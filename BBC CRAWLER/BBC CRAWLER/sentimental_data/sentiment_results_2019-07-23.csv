"Katie Kempen is chief executive of the monitoring body which pushed for the new rules Police in England and Wales must offer female detainees free sanitary products in case they are on their period while in custody, under new legislation. The amended codes of practice come after a watchdog suggested last year that police were ""routinely ignoring"" the needs of menstruating suspects. Other changes include improved privacy in the toilet area of cells monitored by CCTV. Campaigners said the changes would help to protect human rights. Thetwo amended codes of practice,externalwill come into force on 21 August. In one of the last acts of Theresa May's premiership, Policing minister Nick Hurd laid a statutory instrument in the Commons on Tuesday. The tactic allows legislation to be fast-tracked through both houses of Parliament - to revise thePolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,external(PACE). ""Police have made great progress in this area and today's changes will make sure high standards are met across the country,"" Mr Hurd said. The Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA) - the monitoring body thatpublished the evidence in 2018- welcomed the changes. Katie Kempen, the ICVA's chief executive, said: ""No detainee should be left to bleed for want of a difficult conversation or a cheap tampon. These changes should ensure that never happens."" Revisions to the codes include: Custody officers must ask all detainees if they wish to speak in private with a member of custody staff about any matter concerning their personal health, hygiene and welfare needs The detainee can request to speak to a member of staff of the same sex Detainees can keep menstrual and other health, hygiene and welfare products on their person. A decision to withhold such products must be subject to a risk assessment A general mandate to ""take account of the detainee's dignity"" The College of Policing's manager for criminal justice said her team had worked with the ICVA and the National Police Chief's Council to help make sure forces across England and Wales ""are working to a consistent set of standards"" in regard to the issue.

"The Diamond Casino and Resort - where real cash can be spent on virtual vice Grand Theft Auto V has opened an in-game casino where real money can be spent on gambling chips - but they cannot be converted back into cash. The new feature was launched as regulators grapple with whether in-game wagers should be treated as gambling. In GTA Online, players can buy in-game ""dollars"" with real currency, and then convert their virtual dollars to gambling chips. The game is rated for ages 18 and over, but remains popular among young teens. The in-game currency can be used to acquire cars, weapons, and cosmetic items - and used to play slot machines, roulette, or poker. Some players reported that while they could walk around the casino area, the gambling tables were blocked in their country where gambling is illegal. Gamers had mixed reactions to the discovery that gambling chips can be purchased with real cash. Popular British streamer Broughy1322, who was showcasing the new content on Twitch said: ""They've done it, I can't believe they've done it,"" after finding that in-game dollars can be exchanged directly for chips. ""They've gone over the line of what they would, and it's a big problem that they allow you to buy chips with real money, frankly,"" he added later as viewers debated the system. Ahead of the launch, it was not clear if such an exchange would be possible. Gaming news site Kotaku speculated that chips would only be earned by playing the game - similar to the way it works in Rockstar's other recent online game, Red Dead, and in many other games. ""This way, players can't spend real money or win fake money that is worth real cash in the casino,"" it wrote. Fifa packs and loot boxes 'not gambling' in UK Lindsay Lohan loses video game lawsuit Frank Ocean has a new radio station in GTA Chips can be spent on blackjack, poker, slot machines, video horse racing, roulette, or spent on furnishing a casino penthouse with a wide array of customisable items. Put it all on black: players can gamble their in-game dollars at the tables Others gamers were excited by the update, which has been hinted at for about six years - and also contains an array of missions, story scenes, and new vehicles centred around the casino resort. The online mode was launched as an add-on to the popular game in 2013, and has always allowed players to top-up their in-game wallets with real money. The conversion rate in 2019 is roughly GTA$500,000 for Â£5.99 - with discounts for higher amounts purchased. There is also a limit on how many chips can be bought every hour in the new casino. But the fact that in-game gambling winnings cannot easily be converted back into real-world cash may be a key distinction for regulators. The UK gambling watchdog told MPs on Monday that it does not oversee the purchase of in-game content - like video game loot boxes - because there is no official way to monetise the winnings. A prize has to be either money or have monetary value in order for it to fall under gambling legislation, it told a parliamentary committee. However, a grey area exists in some games  where a third-party ""black market"" operates, allowing players to gamble or sell the in-game items they win. Some examples include players earned through ""card packs"" in Fifa 19, or rare skins earned in shooter Counter-Strike. GTA items, meanwhile, are tied to a player's account, making it more difficult to sell than in some other games. ""Unlicensed and unauthorised secondary in-game item trading markets that abuse the terms and conditions of games are a scourge on the industry,"" commented Jo Twist, chief executive of the video games trade body Ukie. ""Companies take proactive measures to close them down, regularly working hand in hand with law enforcement agencies and regulators to safeguard players."" Rockstar has been contacted for comment.

"Boris Johnson's political inheritance has all the makings of a disaster. He has no Commons majority. There is no mandate from the general public - remember this election has only been decided by Tory members. There are policy problems everywhere in sight - whether that's trying to solve the conundrums of Brexit with a reluctant EU and a divided party or trying to address some of the deep-seated problems at home. And just as among his fans there is genuine excitement that he will, at last, be in Number 10, there is scepticism and disbelief from the opposition parties, and double-sided concerns in his own party. Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM There is anxiety on one wing of the Tory party that he will pursue a rapid Brexit and cravenly, hang the consequences of what might be at risk. But in darker moments on the right of the Tory Party, there are suspicions that underneath the Brexit bluff there's a metropolitan wet, who could betray them. Their man for now, but a prime minister who needs to be strapped into place. For those who know him best though, the point about Boris Johnson is that he, frustratingly even to them, can be, maybe even wants to be more than one thing at the same time. They hope he could be a canvas on which others project their hopes and aspirations. A leader who can use his panache to manage all of those competing interests. A leader who will not be bowed by upsetting one side or another. An incoming prime minister who, in dramatic contrast to Theresa May, can communicate his will to the public and his party, his conviction to get this done. His plans for the Cabinet, to appoint a record number of women, a record number of ethnic minority MPs, and to promote the next generation, a contrast to the image held by some Conservatives who see him as the one to recreate perceived glories of the past. And his fans are often willing to accept whatever he actually says or does because the mistakes, or promises come from his lips. For them perhaps, the belief is in him, beyond actions he takes. Belief is a powerful commodity but it doesn't preserve a government on its own. For many of Mr Johnson's critics the jokes are old already. For those worried about Brexit, a rousing speech just doesn't solve it. To govern is not to make people feel good, it is to choose. And as soon as the decisions actually get made, Mr Johnson might find that like Theresa May he finds himself in stalemate. So sprinkle salt on vows made now about going to the country to ask all of us for his own mandate. Willing success is not the same as delivering it. Ultimately, Boris Johnson will have more than his party to convince.  Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Boris Johnson: What's his track record?

"This video can not be played ""One of our biggest risks to the outlook comes from an escalation of tensions in trade"" The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its growth forecasts for the global economy for this year and next. It predicts growth of 3.2% in 2019, down from its April forecast of 3.3%. Growth next year is set to pick up to 3.5% next year, although that is below its earlier forecast of 3.6%. Growth ""remains subdued"", the IMF says,external, and there is an urgent need to reduce trade and technology tensions. The Fund has raised its growth forecast for the UK this year to 1.3% from 1.2%. The revision for the UK reflects what the report calls a stronger-than-expected first three months of the year, boosted by pre-Brexit stockpiling. Next year, the report predicts 1.4% growth. The UK forecasts are based on an assumption of an orderly Brexit followed by a gradual transition to the new regime. As the report notes, what this will be remains highly uncertain. The IMF named a no-deal Brexit as one of the key risks to global economic growth. ""The principal risk factor to the global economy is that adverse developments - including further US-China tariffs, US auto tariffs, or a no-deal Brexit - sap confidence, weaken investment, dislocate global supply chains, and severely slow global growth below the baseline,"" the Fund said. In an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said: ""Global growth is sluggish and precarious. But it doesn't have to be this way because some of this is self-inflicted"". The report is, by implication, strongly critical of US President Donald Trump's approach to trade policy. It says countries should not use tariffs - taxes on traded goods - to target bilateral trade balances, or as a substitute for dialogue to pressure others for reform. Faisal Islam: What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana? Karishma Vaswani: Trade war infects Asia as exports plunge Both these strategies are being employed by the Trump administration in its more assertive approach to trade policy. It has sought to pressure other countries to takes steps to reduce the deficit the US has with them; to export less to the US or import more. The official objective of the tariff increases directed against Chinese goods was reform. The Trump administration wanted China to take action to stop what the US sees as unfair subsidies and the unfair acquisition of American companies' technology. The IMF also calls for the uncertainty surrounding trade agreements to be resolved quickly, including Brexit and the free-trade area encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico. The report describes inflation as muted. That, together with the subdued growth means that the low interest rate policies pursued in many countries are appropriate. Japan and the eurozone both have one of their central bank interest rates below zero.  In the financial markets, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve are thought to be likely to cut rates in the coming months - next week in the case of the US. The IMF predicts that the US economy will see a significant slowdown as the stimulus from tax cuts fades. After 2.9% growth last year, it predicts 1.9% in 2020. The largest forecast downgrades were in some of the major emerging economies, including Brazil where there is uncertainty about pension and other reforms, and South Africa, which is affected by strikes, energy supply problems and weak agricultural production. There was also a smaller forecast downgrade for both years for China which partly reflects the trade tension with the US. The somewhat quicker global growth predicted for next year is based mainly on an expected improvement in four severely stressed emerging economies - Turkey, Argentina, Iran and Venezuela.  That, Ms Gopinath says, is subject to high uncertainty. Could Iran tensions push up petrol prices? What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana?

"South Korea said a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane twice violated its airspace (file photo) Russia has strongly denied ever apologising for violating South Korean airspace, as the fall-out from an incident involving warplanes from four countries continues. South Korea's presidential office earlier said a Russian official had expressed ""deep regret"" for Tuesday's aerial intrusion. It says a Russian aircraft twice violated its territorial airspace during a joint exercise with China. But Moscow denies any intrusion. ""We have seen statements in the South Korean media quoting words allegedly said by our acting military attachÃ©,"" a spokesman for Russia's embassy in South Korea said, according to Interfax news agency. ""We have paid attention to these statements. In this connection we can speak for ourselves that there is a lot in them which does not correspond to reality."" South Korean jets fired nearly 400 warning shots and 20 flares on Tuesday near the Russian surveillance plane that both it and Japan said flew near disputed islands in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, that the two countries claim. What are the Dokdo/Takeshima islands? How an Asian trade row could hit electronics supplies S Korea expands air defence zone On Wednesday, South Korea's government said that a Russian official had admitted the violation on Tuesday, saying it was unintended and that Moscow would immediately launch an investigation into the case, which the official blamed on a ""technical glitch"". ""Moscow said if the aircraft flew according to an initially planned route, this incident would not have occurred,"" a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, Yoon Do-han, told reporters. Meanwhile, China has defended the exercise, which was the first ever joint air patrol between it and Russia. Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian told reporters they ""strictly abided by the relevant regulations of international law and did not enter the airspace of other countries"". Japan also scrambled bombers during Tuesday's incident. The alleged incursion happened over the disputed Dokdo/Takeshima islands, which are occupied by South Korea but also claimed by Japan. South Korea's military said that in total three Russian and two Chinese military aircraft entered the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ) on Tuesday morning. One of those planes - an A-50 Russian surveillance plane - also violated its territorial airspace twice, it said, before leaving. South Korea said its jets fired flares and machine-gun warning shots when the Russian plane intruded. It also deployed F-15 and F-16 planes to intercept it. Russian and Chinese bombers and reconnaissance planes have occasionally entered the zone in recent years, but this is the first incident of its kind between Russia and South Korea. South Korean F-15 jets were sent to intercept the Russian plane Russia's defence ministry denied any airspace violation and said it did not recognise the KADIZ. Russia also accused the South Korean pilots of ""hooliganism in the air"", saying that the patrol had been more than 25km from the Dokdo/Takeshima islands. Lt Gen Kobylash said Russia had complained to South Korea about its crews' ""illegal and dangerous actions"". The government in Tokyo lodged a complaint against both Russia and South Korea. Because it claims sovereignty over the islands, Japan's government said that Russia had violated its airspace. It also said that South Korea's response had been extremely regrettable. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""In light of Japan's stance regarding sovereignty over Takeshima, the South Korean military aircraft's having carried out warning shots is totally unacceptable and extremely regrettable."" This first ""joint air patrol"" involving Russian and Chinese long-range aircraft in the Asia Pacific region, sends a powerful signal of the developing military relationship between Moscow and Beijing. This still falls short of a formal alliance but their joint exercises are larger and more sophisticated. In turn this is a reflection of the ever closer economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries who, though they still have points of tension, are drawing ever closer together. They broadly share a similar world view, hostile to Western liberal democracy, eager to promote an alternative model, protective of their own national sovereignty, and often willing to ride rough-shod over that of others. This poses a huge challenge for US strategy. The nightmare in Washington is an ever closer relationship between an assertive, but declining Russia, and a rising China, which looks set to overtake the US as a technological and economic power in the years ahead. An air defence identification zone (ADIZ) is an airspace which a country seeks to monitor on grounds of national security. Overseas aircraft should identify themselves before entering an air defence zone. An ADIZ usually extends well beyond national airspace to allow for sufficient warning of a potential threat. But ADIZs are not governed by international law and the self-defined boundaries can be disputed or overlap with other countries' claims, which may lead to violations. This is the case in the East China Sea region, where South Korea, China and Japan all have overlapping ADIZs. In this case, South Korea says Russia went beyond its ADIZ and into the territorial airspace surrounding the islands. But other nations do not recognise South Korea's claim of sovereignty.

"Gatis Lagzdins wore a T-shirt saying ""Veganism = Malnutrition"" when protesting outside a vegan food market Two men who ate dead squirrels outside a vegan food stall in protest against veganism have been convicted of public order offences and fined. Deonisy Khlebnikov, 22, and Gatis Lagzdins, 29, bit into the furry animals at the Soho Vegan Food Market in Rupert Street, London, on 30 March. The pair denied using disorderly behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress at a trial at City of London Magistrates' Court in June. They were found guilty on Monday. Natalie Clines, from the CPS, said: ""Deonisy Khlebnikov and Gatis Lagzdins claimed they were against veganism and were raising awareness about the dangers of not eating meat when they publicly consumed raw squirrels. Why do people mock vegans? Is social media behind the rise of veganism? Vegan diet 'could have severe effects' ""By choosing to do this outside a vegan food stall and continuing with their disgusting and unnecessary behaviour despite requests to stop, including from a parent whose child was upset by their actions, the prosecution was able to demonstrate that they had planned and intended to cause distress to the public. ""Their pre-meditated actions caused significant distress to members of the public, including young children."" Khlebnikov, of Westminster, was also fined Â£200. Lagzdins, of Ealing, an anti-vegan protester who has posted videos of similar stunts on YouTube, was fined Â£400. He did not attend the hearing, at Westminster Magistrates' Court A statement from Soho Vegan Market said: ""Soho Vegan Market was created so that people, both vegan and otherwise, could try delicious and different plant-based food in a brilliant and easily accessible location in the heart of London. ""We do not condone the actions of known anti-vegan YouTuber Sv3rige, we're disappointed that it disrupted the vibrant and diverse weekly event and are glad to see those involved have been charged for their actions.""

"With a heatwave predicted to bring temperatures above 41C to parts of the UK over the next few days, how can the nation keep cool and carry on? Temperatures could be thehighest ever recorded in the UKthis week, beating the current record temperature from 2019, when a high of 38.7C was recorded in Cambridge. The Met Office has issued ared extreme heat warning,externalfor many parts of England, from London and the south-east up to York and Manchester. Amber warnings are also currently in place across the rest of England, all of Wales, and parts of Scotland. For those hoping to be given a day off, unfortunately, there are currentlyno laws in the UK,externalabout when it is too hot to work. Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. It can, however, be too cold to work. Government guidance recommends a minimum working temperature of 16C (61F), or 13C, if employees are doing physical work. As avoiding work in the heat isn't an option, then there's the inevitable dilemma of what to wear. But can you wear flip-flops to work?Staff should have a relaxed dress code during the heatwave, union says. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

If you can't see the calculator,tap here,external That's the million dollar question. On sticky nights, drifting off can seem impossible. How to sleep in hot weather What you should - and shouldn't do - to stay cool Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Send your photos/videos of the hot weather toyourpics@bbc.co.uk A big part of the problem is humidity, which makes it hard for sweat to evaporate. To try and keep your bedroom as cool as possible, shut your blinds or curtains during the day - although doing so with metallic blinds and dark curtains could make the room hotter. You could also open windows on the shady side of your home and close them on the sunny side - and then open all the windows before going to bed to get a thorough breeze. That's not an option open to everyone, so an electric fan can be a handy substitute. A fan will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating. Other recommendations include: Putting reflective material or shades outside bedroom windows Having a lukewarm shower before bed Using thin cotton sheets Wearing lightweight materials for bed as they can keep you cooler - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners Putting your sheets in the freezer for a spell before you go to bed When it comes to children, the NHS says a cool bath before bedtime can help. Pyjamas and bedclothes should be kept to a minimum, and if a baby kicks off its bedcovers during the night then they could sleep in just a nappy - babies sleep most comfortably when their room is between 16C (61F) and 20C (68F). As if you don't have enough to think about with a baby, a heatwave brings an added risk of dehydration, sunburn and sunstroke. The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight, and older infants should be kept out of the sun as much as possible, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Sun cream with a high sun protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids and the NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual, but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. As tempting as it might be to strip off, you may be at greater risk of sunburn which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. It's best to choose light colours over dark - which absorb heat more - and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will also help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. This is fast becoming the first question asked when extreme weather events strike - and the answer remains the same. It is almost impossible to say that a specific event, like the current hot spell, is caused by global heating. However there are some very strong connections to human-induced warming that increase the likelihood of such weather. Last year's blazing summer in the UKwas said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likelybecause of emissions from human activity. And the Met Office also said warm spells in the UK have more than doubled in length - increasing from 5.3 days in the 1961-1990 period to more than 13 days in the decade from 2008 to 2017. The heatwave also follows on from a previousrecord-breaking June across Europe, which was 1C above the long term trend and an incredible 3C above the average from 1850-1900. When researchers carried out a rapid analysis to see the impact of climate change on the June heatwave,they concluded it was made at least five times more likelyby warming. It may well be that the current period of extremely hot weather is purely down to natural variability, said BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath. But even if so, the fingerprints of fossil fuel burning are heavily influencing the background - and making such events much more likely. Strawberries are among the foods recommended during a heatwave Hydration is key. Our bodies sweat more in hot weather, so it is really important to restock lost water levels. Don't rely on your physical thirst to judge how dehydrated you are as it's not a very good indicator(urine colour,externalis better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. And try not to consume too much alcohol. The NHS says good drink options include water, lower-fat milks and tea and coffee. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down.,external More tips on what to eat in a heatwave from BBC Good Food,external Dogs in particular struggle in the hot weather because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do, and those breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating. The RSPCA has a series of tips,externalfor keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. These include avoiding leaving animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, which, even just for a short while, can be fatal due to rising temperatures. It also says it is best to walk a dog early in the morning or late in the evening when it is cooler, as paws can burn on a hot pavement. Exercise can also increase the risk of heatstroke. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer For those pets kept in cages, hutches, fish tanks or other enclosures, they should be kept out of direct sunlight. And it's not just humans who need sun cream, it might also be beneficial to apply some to your pet. Animals' exposed spots, such as ears and noses, are vulnerable to sunburn and - just like people - sun damage can lead to skin cancer. The Blue Cross saywhite cats are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer,externalfrom sunlight exposure than others. This video can not be played Dog owners have been urged to check pavements using the ""seven-second test"" This video can not be played Humidity explainer Most people in the UK aren't used to such extreme temperatures, which can cause heat exhaustion and, more seriously, heatstroke. Signs of heat exhaustion can include tiredness or weakness, feeling faint or dizzy, having muscle cramps or feeling sick. If left untreated, the more serious symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation and even a loss of consciousness. Those suffering the signs of heat exhaustion should go to a cool place with air conditioning or shade, use a cool, wet sponge or flannel and drink fluids - ideally water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. NHS guidance on dealing with heatstroke,external If you choose to exercise, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. Aim to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. The risk of sunburn depends on how sensitive your skin is, and how strong the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays are. The UV index will vary, depending on where you are in the world, the time of year, what the weather is like, the time of day, and how high up you are compared to sea level. During the UK's summer months, the sun's UV rays are strongest between 11:00 and 15:00. Cancer Research UK suggests,externalusing a simple ""shadow rule"" to estimate the strength of the sun. It suggests that if your shadow is shorter than your height, the sun's UV rays are strong - and you are therefore more likely to burn. How much sun cream to use and what to do if you burn There are lots of ""extended wear"" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use ""once a day"", or claiming to last for eight hours. But dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a ""satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing"" and that it should be reapplied at least every two hours, no matter what SPF it is. There are lots of places that rate sunscreen brands, including consumer websiteWhich?,external. However,the British Association of Dermatologists,external(BAD) says in general you should look for two ratings on bottles of sun creams. The sun emits two types of ultraviolet rays - UVA (most commonly responsible for premature ageing and wrinkles) and UVB (which causes most sunburn). The BAD says you need to be protected from both. The sun protection factor (SPF) offers guidance on a cream's protection against UVB rays, while a star system indicates the level of protection against UVA rays.

"Benjamin Field and Martyn Smith are accused of murdering Peter Farquhar (pictured left) and conspiring to murder Ann Moore-Martin (right) A jury deliberating verdicts in a murder trial have been sent home due to ""extreme heat"" as UK temperatures soar. The panel is considering if Benjamin Field, 28, and Martyn Smith, 32, are guilty or not of murdering Peter Farquhar, 69, and conspiring to murder Ann Moore-Martin, 83, in Maids Moreton. The jurors told the judge they were struggling to concentrate at Oxford Crown Court despite using a fan. Mr Justice Sweeney said it was ""not appropriate"" for them to continue. A heatwave is predicted to bring temperatures above 35Cto part of the UK over the next few days. Other cases at the crown court have been called off this week because of an issue with the air conditioning system. Mr Justice Sweeney said: ""It is clearly not appropriate for you to continue to deliberate in the conditions you describe and therefore I am inviting you to stop deliberating for the day."" He said the jury would resume their deliberations on Wednesday morning. University lecturer and author Peter Farquhar, left, was betrothed to Benjamin Field, right, who is accused of his murder The jury have been considering verdicts in the trial of Mr Field and Mr Smith for five days. Church warden Mr Field and magician Mr Smith are accused of murdering Mr Farquhar, a university lecturer and author, and of conspiring to murder Miss Moore-Martin, a retired headmistress, to gain financially from their wills. Mr Field has admitted fraudulently being in relationships with Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin as part of a plot to get them to change their wills. Mr Farquhar died in October 2015 and Miss Moore-Martin died of natural causes in May 2017. The pair lived three doors away from each other in the Buckinghamshire village of Maids Moreton. Prosecutors allege Mr Field and Mr Smith targeted Miss Moore-Martin after murdering Mr Farquhar. Mr Field has admitted defrauding Miss Moore-Martin of Â£4,000 to buy a car but denies recruiting his younger brother Tom, 24, to con her out of Â£27,000 by claiming it was for a dialysis machine. Peter Farquhar lived at the house circled on the left, and Ann Moore-Martin on the right Mr Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, and possessing an article for use in fraud. He has admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. His brother Tom Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denies a single charge of fraud. Mr Smith, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, two charges of fraud, one of burglary and possession of an article for the use in fraud.

"Rape and sexual assault complainants say police have stopped investigating their cases after they refused to reveal up to seven years of phone data. Their accounts were compiled by privacy campaign Big Brother Watch, which is calling for more restricted searches of devices by forces in England and Wales. One said the demand made her ""feel like I'm being violated once again"". Police say searches are needed in some cases as trials collapsed when evidence was not disclosed to defence lawyers. Consent forms asking victims of crime for permission to access information including emails, messages and photographs have been rolled out by police since April. The Big Brother Watch report, Digital Strip Searches, calls for forces to revise the policy of ""mass data downloads"", arguing it is ""unlawful"" and a ""gross invasion of privacy"" to ask victims to hand in their phones. It says the move most commonly affects victims of sexual offences. The campaign is being backed by nine other civil liberties and victims' groups, including Amnesty International and Liberty, as well as a petition with more than 35,000 signatures. The Information Commissioner's Office, the data protection watchdog, also said it had ""serious concerns about the extraction of mobile phone data by the police and how that impacts people's privacy rights"". When could police ask for your phone? Why are rape prosecutions falling? Hundreds of court cases axed over failings Different rules on phone searches apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Police Scotland says it assesses whether it is ""necessary and proportionate"" in each case to seek access to someone's phone. PSNI says officers seize phones only when it is necessary and inaccordance with legislation.,external The Big Brother Watch report collects testimony from several women whose cases were dropped after they refused consent for a blanket phone search, including one who reported a ""sustained and sadistic attack"" by an acquaintance. She said: ""Imagine your most private thoughts and feelings from counselling held in your phone being seen by anyone, let alone your rapist."" Another said police demanded seven years of phone data after she reported being drugged and raped by a group of strangers. ""My phone documents many of the most personal moments in my life and the thought of strangers combing through it, to try to use it against me, makes me feel like I'm being violated once again,"" she said. A woman who reported historic abuse that took place before the mobile phone era had her case dropped when she refused consent to search her current phone, the report says. In another case, the Crown Prosecution Service demanded to search the phone of a 12-year-old rape victim - even though the perpetrator had admitted the crime. The case was delayed for months as a result. Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for criminal justice, said smartphones and other devices were only examined when there was a ""reasonable line of inquiry"" and theCriminal Procedure and Investigations Act,externalobliged them to disclose their findings to the defence. Examination of digital devices is ""most common in cases where victims and suspects know each other"", he said. He added police had introduced a new consent form to ensure permission was sought from alleged victims ""properly and consistently"". ""We recognise the concerns of some privacy and victims' groups and have been seeking advice from a wide range of groups to help us improve the process. We are strengthening training and investing in new technology, which will help to address concerns."" The new consent form for searching victims' phones was introduced after a series of rape and sexual assault cases collapsed when crucial evidence emerged at the last minute. This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape Liam Allan, a 22-year-old student at the time, was one of the defendants affected, whenmessages exonerating him were discovered two years into his case. The messages were among 57,000 downloaded from his accuser's phone, but the officer in charge suggested he had not searched them properly because he had too many phone downloads to analyse. Big Brother Watch said the consent form used by police to search complainant's phones demands ""excessive personal information regardless of its relevance"" under threat of dropping the case. It also warns people reporting rape and sexual assault they may be prosecuted themselves if evidence of other suspected criminal offences is found on their phone. Because the consent is not freely given, specific and informed, the searches may be ""unlawful"", the campaign group says. ""No victim should have to make a choice between their privacy and justice,"" said Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch. A screenshot of part of a consent form for 'digital device extraction', provided by the National Police Chiefs Council The report said the volume of phone data collected by police was causing delays of up to 18 months to investigations. Complainants are also told they may lose access to their smartphones for long periods, with police reporting wait times for devices to be examined of up to nine months in complex cases. The Information Commissioner's Office said police have also wrongly disclosed alleged victims' information.

We are strengthening training and investing in new technology, which will help to address concerns."" The new consent form for searching victims' phones was introduced after a series of rape and sexual assault cases collapsed when crucial evidence emerged at the last minute. This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape Liam Allan, a 22-year-old student at the time, was one of the defendants affected, whenmessages exonerating him were discovered two years into his case. The messages were among 57,000 downloaded from his accuser's phone, but the officer in charge suggested he had not searched them properly because he had too many phone downloads to analyse. Big Brother Watch said the consent form used by police to search complainant's phones demands ""excessive personal information regardless of its relevance"" under threat of dropping the case. It also warns people reporting rape and sexual assault they may be prosecuted themselves if evidence of other suspected criminal offences is found on their phone. Because the consent is not freely given, specific and informed, the searches may be ""unlawful"", the campaign group says. ""No victim should have to make a choice between their privacy and justice,"" said Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch.

"With a heatwave predicted to bring temperatures above 41C to parts of the UK over the next few days, how can the nation keep cool and carry on? Temperatures could be thehighest ever recorded in the UKthis week, beating the current record temperature from 2019, when a high of 38.7C was recorded in Cambridge. The Met Office has issued ared extreme heat warning,externalfor many parts of England, from London and the south-east up to York and Manchester. Amber warnings are also currently in place across the rest of England, all of Wales, and parts of Scotland. For those hoping to be given a day off, unfortunately, there are currentlyno laws in the UK,externalabout when it is too hot to work. Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. It can, however, be too cold to work. Government guidance recommends a minimum working temperature of 16C (61F), or 13C, if employees are doing physical work. As avoiding work in the heat isn't an option, then there's the inevitable dilemma of what to wear. But can you wear flip-flops to work?Staff should have a relaxed dress code during the heatwave, union says. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

If you can't see the calculator,tap here,external That's the million dollar question. On sticky nights, drifting off can seem impossible. How to sleep in hot weather What you should - and shouldn't do - to stay cool Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Send your photos/videos of the hot weather toyourpics@bbc.co.uk A big part of the problem is humidity, which makes it hard for sweat to evaporate. To try and keep your bedroom as cool as possible, shut your blinds or curtains during the day - although doing so with metallic blinds and dark curtains could make the room hotter. You could also open windows on the shady side of your home and close them on the sunny side - and then open all the windows before going to bed to get a thorough breeze. That's not an option open to everyone, so an electric fan can be a handy substitute. A fan will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating. Other recommendations include: Putting reflective material or shades outside bedroom windows Having a lukewarm shower before bed Using thin cotton sheets Wearing lightweight materials for bed as they can keep you cooler - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners Putting your sheets in the freezer for a spell before you go to bed When it comes to children, the NHS says a cool bath before bedtime can help. Pyjamas and bedclothes should be kept to a minimum, and if a baby kicks off its bedcovers during the night then they could sleep in just a nappy - babies sleep most comfortably when their room is between 16C (61F) and 20C (68F). As if you don't have enough to think about with a baby, a heatwave brings an added risk of dehydration, sunburn and sunstroke. The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight, and older infants should be kept out of the sun as much as possible, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Sun cream with a high sun protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids and the NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual, but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. As tempting as it might be to strip off, you may be at greater risk of sunburn which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. It's best to choose light colours over dark - which absorb heat more - and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will also help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. This is fast becoming the first question asked when extreme weather events strike - and the answer remains the same. It is almost impossible to say that a specific event, like the current hot spell, is caused by global heating. However there are some very strong connections to human-induced warming that increase the likelihood of such weather. Last year's blazing summer in the UKwas said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likelybecause of emissions from human activity. And the Met Office also said warm spells in the UK have more than doubled in length - increasing from 5.3 days in the 1961-1990 period to more than 13 days in the decade from 2008 to 2017. The heatwave also follows on from a previousrecord-breaking June across Europe, which was 1C above the long term trend and an incredible 3C above the average from 1850-1900. When researchers carried out a rapid analysis to see the impact of climate change on the June heatwave,they concluded it was made at least five times more likelyby warming. It may well be that the current period of extremely hot weather is purely down to natural variability, said BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath. But even if so, the fingerprints of fossil fuel burning are heavily influencing the background - and making such events much more likely. Strawberries are among the foods recommended during a heatwave Hydration is key. Our bodies sweat more in hot weather, so it is really important to restock lost water levels. Don't rely on your physical thirst to judge how dehydrated you are as it's not a very good indicator(urine colour,externalis better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. And try not to consume too much alcohol. The NHS says good drink options include water, lower-fat milks and tea and coffee. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down.,external More tips on what to eat in a heatwave from BBC Good Food,external Dogs in particular struggle in the hot weather because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do, and those breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating. The RSPCA has a series of tips,externalfor keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. These include avoiding leaving animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, which, even just for a short while, can be fatal due to rising temperatures. It also says it is best to walk a dog early in the morning or late in the evening when it is cooler, as paws can burn on a hot pavement. Exercise can also increase the risk of heatstroke. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer For those pets kept in cages, hutches, fish tanks or other enclosures, they should be kept out of direct sunlight. And it's not just humans who need sun cream, it might also be beneficial to apply some to your pet. Animals' exposed spots, such as ears and noses, are vulnerable to sunburn and - just like people - sun damage can lead to skin cancer. The Blue Cross saywhite cats are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer,externalfrom sunlight exposure than others. This video can not be played Dog owners have been urged to check pavements using the ""seven-second test"" This video can not be played Humidity explainer Most people in the UK aren't used to such extreme temperatures, which can cause heat exhaustion and, more seriously, heatstroke. Signs of heat exhaustion can include tiredness or weakness, feeling faint or dizzy, having muscle cramps or feeling sick. If left untreated, the more serious symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation and even a loss of consciousness. Those suffering the signs of heat exhaustion should go to a cool place with air conditioning or shade, use a cool, wet sponge or flannel and drink fluids - ideally water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. NHS guidance on dealing with heatstroke,external If you choose to exercise, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. Aim to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. The risk of sunburn depends on how sensitive your skin is, and how strong the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays are. The UV index will vary, depending on where you are in the world, the time of year, what the weather is like, the time of day, and how high up you are compared to sea level. During the UK's summer months, the sun's UV rays are strongest between 11:00 and 15:00. Cancer Research UK suggests,externalusing a simple ""shadow rule"" to estimate the strength of the sun. It suggests that if your shadow is shorter than your height, the sun's UV rays are strong - and you are therefore more likely to burn. How much sun cream to use and what to do if you burn There are lots of ""extended wear"" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use ""once a day"", or claiming to last for eight hours. But dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a ""satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing"" and that it should be reapplied at least every two hours, no matter what SPF it is. There are lots of places that rate sunscreen brands, including consumer websiteWhich?,external. However,the British Association of Dermatologists,external(BAD) says in general you should look for two ratings on bottles of sun creams. The sun emits two types of ultraviolet rays - UVA (most commonly responsible for premature ageing and wrinkles) and UVB (which causes most sunburn). The BAD says you need to be protected from both. The sun protection factor (SPF) offers guidance on a cream's protection against UVB rays, while a star system indicates the level of protection against UVA rays.

"The Diamond Casino and Resort - where real cash can be spent on virtual vice Grand Theft Auto V has opened an in-game casino where real money can be spent on gambling chips - but they cannot be converted back into cash. The new feature was launched as regulators grapple with whether in-game wagers should be treated as gambling. In GTA Online, players can buy in-game ""dollars"" with real currency, and then convert their virtual dollars to gambling chips. The game is rated for ages 18 and over, but remains popular among young teens. The in-game currency can be used to acquire cars, weapons, and cosmetic items - and used to play slot machines, roulette, or poker. Some players reported that while they could walk around the casino area, the gambling tables were blocked in their country where gambling is illegal. Gamers had mixed reactions to the discovery that gambling chips can be purchased with real cash. Popular British streamer Broughy1322, who was showcasing the new content on Twitch said: ""They've done it, I can't believe they've done it,"" after finding that in-game dollars can be exchanged directly for chips. ""They've gone over the line of what they would, and it's a big problem that they allow you to buy chips with real money, frankly,"" he added later as viewers debated the system. Ahead of the launch, it was not clear if such an exchange would be possible. Gaming news site Kotaku speculated that chips would only be earned by playing the game - similar to the way it works in Rockstar's other recent online game, Red Dead, and in many other games. ""This way, players can't spend real money or win fake money that is worth real cash in the casino,"" it wrote. Fifa packs and loot boxes 'not gambling' in UK Lindsay Lohan loses video game lawsuit Frank Ocean has a new radio station in GTA Chips can be spent on blackjack, poker, slot machines, video horse racing, roulette, or spent on furnishing a casino penthouse with a wide array of customisable items. Put it all on black: players can gamble their in-game dollars at the tables Others gamers were excited by the update, which has been hinted at for about six years - and also contains an array of missions, story scenes, and new vehicles centred around the casino resort. The online mode was launched as an add-on to the popular game in 2013, and has always allowed players to top-up their in-game wallets with real money. The conversion rate in 2019 is roughly GTA$500,000 for Â£5.99 - with discounts for higher amounts purchased. There is also a limit on how many chips can be bought every hour in the new casino. But the fact that in-game gambling winnings cannot easily be converted back into real-world cash may be a key distinction for regulators. The UK gambling watchdog told MPs on Monday that it does not oversee the purchase of in-game content - like video game loot boxes - because there is no official way to monetise the winnings. A prize has to be either money or have monetary value in order for it to fall under gambling legislation, it told a parliamentary committee. However, a grey area exists in some games  where a third-party ""black market"" operates, allowing players to gamble or sell the in-game items they win. Some examples include players earned through ""card packs"" in Fifa 19, or rare skins earned in shooter Counter-Strike. GTA items, meanwhile, are tied to a player's account, making it more difficult to sell than in some other games. ""Unlicensed and unauthorised secondary in-game item trading markets that abuse the terms and conditions of games are a scourge on the industry,"" commented Jo Twist, chief executive of the video games trade body Ukie. ""Companies take proactive measures to close them down, regularly working hand in hand with law enforcement agencies and regulators to safeguard players."" Rockstar has been contacted for comment.

"This video can not be played ""One of our biggest risks to the outlook comes from an escalation of tensions in trade"" The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its growth forecasts for the global economy for this year and next. It predicts growth of 3.2% in 2019, down from its April forecast of 3.3%. Growth next year is set to pick up to 3.5% next year, although that is below its earlier forecast of 3.6%. Growth ""remains subdued"", the IMF says,external, and there is an urgent need to reduce trade and technology tensions. The Fund has raised its growth forecast for the UK this year to 1.3% from 1.2%. The revision for the UK reflects what the report calls a stronger-than-expected first three months of the year, boosted by pre-Brexit stockpiling. Next year, the report predicts 1.4% growth. The UK forecasts are based on an assumption of an orderly Brexit followed by a gradual transition to the new regime. As the report notes, what this will be remains highly uncertain. The IMF named a no-deal Brexit as one of the key risks to global economic growth. ""The principal risk factor to the global economy is that adverse developments - including further US-China tariffs, US auto tariffs, or a no-deal Brexit - sap confidence, weaken investment, dislocate global supply chains, and severely slow global growth below the baseline,"" the Fund said. In an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said: ""Global growth is sluggish and precarious. But it doesn't have to be this way because some of this is self-inflicted"". The report is, by implication, strongly critical of US President Donald Trump's approach to trade policy. It says countries should not use tariffs - taxes on traded goods - to target bilateral trade balances, or as a substitute for dialogue to pressure others for reform. Faisal Islam: What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana? Karishma Vaswani: Trade war infects Asia as exports plunge Both these strategies are being employed by the Trump administration in its more assertive approach to trade policy. It has sought to pressure other countries to takes steps to reduce the deficit the US has with them; to export less to the US or import more. The official objective of the tariff increases directed against Chinese goods was reform. The Trump administration wanted China to take action to stop what the US sees as unfair subsidies and the unfair acquisition of American companies' technology. The IMF also calls for the uncertainty surrounding trade agreements to be resolved quickly, including Brexit and the free-trade area encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico. The report describes inflation as muted. That, together with the subdued growth means that the low interest rate policies pursued in many countries are appropriate. Japan and the eurozone both have one of their central bank interest rates below zero.  In the financial markets, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve are thought to be likely to cut rates in the coming months - next week in the case of the US. The IMF predicts that the US economy will see a significant slowdown as the stimulus from tax cuts fades. After 2.9% growth last year, it predicts 1.9% in 2020. The largest forecast downgrades were in some of the major emerging economies, including Brazil where there is uncertainty about pension and other reforms, and South Africa, which is affected by strikes, energy supply problems and weak agricultural production. There was also a smaller forecast downgrade for both years for China which partly reflects the trade tension with the US. The somewhat quicker global growth predicted for next year is based mainly on an expected improvement in four severely stressed emerging economies - Turkey, Argentina, Iran and Venezuela.  That, Ms Gopinath says, is subject to high uncertainty. Could Iran tensions push up petrol prices? What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana?

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders.

"With the UK about to get a new prime minister, the prospect of an early election is not far-fetched. But should one be held, neither the Conservatives nor Labour could feel confident about winning an overall majority. The face of party politics in the UK has undergone a dramatic change. The deadlock over Brexit has been followed by a dramatic decline in support for both the Conservatives and Labour. As a result, the two parties' traditional dominance of the electoral landscape is facing an unprecedented challenge. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories and Labour punished in European elections for Brexit contortions When, on 15 November last year, Theresa May unveiled the deal she'd negotiated with the European Union, that dominance was still in evidence. Both parties were averaging 39% in the opinion polls. Their combined tally of 78% was only a little down on the 84% share of the vote they had jointly secured in the 2017 election, the highest proportion since 1970. Neither the Liberal Democrats nor the Greens were showing much sign of advancing on the 8% and 2% that they respectively won in 2017. At 5%, UKIP's tally was only up by three points on its poor performance at the same election. Nine months later, the picture could not be more different. True, the Conservatives and Labour are still more or less neck-and-neck - but now they each enjoy the support of just a quarter or so. UKIP's role as the principal voice of Euroscepticism has been wrested from its grasp by a new party, the Brexit Party. Its current average poll rating of 18% is as high as anything UKIP ever achieved. The Liberal Democrats also stand on 18%, their strongest position since they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Their performance seems to have snuffed out an attempt by a group of Labour and Conservative rebels to form a new ""centre"" party, Change UK. The Green Party, too, is enjoying something of a revival; its 6% support puts the party in its strongest position since the 2015 general election. The only party to have experienced little change in its fortunes is the SNP in Scotland. Five Scottish polls since the beginning of April have put the party on an average of 40% of the vote north of the border. That is just a couple of points above where the party stood in the autumn, and three points above its tally in 2017. In contrast, both the Conservatives and Labour have seen their Scottish support slip, leaving the SNP well ahead of all of its rivals. That means that not only are there as many as four parties recording substantial levels of support across Britain as a whole, but also a fifth which has a stranglehold on Westminster voting intentions in Scotland. The first signs of a crack in Conservative-Labour dominance were already in evidence when the UK failed to meet the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Support for the Conservatives fell on average by three points between mid-November and the end of March. It immediately fell by a further six points as soon as the Brexit deadline was not met. Theresa May was unable to take the UK out of the EU by the 29 March deadline Support for Labour also eased by five points during this period. Conversely, support for UKIP and the newly formed Brexit Party was beginning to rise, reaching 11% immediately after the failure to leave the EU in March. These were clear warning signs that a continuation of the Brexit impasse could well do neither the government - nor the opposition - much good. However, the pivotal moment was the European Parliament elections that had to be held in May because the UK was still in the EU. That helped put the issue of Brexit at the forefront of voters' minds. The Brexit Party, which was advocating leaving the EU without a deal, stormed into first place. Former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe was one of 29 Brexit Party MEPs elected in the European elections The Liberal Democrats, in favour of another referendum, came second. And although some of their respective supporters would not have voted the same way in a general election, many would have done so. By polling day, as many as one in five were indicating that they would vote in a general election for the Brexit Party or - in much smaller numbers - for UKIP. At the same time, support for the Liberal Democrats was now also firmly in the mid-teens. Both Labour and, especially, the Conservatives were now struggling to retain as much as a quarter of the vote. The battle for Westminster suddenly looked like a four-party rather than a two-party one. And - so far - that more or less remains the position, even though the European elections, but perhaps not Brexit, are beginning to fade in voters' memories. Support for the Liberal Democrats remains exactly where it was at the end of May, while the Brexit Party's vote has only slipped a little - by four points. Both parties hold an uncompromising position on Brexit, and their support comes almost exclusively from those on one side or other of the Brexit debate. Nearly all of the Brexit Party's support is from those who voted Leave, among whom it is the single most popular party. Support for the Liberal Democrats is predominantly from those who voted Remain, for whose support the party is evidently in close competition with Labour. The Conservatives are more popular among Leave supporters than their Remain counterparts - and the opposite is true for Labour. But both parties still secure a substantial proportion of their support from a minority who hold the opposing view. Now that many voters seem to want to use their ballot paper to express their view about Brexit, it is difficult for the Conservatives and Labour to maintain their cross-Brexit support. The apparent inability of the House of Commons to make any decision about Brexit is a problem for the new prime minister. Some suggest he will eventually find it necessary to hold a general election, to try to change the Parliamentary arithmetic. Boris Johnson says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"" However, at the moment at least, the advent of four-party politics, or - given the position in Scotland - five-party politics, does not make this an attractive prospect. Quite how the current numbers in the polls would translate into seats in Parliament is highly uncertain. Support for both the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party could be scattered so evenly across the country that they would end up winning few seats. But even bearing this possibility in mind, it is still highly unlikely that either the Conservatives or Labour would be able to win an overall majority, or even come close to one. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? A new government could find itself in much the same position as the one in which Theresa May has found herself - reliant on minority parties to remain in office and constantly at risk of Parliamentary defeat, including on Brexit. That said, all eyes will be on what happens to the polls when the new prime minister is installed. No fewer than one in four of those who voted Conservative in 2017 is currently saying they would vote for the Brexit Party. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, at least, is popular with many Brexit Party supporters. Maybe the Tories will soon be enjoying a lead in the polls thanks to a squeeze on the Brexit Party vote. That could make an early election a more attractive prospect to them. But equally, perhaps, the new prime minister will discover that Brexit Party voters are reluctant to return to the Tory fold until Brexit has actually been delivered.

" by John Pienaar by John Pienaar I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course. Promise, I mean. Not break his nose. I had been recruited to take part in a televised bout of “celebrity boxing”, live on BBC Two. In the end, the British Boxing Board of Control had more sense than I and, for a fleeting moment, Johnson had at the time. The boxing authorities judged that a high-profile fight between two barely trained middle-aged amateurs might be “reckless and irresponsible”. The “fight” was cancelled. Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk. He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?” he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint. In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity. Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts byphysically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London. Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his biography of Johnson, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair. At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members chose a leader who defies almost every norm. Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another. Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which helped carry him into Downing Street. Boris Johnson’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002.

Boris Johnson ’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? The first thing to note is that he is not actually Boris at all, despite the rare distinction in politics of being known universally by that single name. He was born Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson on 19 June 1964. He chose to be called Boris and his family, friends and eventually everyone else have amiably obliged him. For one so stereotypically English, his ancestry is surprisingly varied - a mixture of English Christians, Turkish Muslims and Eastern European Jews. His maternal great-grandfather was an Orthodox Lithuanian rabbi. His paternal great-grandfather was a Turkish political activist, Ali Kemal, who was apparently lynched after falling foul of the nationalists then in power. Boris, Sonia Purnell records in her biography, was the name of a Russian emigre friend of the family. Johnson was born in New York City, and spent his earliest days with father Stanley and mother Charlotte in a home opposite the famous Chelsea Hotel, hangout of many famous rock stars of the time. His father began a master’s degree in agricultural economics, and after what he has reportedly hinted to be an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as a spy (undergoing “the most intensive training in clandestine techniques known to man”) he worked briefly for the World Bank in Washington DC, before he was sacked. Apparently, being perhaps something of a block off the old chip, he submitted a suggestion for a $100m loan to build three pyramids and a sphinx to help the Egyptian tourist effort. It was an April Fool joke. His employers were not amused.  Leader profiles: Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage  Back in the UK, Stanley and Charlotte raised a family: a daughter, Rachel, who recently joined the Liberal Democrats before defecting to the then Independent Group as a candidate for the European Parliament (more successful as a journalist than as a politician); Leo who did well in finance, and Jo, who worked in Downing Street as a policy thinker under David Cameron, and became a respected minister under Cameron and Theresa May. The siblings were ferociously competitive. Stanley’s ambition was to raise a journalistic and political dynasty, and he did. Young Boris was at Eton, and the family living in Brussels, when his parents split. He doesn’t like to speak of that time, or its effect on him, but it was painful. Charlotte - a celebrated artist - subsequently suffered a serious mental breakdown and spent nine months as a patient in a psychiatric hospital. So Boris Johnson’s early life cannot be described as easy, or pain-free. His now famous amiable, bumbling persona - a close copy of his father’s - has sometimes been described as a defence mechanism, concealing a sharp brain and a fine but well-disguised instinct for personal advantage. At any rate, after a spell at Ashdown House boarding school, Johnson went to Eton with an academically prestigious King’s Scholarship. He became a contemporary of, among others, David Cameron - and a close friend to then Viscount Althorp (now Earl Spencer), brother to Princess Diana, and Darius Guppy who was later to be jailed for five years for fraud. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton At Eton, AB Johnson became  “Boris” - rather posh, very English, somewhat eccentric and the deeply distinctive, deliberately dishevelled character we know now. He was also very clever - “brilliant” according to one teacher - and endowed with what has arguably become a strong sense of entitlement to both make up and play by his own rules. He was a formidable debater, and became adept at deflecting awkward questions with non-committal answers (as any journalist who has interviewed him can testify). The report from his housemaster makes interesting reading now. He wrote of Boris to his father: “I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception - one who should be free of the network of obligations which binds everyone else. Boris is pretty impressive when success can be achieved by pure intelligence, unaccompanied by hard work.” His character - clever, capable of achieving impressive results though always very much on his own terms - was forming. Future opponent Ken Livingstone wrote an attack on public schools while Johnson was a pupil. He wrote a reply in the school newspaper, recounted in Purnell’s biography, dismissing his future adversary’s arguments as “twaddle, utter bunkum, balderdash, tommyrot, piffle and fiddlesticks”. His distinctive vocabulary seemed to be forming too. Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri He earned a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, with a roll-call of political and journalistic luminaries as contemporaries. Those at Oxford University at the time included David Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. Labour’s Miliband brothers, David and Ed, as well as Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were there too. “What a sharp-elbowed thrusting and basically repellent lot we were,” was his own verdict, said, presumably, with amused irony. “Always bragging and shafting each other. And in a way we still are.” Johnson, like David Cameron and George Osborne,,famously joined the infamous Bullingdon Club of rich, rowdy and elitist undergraduates. 1985: At Viscount Althorp's 21st birthday party with his future wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen (left), and his sister Rachel 1985: At Viscount Althorp's 21st birthday party with his future wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen (left), and his sister Rachel Cameron has since played down this aspect of his Oxford career, with its trashing of dining rooms and debauchery. Boris Johnson, it is suggested, has never been much attached to hell-raising, though the Etonian network was undeniably useful in pursuit of his great ambition of becoming president of the Oxford Union - historically, at least, a stepping stone to the office of prime minister. Johnson met his first wife, Allegra Mostyn-Owen, at Oxford - another ambition. But he never attained the goal of a first-class degree in Classics, something friends say still rankles to this day.  He did, though, make connections which became more than useful in what was to be a journalistic and political career of dizzying ups and crashing, if temporary, setbacks. It has always proved hard to keep Boris Johnson down. In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson.

In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson. From the earliest days of his career, he nonetheless seemed determined to try. Boris Johnson the prime minister would, one imagines, hate being subject to the kind of reporting and analysis that Boris Johnson the fledgling journalist made his own particular trademark. As a trainee fresh out of Balliol College, he joined the Times newspaper under the editorship of the near legendary Charlie Wilson - a tough, Glaswegian out of the old school of Fleet Street broadsheet journalism. Johnson was found to have tried too hard to pep up a fairly innocuous story about the discovery of a palace of Edward II on the south bank of the Thames. His historical account was nonsensical, and an accompanying quote entirely made up. He wrote how the king would frolic at the palace with his sidekick Piers Gaveston. Only Gaveston had been executed years before the palace was built, and the made-up quote was attributed to an Oxford academic who was also his godfather, but nonetheless, not surprisingly, complained. Johnson was sacked. It might have been the end of his journalistic - and conceivably any other - career in any profession requiring trust. But it wasn’t. Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings, who had met Johnson while he was hosting the great and the good at the Oxford Union, gave him a chance to redeem himself and he grabbed it with both hands. Soon, as the paper’s Europe correspondent in Brussels, Johnson made his name as a pioneer on what in 1989 became a new frontier of deeply Eurosceptic reporting. Much of the reporting at the time was done by correspondents who were arguably much more sympathetic to the culture of what was then called the European Economic Community. Johnson’s stories consistently made the front page, pleased readers who held the EEC’s “federalism” and interfering ways  in contempt - some of them, like Iain Duncan Smith, now prominent political supporters of the new regime set for Downing Street - and made his work popular to the point of becoming cult reading. His journalism artfully mixed fact with wild Eurosceptic fiction. There were tales about unlawfully curved bananas, wrongly sized condoms, and one about the European Commission headquarters Berlaymont building being about to be blown up with dynamite because it was found to contain asbestos. Often, the reports made you laugh out loud, which only added to their force. I remember running into him in Strasbourg, during a session of the European Parliament while I was a political reporter with the Independent. He was smirking at a name he’d invented for the leader of the Conservatives in the parliament, Sir Christopher Prout -  “Brussels-Prout”. He has a useful gift of somehow making you laugh even when his jokes are not especially good. But my former Independent colleagues, like other journos covering Europe, were not always so easily amused by their rival from the Telegraph. “He was fundamentally intellectually dishonest, in my view,” David Usborne told Andrew Gimson in an interview for his book. “He was serving his masters in a very skilful way but I never felt he believed... He was a highly intelligent man, much cleverer than I was, he could see all these nuances and subtleties, but he wasn’t conveying them in his writing. It was a cheap thrill - a stunt, and quite a dangerous stunt really.”  As you’d expect, Max Hastings, his then editor, took a slightly indulgent view of his talented protege. He is perhaps rather less tolerant in retrospect. “I don’t think we ever caught him out in anything he deserved to be sacked for, or to be brought home from Brussels,” he told me in an interview for the BBC’s Panorama. “Boris’s relationship with integrity and truth, and with the right moral standards has always been a bit uncertain to put it politely.” As we’ll see, not everyone has been inclined to “put it politely” when it comes to Johnson’s character and record. Max Hastings’ assessment of his former employee is striking. “All human relations are about who makes you feel good… more than any other politician in British life today he’s a genius. He is absolutely terrific at telling people what they want to hear and he does it with wit, with elegance, with style. “He’s got that quality that causes his believers to be prepared to overlook all the things people traditionally ask about. Is he truthful? Is he honest? Is he nice to his wife? None of that stuff matters.” But Hastings has argued for some time that Johnson is unfit for national office,writingof his “moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth”. Some, including his biographer Sonia Purnell, have credited Boris Johnson’s Eurosceptic journalism in Brussels with creating the climate which nurtured anti-EEC feeling in the Tory Party and in doing so destroyed John Major’s administration. That, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Major’s government was exhausted after 18 years of Tory government, and battle-weary after the struggle which ended Margaret Thatcher’s premiership in 1990. The Conservatives were tottering in the face of Tony Blair and New Labour’s assault and, vulnerable to the country’s appetite for “change”, were kicked out in the truly crushing general election defeat of 1997. But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.  Boris Johnson the prime minister would, one imagines, hate being subject to the kind of reporting and analysis that Boris Johnson the fledgling journalist made his own particular trademark. As a trainee fresh out of Balliol College, he joined the Times newspaper under the editorship of the near legendary Charlie Wilson - a tough, Glaswegian out of the old school of Fleet Street broadsheet journalism.

Johnson was sacked. It might have been the end of his journalistic - and conceivably any other - career in any profession requiring trust. But it wasn’t. Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings, who had met Johnson while he was hosting the great and the good at the Oxford Union, gave him a chance to redeem himself and he grabbed it with both hands. Soon, as the paper’s Europe correspondent in Brussels, Johnson made his name as a pioneer on what in 1989 became a new frontier of deeply Eurosceptic reporting. Much of the reporting at the time was done by correspondents who were arguably much more sympathetic to the culture of what was then called the European Economic Community. Johnson’s stories consistently made the front page, pleased readers who held the EEC’s “federalism” and interfering ways  in contempt - some of them, like Iain Duncan Smith, now prominent political supporters of the new regime set for Downing Street - and made his work popular to the point of becoming cult reading. His journalism artfully mixed fact with wild Eurosceptic fiction. There were tales about unlawfully curved bananas, wrongly sized condoms, and one about the European Commission headquarters Berlaymont building being about to be blown up with dynamite because it was found to contain asbestos. Often, the reports made you laugh out loud, which only added to their force. I remember running into him in Strasbourg, during a session of the European Parliament while I was a political reporter with the Independent. He was smirking at a name he’d invented for the leader of the Conservatives in the parliament, Sir Christopher Prout -  “Brussels-Prout”. He has a useful gift of somehow making you laugh even when his jokes are not especially good. But my former Independent colleagues, like other journos covering Europe, were not always so easily amused by their rival from the Telegraph. “He was fundamentally intellectually dishonest, in my view,” David Usborne told Andrew Gimson in an interview for his book. “He was serving his masters in a very skilful way but I never felt he believed... He was a highly intelligent man, much cleverer than I was, he could see all these nuances and subtleties, but he wasn’t conveying them in his writing. It was a cheap thrill - a stunt, and quite a dangerous stunt really.” As you’d expect, Max Hastings, his then editor, took a slightly indulgent view of his talented protege. He is perhaps rather less tolerant in retrospect. “I don’t think we ever caught him out in anything he deserved to be sacked for, or to be brought home from Brussels,” he told me in an interview for the BBC’s Panorama. “Boris’s relationship with integrity and truth, and with the right moral standards has always been a bit uncertain to put it politely.” As we’ll see, not everyone has been inclined to “put it politely” when it comes to Johnson’s character and record. Max Hastings’ assessment of his former employee is striking. “All human relations are about who makes you feel good… more than any other politician in British life today he’s a genius. He is absolutely terrific at telling people what they want to hear and he does it with wit, with elegance, with style. “He’s got that quality that causes his believers to be prepared to overlook all the things people traditionally ask about. Is he truthful? Is he honest? Is he nice to his wife? None of that stuff matters.” But Hastings has argued for some time that Johnson is unfit for national office,writingof his “moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth”. Some, including his biographer Sonia Purnell, have credited Boris Johnson’s Eurosceptic journalism in Brussels with creating the climate which nurtured anti-EEC feeling in the Tory Party and in doing so destroyed John Major’s administration. That, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Major’s government was exhausted after 18 years of Tory government, and battle-weary after the struggle which ended Margaret Thatcher’s premiership in 1990. The Conservatives were tottering in the face of Tony Blair and New Labour’s assault and, vulnerable to the country’s appetite for “change”, were kicked out in the truly crushing general election defeat of 1997. But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.  Johnson’s media career bore fruit, just as his efforts to cultivate his celebrity status blossomed, and his political efforts took root. He was a popular turn on the BBC’s Have I Got News For You, and he had quickly advanced to star columnist at the Telegraph, and editor of the Spectator soon afterwards. After an unsuccessful run at the impregnable Welsh Labour stronghold of Clwyd South in 1997, his high media profile helped him pluck the plum candidacy of Henley. He got into Parliament in 2001, succeeding Michael Heseltine, in his time a political super-heavyweight and aspirant premier himself, though obviously less successful in that ambition than Johnson. 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You For a while, it all seemed to be going almost too well. And it was. Johnson - who was divorced in 1993 and later married the barrister Marina Wheeler - was given a shadow ministerial job by party leader Michael Howard. But he was sacked after lying about an affair with his Spectator colleague Petronella Wyatt. In an interview with the BBC’s Today programme this year, Howard suggested sacking Johnsonmight have been a mistake. But that moment of repentance came when Johnson was very much closer to the premiership he craved than Howard had ever been. At the time of his sacking, he was a mere junior arts spokesman. And it wasn’t Johnson’s only setback. Another had been, if anything, more humiliating. Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife A leading article appeared in the Spectator in October 2004 after the awful murder of Ken Bigley while a hostage in Iraq. It described the “mawkish sentimentality” of the reaction. Bigley was a Liverpudlian, from a city still raw from the deaths of 96 fans in the Hillsborough football stadium tragedy of 1989. For Howard, a passionate fan of Liverpool Football Club, it was too much, and he ordered Johnson to go to the city to apologise. It became a grim media circus. Not the first to surround Boris Johnson. And not the last. He was constructing a reputation for gaffes and scrapes, but also having a way of somehow surviving them. That knack, as we have seen, has turned out to be very handy. The tabloid flurry over his relationship with Petronella Wyatt wasn’t the only one of its kind. Newspapers have other tales on file. Yet, as Max Hastings told me, moral disapproval never seems to have stuck, or, where it has, to have inflicted permanent political harm. Johnson himself often refused to answer interviewers’ questions about his private life during the Tory leadership campaign. They were not often asked. With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 Go back to his past writings, however, and he has argued for a liberal approach to the private lives of public figures. In a piece for the Telegraph in January 1998, defending the then US President Bill Clinton, he posed the question: “Does anyone think a bunch of uniformly virtuous politicians would make the slightest difference? Of course they wouldn’t… the press wilfully muddles the issue, feeding on public prurience and jealousy.” Highs and lows have come and gone, including his two spells as Conservative Mayor of London. The then Conservative leader, his Eton and Oxford contemporary, David Cameron, was not at first keen on Johnson becoming candidate for City Hall. Would he be a liability? He was certainly a rival attraction. Lord Coe was preferred, but didn’t want the job. Some believe Cameron’s lack of enthusiasm helped convince Johnson to go for it. And the prospect of the Tory Party scoring a huge victory in the capital, against the odds, became attractive in Downing Street. Was his mayoralty a success? Depends who you ask. House building went up. Crime came down. “Boris Bikes” filled the streets. Critics say he inherited Ken Livingstone’s legacy, and that crime came down across the country. In the build-up and aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics, it is reasonable to argue Johnson’s role as a frontman outweighed his actual contribution to delivering the event itself. His leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, played a bigger role in the practicalities. Lord Coe did too. But as a frontman Johnson had no equal. Obviously, he never intended to get stuck half way down a zip-wire near the Olympic site. For someone else, it might have been disastrous. For Johnson it was a comedic triumph. No wonder David Cameron - who always perceived Johnson’s unique potential - described him as a man capable of “defying gravity”. Young and old, left and right, the crowds cheered, and that raises the question: “Who is the real Boris Johnson?” Was it the leader of the metropolitan, multicultural, liberal and Labour-leaning capital? Or is it the darling of the Brexit-loving, deep dyed Conservative, and more socially conservative, party members who have elected him to be theirs and the country’s leader? His critics -  and some of his friends - believe the answer to that question is that Boris Johnson is whoever he needs to be to advance politically. Another, slightly pseudo-psychoanalytical take is that he truly believes everything that he says or writes, at the moment that he says or writes it. That is barely a more flattering view. Yet another view is that Johnson is at heart a “one-nation” Conservative, socially liberal and personally kind (a master at Eton says he never witnessed Johnson uttering an unkind word), and optimistic in a way that is infectious. MPs who were former colleagues at City Hall speak highly of his abilities.Kit Malthouse, who was deputy mayor for policing, said Johnson had succeeded in “tackling poverty, cutting crime - particularly knife crime, building the homes people need and delivering a cleaner, greener city”.James Cleverly, who also worked with Johnson as a London Assembly member, said: “I know he can run a successful executive operation because I was part of the team who did that in London for eight years.” Both initially announced their intention to stand for the Conservative leadership before dropping out and backing Johnson. Before he took office in July, there had been much talk of Johnson being a“chairman of the board”.The idea was that as prime minister he would surround himself with talented people - in much the same way he did as mayor - rather than trying to micromanage. The questions about Boris Johnson's political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her. A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran Ken Clarke, who has filled virtually all the most senior jobs in Conservative cabinets, told me that as foreign secretary, Johnson ""was a disaster”. “The diplomats were driven up the wall. He didn’t read the brief. The only thing he worked at were the photo opportunities at foreign meetings… quite the most hopelessly irresponsible foreign secretary I’ve ever known from any party.”  For an alternative, vastly more friendly view, you might try Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph. Shehit backat all the “lazy caricatures”, and preferred to remember Johnson’s support as foreign secretary for girls’ education around the globe, as well as his backing for strong sanctions after the poison attack on the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, which resulted in the expulsion of 100 Russian diplomats by the UK and allies including the US. She also drew attention to his habit of delegating tasks to trusted subordinates. Now, Camilla Tominey was, of course, a colleague of Johnson’s on the Telegraph, where he wrote a regular and highly prized, highly paid column. Ken Clarke is a known critic of Brexit. My guess is you may already be predisposed to agree with one side or the other. Either way, Boris Johnson was chosen to serve as foreign secretary not for his diplomatic skills, but because Theresa May wanted prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet jobs most closely tasked with delivering it. That plan didn’t work out particularly well for her. Brexit ground to a standstill. May resigned, having failed wretchedly to achieve a mission which, in truth, seemed all but impossible from the moment of her disastrous “victory” in the 2017 general election, and Boris Johnson’s rise to replace her is now pencilled into political history. He’ll be hoping it makes easy reading in time to come. Again, we’ll see. The story of Johnson’s role in the Leave campaign has been told too often to need much retelling here. There were the two newspaper columns he wrote, one for leaving and one against. The friends (or former friends) like Roland Rudd, the financial PR man who now chairs the People’s Vote campaign, who told me bitterly how Johnson pledged his devotion to the Remain side shortly before announcing the opposite. Sir Craig Oliver, then director of communications in Downing Street under David Cameron, testifies to a poetic text message from Johnson predicting Brexit would be crushed “like the toad beneath the harrow”, sent moments before he came out for the Leave side. According to who’s telling the tale, it’s damning evidence that Johnson was never a true Brexiteer with some saying that he joined what he hoped would be the losing side (though still the one most useful to his leadership ambitions) or that he was genuinely torn by doubt until the last moment. Does the accusation of dishonesty stick? Detractors point to the dubious slogan plastered on the side of the Leave campaign bus suggesting Brexit would free £350m a week for the NHS, and also the alarming suggestion that millions of Turks were waiting to enter the UK and swamp the health service almost overnight. The charge sheet of false or inflated campaign claims, with which Johnson became associated, is a long one. Of course, Brexiteers are no less vocal in condemning the Remain side’s hair-raising economic prophecies - Project Fear. You will doubtless have your own view. If Boris Johnson feels any regret - and I have never heard anything to suggest that he does - he has kept it to himself. A friend and close associate told me he is proud of what he achieved, and considers that he “owns” Brexit. Another friend, his close adviser at City Hall, Guto Harri (a former BBC colleague) told me: “He has to focus very narrowly on the Conservative grassroots now. But he will know that he will only succeed as prime minister if he broadens his focus and his appeal once again way beyond that. It’s something he did pull off as mayor and I just hope he can do that again.” Johnson may or may not “own” Brexit. He certainly owns the responsibility to deliver it, or to deliver something that works. His leadership will be unlike anything we’ve seen. But the consequences will be no joke.

"A trade spat between Japan and South Korea threatens to spill beyond their borders, posing potential risks to consumer electronics supplies around the world. The row stems from export restrictions Tokyo imposed on certain industrial materials that Seoul needs to make semiconductors and display screens. Japan has also warned tougher trade curbs could be on the way. The moves have drawn anger from South Korea, and earlier this month President Moon Jae-in described the situation as an ""unprecedented emergency"" for his country's economy. On Tuesday, officials from Seoul will bring the dispute to a meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) General Council. They hope to convince the international community that Japan has violated global trading rules, and the measures should be rescinded. The simmering dispute is seen as the latest example of countries using trade as a weapon in diplomatic battles. ""There's blame to be had on both sides,"" says Robert Dujarric, director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University Japan. ""The issue goes back 50 years, this is not something that has just landed today."" The two countries share a complicated history that includes Japanese colonial rule of Korea from 1910 until the defeat of Japan in 1945. Last year, South Korean court rulings ordering Japanese firms pay compensation to Koreans over forced wartime labour inflamed long-running tensions. Bad blood between Japan and Korea persists The decisions drew condemnation from Japan, which argues the dispute was settled in 1965 when diplomatic ties were normalised between the neighbouring countries. Mitsubishi Heavy, one of the firms involved, has reportedly refused to comply with the court order, while two other companies have had their assets seized in South Korea. Family members of South Korean victims of forced wartime labour at a rally urging compensation issues be resolved In July, Tokyoimposed export controls targeting South Korea's key electronics sector,external. Japan says the measures are designed to clean up export control procedures. But many are sceptical about that justification. ""I don't think there's anyone that believes that the Japanese decision on exports is not related to the desire to 'punish' or 'pressure' South Korea to deal with the court rulings,"" says Temple University's Mr Dujarric. The export curbs apply to three high-tech materials: fluorinated polyimide, photoresists and hydrogen fluoride. Japan is the dominant producer of those materials which are vital to make memory chips and display screens. These are key industries for South Korea. The country's tech giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix exported around 60% of global memory components last year, according to IHS Markit. A spokesperson for Samsung said the company was ""assessing the current situation"" and ""reviewing a number of measures to minimise impact on our production"". SK Hynix declined to comment. UK and S Korea sign preliminary trade deal The restrictions don't block the sale of the materials, but require Japanese exporters to acquire licences to sell the products to South Korea, potentially causing delays and choking supplies. Tokyo may go further by removing Seoul from its so-called ""white list"" of trusted trading partners. Striking South Korea from the list would dramatically expand the products that face export restrictions. Japan's decision on the white list is expected by next month. The dispute has sparked strong reactions in South Korea, prompting boycotts of Japanese goods from beer to clothes and travel. This sign in a grocery shop in Seoul says ""This store does not sell Japanese products!"" South Korea plans to take the dispute to the WTO and has argued that other countries could be caught in the crossfire. ""There are major concerns that such a move would have a grave impact on not only the economies in both countries, but the global supply chain,"" Lee Ho-hyeon, a director at South Korea's trade ministry said last week. Many analysts have joined South Korea in raising the alarm over the risk the trade spat presents to the global technology supplies. ""The ripple effects on the regional electronics supply chains cannot be underestimated,"" says DBS economist Ma Tieying. She says supply disruptions could hit Apple, Huawei and Sony among others in the production of smartphones, computers and televisions. More from theBBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Should I offset my summer holiday flights? Would you drink camel milk? Why blue jeans are going green The tropical islands that fell into ruin Young drinkers lead the trend for alcohol-free beer South Korea is currently the world's second largest producer of semiconductors, according to DBS, while Samsung and LG Electronics hold more than 90% of the global organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen market. The longer the dispute drags on, the deeper the potential impact. Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit, says if Japan's export controls remain in place for a prolonged period it ""could disrupt the global electronics supply chain"" given South Korea's dominance in the memory chip market. He says the price of memory components ""could significantly increase due to the inability of the other memory suppliers to meet global demand"". Memory chips are used in smartphones and other devices Still, electronics manufacturing industry group Semi says it's too early to gauge the impact on global supplies. ""We're still waiting to see. Japan has said this is not punitive. [It said] this is not going to negatively impact trade,"" Mike Russo, vice president of global industry advocacy at Semi says. Mr Russo expects South Korea will be removed from the white list, which could create supply delays, but notes that Japan says ""that will not happen"". ""Our major members in Japan have said to us they are comfortable with the assurances they have received so far from the [Japanese] government and while they are hopeful, it is too early to tell if there will be a negative impact.""

"This video can not be played Jennifer Hutchinson was diagnosed with hepatitis C, 34 years after receiving contaminated blood A lawyer representing dozens of victims of the contaminated blood scandal has urged the Welsh Government to take the lead in helping them. At least 300 victims from Wales were left with chronic or life-limiting conditions such as hepatitis or HIV after receiving contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 80s. Apublic inquirystarted taking evidence in Cardiff on Tuesday. Michael Imperato said it was about justice and bringing victims comfort. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was committed to supporting victims and working to ensure they had ""clarity and parity"". There were about 2,400 deaths UK wide as a result of the blood scandal, which was caused by infected and unscreened blood donations being pooled and used in blood products. The inquiry team is examining thousands of documents and will hear from patients and families in Wales over the next four days. What is the contaminated blood scandal? Blood inquiry seeks answers at last Infected Blood Inquiry: live coverage,external Inquiry head Sir Brian Langstaff opened the hearing in Cardiff on Tuesday, saying it had been the 'greatest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS' Mr Imperato, a partner and solicitor at Watkins and Gunn, said although the scandal pre-dates devolution, it was now up to the Welsh Government to make amends. ""Don't think that because it wasn't necessarily on your watch that there is nothing you can't learn from this and that there's nothing you can't be doing from this,"" he said. ""What we don't want is a 'pass the ball' culture. The Welsh Government have to deal with victims who are living and dying in Wales - I would ask them to try to lead the way in taking up the recommendations - put the others to shame and say 'we in Wales care for our people'."" Mr Gething said it was important that lessons were learned. ""Any recommendations from the inquiry will be considered and I'd need a good reason not to follow those recommendations,"" he said. Lawyer Michael Imperato said victims receive ""patchy"" support currently Mr Imperato said it was not just about the details of how the contaminated blood came to infect patients but how the scandal was covered up. He wants to know how the chain of command worked in Wales in the 1980s, in terms of the Welsh Office - in charge of Welsh blood - and Whitehall. ""Why has it taken 30 to 40 years to have this inquiry - during which hundreds of people have died or had their lives blighted?"" he asked. ""People have been begging for help but the establishment has ignored them. That's as big a scandal as anything else."" Mr Imperato is also concerned about the ""patchy"" and ""arbitrary"" level of support received by victims in Wales, with them having to go ""cap in hand"" to different organisations. The secret in my blood The NHS scandal which killed Liz's two husbands The health minister said he wanted to ensure victims were able to meet their ongoing challenges. ""There's an absolute commitment from me to continue to sit down and to listen to the affected community, as we understand what more we can do today to provide them with all the help and support they need,"" said Mr Gething. He said discussions were continuing between the UK nations about having a financial support scheme which would be the same UK wide to bring ""clarity and parity"". ""I want the issue resolved as soon as possible - the sooner the better."" Jennifer Hutchinson wants answers about who was to blame Jennifer Hutchinson, 75, from Benllech, Anglesey, contracted hepatitis C in her 30s after receiving contaminated blood in an operation. It happened six months after her third child was born in 1977, when she had problems and went into St David's hospital in Bangor. She suffered a haemorrhage and needed emergency surgery. But it was 34 years before hepatitis C - a disease which damages the liver - was diagnosed as a result of her blood transfusion. Jennifer, unaware, worked running a guest house and as a receptionist in a solicitor's office. But when her husband was offered early retirement in the mid 1990s from his job as a probation officer, the couple decided to travel. ""We loved France, got work there and did that for several years. In 2001, we were walking in the Pyrenees and I wasn't feeling very well. I was tested in Spain - and it came back as hep C. I didn't believe it, where did that come from? I didn't know how you got it. It didn't register that it was a blood transfusion."" A friend who was a GP tracked back what had happened. ""I felt it was a death sentence, because I had to be tested for Aids as well, which was clear."" The Hutchinsons want answers and for lessons to be learnt The couple returned to north Wales and Jennifer suffered from different health problems, including serious liver issues. Her husband of nearly 54 years, Norman, said: ""From that moment of diagnosis, our lives were turned completely upside down. The good times we were having stopped."" Jennifer, who has treatment in Birmingham, added: ""I'm tired all the time, most afternoons I need to sleep. I never have a good day, I have a bad day or a very bad day."" She said there could also be stigma attached to the condition, which she faced when she was sent to what turned out to be a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Bangor a few years ago. ""I said 'is this the VD clinic?' The nurse said it was the only place they had. It was embarrassing."" The couple want answers about who was to blame and believe there was a cover-up - saying 160 people had died since the inquiry began. Norman said: ""The best to happen would be for the Westminster government to own up and pay up - and learn from it."" Mr Imperato said thousands of people had been touched by it and it might never be known just how many - as so many had died or may not realise they had it. ""You can never fail to be moved by particularly young people's lives cut off at their prime and the impact on the spouse and children,"" he said. ""These people also often had to live with terrible stigma. Back in the 1980s, HIV was seen as something of a pariah disease. Hepatitis C is often associated with liver disease, unhealthy living and too much alcohol. It's hard to believe the survivors have managed to live through that.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has three priorities, to deliver Brexit, unite the country and beat Jeremy Corbyn Boris Johnson has been elected new Conservative leader in a ballot of party members and will become the next UK prime minister. He beat Jeremy Hunt comfortably, winning 92,153 votes to his rival's 46,656. The former London mayor takes over from Theresa May on Wednesday. In his victory speech, Mr Johnson promised he would ""deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn"". Speaking at the Queen Elizabeth II centre in London, he said: ""We are going to energise the country. ""We are going to get Brexit done on 31 October and take advantage of all the opportunities it will bring with a new spirit of can do. ""We are once again going to believe in ourselves, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity."" Watch the moment the result was revealed Boris Johnson's battles What does the prime minister actually do? And what can he expect on his first day? Mr Johnson thanked his predecessor, saying it had been ""a privilege to serve in her cabinet"". He was Mrs May's foreign secretary until resigning over Brexit. The outgoing PM - who is standing down after a revolt by Conservative MPs over her Brexit policy - congratulated her successor, promising him her ""full support from the backbenches"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: 'My remain vote was a hurdle we couldn't overcome' Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said he was ""very disappointed"", but Mr Johnson would do ""a great job"". He said he had ""total, unshakeable confidence in our country"" and that was a valuable quality at such a challenging time. Mr Hunt added: ""It was always going to be uphill for us because I was someone who voted Remain and I think lots of party members felt that this was a moment when you just had to have someone who voted for Brexit in the referendum. ""In retrospect, that was a hurdle we were never able to overcome."" Donald Trump told an event in Washington ""a really good man is going to be the prime minister of the UK now,"" and Mr Johnson would ""get it done"", referring to Brexit. The president added: ""They call him Britain Trump. That's a good thing."" Almost 160,000 Conservative members were eligible to vote in the contest and turnout was 87.4%. Mr Johnson's share of the vote - 66.4% - was slightly lower than that garnered by David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership election (67.6%). The former London mayor and ex-foreign secretary spoke to staff at Conservative Party HQ after his victory was announced. He was then given a rousing reception by Tory MPs at a meeting in Parliament, where he urged them to ""unite, unite, unite and win"". The BBC's Nick Eardley, who was outside the room, said such gatherings had been gloomy and downbeat for many months, but this one was full of laughter. One MP told our correspondent: ""The BoJo show is up and running."" Another said: ""The cloud has been lifted."" Mr Johnson will begin announcing his new cabinet on Wednesday, but it has already been confirmed that Mark Spencer, MP for Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, will become chief whip - the person responsible for enforcing party discipline in the Commons. A number of senior figures have already said they will not serve under Mr Johnson, though, citing their opposition to his stance on Brexit. He has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal exit will happen if a new agreement cannot be reached by then. Education Minister Anne Miltontweeted her resignation,externaljust half an hour before the leadership result was due to be revealed, insisting the UK ""must leave the EU in a responsible manner"". And International Development Secretary Rory Stewart confirmed he would be returning to the backbenches, where he would be spending more time ""serving Cumbria"" and ""walking"".

David Gauke, another vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit,announced he was resigning,externalas justice secretary. They join the likes of Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Culture Minister Margot James who have all said they disagree too strongly with Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy to work closely with him. Boris Johnson will become our next prime minister. A sentence that might thrill you. A sentence that might horrify you. A sentence that 12 months ago even his most die-hard fans would have found hard to believe. But it's not a sentence, unusually maybe for politics, that won't bother you either way. Because whatever you think of Boris Johnson, he is a politician that is hard to ignore. With a personality, and perhaps an ego, of a scale that few of his colleagues can match. This is the man who even as a child wanted to be ""world king"". Now, he is the Tory king, and the Brexiteers are the court. Read Laura's blog here The EU Commission's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he was looking forward to working with Mr Johnson ""to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement and achieve an orderly Brexit"". The new Tory leader has previously said the agreement Mrs May reached with the EU was ""dead"", having been rejected three times by MPs. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator, said the parliament would hold an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in response to Mr Johnson's election. What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? What will he mean for Northern Ireland? Watch his victory speech in full Jeremy Corbyn reacted to the result by tweeting that Mr Johnson had ""won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative Party members"". ""The people of our country should decide who becomes the prime minister in a general election,"" he added. Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Corbyn said Labour planned to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Johnson. Asked when that would be, he replied: ""It will be an interesting surprise for you all."" Wednesday 12:00 BST onwards:Theresa May takes part in her last Prime Minister's Questions. After lunch she will make a short farewell speech outside No. 10 before travelling to see the Queen to tender her resignation. Boris Johnson will then arrive for an audience at Buckingham Palace where he will be invited to form a government. After that he will make a speech in Downing Street before entering the building for the first time as prime minister. Later, he will begin announcing his most senior cabinet appointments, such as chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary, and will make and take his first calls from other world leaders. Thursday:Mr Johnson is expected to make a statement to Parliament about his Brexit strategy and take questions from MPs. Parliament will break up for its summer recess later. The new PM will also continue announcing his new cabinet. Boris Johnson's family - father Stanley, sister Rachel and fellow Tory MP Jo - attended the announcement This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Boris Johnson needs to think âa bit more carefullyâ about his priorities Newly-elected Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Johnson had ""shown time and time again that he isn't fit to be the prime minister of our country"". First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson, but said she had ""profound concerns"" about him becoming prime minister. The new leader also received congratulations from Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose support has kept the Conservatives in government since the 2017 general election. She said the pact - known as a confidence and supply agreement - continued and would be reviewed over the coming weeks ""to explore the policy priorities of both parties"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson, who backed Mr Hunt in the campaign, also sent her congratulations, adding that the new PM had ""an enormous task ahead of him"". In the often divisive Brexit world of ""them and us"" it's easy to forget that, beyond Brexit, EU leaders still see the UK as a close partner and ally. Today's messages of congratulation to Boris Johnson from across Europe were a timely reminder. Whatever happens with Brexit, France, Germany, Poland et al still very much hope to work closely with the UK on international issues like Russia sanctions, Iran, and human rights protection. But EU leaders' welcoming tone does not signal a willingness to accept whatever Prime Minister Johnson might demand in terms of changes to the Brexit deal. He's right when he says a no-deal Brexit is bad for Brussels, but he overestimates EU wiggle room. Amendments will only be forthcoming if EU leaders deem them workable and are convinced the new prime minister commands a majority in Parliament to get an agreement through once and for all.

"Gatis Lagzdins wore a T-shirt saying ""Veganism = Malnutrition"" when protesting outside a vegan food market Two men who ate dead squirrels outside a vegan food stall in protest against veganism have been convicted of public order offences and fined. Deonisy Khlebnikov, 22, and Gatis Lagzdins, 29, bit into the furry animals at the Soho Vegan Food Market in Rupert Street, London, on 30 March. The pair denied using disorderly behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress at a trial at City of London Magistrates' Court in June. They were found guilty on Monday. Natalie Clines, from the CPS, said: ""Deonisy Khlebnikov and Gatis Lagzdins claimed they were against veganism and were raising awareness about the dangers of not eating meat when they publicly consumed raw squirrels. Why do people mock vegans? Is social media behind the rise of veganism? Vegan diet 'could have severe effects' ""By choosing to do this outside a vegan food stall and continuing with their disgusting and unnecessary behaviour despite requests to stop, including from a parent whose child was upset by their actions, the prosecution was able to demonstrate that they had planned and intended to cause distress to the public. ""Their pre-meditated actions caused significant distress to members of the public, including young children."" Khlebnikov, of Westminster, was also fined Â£200. Lagzdins, of Ealing, an anti-vegan protester who has posted videos of similar stunts on YouTube, was fined Â£400. He did not attend the hearing, at Westminster Magistrates' Court A statement from Soho Vegan Market said: ""Soho Vegan Market was created so that people, both vegan and otherwise, could try delicious and different plant-based food in a brilliant and easily accessible location in the heart of London.

"Boris Johnson, the UK's new prime minister, was already one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. His high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy. As editor of the Spectator magazine and a Have I Got News For You contestant, Boris Johnson was already well known for his shambolic persona. In 2001, he became an MP,replacing Michael Heseltine,externalin the safe Conservative seat of Henley-on-Thames. Gay rights He was considered more liberal than many Tories. As a journalist, he hadquestioned the repeal of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities,external. But as an MP, he changed tack and said the state should not interfere in people's lives. He also voted in favour of civil partnerships. Boris Johnson during one of his Have I Got News For You appearances, in 2004 Mr Johnson continued to attract controversy. In October 2004, then Conservative leader Michael Howardordered him to visit Liverpool to apologise,externalfor a Spectator article accusing its residents of wallowing in ""disproportionate"" grief after Ken Bigley - an engineer from the city - was kidnapped and killed in Iraq. And the following month, he was sacked as shadow arts minister, amid claims he hadmisled Mr Howard about reports of an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt.,external Political career 7 yearsMP for Henley (2001-2008) 8 yearsMayor of London (2008-2016) 4 yearsMP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015- 2 yearsForeign Secretary (2016-2018) Nevertheless, a year later, he was on the rise again - resigning from his Spectator post when new Tory leaderDavid Cameron made him shadow higher education minister,external. However, he continued to write for the Telegraph and had to make another apology - to a whole country - after helinked Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief-killing"",externalin a column. By 2007, the Henley MP had his sights set on one of the biggest jobs in UK politics. Taking over from Labour's Ken Livingstone in 2008, Boris Johnson remained London mayor until 2016. It is the longest continuous period of public office that he has held. He's often spoken of what he considers to be his biggest achievements during that period: on crime, housing and transport.

Crime The homicide rate in London - which includes murder and manslaughter - fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people during his time as mayor. However, it was also falling during his predecessor's second term. And in the first few years after Mr Johnson took over, knife crime rose by over 15% - although from 2012-13 onwards it started to fall. Mr Johnson had backed the police use of stop-and-search powers to tackle violent crime. And he said he would ensure police numbers would go up despite central government cuts. Home Office figures show police numbers in London rose slightly, from 31,460 to 32,125, between March 2008 and March 2016. Across England and Wales in that period the number of officers fell by 17,603. Housing There was an increase in the number of affordable homes built - 101,525 by the end of March 2016, of which the Greater London Authority contributed to 94,001. This was a rise compared with the two terms of Mr Livingstone, although the definition of affordable housing had changed in 2011 so the figures are not directly comparable. Transport He scrapped the so-called bendy buses- which he said were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. In their place, he introduced a new version of the popular Routemaster London bus - a move that was criticised as a vanity project. There were complaints about non-opening windows and problems with the hybrid engines. They also cost considerably more than a normal bus. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his record as mayor of London add up? The transport legacy of Boris Johnson in London One of his most famous transport initiatives was the so-called ""Boris Bike"" cycle scheme, introduced in July 2010. Mr Johnson regularly promoted the hire bikes by riding them himself and the number of rentals reached more than 10.3 million during his last year as mayor. However, critics pointed to the Â£11m-a-year cost of keeping the bikes on the road. Others pointed out that plans for a bike hire scheme had been announced while Mr Livingstone had been mayor. Olympics As mayor, Mr Johnson became involved in overseeing arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, planning for which started after they were awarded to London in 2005. One of the most memorable moments was when he got stuck on a zip wire, while celebrating the UK's first gold medal win. The Olympics were widely seen as a success and there were claimsthat they had provided a major economic boost. But there were also questions raised about the Olympics' legacy, including criticism of the conversion of the Olympic Stadium into a football ground. In 2017, an independent review saidthe conversion had cost Â£323m - far more than the original estimate of Â£190m. Garden Bridge The latter part of his time as mayor sawa plan to build a garden bridge over the River Thamesas a memorial to Princess Diana. The pedestrian-only bridge, with trees and plants, which was first suggested by the actress Joanna Lumley in 1998, was to be funded by private and public money. But it was cancelled in 2017, after a review recommended the project be scrapped - Â£53m had already been spent on the project; Â£43m of which came from the public purse. Appointed foreign secretary in 2018 - after Boris Johnson's resignation Was health secretary for a record six years Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? Mr Johnson decided he wanted to return to Parliament before his term as mayor ended, in 2016. He won the seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 2015. After resuming life as an MP, he declared his opposition to expanding nearby Heathrow airport, saying he would lie in front of the bulldozers. As London mayor, he had promoted an alternative scheme, for an island airport in the Thames estuary,an idea rejected on cost and environmental grounds. But Mr Johnson was noticeably absent when MPs subsequently voted on Heathrow expansion in June 2018, as he was on an official trip to Afghanistan. Mr Johnson had been appointed foreign secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May, in 2016. He had also run in the Tory leadership campaign that yearbut dramatically pulled outafter Michael Gove's surprise decision to enter the race. The job as foreign secretary was seen as an acknowledgement of his role as a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. However, there was also some surprise at the choice, with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron saying he would""spend more time apologising to nations he's offended""than working as foreign secretary. And there were the disparaging comments about other countries and their leaders - some of which were made before he got the job. They included a Limerick - which won a Â£1,000 award in 2016 - about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a goat. And he said the Libyan city of Sirte could be the new Dubai if""they... clear the dead bodies away"". Russian expulsions As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson supported a tough line against Russia,with the expulsion of its diplomats after the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal. Twenty-nine countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and EU states, joined the UK, expelling more than 140 Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated move. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since 2016 Iran But in the case of British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, Mr Johnson had to apologise in Parliament. He had said she had been teaching journalists in Iran when she had been detained, contradicting her statement that she had been on holiday at the time. He later clarified that she had in fact been on holiday but has also said he does not believe his remarks made a difference to her plight - a claim rejected by her family. A few days after Mr Johnson made his remarks, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned before an Iranian judge, to face charges of engaging in propaganda against the regime. How Boris Johnson insulted the world Boris Johnson's most controversial foreign insults Saudi Arabia As foreign secretary,he also earned a rebuke from Downing Street, after comments emerged in which he had criticised close ally Saudi Arabia for engaging in proxy wars in the Middle East. Nevertheless, he continued to allow sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. In 2018, Mr Johnson also faced criticism after writing in the Daily Telegraph thatMuslim women wearing the burka ""looked like letterboxes"". By this stage, though, he had left the government, resigning in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plan. Boris Johnson was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. He became well known for his attacks on the EU and for advocating the benefits of Brexit. He declared that he was ""pro-having cake and pro-eating it"". But it hadn't always been clear which side he would support. In fact, while mayor of London, he'd spoken of the benefits of being in the single market. And in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2013,external, weighing up the pros and cons of being in the EU, he had said that leaving would not solve the UK's problems. However, he also made clear he supported plans to ask the British people to decide about EU membership. During the Brexit campaign, he came undersustained criticism from those in favour of Remain, for his claims about the benefits of leaving and what he called ""taking back control"". Â£350m claim Most controversial was a claim about how much money the UK sent to the EU. The Â£350m-a-week figure, which appeared on the side of a bus during the campaign,recently led to an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him.Critics pointed out at the time that the figure was wrong as it did not take into account the UK's rebate, or indeed money subsequently spent in the UK. For his part, Mr Johnson dismissed warnings that leaving the EU could spark a recession,describing one such study as propaganda. And he has continued to advocate a harder form of Brexit, sharply criticising both the deal that Mrs May agreed and her whole approach to the negotiations with the EU. He described it asleading the UK into the ""status of a colony"", in his resignation letter, in July 2018. Mr Johnson has continued to insist that the UK can and should leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal.

"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will face Boris Johnson in the run-off to become Conservative leader and prime minister. Mr Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Jeremy Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. He became the MP for South West Surrey at the 2005 general election, taking over from Virginia Bottomley. From 2005 to 2007, Mr Hunt was shadow minister for disabled people. It was a reward for supporting David Cameron, who attended Oxford University at the same time as him, in the Conservative leadership election.  2018-presentForeign secretary 2012-2018Health secretary 2010-2012Culture secretary 2007-2010Shadow culture secretary 2005-2007Shadow minister for disabled people A reshuffle in 2007 saw Mr Hunt promoted to shadow culture secretary. In 2009, he was found to havebreached expenses rules and ordered to repay more than Â£9,500,external. He had allowed his agent to stay rent-free in his constituency property, which was designated as his second home. Mr Hunt had claimed Â£19,117 in public money towards the property, but it was decided he hadn't benefited financially from the situation. When the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was formed in 2010, Jeremy Hunt joined the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, Olympics, media and sport. Olympics It was a key role in the run-up to London's 2012 Olympics and he worked closely with then London Mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr Hunt campaigned on the importance of tourism during the Olympics. And he took the decision to double the budget for the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies from Â£40m to Â£81m. The Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a big success. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt's bell-ringing clanger Mr Hunt also put emphasis on creating a lasting legacy for the games. The government gave Sport England Â£1bn to invest in grassroots sports, and Mr Hunt said there was an ""extraordinary chance"" to ""reinvigorate this country's sporting habits for both the young and the old"". But in the years that followed there wasonly a small increase in the number of young people taking up sport. In 2005-06 the proportion of over-16s in England who played sport for at least 30 minutes each week was 34.6%. By 2015-16, it was 36.1%. BSkyB takeover Earlier in 2012, his career was hanging in the balance. During the Leveson Inquiry into the culture and practices of the press, his contact with the Murdoch family came under scrutiny. Mr Hunt was responsible for overseeing the proposed takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. He was criticised for failing to supervise his adviser's contact with News Corp, and for messages he exchanged with James Murdoch on the bid. His special adviser, Adam Smith, was forced to quit. The inquiry released texts sent from Mr Hunt to News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel when it was bidding for BSkyB. The culture secretary addressed him as ""Daddy"" and ""mon ami"" - their wives had given birth in the same hospital in May 2010. Separately, in December 2010, he told Mr Michel there was ""nothing u won't like"" in a forthcoming speech. Mr Hunt insisted he acted with ""total integrity"" during the bid process. Local television As culture secretary, Mr Hunt also led a government plan to launch local television stations across the UK. More than 30 had been set up beforeOfcom later scrapped,externalthe roll-out of any further channels, because of limited interest from viewers and financial difficulties. City TV, the holder of the local TV licence for Birmingham, was forced to appoint administrators to find a buyer before it was even launched, for example. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt Reality Check: What is 'no-deal Brexit'? BBC Mr Hunt also announced a deal with the BBC to freeze the licence fee for six years at Â£145.50 from 2010. He said high executive salaries and an advantage over commercial broadcasters were a cause for concern. That was equivalent to a 16% budget cut in real terms and led to the BBC having to make savings, including 2,000 job losses. Under the agreement, the BBC also took on responsibility for funding the World Service, the Welsh language channel S4C, and the roll-out of broadband to rural areas. Was mayor of London for eight years, overseeing the London 2012 Olympics Resigned as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit strategy Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Boris Johnson's track record? Jeremy Hunt was appointed health secretary in September 2012, with Maria Miller taking on his previous role. He would eventually become the longest-serving health secretary in NHS history, surpassing its founder, Labour's Aneurin Bevan. NHS funding But Mr Hunt held office during the slowest period of investment in the NHS since its foundation - which created big problems. Since the NHS was established, health spending has risen by about 4% above inflation each year on average. Post-2010, as the coalition budget tried to reduce the deficit, this fell to about 1% a year. This came as demands on the health service were growing. Between 2005 and 2015, A&E visits went up by almost 30%. And during Mr Hunt's tenure as health secretary, the number of people in the population aged 85 and over went up by about a third. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said funding for the NHS needed to rise by 4.3% a year just to keep up with rising demand, without actively improving standards. Financial difficulties led to more hospitals going into the red, as well as targets being missed in three main areas: cancer care, hospital appointments and A&E waiting times. NHS England has not met any of these targets since 2015. Just 85.3% of patients were seen at A&E departments within the waiting time target of four hours in January 2018. At least 95% of patients attending A&E are supposed to be either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. Unions, like the GMB, demanded his resignation. Junior doctors battle As well as a series of austerity measures - which included extending a cap on pay increases for NHS staff - he was also criticised for his handling of the junior doctor contract row. Mr Hunt said that changes to contracts were essential to deliver a seven-day NHS in England by 2020 - a pledge in the Conservatives' 2010 election manifesto. To achieve this, the proposed contracts would mean evenings and Saturdays would be considered ""normal"" rather than ""unsocial"" hours and would no longer attract overtime pay. The NHS's pay review body had said the cost of paying a premium on these ""unsocial hours"" put delivering a seven-day NHS out of reach. Reality Check: How much has social care been cut? Junior doctors responded by tweeting pictures of themselves working weekend and late shifts, with the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. Contract negotiations with junior doctors stopped and started and the British Medical Association eventually decided on industrial action. Junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts in 2016. On two strike days, between 08:00 and 17:00 even emergency care wasn't covered - the first time that had ever happened in the history of the NHS. Public support for the strike was high, and even after doctors withdrew emergency care, the majority of the public (57%) still supported the strike and believed the government was more at fault (54%). A newcontract for junior doctors was later imposed, after BMA members rejected a deal agreed by the government and union negotiators. Despite heavy criticism, Mr Hunt did go on to secure a funding increase for the NHS, totalling Â£20.5bn in real terms by 2023. He also oversaw the introduction of an Ofsted-style system for rating hospitals and GP surgeries in England, ranking them on things like cancer, mental health and diabetes services. Patient safety Mr Hunt repeatedly referred in speeches to cases where individuals had received bad treatment in the NHS. He said he was horrified at the report into theStafford Hospital scandal. He went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers. Social care Social care was added to his brief in 2018. He spoke of the need to integrate social care, funded by local councils, with services delivered by the NHS. He had already overseen a transfer of money from the NHS to council budgets from 2014. This shared budget was designed to tackle the problem of elderly people having to stay in hospital beds unnecessarily, because of a lack of care for them at home. After this, the number of these cases fell. He also oversaw the introduction of the first national waiting-time target for mental health treatment. From April 2016, the NHS said at least 50% of people experiencing a first episode of psychosis should begin treatment within two weeks of referral. Mr Hunt became foreign secretary in July 2018, after his predecessor and now leadership rival, Boris Johnson, quit over Theresa May's Brexit strategy. In March, he becamethe first Western foreign minister to visit Yemen since conflict there began,external. He has faced criticism for allowing the UK to sell arms to the Saudi regime, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. But he has previously defended UK-Saudi ties, saying Saudi Arabia is a ""very, very important military ally to the UK"". His time as foreign secretary has not been gaffe-free. During a meeting on an official visit to China, he called his wife Lucia Guo ""Japanese"" - although she was born in Xian in central China. This video can not be played The foreign secretary tells Today he would include the DUP and ERG in Brexit talks A Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Hunt has since said he would vote Leave in a second vote. He said this was because of the ""arrogance of the European Commission"" in Brexit negotiations. He also likened the Brexit negotiating tactics of the EU to the Soviet Union. The comparison provoked criticism from EU ambassadors and politicians and there were calls for an apology. Mr Hunt says he want to negotiate a ""credible"" Brexit plan by securing changes tothe controversial Irish backstop. However, he does not rule out leaving the EU without a deal if such an outcome becomes ""the only way to deliver Brexit"". But unlike his leadership rival, Boris Johnson, he says the current departure date of 31 October is not a hard deadline.

"A lack of funding is having a devastating impact on Northern Ireland's schools, the chairman of a Westminster committee has said. The NI Affairs Committee has carried out an inquiry into education funding. It concluded that a growing funding crisis in Northern Ireland's schools has led to unmanageable pressures on school budgets. It also found there was not enough resources for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) pupils. Autistic child suspended from school for 135 days Toilet roll donated to school due to cuts NI schools at 'rock bottom', MPs are told As a result,many were receiving ""delayed care and limited hours of specialist support"". There are around 80,000 pupils with some form of special needs, almost a quarter of the total number of pupils, and a majority of them are educated in mainstream schools. The committee called for the education budget to be increased to reflect the rising costs associated with caring for pupils with SEND. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has published a report into education funding in Northern Ireland The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee launched an inquiry into education funding in August 2018, due to the lack of scrutiny taking place in the absence of an assembly. It heard oral evidence and received written submissions from principals, schools, unions and sectoral bodies, as well as the Department of Education (DE) and the Education Authority (EA). The DE resource budget for 2018-19 was Â£1.98bn, ""a 0.6% increase on the previous year's allocation and a reduction in real terms"", according to the committee. It said the department's resource budget for 2019-20 also saw a real-terms cut. ""We recommend that future budget allocations to DE rise not only in line with inflation, but in proportion to the number of pupils in the school system in order to reflect increasing pupil numbers and the associated demand for additional staff,"" the report said. The committee found: individual school budgets had deteriorated. While the numbers of pupils had risen by 2.5% since 2011, spending per head on them had decreased; the fragmented nature of Northern Ireland's education systems - with a range of schools across a number of different sectors - led to duplication and did not make the best use of resources. As a result they recommended fewer, better resourced schools; the committee also raised concerns about how the EA procures goods and services for schools, saying there is scope for ""substantial savings"". It also said teachers in Northern Ireland had seen their pay ""stagnate"" compared to their counterparts in the rest of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland. ""This is deeply unfair to Northern Ireland's teachers and must be corrected,"" the report said. But it said schools could not afford to fund any pay rise and recommended that the secretary of stateapprove a pay rise, funded centrally by government. It also called on the secretary of state to take key decisions relating to education in the absence of an assembly. It recommends, for instance, that if the executive is not reformed by October that Karen Bradley should implement SEND reforms previously agreed by the assembly in 2016. Simon Hoare MP, who chairs the committee, said schools were facing ""unmanageable pressures"". ""Stagnant funding is evidently having a devastating impact on the ability of Northern Ireland's schools to provide the education and support their pupils deserve,"" he said. ""Without an executive or assembly, budgeting challenges have mounted into a crisis."" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: ""The department welcomes the publication of this report and will carefully study all of its conclusions and recommendations."" Maghaberry Primary School principal Graham Gault, who previously told MPs that parents were ""donating toilet roll"" at his school, appealed to the Northern Ireland secretary to ""take it [the report] seriously"". ""Our children can bear the brunt of the financial circumstances that our government are imposing on our schools no longer,"" he said.

"Most of Caracas was hit by the latest blackout Venezuela has been hit by another massive power cut with the capital, Caracas, among the areas affected. Power was slowly being restored after the blackout reportedly hit 16 of the country's 23 states as well as Caracas. Information Minister Jorge RodrÃ­guez claimed the power cut was caused by an ""electromagnetic attack"" without providing evidence. In March, the country was hit by a series of blackouts, including one that affected all states and lasted a week. Sporadic blackouts are common in crisis-hit Venezuela, where decades of underinvestment have damaged the country's power grid. From March: Lootings as desperation grows in Venezuela Venezuela crisis in nine charts Crisis explained in 300 words The blackout, which started at 16:45 local time (20:45 GMT) on Monday, caused a massive gridlock in Caracas as traffic lights lost power. Sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians after the city's metro stopped running. Power was restored in the capital and some other parts of the country in the early hours of Tuesday local time, state-owned power company Corpolec said. But workplaces and schools were due to remain closed during the day as the government urged people to stay home. This video can not be played What are the real reasons behind Venezuelaâs blackouts? ""These blackouts are catastrophic,"" 51-year-old janitor Bernardina Guerra, who lives in Caracas, told Reuters news agency. ""I live in the eastern part of the city and there the lights go out every day. Each day things are worse."" Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. In a statement, Mr RodrÃ­guez said the alleged attack ""sought to affect the hydroelectric generation system of Guayana"", the southern state where the important Guri dam plant is located. Traffic lights lost power causing a massive gridlock in Caracas On Twitter, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro claimed the blackout was the result of a ""new criminal attack on the tranquillity and peace of the homeland"" and said the armed forces had been deployed for relief efforts. But opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ said it was the result of ""corruption and inability of the regime"". The latest blackout follows an hours-long outage in April that plunged large swathes of the country, including Caracas, into darkness. The government has blamed an ""electromagnetic attack"" for the blackout President Maduro and other government officials have in the past blamed ""terrorism"" and opposition sabotage, often claiming US involvement. Other alleged reasons include: An iguana that bit through a high-voltage cable, a reason given by Corpoelec to explain a power cut in the north-east of the country in 2010 ""Animals such as rats, mice, snakes, cats, squirrels"",externalgetting into the hydroelectric system's substations, as claimed last October by Electricity Minister Luis Motta Dominguez The country's position near the Equator, as senior official Lisandro Cabello alleged in June 2018, saying the fact that ""we're very close to the Sun"" means more intensive use of power in Venezuela than in other countries Mr GuaidÃ³ and President Maduro have been at loggerheads since January, when the former invoked the constitution and declared himself interim president. Mr GuaidÃ³ argued that the elections which had returned Mr Maduro to power for a second term in 2018 had not been free and fair. Since then, more than 50 countries, including the US and most nations in Latin America, have recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate leader. But Venezuela's military - a powerful force in the country - and influential allies such as China and Russia have stuck by Mr Maduro. This video can not be played Venezuela crisis: The four countries interested in the presidential battle An attempt by Mr GuaidÃ³ to get the military to switch allegiance to him failed, and the country remains in limbo with both men claiming to be the legitimate president. Meanwhile, a severe economic crisis has exacerbated and shortages of food and medicines have grown even more acute. United Nations figures suggest four million people have fled the country since 2015. Venezuela's government blames the shortages on US sanctions but the opposition says they are down to years of mismanagement. Preliminary talks between Mr GuaidÃ³ and President Maduro were held in Oslo in May, but they petered out without an agreement. However they resumed earlier this month in Barbados, with the Norwegian foreign ministry again acting as a mediator. Venezuela crisis in brief What's behind Venezuela's political crisis?
