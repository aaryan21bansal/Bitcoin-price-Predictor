"This video can not be played Ellie Soutter during the Youth Olympic Winter Festival in 2017 The father of British snowboarder Ellie Soutter who died on her 18th birthday believes she could have been struggling with the pressure of competing in high-level sport. Tony Soutter told BBC South East he had lost his best friend, his ""total buddy"" and his rock. Ellie ""wanted to be the best"" and not ""let anybody down"", he said. UK Sport said it was working with partners to provide appropriate support for athletes. Speaking publicly for the first time sincehis daughter's death on 25 July,external, Mr Soutter said he believes his daughter's history of mental health issues coupled with the pressure of elite performance may have contributed to her ending her life in Les Gets in the French Alps. ""She wanted to be the best,"" he said. ""She didn't want to let anybody down. ""Unfortunately it all came about from missing a flight which then meant she didn't go training with the GB squad. ""She felt she'd let them down, felt she'd let me down and just tragically it just takes one silly little thing like that to tip someone over the edge, because there's a lot of pressure on children."" Ellie Soutter during the Youth Olympic Winter Festival in 2017 Calling for action to help other young athletes, Mr Soutter added: ""Mental health awareness needs to be really looked at and made more public."" He said: ""I have lost my best friend, my total buddy. She was my rock."" Soutter grew up in Oxted, Surrey, before moving to the Alps where she trained. Her bronze was Team GB's only medal at the Youth Olympic Winter Festival in Turkey last year.

"Bournemouth School is bidding for money to expand There are 11,000 more grammar school pupils in England now than in 2010, BBC analysis of official data shows. And by 2021, the data suggests, the number of extra places created will be equivalent to 24 new grammar schools compared to eight years ago. The analysis shows a rise in numbers even before the distribution ofa new Â£50m growth fund, announced in May. The government says schools will be eligible for funding only if they improve access for poorer pupils. Grammar schools are state-funded secondary schools which allocate places to pupils on the basis of their performance in an extra academic test at the end of primary school. Prime Minister Theresa May had to drop controversial plans to overturn the ban on new schools after the last election, but the expansion of existing grammar schools has been encouraged. Green light for grammar expansion Do grammars boost social mobility? Reality check: Selective schools and social mobility More than 30 existing grammar schools are bidding for some of the first Â£50m slice of a new Â£200m government expansion fund. Schools bidding for the cash will have to show how they intend to admit more disadvantaged pupils. Using newly-published government data, the BBC has found that grammar schools have been continuing to grow, even before the distribution of those funds. If schools maintain their intake at current rates, the equivalent of eight extra schools will be added by 2021 compared with this year, and 24 more compared with 2010. This video can not be played Grammar schools: How do children cope when they don't make the grade? Grammar schools remain controversial because they take a big slice of the children already doing well at school, making it harder for neighbouring schools to get similarly good GCSE results. Some better-off parents invest heavily in paying for tutoring for the test, and overall very few pupils from poorer backgrounds have attended grammar schools in the past decade. So a key part of the debate in England about grammar schools has been whether they make an effort to give places to children from families on benefits or low earnings. If a child has received free school meals in the past six years, the school gets extra money called pupil premium funding. We looked at the admission policies of all 163 grammar schools in England for the school year 2018-19. You need a modern browser and a working internet connection to view the interactive content in this page. Source: BBC research and Department for Education pupil population data 2016-17 If you can't see the postcode search, taphere,external The number not giving any priority to poorer, pupil premium children has fallen from 90 to 61 since the current school year. Looking ahead to next year, 93 of England's 163 grammar schools have a priority policy of some kind. A further nine will only use pupil premium status as a tiebreaker to decide between two children with the same test score. If a school uses results from the top test score down it may never need to use the tiebreaker, and children who have been tutored, or come from better-off homes, may get most of the places. Prof Anna Vignoles, from Cambridge University, says quotas are a better way of getting more poorer pupils into grammar schools as they set a lower bar for those pupils. ""Tiebreakers are less effective, and the reason is you are still admitting pupils on the basis of their test score and on average, poorer students have lower scores. ""So what you are doing is ranking students on their test score and the richest students will be at the top, and you rarely get to use your tiebreaker."" More than 30 grammar schools are bidding for a share of the first wave of expansion cash. The government says those schools asking for money need to show how they will make sure more disadvantaged children get places, through measures such as a lower test mark or a quota of places. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Any good school - whether it is a comprehensive, academy or selective school - is able to expand if there is a need and a parental demand. By 2020 this government will have created a million new school places, so it's no surprise that grammars, some of the highest performing schools in the country, are part of that. ""The criteria for grants from the Selective School Expansion Fund is clear. If applicants cannot show how they will increase access, they will not be eligible for funding."" Schools willing to ask for some of the money as a loan will also win points that could help their bid. Heath Monk is the executive director of the King Edward VI group of schools in Birmingham. ""There is a real opportunity to use the fund to leverage more fair access, but that's clouded by the financial considerations. ""The question is whether if you have weaker fair access plans, could those bids get through because of a willingness of the school to borrow more?"" Grammar school success 'down to privilege' How parent power boosts grammars Four of the schools bidding do not have any policy in place for this year or next to give poorer children priority. These are Chislehurst and Sidcup, Highworth, and Wilmington, all in Kent and Westcliff grammar school in Essex. Some, like the highly oversubscribed Colchester County High School for Girls, and Tiffin school in Kingston-upon-Thames, only use pupil premium to decide as a tiebreaker. Others, like Bournemouth grammar school have already made very radical changes to make their admissions policy more inclusive. Next year, all pupil premium children passing the test will be awarded places first regardless of where they live, followed by other local children from Bournemouth and parts of Christchurch. ""I think we're going back to why grammar schools were established, to serve the most able children no matter what their background,"" says head teacher Dorian Lewis. He says changes made already in admissions have more than doubled the proportion of pupils on free school meals from 3% to 7%. He describes the school buildings as ""crumbling"" and says they have previously missed out on money to rebuild. The anti-selection campaign group Comprehensive Future, asked grammar schools how many pupil premium or free school meals children had been given places for the school year starting in September 2017. It was made as a Freedom of Information request, and the data, seen by the BBC, shows that 564 places were awarded to poorer pupils. Northern Ireland also has grammar schools but each part of the UK manages its budget and policy for schools separately. Additional reporting by Christine Jeavans, Wesley Stephenson and Katherine Smith. Correction 2 August 2018: An earlier version of this story reported that according to data gathered by Comprehensive Future, Colchester County High School for Girls did not admit a single pupil premium or free school meals pupil in the current school year. The school has contacted us to say that 10 such pupils were admitted in the current school year. We have amended the story to reflect this.

"Prime Minister Theresa May is to hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, Downing Street says. Mrs May has been invited to Mr Macron's holiday retreat in the south of France. It comes as the UK government steps up its engagement with counterparts in the EU over Brexit. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told theEvening Standard,externalFrance and Germany had to ""send a strong signal"" to the European Commission on the need for a ""pragmatic and sensible outcome"". Prime ministers and their holiday snaps And he warned that the likelihood of no deal being reached were ""increasing by the day"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree on how their future relationship will work. Key differences between the UK and the EU remain, more than a year after negotiations started. This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? Government ministers say they want to reach a deal with the EU covering issues like trade and border checks, but are also making contingency plans to prepare for leaving with no agreement in place. Last week the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected a key part of Mrs May's proposals, which would involve the UK collecting customs duties on its behalf. More concerns have been raised in the UK about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. An assessment by Dover Council saida giant 13-mile ""lorry park"", proposed for the M20, could be in place for yearsas ports try to cope with the situation. It said ""there does not appear to be a Plan B"" if it does not work, and it could lead to ""17-mile traffic jams"". Kent County Council has also warned that any increased border and customs checks could lead to delays and long queues of port freight traffic. Mr Hunt, who is holding talks with his French and Austrian opposite numbers, warned of economic consequences for both the UK and the EU if a deal can't be found. ""The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. ""That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,"" he said. ""There is a real chance of no deal by accident.""

"This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Apple shares hit a record on Wednesday, pushing the market value of the tech giant closer to the $1 trillion mark. The shares rose more than 5% to end at more than $201, close to the roughly $207 price needed to make it a $1tn company. The rise came after Apple reported strong demand for its most expensive iPhones, boosting quarterly revenue despite just 1% growth in shipments. The average iPhone price hit $724 (Â£552), well above the expected $694. The firm said its $999 iPhone X - launched last year - remained its most popular iPhone model in the quarter and had driven the higher sales price. Revenue growth of 31% in Apple's services business, which includes the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, also boosted the firm's performance. Is Samsung's Galaxy S9 flagship a flop? State firm hosts Apple's data in China Apple to close iPhone security loophole Overall the tech giant's revenue jumped 17% year-on-year to a quarterly record of $53.3bn (Â£40.6bn), with every region except Japan reporting double digit growth. Profits rose to $11.5bn, up 32% compared to the same period in 2017. ""The lesson Apple's management has learned from the iPhone X, is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1,000 you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,"" said analyst Thomas Forte from DA Davidson & Co. If Apple's momentum continues, it could be the first US company to hit a $1tr market value. Globally,PetroChina reached that milestone in 2007,external, though the market cap, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price, was measured using the price of its Shanghai-listed shares, not those traded elsewhere, and has since fallen. Apple already claims a market capitalisation of about $975bn, making it the world's most valuable company, ahead of Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft. To reach the $1tn threshold, Apple will need to see further increases to its share price - though exactly how high the price has to climb depends on how many shares Apple has. That is changing as the firm is engaged in a generous share buyback programme, which it expanded by $100bn in May. The company is also vulnerable to trade tensions between the US and China, which have led to new tariffs and rattled global stock markets. The US is mulling additional duties on $200bn in Chinese imports, which could affect Apple's operations.  In recent days, state media in China have also had reports that fault Apple for not doing enough to counter spam in its messaging service. Apple chief executive Tim Cook told financial analysts on Tuesday that the firm is assessing the risk from the latest US tariff proposal but has not felt direct effects from the higher duties already put in place. ""Our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences,"" he said. However, he said he was optimistic that ""this will get sorted out"". Apple sold 41.3m iPhones in the April through June period, up 1% from last year. The appetite for the firm's most expensive phones marked a contrast with the world's largest smartphone sellerSamsung, which disappointed investorsby warning of lower than expected sales of its high-end Galaxy S9 . But Chinese tech company Huawei, which reported 15% revenue growth in the first half of this year, overtook Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone seller in the quarter, according to market research firmsCanalys,externalandIDC,external.

"Facebook says it has removed 32 accounts and pages believed to have been set up to influence the mid-term US elections in November. It said it was in the ""very early"" stages of the investigationand did not yet know who was behind the pages.,external It said the creators had gone to greater lengths to hide their identities than a Russia-based campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential vote. It described attempts to erase election interference as an ""arms race."" The social network said in a blog that it had identified 17 suspect profiles on Facebook and seven Instagram accounts. It said that there were more than 9,500 Facebook posts created by the accounts and one piece of content on Instagram. Facebook has shared some of the images posted by the accounts In total more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the pages involved, it added. Facebook said the suspect accounts had also run about 150 ads on Facebook and Instagram, costing a total of $11,000 (Â£8,300). The most popular fake accounts were: Aztlan Warriors Black Elevation Mindful Being Resisters The ""bad actors"" went to far greater lengths to cover their tracks than the Russian-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) had in the past, Facebook said. This included using virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their location, and using third parties to run ads on their behalf. Furthermore, the social network said it had not found evidence of Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses. But it did find one link between the IRA and the new accounts. One of disabled IRA accounts shared a Facebook event hosted by the Resisters page. The page also briefly listed an IRA account as one of its administrators. Many of the posts included anti-Trump messages It added that it ""may never be able to identify the source"" for the fake accounts. ""The set of actors we see now might be the IRA with improved capabilities, or it could be a separate group,"" explained Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos. ""This is one of the fundamental limitations of attribution: offensive organisations improve their techniques once they have been uncovered, and it is wishful thinking to believe that we will always be able to identify persistent actors with high confidence."" Fake news 'crowding out' real news, MPs say Facebook halts InfoWars founder's posts Facebook is in 'arms race' with Russia Facebook has removed the suspect accounts, but says other legitimate page administrators unwittingly interacted with them. For example, after the Resisters account created a Facebook event for a protest on 10 to 12 August called ""No Unite the Right 2"", five other page owners offered to co-host the demonstration and posted details about transportation and locations. Facebook said it had contacted the admins involved and would alert the 2,600 users who had expressed interest in the event. Some of the flagged posts would have been difficult for the public to identify as election interference The firm said it would also continue efforts to detect further misuses of its platform and work more closely with law enforcement and other tech firms to understand the threats faced. Democratic congressman Adam Schiff said: ""Today's announcement from Facebook demonstrates what we've long feared: that malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmarks of previously-identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponise social media platforms to influence the US electorate."" Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who is vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, also pointed his finger at Moscow. ""Today's disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation, and I am glad that Facebook is taking some steps to pinpoint and address this activity,"" he said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham added that he intended to pursue retaliatory measures by introducing a sanctions bill against Russia on Thursday ""that has everything but the kitchen sink in it"". ""It'll be the sanctions bill from hell. And any other country that is trying to interfere with our election should suffer the same fate."" Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, said that the operation's apparent goal had been to ""sow discord, distrust, and division in an attempt to undermine public faith in our institutions and our political system"". ""Russians want a weak America,"" he added. This may look like another disastrous headline for Facebook, but it isn't. Earlier in the year it promised to improve its so-far shambolic efforts at removing misinformation. It promised to hire more people, enlist outside help and work on new automated detection methods. Today it was able to share a tangible, politician-friendly example of how those efforts came together, to quash a misinformation campaign before it apparently caused much harm. But the future is troubling and predictable. This latest campaign was more sophisticated than anything that came before it - the use of third parties to buy advertising in the US is a difficult problem for Facebook to tackle without snarling up its ads operation. And to state the obvious, while Facebook was able to detect this specific operation, none of us really know how big this problem is. Shortly after the vote, Facebook's chief Mark Zuckerberg derided suggestions that fake news posted to the platform had influenced the presidential election, saying it was a ""pretty crazy idea"". But he has since apologised for being so dismissive. In September 2017, Facebook acknowledged that Russians had indeed used fake identities to try to influence the US electorate before and after the election, and had posted comments, ads and details about street protests to achieve this. US intelligence agencies have also concluded that Russian state operators used fake social media accounts in an attempt to interfere with the campaign. President Putin has, however, denied that Russia meddled.

"Women are being warned against risky cosmetic ""rejuvenating"" procedures to reshape and tighten the vagina. Experts say the ""therapies"", offered by some private clinics in the UK and the US, pose a serious risk of burns, scarring and recurring pain. Typically during these procedures, a probe is inserted into the vagina to heat or laser the vaginal tissue. Although it is non-surgical and can be done in a lunch hour, it is not necessarily safe, say officials. Laser and energy-based devices have been approved for use in destroying pre-cancerous cells in cervical or vaginal tissue, as well as genital warts, but they have not undergone testing for rejuvenation therapies. US regulator the FDA says it will take action if deceptive marketing of the ""dangerous procedure with no proven benefit"" continues. It says a growing number of manufacturers have been claiming the procedure can treat conditions and symptoms related to menopause, urinary incontinence or sexual function. ""These products have serious risks and don't have adequate evidence to support their use for these purposes. We are deeply concerned women are being harmed,""says the FDA warning,external. Paul Banwell, consultant plastic surgeon and member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, shared the FDA's concerns: ""There has been an exponential rise in the interest in women's health and sexual well-being and whilst this should be encouraged, it is vital that any educational and treatment initiatives are provided in a sensitive manner free of any misleading or marketing hyperbole."" Dr Vanessa Mackay, from the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said: ""There is no evidence to suggest that non-surgical 'vaginal rejuvenation' devices are effective in improving vaginal muscle tone or reshaping vaginal tissue. If women are concerned about the appearance or feel of their vagina, they should speak to a healthcare professional. It is important to remember, however, that every woman's vagina is different. Labia are as individual as women themselves and vary in appearance and colour. ""To strengthen the muscles around the vagina, women are encouraged to try pelvic floor exercises which can help to improve muscle tone and sensitivity during sex."" How to do pelvic floor exercises: Sit or stand comfortably with knees slightly apart and then draw up the pelvic floor muscles as if trying to avoid passing urine It is important not to tighten the stomach, buttock or thigh muscles during the exercises Do 10 slow contractions, holding them for about 10 seconds each The length of time can be increased gradually and the slow contractions can then be followed by a set of quick contractions The whole process should be carried out three or four times a day Tips for a strong pelvic floor Vaginal dryness is a common but treatable problem that many women experience at some point in their lives. It can be caused by a number of things including the menopause, breastfeeding, childbirth, not being aroused before sex and some types of contraception. Women are encouraged to try self-help options before seeing a healthcare professional, including vaginal moisturisers and lubricants. If these aren't effective, a doctor  may prescribe vaginal oestrogen, says the RCOG.

"Thomas Watson was visiting Southend Pier with his partner and daughter on Friday A man put out a fire on the world's longest pleasure pier by urinating on it. Thomas Watson noticed a small fire on the deserted Southend Pier and took matters into his own hands by relieving himself over the flames. The council thanked him for his ""quick-thinking tinkling"" but said it was confident its own sprinkler system would have worked,as The Sun reported,external. Essex Fire Service confirmed it was called but no action was required. Mr Watson, 22, from Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire, was visiting the 1.3 mile (2.1km) pier with his partner and daughter on Friday at about 19:30 BST, when he noticed smoke and small flames on the wooden planks. The weather had turned and ""we were literally the last people there"", he told the BBC. The 1.3 mile (2.1km) structure is the longest pleasure pier in the world Mr Watson said the fire was ""only small on top"", but a lot of smoke was coming from underneath and he ""thought it was all burning under there"". See more stories and videos like this ""I looked at it and the wood was proper charring away, like white with an orange glow. ""Using my initiative I decided to empty my bladder."" Although his partner had called the fire service, Mr Watson had tackled it by the time crews arrived. A section of Southend Pier was gutted by fire in October 2005... ...And left slightly charred in July 2018 A Southend Borough Council spokesman said: ""Whilst we have faith our sprinkler system would have soon sprung into action, we understand the visitor deployed his own sprinkler system to swiftly extinguish the miniature inferno."" He said the family could come back and visit the pier for free, but added: ""[We] kindly ask that he keeps his trousers firmly secured on this occasion.""

"Suppliers of fire doors have been told to make changes after products from five brands failed safety tests following the Grenfell Tower fire. An investigation was launched after it was found thata fire door from Grenfell Tower could only hold back firefor half the time it was meant to. Problems have now been found with doors from other firms, the government said. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has suggested ""there is a broader issue across the fire door market"". He stressed that the risk was low, however. All doors known to have failed to meet safety standards have been withdrawn from the market and local trading standards have been informed, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said. What happened at Grenfell Tower? The teenagers dealing with loss The victims of the fire The Grenfell Tower door, manufactured by Manse Masterdor, failed a 30-minute fire resistance test after about 15 minutes. Doors made by its successor company Masterdor Ltd, as well as those from Specialist Building Products Ltd, trading as Permadoor, Solar Windows Ltd, and Birtley Group Ltd, trading as Bowater by Birtley, have now failed government tests too. Mr Brokenshire said he was ""calling on suppliers to meet this week and provide reassurance that they are gripping this issue properly"". ""I want to see a clear plan of action to rectify existing problems and ensure such failures are not repeated in the future,"" he added. ""Whilst our expert panel assures me the risk remains low, I want to assure the public that the government is doing everything it can to ensure construction products are of the highest safety standards and accurately tested and marketed."" In total, 72 people died as a result of the fire The manufacturers cooperated fully with the government investigations, launched by the MHCLG after the Grenfell fire. In total, 72 people died as a result of the fire in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June 2017. The ministry is now writing to all building control bodies to highlight the need for existing building regulations guidance on new fire door installations to be followed. The major suppliers of fire doors have been asked to make weekly reports on their progress after meeting this week to discuss the issue. Experts say the risk to public safety is low because even when fire doors do not meet the full resistance standards, they provide some protection from the spread of a blaze.

"Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported a loss for the first time in three years after sales slowed in China. The UK's biggest car firm, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, blamed the setback on ""multiple challenges"". This included the impact of what it said was  a ""temporary issue"" from a change in Chinese import duties. China plans to cut import tariffs for cars and parts for most vehicles to 15% from 25% from 1 July. As a result many consumers delayed purchases, JLR said. The tariff change is part of the country's efforts to try to reduce tensions with the US over trade. US carmakers hit by tariffs disputes Harley warns of trade war tariff damage US faces backlash if car tariffs go ahead The firm isn't the only car company affected by the changes to trade policies. Just days agothree US car firms warnedthat their performance had been affected by changes to tariffs. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler, which owns Jeep and Maserati, also slashed its 2018 revenue outlook after sales in China slumped as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. Jaguar Land Rover said the reduction in Chinese trade duties would help boost future sales in China. The group said fears over the UK's departure from the European Union and the backlash against diesel vehicles in the UK and Europe had also hit sales. For the three months to June, Jaguar Land Rover made a Â£264m pre-tax loss, compared to a Â£595m profit last time round. Total sales fell 6.7% year-on-year to Â£5.2bn. Tata Motors' chief financial officer PB Balaji said China's performance was its biggest concern. ""We need to ensure China gets back to the growth rate that it was before the announcement of duty cuts,"" he said. In terms of Brexit, he said the company was ""gearing up for any eventuality that may be there"".

"President Cyril Ramaphosa promised land reform on his election in February South Africa will push ahead with plans to amend the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation, its president says. In a recorded address, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the ruling ANC will ""finalise a proposed amendment"" allowing the move. He said the reform was ""of critical importance"" to the economy. Recent months have seen growing anger about the slow pace of land reform in South Africa. The country's white minority is believed to have a disproportionate hold over land, with a few thousand white commercial farmers possessing the most fertile lands. However, critics fear expropriation could lead to land grabs, as happened in neighbouring Zimbabwe. South Africans' anger over land set to explode Can South Africa avoid doing a Zimbabwe on land? In the video,Mr Ramaphosa said that a ""proper reading"" of the constitution allowed expropriation of land,externalwithout compensation ""in the public interest"". The ANC would go ""through the parliamentary process"" with the amendment. The country passed a law allowing expropriation in 2016. Millions of South Africans depend on agriculture for their livelihoods However, he said it had become ""patently clear"" that the people want the constitution to be ""more explicit"" on the matter. ""This is the constitutional democracy that we fought for,"" the president said. ""We call on all South Africans to work with us on developing a social compact for economic inclusion, economic growth and jobs for all."" Around 10% of land in white ownership has been transferred to black owners since the end of apartheid, which is only a third of the ANC's target.

"This video can not be played Lorenzo Nunez described a ""strong explosion"" moments after take off A passenger plane has crashed in the capital of Mexico's Durango state, just moments after take-off. All 103 passengers and crew on board the AeromÃ©xico flight survived the crash but 97 of them are injured. State Governor JosÃ© Rosas Aispuro said the plane was hit by a gust of wind which caused a sudden descent. Its left wing then touched the ground and two engines broke off. Most of the passengers were able to walk away before it caught fire. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? AeromÃ©xico flight AM2431 was flying from Guadalupe Victoria International Airport in Durango to Mexico City when it crashed at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT). Initial reports spoke of 97 passengers and four crew, but Governor Rosas said that two children were also on board - bringing the total to 103. The plane's pilot is one of two who were seriously injured. He needed an operation on his spine but is reportedly in a stable condition. A young girl sustained burns. Many other passengers had only ""very light"" injuries, officials said. Ramin Parsa told the BBC that ""shortly after the plane took off, I knew something was wrong. The plane began to shake,"" he recalled. He said the plane hit the ground and ""started bouncing, shaking and sliding"" until it hit some trees and finally stopped when it fell into a ditch. ""All the lights went off and then there was smoke inside the cabin, people were panicking and screaming."" Mr Parsa said it was ""a miracle of God that we survived"". The fire spread through the aircraft after the crash Passenger Jacqueline Flores described the moment she and her daughter escaped the plane. ""I think we fell back on the runway because it was a hard surface, then we skidded on the ground until it stopped,"" the 47-year-old told the Agence France Press news agency. ""I undid my seatbelt and saw flames, and realised we had to jump. There was a hole right next to us where the plane had broken up. I told my girl, 'We have to jump over here', and we jumped,"" she added. A local politician on board the flight, RÃ³mulo Campuzano, said he had been ""very lucky because I was able to get out by the main door"". He said the door had been torn off and was lying next to the plane ""acting as a ramp"". ""I walked away from the plane, turning around to see if the other passengers were getting out, too. It started raining very hard and I think that helped put out the flames,"" he said.

"The government ""misled"" the High Court over its decision to refuse unaccompanied child refugees in Calais the right to join their families in the UK, says the Court of Appeal. The ruling,externalrevealed Home Office lawyers gave advice on how to avoid legal challenges by not giving children reasons for their refusal. As a result, over 500 children were rejected and ""many"" are now missing. The Home Office said it had ""noted the criticisms"" and were reviewing them. Striking images of 'Jungle' demolition The desperate children of the Calais Jungle Calais Jungle: Police try to stop new camp forming Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, described the Home Office's actions as a ""shocking denial of children's rights"". The demolition of the ""Jungle"" refugee camp in Calais was ordered in October 2016, when Amber Rudd was Home Secretary. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As a result of the closure, the government conducted over 1,000 interviews with unaccompanied children who claimed to have family in the UK. Around 550 were brought to the country - but over 500 were rejected. Many of them then went missing from the French centres they were living in. The court ruling said the Home Office's process for refusing to transfer the children was ""unfair and unlawful"". It said failures in the system were prejudicial to the children, who had no realistic prospect of challenging the rejections. Lord Justice Singh added that not presenting the evidence - namely emails showing the lawyer's advice - to the High Court hearing was ""a serious breach of the duty of candour and co-operation"". Charity Safe Passage - part of the community organising group Citizens UK - first took the case to the High Court in September to challenge the Home Office and the way it dealt with the unaccompanied child refugees. The court ruled in favour of the government, saying it had acted lawfully in not providing full reasons. It said, despite ""serious shortcomings"" in the processes of assessing the applications, the department was ""justified"" due to the time frame and urgent conditions the UK was working under after the clearance of the camp was announced. But on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal overturned High Court's decision, saying the judge had been given an ""incomplete picture"" by the government and a ""great deal of important evidence"" was not brought to the court's attention. The Calais Jungle had been home to around 8,000 refugees before its demolition in October 2016 The evidence came in the form of emails between the UK Border Force and the French authorities - disclosed in another case being mounted by Citizens UK - detailing the lawyer's advice to not provide reasons for refusal to avoid legal challenges. The emails also showed that French officials wanted the children to be given an adequate explanation - despite the government previously presenting evidence that the authorities only required ""sparse"" detail. Lord Justice Singh said: ""In my judgment, the process which was adopted by the secretary of state in the present context failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness as a matter of common law."" Ms Cooper said : ""Everyone knows the Home Office gets decisions wrong, but these teenagers and children weren't even told the reasons why, so they or their families could challenge basic mistakes. ""The result was many of those teenagers and children disappeared again - very possibly straight back into the arms of smugglers, traffickers and abusers."" Sonal Ghelani of the Islington Law Centre, which worked on the appeal, said it was ""extremely disturbing"" for the Home Office to act in the way it did. Calling for an investigation into the Home Office's actions, she added: ""Public authorities have a duty of candour to provide the court with a full and accurate explanation of all the facts but we now know there was a serious breach of the duty of candour in this case."" Beth Gardiner-Smith, project lead for Safe Passage, added: ""Tragically, many of the children that were refused by the government with no good reason have since gone missing from French authorities' care, and we have little to no information on their whereabouts or wellbeing. ""Today's judgment reveals not only the failure of the Home Office to comply with law but also its abysmal disregard for the safety and welfare of incredibly vulnerable children."" Young migrants watch the camp being demolished in 2016 A Home Office spokesperson said the UK had worked with France to expedite the transfer of vulnerable unaccompanied children from Calais in October 2016 in response to an ""urgent humanitarian situation"" and their priority was to ""provide safe passage for children"". The spokesperson added: ""The court agreed that the process operated by the government was outside of its existing obligations under EU law. ""However, we note the criticisms contained within the wider ruling and are currently reviewing these with our legal team."" A French Senate report from July 2017 found that 709 children removed during the clearances of the camps in Calais had subsequently gone missing from French care shelters.

"More than 10,000 freight vehicles pass through Dover on peak days A giant 13-mile ""lorry park"" on the M20 could last for years if there is a no-deal Brexit, a council has warned. An assessment by Dover council has expressed concern over how ports would cope with the potential situation. The document is critical of the slow pace of work on a ""temporary"" scheme, named Operation Brock, and said ""there does not appear to be a Plan B"". A government spokesman said it was working with ""a range of partners on contingency plans"". Operation Stack is currently used on closed sections of the M20 in Kent, where lorries park while waiting to cross the English Channel when traffic is disrupted. The new strategy, Operation Brock,plans to use a contraflow to keep the roads openwhen problems arise. The Dover council report stated: ""A 13-mile stretch of the coast-bound section of the M20, between junction eight near Maidstone and junction nine near Ashford, will be earmarked to hold heavy goods vehicles, in what will effectively become a giant temporary lorry park holding around 2,000 lorries. ""It is likely a permanent solution will not be in place for many years if enacted through current planning processes and procedures."" Severe traffic problems in the past have seen queues stretch back 30 miles The report, released under a Freedom of Information request, said ""there could be gridlock around the town"" if Brexit ""ends up creating regulatory and tariff barriers between the UK and the EU"". ""Customs checks on imports from outside the common market can take between five minutes to 45 minutes per vehicle,"" it added. ""Port officials have warned that increasing the average time it takes to clear customs by as little as two minutes could lead to 17-mile traffic jams."" A government spokesman said: ""As the prime minister has set out, after Brexit we will not only seek to forge new trade relationships with partners around the world but also maintain frictionless trade in goods between the UK and EU. ""While we remain confident of reaching an agreement with the EU to achieve this, it is only sensible to prepare for a range of scenarios. ""That is why the Department for Transport is working closely with a range of partners on contingency plans to ensure freight can continue to move as freely as possible between the UK and Europe."" The spokesman also insisted that work on Operation Brock would have taken place regardless of Brexit to improve contingency arrangements for a range of scenarios which could result in cross-Channel disruption. Highways England said it recently consulted on a permanent solution and is considering responses. In the meantime, it said Operation Brock would create up to 2,000 on-road lorry holding spaces between junctions 8 and 9 on the M20. It said it would offer ""significant benefit"" compared to Operation Stack, as it would keep traffic flowing in both directions. Deployment of the temporary solution is planned for a maximum duration of up to six months, it added. Conservative MP for Dover Charlie Elphicke tweeted,externalthat the report underlined the case for investment in border infrastructure and roads. He added: ""The government has not done enough to prepare in the two years since the EU referendum."" Barnier rules out UK's customs proposal Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations Kent County Council set out its position on preparations for Brexit earlier this month. It warned that any increased border and customs checks could lead to delays and long queues of port freight traffic. It added: ""We need to avoid the dire consequences experienced in 2015 which impacted on the Kent economy and and more broadly on the national economy."" It said there needed to be a ""robust, workable implementation plan that utilises all available resources"" and urged the government to consider making further resources available. Additional powers in legislation should also be considered, it added, to ensure that all agencies have the necessary authority to take action to ensure the free-flow of traffic. More than 10,000 freight vehicles pass through Dover on peak days as it handles one sixth of the UK's total trade in goods with a value of Â£119bn per year. In 2015, queues of 4,600 lorries stretched back 30 miles andthe daily cost to the UK economy was estimated at Â£250m.

"Women are being warned against risky cosmetic ""rejuvenating"" procedures to reshape and tighten the vagina. Experts say the ""therapies"", offered by some private clinics in the UK and the US, pose a serious risk of burns, scarring and recurring pain. Typically during these procedures, a probe is inserted into the vagina to heat or laser the vaginal tissue. Although it is non-surgical and can be done in a lunch hour, it is not necessarily safe, say officials. Laser and energy-based devices have been approved for use in destroying pre-cancerous cells in cervical or vaginal tissue, as well as genital warts, but they have not undergone testing for rejuvenation therapies. US regulator the FDA says it will take action if deceptive marketing of the ""dangerous procedure with no proven benefit"" continues. It says a growing number of manufacturers have been claiming the procedure can treat conditions and symptoms related to menopause, urinary incontinence or sexual function. ""These products have serious risks and don't have adequate evidence to support their use for these purposes. We are deeply concerned women are being harmed,""says the FDA warning,external. Paul Banwell, consultant plastic surgeon and member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, shared the FDA's concerns: ""There has been an exponential rise in the interest in women's health and sexual well-being and whilst this should be encouraged, it is vital that any educational and treatment initiatives are provided in a sensitive manner free of any misleading or marketing hyperbole."" Dr Vanessa Mackay, from the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said: ""There is no evidence to suggest that non-surgical 'vaginal rejuvenation' devices are effective in improving vaginal muscle tone or reshaping vaginal tissue. If women are concerned about the appearance or feel of their vagina, they should speak to a healthcare professional. It is important to remember, however, that every woman's vagina is different. Labia are as individual as women themselves and vary in appearance and colour. ""To strengthen the muscles around the vagina, women are encouraged to try pelvic floor exercises which can help to improve muscle tone and sensitivity during sex."" How to do pelvic floor exercises: Sit or stand comfortably with knees slightly apart and then draw up the pelvic floor muscles as if trying to avoid passing urine It is important not to tighten the stomach, buttock or thigh muscles during the exercises Do 10 slow contractions, holding them for about 10 seconds each The length of time can be increased gradually and the slow contractions can then be followed by a set of quick contractions The whole process should be carried out three or four times a day Tips for a strong pelvic floor Vaginal dryness is a common but treatable problem that many women experience at some point in their lives. It can be caused by a number of things including the menopause, breastfeeding, childbirth, not being aroused before sex and some types of contraception. Women are encouraged to try self-help options before seeing a healthcare professional, including vaginal moisturisers and lubricants. If these aren't effective, a doctor  may prescribe vaginal oestrogen, says the RCOG.

"Suppliers of fire doors have been told to make changes after products from five brands failed safety tests following the Grenfell Tower fire. An investigation was launched after it was found thata fire door from Grenfell Tower could only hold back firefor half the time it was meant to. Problems have now been found with doors from other firms, the government said. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has suggested ""there is a broader issue across the fire door market"". He stressed that the risk was low, however. All doors known to have failed to meet safety standards have been withdrawn from the market and local trading standards have been informed, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said. What happened at Grenfell Tower? The teenagers dealing with loss The victims of the fire The Grenfell Tower door, manufactured by Manse Masterdor, failed a 30-minute fire resistance test after about 15 minutes. Doors made by its successor company Masterdor Ltd, as well as those from Specialist Building Products Ltd, trading as Permadoor, Solar Windows Ltd, and Birtley Group Ltd, trading as Bowater by Birtley, have now failed government tests too. Mr Brokenshire said he was ""calling on suppliers to meet this week and provide reassurance that they are gripping this issue properly"". ""I want to see a clear plan of action to rectify existing problems and ensure such failures are not repeated in the future,"" he added. ""Whilst our expert panel assures me the risk remains low, I want to assure the public that the government is doing everything it can to ensure construction products are of the highest safety standards and accurately tested and marketed."" In total, 72 people died as a result of the fire The manufacturers cooperated fully with the government investigations, launched by the MHCLG after the Grenfell fire. In total, 72 people died as a result of the fire in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June 2017. The ministry is now writing to all building control bodies to highlight the need for existing building regulations guidance on new fire door installations to be followed. The major suppliers of fire doors have been asked to make weekly reports on their progress after meeting this week to discuss the issue. Experts say the risk to public safety is low because even when fire doors do not meet the full resistance standards, they provide some protection from the spread of a blaze.

"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said. Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase. NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff University's sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference. One student said the help she received turned her life around. Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge. At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course. She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly. ""I wasn't concentrating in meetings, I couldn't focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions."" ""I wasn't turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts."" Clampdown on student binge drinking Excess drinkers 'can lose years of life' Critics bust fraternity culture Thelatest official datasuggest young people are drinking less. However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up. ""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA. ""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and I'm sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group."" Minimum alcohol price law unveiled Stagger drinking time - health chief Sporty people 'likely to drink more' The weekly AA meeting at Cardiff University's student union is for anyone who wants to stop drinking. Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"". Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised."" NUS Wales president, Gwyneth Sweatman said she thought the AA meetings idea was ""absolutely brilliant"", and one which she would ""love"" to see replicated across the UK - similar to the United States, where college campaigns AA meetings are more common.

"One proposed advert showed women shopping for a coffin in what looked like a bridal shop The company behind a set of funeral comparison adverts banned by Transport for London has said it was trying to break the ""taboo"" around death. Proposed adverts from Beyond showed beachgoers running with coffins rather than surfboards - with a pun on ""roasting temperatures"" and cremations. Its co-founder Ian Strang said the campaign was designed to be ""edgy"", but was not cruel or mocking. TfL said it had a ""serious responsibility"" over advertising. It told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme its advertising partner had referred the adverts to the Committee of Advertising Practice, who  advised that the ""original posters proposed by Beyond were likely to cause serious and widespread offence. ""Our partner then worked with the brand to come up with a more acceptable campaign, which is now running on our network,"" it said. Another advert banned by TfL showed beachgoers running with coffins instead of surfboards Mr Strang told the Victoria Derbyshire programme there was ""a long history of edgy campaigns being used to cut through difficult issues. ""It's the same with death - there is a taboo around it."" He said the current lack of conversation on the issue meant companies were able to ""take advantage of [the bereaved] when we're in a weakened state"" through their prices. The high cost of funerals has recently come under scrutiny, withtwo separate reviews having been launched. Mr Strang also questioned Transport for London's decision to ban the proposed advertisements, saying it was not the ""arbiter of morality"". He continued: ""They've got [adverts] on payday loans, gambling... is a little bit of humour around death worse than all those products?"" But funeral director Louise Winter said she was concerned ""for the bereaved families I work with on a daily basis. ""If they were to see this on the Tube they might be quite upset by it,"" she added. She accepted the adverts were entertaining ""providing you're not bereaved"", but said the campaign had not been done in a ""sensitive"" or ""cautious"" manner. ""As a society we need a way to talk about death in a sensitive way that's emotionally intelligent, and I'm not sure these ads are doing that.""

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"". Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised.""

"This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Willsman said and why it matters Labour is facing growing calls to take action against an ally of Jeremy Corbyn after he was recorded criticising members of the Jewish community. During a meeting of the ruling National Executive Committee, Peter Willsman suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks. Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He has apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported. He also said he would be referring himself for equalities training. What's the anti-Semitism row doing to Labour? How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Councillor suspended in anti-Semitism row Jewish newspapers unite against Labour But Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said he should be ""summarily expelled"", and the Jewish Labour Movement called for his suspension and a disciplinary investigation. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused Mr Willsman of being a ""loud-mouthed bully"" and high-profile supporters of Mr Corbyn have also taken to Twitter to urge Mr Willsman to withdraw from the elections to the NEC. He was supported by Labour MP and former frontbencher Chris Williamson who endorsed him for the ruling body vote. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the row had added significance because Mr Willsman had been a ""fellow traveller politically"" of the Labour leader over the years and was a leading ""Corbynite"". The recording,published by the Jewish Chronicle,external, was made at an NEC meeting earlier this month which took place after more than 60 British rabbis signed an open letter that said anti-Semitism in sections of the Labour Party was ""severe and widespread"". This followedcriticism of the party's new code of conducton anti-Semitism, which  critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition.

In the recording, Mr Willsman can be heard discussing the rabbis' open letter with other NEC members. Mr Willsman says he does not want to be ""lectured to by Trump fanatics"", and argues the NEC should ask the rabbis for ""evidence of severe and widespread anti-Semitism"" in the party. He then asks those at the meeting to raise their hands if they had witnessed anti-Semitism in the Labour party - and said he was ""amazed"" when some said they had. Labour said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"". Asked about Mr Willsman's remarks, it said: ""We don't comment on individual cases."" The Jewish Labour Movement also accused the party of ""double standards"" over its decision to pursue disciplinary action against MPs Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin - both critics of Mr Corbyn and the new code of conduct. A Labour source said Mr Willsman's case had been treated ""like any other"", saying he had apologised and that meant the matter had been resolved. How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Jewish newspapers unite against Labour Following the publication of the recording, the NEC member said he had supported ""the decision to confirm the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism and to reopen development of the code in consultation with Jewish community organisations"". He added: ""Not all of what I said has been accurately reported. But I accept that what I did say, and the way I said it, fell short of the requirement, which I accept, for discussions of contentious issues to be conducted in a fully civil and respectful way."" He said he ""deeply"" apologised for any offence caused. Mr Willsman apologised again when speaking at the meeting of Labour's NEC, saying: ""I recognise the offensive nature of my comments.""

"More than 10,000 freight vehicles pass through Dover on peak days A giant 13-mile ""lorry park"" on the M20 could last for years if there is a no-deal Brexit, a council has warned. An assessment by Dover council has expressed concern over how ports would cope with the potential situation. The document is critical of the slow pace of work on a ""temporary"" scheme, named Operation Brock, and said ""there does not appear to be a Plan B"". A government spokesman said it was working with ""a range of partners on contingency plans"". Operation Stack is currently used on closed sections of the M20 in Kent, where lorries park while waiting to cross the English Channel when traffic is disrupted. The new strategy, Operation Brock,plans to use a contraflow to keep the roads openwhen problems arise. The Dover council report stated: ""A 13-mile stretch of the coast-bound section of the M20, between junction eight near Maidstone and junction nine near Ashford, will be earmarked to hold heavy goods vehicles, in what will effectively become a giant temporary lorry park holding around 2,000 lorries. ""It is likely a permanent solution will not be in place for many years if enacted through current planning processes and procedures."" Severe traffic problems in the past have seen queues stretch back 30 miles The report, released under a Freedom of Information request, said ""there could be gridlock around the town"" if Brexit ""ends up creating regulatory and tariff barriers between the UK and the EU"". ""Customs checks on imports from outside the common market can take between five minutes to 45 minutes per vehicle,"" it added. ""Port officials have warned that increasing the average time it takes to clear customs by as little as two minutes could lead to 17-mile traffic jams."" A government spokesman said: ""As the prime minister has set out, after Brexit we will not only seek to forge new trade relationships with partners around the world but also maintain frictionless trade in goods between the UK and EU. ""While we remain confident of reaching an agreement with the EU to achieve this, it is only sensible to prepare for a range of scenarios. ""That is why the Department for Transport is working closely with a range of partners on contingency plans to ensure freight can continue to move as freely as possible between the UK and Europe."" The spokesman also insisted that work on Operation Brock would have taken place regardless of Brexit to improve contingency arrangements for a range of scenarios which could result in cross-Channel disruption. Highways England said it recently consulted on a permanent solution and is considering responses. In the meantime, it said Operation Brock would create up to 2,000 on-road lorry holding spaces between junctions 8 and 9 on the M20. It said it would offer ""significant benefit"" compared to Operation Stack, as it would keep traffic flowing in both directions. Deployment of the temporary solution is planned for a maximum duration of up to six months, it added. Conservative MP for Dover Charlie Elphicke tweeted,externalthat the report underlined the case for investment in border infrastructure and roads. He added: ""The government has not done enough to prepare in the two years since the EU referendum."" Barnier rules out UK's customs proposal Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations Kent County Council set out its position on preparations for Brexit earlier this month. It warned that any increased border and customs checks could lead to delays and long queues of port freight traffic. It added: ""We need to avoid the dire consequences experienced in 2015 which impacted on the Kent economy and and more broadly on the national economy."" It said there needed to be a ""robust, workable implementation plan that utilises all available resources"" and urged the government to consider making further resources available. Additional powers in legislation should also be considered, it added, to ensure that all agencies have the necessary authority to take action to ensure the free-flow of traffic. More than 10,000 freight vehicles pass through Dover on peak days as it handles one sixth of the UK's total trade in goods with a value of Â£119bn per year. In 2015, queues of 4,600 lorries stretched back 30 miles andthe daily cost to the UK economy was estimated at Â£250m.

"Crystle Galloway died five days after her mother drove her to hospital Four US paramedics accused of racially profiling and failing to provide medical care to a dying woman face a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday. Crystle Galloway's mother says medics assumed the Tampa, Florida, family could not afford the ambulance cost. The 30-year-old's mother drove her to hospital instead. Ms Galloway slipped in to a coma after suffering a presumed stroke, and died five days later. Hillsborough County officials have already accepted responsibility. The incident occurred early on the morning of 4 July this year, days after Ms Galloway had given birth by Caesarean section. Her mother, Nicole Black, called 911 after finding her daughter slumped in the bath, drooling from swollen lips. The ambulance crew arrived at Ms Galloway's third-floor apartment, and carried her downstairs. Ms Black told US media. ""They kept asking her over and over, 'Do you want to go to the hospital? Do you want to go to the hospital?' She kept begging and telling them yes."" This video can not be played When Uber drivers replace ambulances But instead of the ambulance, Ms Black said they placed her daughter in her car. ""They never took blood pressure,"" said Mrs Black. ""They never took her temperature. They never checked any of her vitals. ""They were too busy or too caught up in convincing us that she couldn't afford it. ""There was reference to, 'Didn't you just have a newborn baby? Do you really want to spend $600 to go three blocks?' ""'Oh, have you been drinking? Were you guys celebrating Fourth of July? Is that why your head hurts?'"" Ms Black said the medics spent 12 minutes urging her to drive her daughter to hospital herself, as Ms Galloway lay on the ground ""in the foetal position"". Amazon reveals plan to enter healthcare Reality Check: Does UK spend half as much on health as US? Ambulance transport in the US, where many citizens lack healthcare coverage, can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. According to a GoFundMe page, she leaves behind two children, including a five-day-old baby. Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill acknowledged in a press conference on Monday that ""we did in fact fail to provide good care to this woman"". ""My guys did a lot of things wrong here and we take responsibility,"" he said, acknowledging that the medics had failed to even check the woman's vital signs. He added that medics also falsified a report to claim they were unable to locate the patient. ""If it's a culture of racism,"" he added, ""that's something that needs to be fixed or for the sake of good care for our community."" The four staff, Lt John ""Mike"" Morris, 36, Fire Medic Justin Sweeney, 36, Fire Medic Andrew Martin, 28, and Acting Lt Courtney Barton, 38, are on paid administrative leave.

"Lenders will write to thousands of ""mortgage prisoners"" currently paying high interest rates with a potential offer to move to a better deal. The letters, which will arrive by the end of the year, will outline some of the alternative mortgage deals available from their existing lender. Up to 10,000 homeowners are trapped in their current deal paying high rates. Most of these homeowners took out mortgages before new, stricter rules on affordability were introduced in 2014. An interim report into the mortgage market,external, published in May by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), highlighted the plight of these borrowers. These ""mortgage prisoners"" were unable to move to a better deal when their existing mortgages switched to the more expensive standard variable rate, even if they could meet the payments. This was the result of stricter affordability checks or changing circumstances after the original deal was agreed. The FCA said it had identified about 150,000 such customers. Of these, about 30,000 were with authorised mortgage lenders, while about 120,000 had mortgages held by non-regulated firms - which include some previous Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley customers. Mortgage misery: The homeowners facing repossession People much less likely to move home than in 1970s Properties taking longer to sell in sluggish market Some 10,000 of them are with lenders who are still actively operating in the mortgage market. It is some of the people in this group that are designed to be helped by a commitment among 59 lenders to help them to find better deals. The rules set by the regulator mean they will still, in effect, be blocked from searching the whole of the mortgage market for a cheaper fixed-rate deal. However, assuming they are currently keeping up with repayments, the commitment - organised by trade body UK Finance - means they will receive a letter from their existing lender outlining what similar, but cheaper, deals are available. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said: ""Lenders have responded to the FCA's challenge and made a voluntary commitment to help these longstanding customers."" However, given that lenders can be - and have been - writing to some customers already, UK Finance is likely to face accusations that it is doing the bare minimum in response to the FCA call for an industry response to the issue. One big name currently missing from the commitment is TSB, which has been struggling with the fallout from its chaotic IT switchover in recent months. A TSB spokesperson said: ""We are fully supportive of the UK Finance initiative and we are working with them to completely understand how this project will work.  We are hoping to join the scheme over the coming weeks."" In its report, the FCA also said a ""significant minority"" - about 30% - of general mortgage customers failed to find the cheapest mortgage. It wants to make it easier for borrowers to see what mortgage products they can qualify for earlier on in the application process, and to assess and compare these products. However, UK Finance has yet to offer any solutions to this issue, arguing that further investigation is needed. It believes that new technology should be given time to aid price comparisons, before any regulatory intervention. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

"One proposed advert showed women shopping for a coffin in what looked like a bridal shop The company behind a set of funeral comparison adverts banned by Transport for London has said it was trying to break the ""taboo"" around death. Proposed adverts from Beyond showed beachgoers running with coffins rather than surfboards - with a pun on ""roasting temperatures"" and cremations. Its co-founder Ian Strang said the campaign was designed to be ""edgy"", but was not cruel or mocking. TfL said it had a ""serious responsibility"" over advertising. It told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme its advertising partner had referred the adverts to the Committee of Advertising Practice, who  advised that the ""original posters proposed by Beyond were likely to cause serious and widespread offence. ""Our partner then worked with the brand to come up with a more acceptable campaign, which is now running on our network,"" it said. Another advert banned by TfL showed beachgoers running with coffins instead of surfboards Mr Strang told the Victoria Derbyshire programme there was ""a long history of edgy campaigns being used to cut through difficult issues. ""It's the same with death - there is a taboo around it."" He said the current lack of conversation on the issue meant companies were able to ""take advantage of [the bereaved] when we're in a weakened state"" through their prices. The high cost of funerals has recently come under scrutiny, withtwo separate reviews having been launched. Mr Strang also questioned Transport for London's decision to ban the proposed advertisements, saying it was not the ""arbiter of morality"". He continued: ""They've got [adverts] on payday loans, gambling... is a little bit of humour around death worse than all those products?"" But funeral director Louise Winter said she was concerned ""for the bereaved families I work with on a daily basis. ""If they were to see this on the Tube they might be quite upset by it,"" she added. She accepted the adverts were entertaining ""providing you're not bereaved"", but said the campaign had not been done in a ""sensitive"" or ""cautious"" manner. ""As a society we need a way to talk about death in a sensitive way that's emotionally intelligent, and I'm not sure these ads are doing that.""

"Allegations surfaced about abuse in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 The aid sector is guilty of ""complacency verging on complicity"" over an ""endemic"" sex abuse scandal, a damning report from MPs has said. Stephen Twigg, chairman of the international development committee, said charities were ""more concerned to protect their own reputation"". The committee's inquiry was launched in light of revelations thatsenior Oxfam staff paid survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake for sex,external. Charities welcomedthe MPs' report,external. Oxfam Trustees chairwoman Caroline Thomson said the committee had been right to challenge the charity sector and recognised ""we have further to go"". The Oxfam scandal, revealed in February in The Times, led to further allegations about UK-based charities. The report, which looked at allegations dating back to 2001, says the delivery of aid to people had been subverted by sexual predators. The committee said in their report: ""Having understood the length of time that the sector has been aware of these issues, we reflect with confusion on the apparent shock of those we spoke to in the immediate aftermath of the Times report. This has been a known problem in the international aid sector for years."" Oxfam worked in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake (file picture) ""So much more"" could have been done to tackle the ""open secret"" of people working in the aid sector committing such acts, the MPs added. Despite the charities knowing about the problem, the committee said there had been a ""collective failure of leadership"", with action only when there was a crisis. The report also said leaders were ""self-deluded"" in thinking they had addressed problems before they became public. MPs insisted more resources were needed to tackle the issue - and said victims had to be at the ""heart of solutions"", or the response could be ""harmful"". Mr Twigg suggested something akin to DBS checks, the criminal records check system used in the UK, could be adopted internationally, to provide details of past allegations to prospective employers. ""That won't cure this but it's one of the ways in which we can try to ensure this won't happen again,"" he said. The MPs also recommended an independent aid ombudsman should be introduced and have called for a global register of aid workers, who will operate according to expected standards. This video can not be played MPs are suggesting DBS-style checks for aid workers in a report into sexual abuse The committee also suggested: Ensuring the beneficiaries of humanitarian aid have knowledge of and confidence in their rights A zero-tolerance culture on sexual exploitation and abuse is the least that victims should expect Reports of wrongdoing should be proactively sought and responded to robustly, with feedback to victims and survivors Known perpetrators of sexual exploitation and abuse should be identified through improved reporting and accountability, and prevented from moving into new positions This video can not be played What's gone wrong with the foreign aid sector? The report looked at allegations of sex abuse and child abuse by aid workers, dating back to 2001. They found sexual assault and exploitation was ""predominately perpetrated against women and girls"" and mainly carried out by men. A 2008 Save the Children report into the under-reporting of child sexual exploitation and abuse, seen by the MPs, said the abusers were ""both foreign and national staff"", with the majority being ""local people employed by international humanitarian organisations"". A 2002 UNHCR and Save the Children report, which looked at refugee camps in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, found that humanitarian workers extorted ""sex in exchange for desperately needed aid supplies (biscuits, soap, medicines, plastic sheeting etc)"". The victims were mainly girls aged 13 to 18, who reported consequences including ""pregnancies, abortions, teenage motherhood, [and] exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS"". The committee found that a recurring theme was ""abuse of power"". ""No corner of the aid sector appears to be immune,"" their report said. ""The problem is a collective one."" Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, apologised to ""vulnerable women"" in Haiti Oxfam trustees chairwoman Caroline Thomson said the report made for ""painful reading"" for the whole aid sector, and apologised that Oxfam had failed to protect vulnerable women in Haiti. She said the charity had tripled funding for safeguarding, established an independent whistleblowing phone line and agreed to publish the details of safeguarding cases twice a year. Save the Children UK said it was strengthening its internal safeguarding systems and had called for greater government oversight. Chief executive Kevin Watkins said: ""We have made mistakes in our own handling of historical sexual harassment complaints from staff in the UK,"" adding, ""there is a great deal more to do"". International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt welcomed the report, saying: ""Until the sector is fully prepared to address the power imbalance, cultures, and behaviours that allow sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment to happen, we will never stamp it out."" An international summit on the issue is due to take place in October, and Ms Mordaunt has called for the sector to demonstrate the progress they have made by then. 22 aid organisations apologise after scandal How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam?

"Accusations Oxfam concealed findings its staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011 have led members of the public to admit they are now doubtful about donating to any charity. The British organisation's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence has resigned in the wake of the revelations but further action is required to restore the faith of donors. ""Absolutely - to any charity,"" says IT security analyst Anil, 40, when asked if he has been put off donating. ""I feel bad saying that but I don't feel confident in what goes on behind the scenes. ""I know the majority of people who work there are very good at what they do but the management is shocking. That [recent allegations] is shocking."" The extent of the damage to public faith and donations is yet to be felt but for retail professional James, 52, the claims only add to his frustrations with the third sector. ""My wife has said she definitely will not give money to Oxfam now,"" he says. ""This has dented public opinion in a very detrimental way."" He adds: ""I think there are some issues with charities anyway. I have a bit of a problem, for example, with how much they pay their chief executives. ""I'm concerned about how much of the money I actually give makes it to the causes."" This video can not be played Michelle Russell, from Charity Commission, says the regulator is ""very angry"" ""It's an upsetting case,"" Daniel Fluskey, from the Institute of Fundraising, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""This will have an impact on public trust and confidence in Oxfam. ""I know they've taken a number of steps to get in touch with all of their supporters to tell them what they've done and that's going to have to continue."" Reality Check: How much money goes to Oxfam? Oxfam to meet government after Haiti claims Oxfam did not give watchdog 'full details' Last year, Oxfam had a total income of Â£409m - of which Â£176m came from the UK government and other public authorities. Of the rest, Â£108m came from donations and legacies and Â£91m from sales in its shops. Other international aid organisations have been quick to distance themselves from the story. The British Red Cross has reassured its supporters it has ""a zero tolerance policy to any form of sexual harassment and misconduct"". It said there had been ""no dismissals... for reasons relating to sexual harassment, abuse or paedophilia in at least the past five years"". For some members of the public, Oxfam's mistakes reflect badly on it alone. Account manager Laura, 39, insists the accusations would have no impact on her decision to donate to other organisations. ""No, not at all,"" she says. ""Definitely not."" ""I only really select a few charities to donate to and Oxfam isn't one of them,"" she adds. ""If it was a different charity then yes it would [affect my decision to donate to them]."" Aid organisations must now be seen to be making real strides to improve transparency as they bid restore the public's faith. ""I think all charities now need to subscribe to some sort of governance and compliance and it needs to be available to the public whenever they want to see it,"" Anil adds. ""Who gets what, what bonuses are there, where is the money allocated to? ""There should be internal auditing by an external company to see exactly where the money is going and what it is being spent on."" This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt: 'They did absolutely the wrong thing' The concern for many in the sector now is about the long-term effects of the story, and experts are warning against complacency. Conservative MP Paul Scully, who sits on the International Development Committee, said the scandal could have wider implications for international aid. ""The long term concern about this is the risk of people not wanting to donate to charities that do amazing work across the world and also to those people that it becomes another argument about why not to spend money on international development. ""There is a disincentive in the system [for charities to be more transparent] because charities are competing against one another for donations and so that means there is the fear that if something tarnishes their reputation it may affect their donations."" Mr Fluskey said charities need to think about public trust and confidence ""in all areas"" of their work. He said organisations need to make sure they are ""open and transparent"" and ""working to the right values"". ""We know that people care about causes and that they do want to give support to charities - we can't take that for granted, but we believe the British public will continue to support charities where they see them working according to the high standards they expect.""

"The scandal has rocked the charity, which has apologised and promised to 'atone for the past' Oxfam, one of the UK's biggest charities, has dominated the headlines in recent weeks following allegations its staff hired prostitutes while working overseas. Since then, the story has continued to develop, with the Charity Commission launching a statutory inquiry - the most serious action it can take. Oxfam - which has nearly 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - denies any cover-up. Here is a summary of the events so far: The Times newspaper publishes a front page article under the headline: ""Top Oxfam staff paid Haiti survivors for sex"". The article alleges thatOxfam covered up claims that senior staff working in Haitiin the wake of the 2010 earthquake used prostitutes, some of whom may have been underage. The Times broke the story on its front page Among the male staff accused of sexual misconduct is Oxfam's then-director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. He is alleged to have used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by the charity. In a statement,Oxfam denies claims of a cover-up,external. It says the behaviour of its staff was ""totally unacceptable"". The charity says it uncovered the accusations in 2011 and immediately launched an internal investigation. According to Oxfam's own 2011 report, four members of staff were dismissed and three, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation. It says claims of underage girls being involved were unproven. Roland Van Hauwermeiren, who denies paying for sex Oxfam adds thatit had publicly announced the investigation at the time. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock orders Oxfam to hand over all the evidence to the Charity Commission. The Charity Commissionsays it was not given full details,externalabout the use of prostitutes by aid workers. It says it would have acted differently if it had known all the facts. In a fresh story, the Times says Oxfam did not warn other aid agencies about problem staff caught using prostitutes. It emerges that Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the aid sector. Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, says the charity did ""anything but"" cover up the incident. But he admits the 2011 report released by the charity did not give details of the revelations, and only referred to them as ""serious misconduct"". Oxfam GB's chief executive Mark Goldring and chair of trustees Caroline Thomson leave the Department for International Development Oxfamis hit with further allegations that staff on its mission to Chad,,externalalso led by Mr Van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes in 2006. The Sunday Timesalso reports new claims,externalalleging more than 120 workers from UK charities were accused of sexual abuse in the past year. Meanwhile, Oxfamannounces new measures,externalfor the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, says staff members had been coming forward with ""concerns about how staff were recruited and vetted"" following the recent media reports. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt warns that ministers could cut off funding for Oxfam if it cannot account for the way it handled claims. Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrenceresigns over the handling of the sex scandal. She says she is ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. Penny Lawrence, who resigned as deputy chief executive of the charity, said concerns were raised about staff behaviour in Chad and Haiti The Charity Commission, which regulates the industry,opens a statutory inquiry into Oxfam,external- the most serious action it can take. The watchdog says it has concerns that Oxfam ""may not have fully and frankly disclosed"" everything it knew about the claims. The European Commission, which gave â¬1.7m to Oxfam's Haiti programme in 2011, threatens it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". Thepresident of Haiti, Jovenel MoÃ¯se, condemns Oxfam,externaland says the actions were an ""extremely serious violation of human dignity"". A senior government source in Haiticonfirms an investigation will be launchedinto foreign aid agencies operating there. President Jovenel Moise condemned ""sexual predator"" staff exploiting ""needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability"" Actress Minnie Driverbecomes the first famous face to cut ties with Oxfam. In a statement Ms Driver, who stepped down from her role as a celebrity ambassador for the charity, said she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Allow Twitter content?

The Charity Commissionsays it is looking into these reports. Oxfam confirms that more than 1,200 peoplecancelled their direct debit payments to the charityon the Saturday, Sunday and Monday after the first reports of the scandal emerged. The former Oxfam director at the centre of the accusations, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, 68,denies paying for sex but admits some ""mistakes"". Inan open letter to Belgian media in Dutch,external, he denies that a reception he hosted was, as alleged by the Times, a sex party. Archbishop Desmond Tutu steps down from his role as ambassador for Oxfam. Oxfamannounces it is setting up an independent commission,externalof leading women's rights experts to carry out a review of working culture and practices. It will also create a global database of referees to stop dishonest or unreliable references and triple its safeguarding budget. The charity's international executive director Winnie Byanyimapromises the charity would ""do justice"" and ""atone for the past"".She is the most senior Oxfam executive to speak on the issue. Oxfamagrees to stop bidding for UK government fundinguntil it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt says the charity has ""a long way to go"" before regaining public trust. Meanwhile, chief executive for Oxfam GB, Mark Goldring,tells the Guardian he believes attacks on the charityare ""out of proportion to the level of culpability"". Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in the Guardian. The ad was paid for by supporters rather than the charity Meanwhile, another charity - MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) -comes under scrutiny as the president of Haiticalls for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country. Jovenel MoÃ¯se, asks why MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members. MSF said it takes seriously any reports of misconduct. In a separate story relating to alleged sexual misconduct in the charity sector, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox,Brendan Cox, quits two charities set up in her memory. Mr Cox denies assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 but admits ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. Oxfam publishes a redacted version of its 2011 internal report into alleged abuse by staff.,externalIt will present the original report to the government in Haiti. Thereport reveals that three of the men accused of sexual misconductphysically threatened witnesses during the charity's 2011 investigation. Oxfam boss Mark Goldring and two other senior executivesare hauled in front of MPs. The International Development Committee hears that around 7,000 people have cancelled donations to the charity. Mr Goldring apologises for the damage done and says 26 claims of sexual misconduct have been made since the scandal broke. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' Save the Children chief executive Kevin Watkins also gives evidence and says his charity investigated 53 allegations in 2016. He says the Oxfam scandal has been a ""wake up call"" for the sector. Meanwhile, a former chief executive of Save the Children, Justin Forsyth,makes headlines over three claims of inappropriate behaviourhe received before leaving the charity.

"A British ex-soldier accused of attending training camps run by militia fighting the Islamic State group has had the case against him dropped. James Matthews, 43, from Dalston, east London, pleaded not guilty to a terror offence for receiving training in Iraq and Syria on or before February 2016. He had been due to face trial at the Old Bailey later this year. But prosecutors said there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction and offered no evidence. Joel Bennathan QC, defending, said Mr Matthews was ""happy"" at the decision but was entitled to a ""full and proper explanation of what has happened here"". ""We have always said the decision to prosecute Mr Matthews for fighting with the YPG [Kurdish militia forces] against Isis was extraordinary and totally unjustified,"" he said. ""Mr Matthews was always open about what he had done and it is baffling that the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) took two years to decide to prosecute him, then seven months later they have suddenly realised there is not enough evidence to do so."" It is believed to be the first time terror legislation has been deployed to seek the conviction of someone who was assisting a group, who are also being assisted by the UK government. Prosecutor Tom Little QC defended the decision to bring the charge and said the review was based on further evidence ""specific"" to the case. In a statement Mr Matthews accused the British government of making a politically calculated decision to charge him. He asked whether relations with Turkey - which deems the YPG to be a terrorist group - was the real reason he was prosecuted and he demanded an explanation. It is estimated that since 2015 dozens of Britons have fought against IS with the Kurds in Iraq and Syria.

"Prime Minister Theresa May is to hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, Downing Street says. Mrs May has been invited to Mr Macron's holiday retreat in the south of France. It comes as the UK government steps up its engagement with counterparts in the EU over Brexit. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told theEvening Standard,externalFrance and Germany had to ""send a strong signal"" to the European Commission on the need for a ""pragmatic and sensible outcome"". Prime ministers and their holiday snaps And he warned that the likelihood of no deal being reached were ""increasing by the day"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree on how their future relationship will work. Key differences between the UK and the EU remain, more than a year after negotiations started. This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? Government ministers say they want to reach a deal with the EU covering issues like trade and border checks, but are also making contingency plans to prepare for leaving with no agreement in place. Last week the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected a key part of Mrs May's proposals, which would involve the UK collecting customs duties on its behalf. More concerns have been raised in the UK about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. An assessment by Dover Council saida giant 13-mile ""lorry park"", proposed for the M20, could be in place for yearsas ports try to cope with the situation. It said ""there does not appear to be a Plan B"" if it does not work, and it could lead to ""17-mile traffic jams"". Kent County Council has also warned that any increased border and customs checks could lead to delays and long queues of port freight traffic. Mr Hunt, who is holding talks with his French and Austrian opposite numbers, warned of economic consequences for both the UK and the EU if a deal can't be found. ""The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. ""That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,"" he said. ""There is a real chance of no deal by accident."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt gaffe: 'My wife is Japanese' Mr Hunt's talks in France came on the back of a visit to China where he made headlines for a different reason - getting his wife's nationality wrong. On Monday, the foreign secretary mistakenly told his hosts his Chinese wife was Japanese before correcting himself and admitting he had made a ""terrible mistake"". He has since tweeted his apologies to his ""long-suffering"" wife - and he used his trip to France to make amends, choosing her some flowers in Paris: Allow Twitter content?

"Dani and Jack are the only couple to have stayed together since the first episode A record-breaking 3.6 million people watched Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham win the final of this year's Love Island. More viewers were watching the show on ITV2 than were watching BBC One, BBC Two or ITV in the same time slot. The pair originally ""coupled up"" on the first episode eight weeks ago and walked away with the Â£50,000 prize. Dani Dyer - daughter of actor Danny Dyer - and pen salesman Jack Fincham have remained together ever since, becoming a firm favourite with viewers. So much so, in fact, that the final saw ITV2 reach its biggest ever overnight audience. An average of 2.6 million watched last year's final, which saw Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies triumph. How will the Love Island contestants cash in? Derry cinema packed out for Love Island Dani and Jack held off competition from Laura and Paul (who came second), Kaz and Josh (who came third), and Megan and Wes. ""It's been an amazing experience, I feel so lucky and grateful, it's honestly been amazing,"" Dani told presenter Caroline Flack. ""Everything's been a highlight for me... the ups and downs, you take the good with the bad in here."" After Dani and Jack were announced as the winners, Jack was given the choice of keeping the prize money for himself, or sharing it with Dani. He opted for the latter - meaning the couple will share the Â£50,000. Jack said the moment he realised he was in love with Dani was when the male and female contestants were separated, with the boys being taken off to an alternative villa. ""When I was at Casa Amor I was so down, I was like 'I'm meant to be enjoying this', but I was just having a [rubbish] time,"" Jack said. ""When I was there, I didn't realise how much I'd miss her, and I just thought, you know what, I love her."" Your Love Island questions answered 'I wish I'd never gone on reality TV' Asked what would be their biggest challenge after leaving the villa, Jack joked: ""Living with her."" The pair confirmed they now plan to start house hunting together. Dani and Jack were the bookies' favourite to win. They had one or two hiccups along the way - including the recent lie detector task. But asked whether they now completely trust each other, Jack said: ""One hundred million percent."" The islanders were seen taking part in a salsa dancing class in the final episode of the series The final episode saw the remaining contestants prepare for the Love Island summer ball - which involved a crash course in salsa dancing. The female contestants then went dress shopping ahead of the islanders' final night in the villa. Later that evening, the couples were seen reflecting on their journeys in the villa before making declarations of love. Dani and Laura were seen going dress shopping with the other female contestants The four remaining couples then came together (suitably attired) to make their declarations of love ""Jack, when I first entered the villa eight weeks ago, I never imagined that in a million years I would have met someone as special as you.

"Dani and Jack are the only couple to have stayed together since the first episode A record-breaking 3.6 million people watched Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham win the final of this year's Love Island. More viewers were watching the show on ITV2 than were watching BBC One, BBC Two or ITV in the same time slot. The pair originally ""coupled up"" on the first episode eight weeks ago and walked away with the Â£50,000 prize. Dani Dyer - daughter of actor Danny Dyer - and pen salesman Jack Fincham have remained together ever since, becoming a firm favourite with viewers. So much so, in fact, that the final saw ITV2 reach its biggest ever overnight audience. An average of 2.6 million watched last year's final, which saw Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies triumph. How will the Love Island contestants cash in? Derry cinema packed out for Love Island Dani and Jack held off competition from Laura and Paul (who came second), Kaz and Josh (who came third), and Megan and Wes. ""It's been an amazing experience, I feel so lucky and grateful, it's honestly been amazing,"" Dani told presenter Caroline Flack. ""Everything's been a highlight for me... the ups and downs, you take the good with the bad in here."" After Dani and Jack were announced as the winners, Jack was given the choice of keeping the prize money for himself, or sharing it with Dani. He opted for the latter - meaning the couple will share the Â£50,000. Jack said the moment he realised he was in love with Dani was when the male and female contestants were separated, with the boys being taken off to an alternative villa. ""When I was at Casa Amor I was so down, I was like 'I'm meant to be enjoying this', but I was just having a [rubbish] time,"" Jack said. ""When I was there, I didn't realise how much I'd miss her, and I just thought, you know what, I love her."" Your Love Island questions answered 'I wish I'd never gone on reality TV' Asked what would be their biggest challenge after leaving the villa, Jack joked: ""Living with her."" The pair confirmed they now plan to start house hunting together. Dani and Jack were the bookies' favourite to win. They had one or two hiccups along the way - including the recent lie detector task. But asked whether they now completely trust each other, Jack said: ""One hundred million percent."" The islanders were seen taking part in a salsa dancing class in the final episode of the series The final episode saw the remaining contestants prepare for the Love Island summer ball - which involved a crash course in salsa dancing. The female contestants then went dress shopping ahead of the islanders' final night in the villa. Later that evening, the couples were seen reflecting on their journeys in the villa before making declarations of love. Dani and Laura were seen going dress shopping with the other female contestants The four remaining couples then came together (suitably attired) to make their declarations of love ""Jack, when I first entered the villa eight weeks ago, I never imagined that in a million years I would have met someone as special as you. ""From our first date together on the beach, to our trip in a hot air balloon, we have already made so many special memories, and I can't wait for even more. ""I have had the summer of my life in here and I owe so much of that to you, Jack."" ""You are everything that I've ever wanted in a girl.

"While there were heavy downpours in the summer of 2017, average temperatures were high 2017 was the fifth warmest year in the UK climate record that stretches back to 1910 according to a new analysis from the Met Office. Their State of the Climate Report says that nine of the ten warmest years on record for the UK have occurred since 2002. The study says that 2017 was more than 1 degree C above the 1961-1990 baseline temperature. Summer rainfall has also increased significantly over the last ten years. Compared to the sun kissed scorcher of a summer that the UK has generally been experiencing this year, 2017 was a rather soggy year with above average rainfall from June through August. Despite the rain, temperatures from February to June were also above average - and the number of days with air frosts was 45, which is nine below average. The overall mean temperature for the 2017 was 9.6 degrees C, which made it the fifth warmest in the UK series dating from 1910, and the eight warmest in the Central England temperature series which dates back to 1659. The authors say if you look at the trend over a decade or more, it is further evidence that the climate is changing both globally and here in the UK. 2017 also had the warmest June day in 40 years ""We do have a very strong evidence that we have observed warming of the UK over recent decades,"" Dr Mark McCarthy, manager of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""So the most recent decade, if we take the period 2008 to 2017 is just under a degree warmer than our standard 1961-1990 baseline reference period."" Most of the UK's hottest years on record have taken place over the past 16 years apart from 1990 with 2014 being the warmest. If you look at the Central England temperature series, it shows that the years since 2001 have been warmer than the previous three centuries. One aspect highlighted by the report has been the fact that over the past decade UK summers have been notably wetter - with a 20% increase in rainfall compared to 1961-1990. The researchers say that this may be due to variability in the summer North Atlantic Oscillation. This weather phenomenon sees differences in pressure influence the path of the jet stream, which in turn can impact the amount of rain that falls in the UK in summer. However that trend has been broken this year as recent months have been extremely dry and warm, with Maybreaking records for heat and sunshine.

"North Korea appears to be building new ballistic missiles despite recent warming ties with the Trump administration and pledges to denuclearise, reports say. Unnamed US officials told the Washington Post that spy satellites had spotted continuing activity,externalat a site that has produced ballistic missiles. Reuters quotes an official as saying it is unclear how far the work has gone. Donald Trump met North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. After the first meeting between sitting leaders from the two countries, the two men pledged to work towards denuclearisation. Mr Trump later said North Korea was ""no longer a nuclear threat"". But Mr Trump was criticised at home for making concessions without securing any firm commitment from Mr Kim to end the nuclear and missile programmes. Trump-Kim summit: Why did they meet? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? These are not the first reports that North Korea may be continuing its weapons programme, casting doubt on the real impact of the summit in Singapore. This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? On Monday, the Washington Post newspaper quoted officials as saying North Korea appeared to be building one or two new liquid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at the Sanumdong facility near the capital, Pyongyang. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Deciphering what happened in Singapore The factory is known to have produced the Hwasong-15, the first North Korean ICBM capable of reaching the US. However, a US official told news agency Reuters that a liquid-fuelled ICBM didn't ""pose nearly the threat that a solid-fuelled one would because they take so long to fuel"". Reuters also added that satellite imaging showed vehicles moving in and out of the facility, but not the extent of any missile construction. Satellite imagery of the Sanumdong facility shows that the site is ""active"", Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) told the Washington Post. ""[The facility] is not dead, by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Mr Lewis. ""We see shipping containers and vehicles coming and going. This is a facility where they build ICBMs and space-launch vehicles."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another North Korean expert from MIIS, Melissa Hanham, told the BBC that the facility had ""regular traffic in and out of the building"", adding that this ""traffic pattern"" on the site stayed ""about the same through the Panmunjom and Singapore meetings"". This indicated that there had not been a complete stop in activity during the summit talks. She also noted that large ""brightly coloured containers"" also showed up in satellite imagery, saying that ""containers similar to these have appeared during previous ICBM inspections by Mr Kim."" Ms Hanham added that while that experts at MIIS could not ""find a way to confirm the [intelligence] leak"", the information has matched evidence from satellite imagery. North Korea has carried out a total of six nuclear tests, the most recent of which took place in September last year. It has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear programme. But at their landmark meeting in Singapore, Mr Trump and Mr Kim agreed to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". The pair signed a document pledging they would work towards new relations It's been unclear what both sides mean by ""complete denuclearisation"", and no further details have been released about when or how Pyongyang would renounce its nuclear weapons nor how the process would be verified. Experts have also cast doubt on whether Pyongyang has been genuine in its apparent commitment to ""denuclearise"". What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? Last week, it appeared North Korea had begun dismantling part of a key rocket launch site, but according to recent reports based on US intelligence leaks, Pyongyang might still secretly be continuing its nuclear weapons programme. Reports had indicated that North Korea was upgrading its only official nuclear enrichment site, and was stepping up enrichment at other secret sites. Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was forced to admit that North Korea was continuing to produce nuclear fissile material, though he insisted that ""progress is happening"".

"Lenders will write to thousands of ""mortgage prisoners"" currently paying high interest rates with a potential offer to move to a better deal. The letters, which will arrive by the end of the year, will outline some of the alternative mortgage deals available from their existing lender. Up to 10,000 homeowners are trapped in their current deal paying high rates. Most of these homeowners took out mortgages before new, stricter rules on affordability were introduced in 2014. An interim report into the mortgage market,external, published in May by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), highlighted the plight of these borrowers. These ""mortgage prisoners"" were unable to move to a better deal when their existing mortgages switched to the more expensive standard variable rate, even if they could meet the payments. This was the result of stricter affordability checks or changing circumstances after the original deal was agreed. The FCA said it had identified about 150,000 such customers. Of these, about 30,000 were with authorised mortgage lenders, while about 120,000 had mortgages held by non-regulated firms - which include some previous Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley customers. Mortgage misery: The homeowners facing repossession People much less likely to move home than in 1970s Properties taking longer to sell in sluggish market Some 10,000 of them are with lenders who are still actively operating in the mortgage market. It is some of the people in this group that are designed to be helped by a commitment among 59 lenders to help them to find better deals. The rules set by the regulator mean they will still, in effect, be blocked from searching the whole of the mortgage market for a cheaper fixed-rate deal. However, assuming they are currently keeping up with repayments, the commitment - organised by trade body UK Finance - means they will receive a letter from their existing lender outlining what similar, but cheaper, deals are available. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said: ""Lenders have responded to the FCA's challenge and made a voluntary commitment to help these longstanding customers."" However, given that lenders can be - and have been - writing to some customers already, UK Finance is likely to face accusations that it is doing the bare minimum in response to the FCA call for an industry response to the issue. One big name currently missing from the commitment is TSB, which has been struggling with the fallout from its chaotic IT switchover in recent months. A TSB spokesperson said: ""We are fully supportive of the UK Finance initiative and we are working with them to completely understand how this project will work.  We are hoping to join the scheme over the coming weeks."" In its report, the FCA also said a ""significant minority"" - about 30% - of general mortgage customers failed to find the cheapest mortgage. It wants to make it easier for borrowers to see what mortgage products they can qualify for earlier on in the application process, and to assess and compare these products. However, UK Finance has yet to offer any solutions to this issue, arguing that further investigation is needed. It believes that new technology should be given time to aid price comparisons, before any regulatory intervention. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

Ms Hanham added that while that experts at MIIS could not ""find a way to confirm the [intelligence] leak"", the information has matched evidence from satellite imagery. North Korea has carried out a total of six nuclear tests, the most recent of which took place in September last year. It has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear programme. But at their landmark meeting in Singapore, Mr Trump and Mr Kim agreed to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". The pair signed a document pledging they would work towards new relations It's been unclear what both sides mean by ""complete denuclearisation"", and no further details have been released about when or how Pyongyang would renounce its nuclear weapons nor how the process would be verified. Experts have also cast doubt on whether Pyongyang has been genuine in its apparent commitment to ""denuclearise"". What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? Last week, it appeared North Korea had begun dismantling part of a key rocket launch site, but according to recent reports based on US intelligence leaks, Pyongyang might still secretly be continuing its nuclear weapons programme. Reports had indicated that North Korea was upgrading its only official nuclear enrichment site, and was stepping up enrichment at other secret sites.

"This video can not be played Rashid criticism slightly unfair - Root England v India, first Specsavers Test Venue:EdgbastonDate:1-5 AugustTime:11:00 BST Coverage:Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 LW and the BBC Sport website. In-play clips and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.Full tour details Adil Rashid has been named as England's only spin bowler for the first Test match against India at Edgbaston on Wednesday. The 30-year-old, who will play his first Test in almost two years, has been recalled despite signing a white-ball-only contract for Yorkshire in February. ""Adil has been a very good attacking option throughout all the white-ball cricket that he's played,"" said captain Joe Root. ""He's obviously come a long way in terms of where he was last time he played Test cricket and gives us a really balanced attack."" Left-arm swing bowler Sam Curran will win his second Test cap in Birmingham, with Moeen Ali and Jamie Porter missing out. Root also confirmed batsman Jos Buttler will act as vice-captain for the five-Test series. Ben Stokes was replaced as vice-captain by James Anderson for the Ashes during the winter. Stokes' trial for affray begins on Monday, the day after the first Test is due to end, with the all-rounder then missing the second Test at Lord's, which begins 9 August. The game at Edgbaston is England's 1,000th Test match. England have many questions to answer - Agnew I am not here to prove myself - Kohli Rashid return 'a stab in the chest for county cricket' England XI for first Test Joe Root (capt), James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler, Alastair Cook, Sam Curran, Keaton Jennings, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Ben Stokes. Adil Rashid has not played Test cricket for England since December 2016 against India Rashid, who made the most recent of his 10 Test appearances on the tour of India in 2016, has taken 38 Test wickets at an average of 42.78. Though he had chosen to focus on limited-overs cricket, the prospect of a recall to the Test side was raised thanks to impressive performances in T20 and one-day matches against Australia and India. However, Rashid opted to remain unavailable for Yorkshire in the County Championship, with the Tykes having to loan spinner Josh Poysden from Warwickshire for their match against Roses rivals Lancashire. In being named in the Test squad, Rashid was selected ahead of Somerset pair Jack Leach and Dom Bess, who had been England's spinners in their previous three matches. National selector Ed Smith said Rashid's selection was a one-off, and that in future all players wishing to play Tests for England must be available for the County Championship. Speaking to BBC Sport, Root said Rashid's recall was a ""very specific scenario"" and had come about in ""very strange circumstances"". Still, Rashid's inclusion in the squad was criticised by Yorkshire and their former players Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan. Vaughan said the decision was ""ridiculous"", but Rashid described the former England captain's comments as ""stupid"". Root, also of Yorkshire, said he did not feel ""compromised"" by the situation at his county and that Rashid's selection does not devalue the county game. ""I see county cricket as a really strong product which produces some fantastic Test cricketers,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Adil learned his trade in county cricket. He's got 450 first-class wickets so it is definitely a massive factor in producing Test cricketers."" Where are all the black English cricketers? Buttler is promoted to vice-captain only two Tests after a recall of his own. The 27-year-old made two half-centuries against Pakistan and now fulfils the role he does for England's one-day side, who are ranked number one in the world. ""With him being vice-captain of the one-day side he obviously thinks about the game extremely well,"" said Root. ""Looking further down the line, taking this team forward, I see him as a crucial part of that. ""Credit to him for taking his opportunity. He's had a fine summer to now and I'm sure he's desperate to kick on from what was a brilliant start against Pakistan. ""He's a very good thinker and he gains a huge amount of respect from the dressing room."" England have lost only one home series since 2012, but still find themselves down at fifth in the world rankings. Over the same time period their away form has been poor - they have won only one away series since winning in India in the same year - and they have often suffered big defeats in individual home Tests. The 1-1 draw against Pakistan earlier this summer included a heavy loss at Lord's. They were beaten by West Indies at Headingley and South Africa at Trent Bridge in 2017, but recovered to win both series. India, meanwhile, arrive as the leading team in the Test rankings. ""It's a great opportunity for this team,"" said Root. ""We had an indifferent few months, coming off the back of last summer where we had some success, then a difficult winter and start to this summer. It's a great chance for us to put that right. ""Hopefully we can start strong and take that forward. India are a fine Test team, they're deserving of their number one ranking. It's been a long time since they played in these conditions. Hopefully we can exploit that."" It had been thought that the hot, dry summer would produce conditions that would suit the tourists. However, Edgbaston has been well watered and has received regular rainfall since the weekend. There were puddles just off the edge of the outfield on Wednesday, yet the pitch is still dry enough for India to be likely to include two spinners. The five-Test series is crammed into a six-week period, with the final match at The Oval scheduled to conclude on 11 September. Since 2002, India have played only two five-Test series, both against England. They were beaten 3-1 here four years ago, then won 4-0 on home soil in 2016. ""The fact that it's a long series is something that we're really looking forward to,"" said India captain Virat Kohli. ""You can either think 'oh it's too long a series to play in this place', or you can think there's so many opportunities that will come up every day, every session, every Test match. We are definitely in that kind of frame of mind. ""We are very confident in our ability and that we have the skillset, character and the mental toughness which is required to compete and win in overseas conditions.""

"Kristy said her boyfriend didn't want her to have surgery: ""He adores me no matter what."" More than half of 18 to 34-year-olds feel that reality TV and social media have a negative effect on how they see their bodies, a survey has found. The ComRes survey of 2,000 British adults forBBC 5 Livealso suggested that younger people were more likely to consider having cosmetic surgery. Some 35% of people said shows such as Love Island and The Only Way is Essex were responsible. This figure rose to 55% in the 18 to 34-year-old age group. ITV recently defended the advertising around Love Island,after criticism from the head of NHS England about seeing trailers for cosmetic breast surgery. Does Love Island have a diversity problem? The ComRes survey also asked people whether they would consider having plastic surgery or a cosmetic procedure, with the younger respondents more likely than any other group to say they would. More than a third (35%) of that age group would think about having plastic surgery or a cosmetic procedure, compared with an overall average of 20%. BBC Radio 5 Live spoke to friends Montanna and Kristy, both 27, from Liverpool. Montanna (left) is thinking about having breast implants after her friend Kristy (right) had them Kristy had breast implants after having a baby: ""After the baby my boobs just went like scoops, like witches' scoops, they were so horrible. ""They had no volume in the top and I thought 'I'm not going on holiday and wearing a bikini like this, I'd have to put chicken fillets in. It's the best thing I've ever done'."" Kristy said before the surgery she wouldn't let her boyfriend see her without a top on: ""He adores me no matter what - he was never a boob man before I had them done, but now he's completely changed."" Montanna hasn't had surgery, but seeing Kristy on a recent holiday has made her think more about it: ""I just felt completely flat-chested, and you just looked so glamorous and happy and free. ""I've wanted a boob job since I was about 16. I've always put socks down my bra. I think I'd just be happier in myself, I could just wear different clothes, I wouldn't be conscious of them, I could just relax a bit more."" Montanna said they know lots of people who've had surgery - and social media plays a big part: ""A lot of people have just put themselves into debt for it. They get it on finance, and rather than thinking 'my priority is to get a nice house', they'd rather look good for a nice Instagram picture."" This video can not be played Melinda Messenger had a breast enlargement in her 20s before finding fame as a glamour model and TV presenter Melinda Messenger started out as a glamour model. She said she had breast surgery when she was 24, going from a C cup to a D cup. ""It was so personal that I didn't tell anyone, I needed to make an adjustment to feel more like myself."" She said in hindsight, she wishes she had realised that it wasn't necessary: ""There's a bit of me that goes - I wish I'd recognised that I was fine as I was."" The TV presenter has three children. Despite her own regrets, she said she would support her daughter having a breast enlargement: ""As long as it was thoroughly talked through and understood, and all the risks and consequences understood, then I would support that."" For Montanna, she said she thinks there's a lot of pressure to look good. ""Especially up here where we live, every girl is pretty much perfect. They've all had their boobs done, they're all really thin. I think if you said to the majority of girls, 'I'll give you a free boob job', I think you'd be hard pushed to find people who'd turn it down.""

"Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 Missing airman Corrie Mckeague is ""somewhere in the Suffolk waste disposal system"", his father has said. Corrie Mckeague was 23 years old when he vanished on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September 2016. Writing on Facebook, Martin Mckeague said: ""Corrie is no longer missing... after looking at all of the facts and evidence we now know what happened."" But Corrie's mother Nicola Urquhart insisted she had ""not given up"" the search for her son. Police believe the airman climbed into a waste bin and was taken away by a refuse lorry. The tragedy that shaped Corrie Mckeague Mr Mckeague said his son was ""known to sleep in and on top of bins, a fact that has been corroborated by Suffolk Police from their interviews"". He also said that on the night Corrie went missing, one bin had a recorded weight of 116kg - ""an unusually high number for this bin, which tells us my son was inside"". He acknowledged that Corrie's remains were ""essentially irretrievable"". But Ms Urquhart, who is divorced from Mr Mckeague, said she would ""keep fighting for the answers I need"". Corrie Mckeague, pictured with his mother, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds In a post on Facebook, she said: ""Corrie is missing, he has not been found, nor has their been any corroborated evidence shown to me yet to say what has happened to my son. ""Although to the very depths of my soul, I know and feel Corrie is not AWOL, I CANNOT state this is a fact, as there is no proof."" Ms Urquhart also confirmed she would be meeting the police in August ""to be given answers"". Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline and serving at RAF Honington in Suffolk, disappeared after a night out in Bury St Edmunds. No trace of him has been found, and police said in March that the investigation was being handed to a cold case team. His father wrote that police came to visit the family in Scotland to review the facts of the investigation in detail in October and February. Missing airman evidence 'manipulated' Missing Corrie search to be stood down Missing airman search costs police Â£2.1m He said he had been presented with evidence that was ""as thorough as it was compelling"" and experts had ""concluded beyond any doubt that Corrie had ended up in the Suffolk waste disposal system"". ""Accepting that conclusion has clearly not been easy for the Mckeague family in Scotland, nor anyone else,"" he wrote. The airman was last seen on CCTV pictures walking through Bury St Edmunds after a night out Mr Mckeague said the remaining areas were either ""too toxic to search"" or ""so vast it could take years to do so"". He added: ""We thought there might be a small glimmer of hope for the Mckeague family that a card reader could be used to identify the whereabouts of Corrie's bank card in the landfill site. ""I myself searched the internet to see if that technology could help but found nothing to support that theory. ""It was also the view of the National Crime Agency and Suffolk Police... there is no technology currently available that can, in these case circumstances, undertake such a task."" Mr Mckeague said there are plans for a memorial for his son. Police said in March there were ""no realistic lines of inquiry left"" in the investigation. The investigation into the disappearance has cost Â£2.1m and Suffolk's police and crime commissioner saidthe government had agreed to contribute with a special grant, expected to be about Â£800,000.

"This video can not be played 'My abortion pill took effect on the Tube home' Women are illegally taking abortion pills, which they have bought online, at home to avoid enduring abortions on public transport. In England, abortion pills must be administered in a clinic or hospital. For some this means the pill can take effect on their journey home. Campaigners say women should be able to take the second pill at home, as buying pills online can be dangerous. The Department of Health said it was monitoring the evidence on home use. Scotland and Wales have both recently changed the law to allow women to take the pill at home. Over the past three years, drug enforcement officers had seized almost 10,000 sets of abortion pills heading to addresses in Britain, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. England abortion pill rules 'out of step' Women having what is known as an early medical abortion must take two types of tablet, 24 to 48 hours apart. This means attending the same clinic twice, for each tablet. TheRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists(RCOG) has now called on England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, to change the legislation so that women can take the second pill at home. More than 50 MPs have done the same. RCOG's president, Prof Lesley Regan, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We know that when women are allowed to take the second tablet at home that it is safe, it's highly effective and they much, much prefer it."" Many experts believe current legislation is putting women at risk, due to the risks associated with buying the pills online. The World Health Organisation recommends home use of the abortion pill. Some hospitals and clinics in England are now allowing women to take both types of pill on the same day - even though this increases the risk of complications. Claudia Craig, who had an abortion last year, took a taxi home from hospital after taking the pill, and said within minutes the symptoms had begun. ""I started to feel really unwell and extremely nauseous,"" she said. ""I was getting that feeling in my chest like I was about to throw up."" Shortly after arriving home, following a 15-minute journey, she ""started retching and being very unwell on the bathroom floor"", she said. Claudia Craig says she felt ""extremely nauseous"" ""And then you lose control of your bowel movements."" She said had her taxi journey been a few minutes longer, she would not have made it home in time. ""All those symptoms would have been happening on the floor of the taxi. ""I would have been sick in the taxi, I would have started bleeding in the taxi and I would have lost control of my bowels in the taxi."" Another woman, Zoe Weldon, said she had started to feel the effects of the pill ""20 minutes into the journey on the Tube towards home"". ""I started to feel nauseous, started to sweat, started to feel really cold, went extremely pale apparently,"" she said. ""I had to get off the Tube. I lay down on a bench next to the Tube and basically decided I wasn't going to move any further. ""It was so painful and so frightening."" Kate Guthrie says more than 2,000 women have contacted her asking for pills Kate Guthrie, who has worked in abortion care for 30 years, now works for a service, Women on Web, which helps women who want to buy the tablets online. She told the Victoria Derbyshire programme in the past 18 months 2,212 women had contacted her asking for pills. Most were single mothers who could not get to clinics because they had children to look after. And others lived hundreds of miles away from a clinic. Since the change in law in Scotland, eight out of 10 women are now choosing to take the pill at home, according to NHS Lothian - equivalent to ""about 1,000 women"". One of their consultants, Dr Sharon Cameron, said the figure showed taking the pill at home was ""a really popular option and that this is what women want to do"". She added there had not been an increase in the rate of complications experienced by women. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was ""currently monitoring the proceedings in Scotland closely"". ""We have a tough regulator in place to ensure the care women receive is safe and of the highest quality.""

"Oxfam GB operations in Haiti were suspended in February Oxfam GB has been banned from operating in Haiti after its staff were accused of sexual misconduct following the 2010 earthquake.

"Dixons Carphone has said a huge data breach that took place last year involved 10 million customers, up from its original estimate of 1.2 million. The Carphone Warehouse and Currys PC World ownerhas been investigating the hack since it was discovered in June. It said personal information, names, addresses and email addresses may have been accessed last year. However, no bank details were taken and it had found no evidence that fraud had resulted from the breach. The hackers also got access to records of 5.9 million payments cards, but nearly all of those were protected by the chip and pin system. Dixons said it was ""very sorry for any distress"" caused and it would be apologising to customers, although it did not say how or over what timescale it would be contacting them. Alex Neill, from consumer lobby group Which?, said: ""Dixons Carphone customers will be alarmed to hear about this massive data breach and will be asking why it has taken so long for the company to uncover the extent of its security failure. ""It is now critical that the company moves quickly to ensure those affected get clear information about what has happened and what steps they should take to protect themselves. ""Anyone concerned they could be at risk of fraud should consider changing their online passwords, monitor bank and other online accounts and be wary of emails regarding the breach as scammers may try and take advantage of it."" by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology editor On the face of it, this is terrible news for Dixons Carphone and its customers - it's as if a householder who discovered in June that burglars had stolen the telly has belatedly looked in the garage and found that the car has gone too. But remember, the really shocking thing about the first announcement last month was that details of 5.9 million payment cards had been accessed - it's not that number which has gone up tenfold but the separate and less serious total of non-financial personal records hacked. Now that still leaves many more people at the theoretical risk of phishing attacks and it's another stain on the company's reputation. But whereas Dixons Carphone shares fell after the news in June, they've risen slightly this morning. Investors have had so much bad news lately about the last electronics retailer left standing on the High Street that they seem able to shrug off something which may not have a huge effect on the bottom line. Dixons said it had been working with leading cyber security experts and had put in further security measures to safeguard customer information. The National Crime Agency began investigating the breach last month when it was first revealed. It is working with the National Cyber Security Centre, the Financial Conduct Authority and the UK's data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). An ICO spokesperson said: ""Our investigation into the incident is ongoing and we will take time to assess this new information. ""In the meantime, we would expect the company to alert all those affected in the UK as soon as possible and to take all steps necessary to reduce any potential harm to consumers."" Dixons Carphone chief executive Alex Baldock, said: ""Since our data security review uncovered last year's breach, we've been working around the clock to put it right. ""That's included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we're updating on today. ""As a precaution, we're now also contacting all our customers to apologise and advise on the steps they can take to protect themselves.""

"A British ex-soldier accused of attending training camps run by militia fighting the Islamic State group has had the case against him dropped. James Matthews, 43, from Dalston, east London, pleaded not guilty to a terror offence for receiving training in Iraq and Syria on or before February 2016. He had been due to face trial at the Old Bailey later this year. But prosecutors said there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction and offered no evidence. Joel Bennathan QC, defending, said Mr Matthews was ""happy"" at the decision but was entitled to a ""full and proper explanation of what has happened here"". ""We have always said the decision to prosecute Mr Matthews for fighting with the YPG [Kurdish militia forces] against Isis was extraordinary and totally unjustified,"" he said. ""Mr Matthews was always open about what he had done and it is baffling that the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) took two years to decide to prosecute him, then seven months later they have suddenly realised there is not enough evidence to do so."" It is believed to be the first time terror legislation has been deployed to seek the conviction of someone who was assisting a group, who are also being assisted by the UK government. Prosecutor Tom Little QC defended the decision to bring the charge and said the review was based on further evidence ""specific"" to the case. In a statement Mr Matthews accused the British government of making a politically calculated decision to charge him. He asked whether relations with Turkey - which deems the YPG to be a terrorist group - was the real reason he was prosecuted and he demanded an explanation. It is estimated that since 2015 dozens of Britons have fought against IS with the Kurds in Iraq and Syria.

"Oxfam is to make Â£16m of cuts because of reduced funding in the wake of the Haiti sex scandal. The charity was accused of covering up claims that staff sexually exploited female victims of the 2010 earthquake. After the scandal emergedthousands of people stopped making regular donationsand the government suspended its funding to the charity. An Oxfam statement said it was ""devastated"" that it would have to reduce some of its aid programmes. However, it said it would target its head offices and support functions to ensure that the majority of its work on the ground could continue. Oxfam chief executive to stand down Oxfam GB banned from Haiti after sex scandal How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Claims first emerged in the Times,externalin February that staff, including former country director Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes while based in Haiti after the earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. The charity's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. In February, Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to Haiti. Oxfam GB chief executive Mark Goldring announced his resignation last month, saying that someone else should help ""rebuild"" the group following the scandal. Earlier this week it was confirmed that Oxfam GB had been banned from operating in Haiti. Oxfam GB's annual income last yearwas Â£408.6m and it says it spent Â£303.5m on ""charitable activities"".,external- including development and humanitarian projects and campaigning. Following the announcement of the cuts, an Oxfam spokesperson said: ""We are devastated that the appalling behaviour of some former staff in Haiti and shortcomings in how we dealt with that eight years ago means we now have less money to provide clean water, food and other support to people who need it. ""We are immensely grateful to all those - including more than nine in 10 of our regular givers - who have continued to support us during these difficult times.

"The victims had been on a cycle tour of the Central Asian country (file image) The Islamic State (IS) group has released a video purporting to show a group of men who killed four foreign cyclists in Tajikistan on Sunday pledging allegiance to its cause. Earlier authorities had blamed a banned Islamist party, citing an alleged confession of one arrested suspect. Two Americans, a Swiss and a Dutch national were hit by a car in Danghara, south-east of the capital Dushanbe. The attackers then stabbed their victims. Two other foreigners were injured. Tajikistan profile Islamic State lures Central Asians Earlier on Tuesday, Tajikistan's interior ministry said that a man suspected of leading the attack was an active member of the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT), which was outlawed three years ago. Exiled leaders of the IRPT denied any link to the attack, saying the authorities were trying to use the incident for political purposes, Reuters reports. Tajikistan's government banned the IRPT in 2015, accusing it of planning a coup. The video released by IS shows five young men seated under a tree in a mountainous area with the IS flag in the background, BBC Monitoring reports. One denounces the rulers of Tajikistan as ""apostates"", who ""sold their religion"" and allowed the country to be occupied by ""unbelievers"". They later join hands and swear loyalty to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, before pledging to attack ""unbelievers"". The identity of the men and whether it was they who carried out the attack cannot as yet be verified. By Mina Al-Lami, BBC Monitoring IS isn't known to have a presence in Tajikistan. However, the group has had members from the country, and from other Central Asian states. Tajik authorities have in the past arrested alleged IS recruiters or sympathisers. In May 2015, a former member of Tajikistan's special OMON police unit, Gulmurod Khalimov,pledged allegiance to IS and migrated to territory held by the group. This was flaunted in an IS-linked video in an effort to inspire others in Tajikistan to follow his example. In February 2018, IS said its attacks in Russia and former Soviet countries had entered a new phase, inciting sympathisers to attack Christians in ""the Caucasus, Crimea, and Central Asia countries"". ""The current stage"", said IS via its weekly newspaper al-Naba, ""does not require groups with big numbers of trained fighters, nor heavy weapons. Rather, it requires a mujahid to use whatever weapon he can get his hands on"" to attack. Such attacks, it said, would instil fear in Christians and prompt them to leave these countries. Special forces chief Gulmurod Khalimov appeared in an IS video in May 2015 Following Monday's attack, four suspects were killed by authorities in a special operation, the interior ministry said. Another four were arrested, and a damaged car believed to have been involved was recovered. An amateur video which appears to be of the attack captures the moment a car is driven into unsuspecting cyclists. According to Tajikistan's interior minister, three of the tourists died instantly and one on the way to a nearby hospital. ""One had knife wounds, he received medical help, now his condition is stable,"" Ramazon Hamro Rahimzoda told reporters. The victims were on a tour in the Central Asian country with three other tourists from France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Tajikistan has struggled with poverty and instability since the former Soviet republic became independent in 1991. It had declared 2018 a ""year of tourism"", AFP news agency said.

"This video can not be played 'My abortion pill took effect on the Tube home' Women are illegally taking abortion pills, which they have bought online, at home to avoid enduring abortions on public transport. In England, abortion pills must be administered in a clinic or hospital. For some this means the pill can take effect on their journey home. Campaigners say women should be able to take the second pill at home, as buying pills online can be dangerous. The Department of Health said it was monitoring the evidence on home use. Scotland and Wales have both recently changed the law to allow women to take the pill at home. Over the past three years, drug enforcement officers had seized almost 10,000 sets of abortion pills heading to addresses in Britain, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. England abortion pill rules 'out of step' Women having what is known as an early medical abortion must take two types of tablet, 24 to 48 hours apart. This means attending the same clinic twice, for each tablet. TheRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists(RCOG) has now called on England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, to change the legislation so that women can take the second pill at home. More than 50 MPs have done the same. RCOG's president, Prof Lesley Regan, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We know that when women are allowed to take the second tablet at home that it is safe, it's highly effective and they much, much prefer it."" Many experts believe current legislation is putting women at risk, due to the risks associated with buying the pills online. The World Health Organisation recommends home use of the abortion pill. Some hospitals and clinics in England are now allowing women to take both types of pill on the same day - even though this increases the risk of complications. Claudia Craig, who had an abortion last year, took a taxi home from hospital after taking the pill, and said within minutes the symptoms had begun. ""I started to feel really unwell and extremely nauseous,"" she said. ""I was getting that feeling in my chest like I was about to throw up."" Shortly after arriving home, following a 15-minute journey, she ""started retching and being very unwell on the bathroom floor"", she said. Claudia Craig says she felt ""extremely nauseous"" ""And then you lose control of your bowel movements."" She said had her taxi journey been a few minutes longer, she would not have made it home in time. ""All those symptoms would have been happening on the floor of the taxi. ""I would have been sick in the taxi, I would have started bleeding in the taxi and I would have lost control of my bowels in the taxi."" Another woman, Zoe Weldon, said she had started to feel the effects of the pill ""20 minutes into the journey on the Tube towards home"". ""I started to feel nauseous, started to sweat, started to feel really cold, went extremely pale apparently,"" she said. ""I had to get off the Tube. I lay down on a bench next to the Tube and basically decided I wasn't going to move any further. ""It was so painful and so frightening."" Kate Guthrie says more than 2,000 women have contacted her asking for pills Kate Guthrie, who has worked in abortion care for 30 years, now works for a service, Women on Web, which helps women who want to buy the tablets online. She told the Victoria Derbyshire programme in the past 18 months 2,212 women had contacted her asking for pills. Most were single mothers who could not get to clinics because they had children to look after. And others lived hundreds of miles away from a clinic. Since the change in law in Scotland, eight out of 10 women are now choosing to take the pill at home, according to NHS Lothian - equivalent to ""about 1,000 women"". One of their consultants, Dr Sharon Cameron, said the figure showed taking the pill at home was ""a really popular option and that this is what women want to do"". She added there had not been an increase in the rate of complications experienced by women. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was ""currently monitoring the proceedings in Scotland closely"". ""We have a tough regulator in place to ensure the care women receive is safe and of the highest quality.""

"This video can not be played The earthquake triggered landslides More than 500 hikers who were stranded on a mountain on the Indonesian island of Lombok after an earthquake have been safely evacuated. The 6.4 magnitude quake on Sunday triggered landslides around Mount Rinjani, cutting off escape routes. Most of the hikers and guides were able to walk down after a safe route was found for them but some were flown out by helicopter. At least 16 people were killed in the quake and more than 330 were injured. Rescue workers are still waiting to bring down the body of an Indonesian hiker who was killed by falling rocks. A Malaysian tourist also died. The volcano, which rises 3,726m (12,224ft) above sea level and is the second-highest one in Indonesia, is a favourite among sightseers. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - a horse-shoe-shaped string of volcanoes, earthquake sites and tectonic plates that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. Some hikers needed medical treatment Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told AFP that 543 people had arrived back at the foot of the mountain by Monday night. I Gusti Lanang Wiswananda, a spokesman for Mataram search and rescue agency, told AFP that they were all ""tired but in good condition"". Hundreds of people in Lombok have been left homeless and are staying in temporary camps amid continuing aftershocks. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Lombok Living in the shadow of a volcano means people here are no strangers to natural disasters, but Sunday's powerful quake and the hundreds of aftershocks have people on edge. The community is quickly pulling together, though, to repair damaged buildings, including the town's only health clinic. Electricity and clean water are being restored to villages in Sambalia that were cut off. Gita Dwipayasantri had arrived at a makeshift medical tent here in Sembalun to ask for doctors' advice. Her four-year-old daughter clings to her. She is worried there is going to be another big earthquake and her mother tells me she's traumatised.  ""I am frightened too, but I need to be strong for her,"" she says. This is an area that increasingly relies on tourism and now that the mountain is closed to hikers, businesses are worried. ""I have had so many international cancellations,"" says Hugeng, who runs a hotel at the base of Mount Rinjani. ""I hope local people will still come and relax here.""

"It is a ""scandal"" that some children start school unable to speak in full sentences, Education Secretary Damian Hinds has said in a speech. And if children reach Year 1 unable to read simple words, they rarely catch up, ""the gap just widens"", he said. He has pledged to halve the number of pupils starting school behind in early talking and reading skills by 2028. A group of companies and charities have been brought together to work out how best to support families in England. Educational researchers have long said that social mobility - or the lack of it - starts at home with what's known as the home learning environment. The idea is that a home with a lot of books and other early learning materials, plus engaged parents giving their children quality time, talking with them and teaching them how to make letter sounds, for example, provides a good start. But not all parents feel able to offer this kind of home environment or realise the importance of it. Researchers from the Education Policy Institute last week said the development gap between England's poorest pupils, and the others, was already at 4.3 months in the early years. And that it grew to 9.4 months by the end of primary school. Mr Hinds said, in the speech in London, that this early gap had a ""huge impact on social mobility"". ""The truth is the vast majority of these children's time is at home. ""Yes the home learning environment can be, understandably, the last taboo in education policy - but we can't afford to ignore it when it comes social mobility. ""I don't have interest in lecturing parents here... I know it's parents who bring up their children, who love them. who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children. ""But that doesn't mean extra support and advice can't be helpful."" The Department for Education says 28% of children in England do not have the required language skills by the end of Reception. Children who communicate well early tend to do better in their lives But this rises to much higher percentages in deprived areas. Mr Hinds also says he is particularly keen to use technology to build awareness of what parents can do to boost early language development. The speech comes a few months after communication charities, and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, published their own report on the lack of progress on improving speech and language services over the past decade. It was based on responses to a major independent cross-government review of such services chaired by John Bercow, which was published 10 years ago. Bercow 10 Years On,externalsaid that communication was crucial to children's life chances but awareness of its importance among the public and decision-makers was not sufficient. Services were inaccessible and inequitable, it said, and too often support for children's speech, language and communication needs was based on the available resources, rather than what was needed, leading to great variations across the country. It also said some measures shown to have worked well had been cut to save money. The government is yet to respond to that report. Bob Reitemeier,  chief executive of I Can, the children's communication charity,  welcomed the plans but said the coalition of companies and charities must include experts with experience of supporting children with speech, language and communication needs. ""Research shows that in some areas of deprivation 50% of children are starting school well behind their peers in language development. ""Without support, the gap between these children and other children will continue to widen, year on year, putting their life chances at risk.""

"Aid organisations have reported 80 cases where workers have harmed people, or put them at risk, international development secretary Penny Mordaunt has said. Reports of children being sexually abused are among the current and historical cases referred to the Charity Commission since 12 February. Last month it emerged that former Oxfam workers paid for sex while in Haiti. It was a ""wake up call"" for the sector, Ms Mordaunt told a safeguarding summit. The cases span 26 charities and groups - seven of which were reporting cases that had occurred in the last financial year - and cover the ""full spectrum"" of safeguarding incidents, she added. The charities involved in the cases have not been named. The reports come after Ms Mordaunt wrote to 179 British charities and agencies asking them to report any cases of abuse to the Charity Commission, in the wake of the sex exploitation scandal which has engulfed the sector. How the Oxfam scandal unfolded What's gone wrong with the foreign aid sector? Nine charts that show what charities do Oxfam Haiti sex claims: Charity 'failed in moral leadership' Aid charities had to be honest about their past mistakes in order to win back the trust of the British public, she said on Monday. Her message to those who sought to exploit the aid sector was: ""We will find you. We will bring you to justice. Your time is up."" The cabinet minister said government funds would not be approved unless organisations passed ""tough new standards"" set by the Department for International Development. These standards - she said - would be ""world-leading"" and ""exacting"" and have now come into force. Attendees at the London event have been asked to find a way ""staff can be properly vetted and monitored as they move between organisations and countries"" and come up with measures to support and protect whistleblowers and survivors of exploitation or abuse. NGOs and charities at the summit will sign a joint statement setting out the key principles they will adhere to and agree a set of practical actions to improve standards. The Charity Commission said it would work with organisations to make changes and chairwoman Baroness Stowell said she was encouraged to see ""a firm commitment to bringing about cultural change in charities"". ""But however noble the cause, it will never justify means which fall below basic standards of conduct expected of any organisation,"" she added. ""And if we are to restore public trust and the nation's pride in what charities achieve, we have to show that's what we understand.""

"Dixons Carphone has said a huge data breach that took place last year involved 10 million customers, up from its original estimate of 1.2 million. The Carphone Warehouse and Currys PC World ownerhas been investigating the hack since it was discovered in June. It said personal information, names, addresses and email addresses may have been accessed last year. However, no bank details were taken and it had found no evidence that fraud had resulted from the breach. The hackers also got access to records of 5.9 million payments cards, but nearly all of those were protected by the chip and pin system. Dixons said it was ""very sorry for any distress"" caused and it would be apologising to customers, although it did not say how or over what timescale it would be contacting them. Alex Neill, from consumer lobby group Which?, said: ""Dixons Carphone customers will be alarmed to hear about this massive data breach and will be asking why it has taken so long for the company to uncover the extent of its security failure. ""It is now critical that the company moves quickly to ensure those affected get clear information about what has happened and what steps they should take to protect themselves. ""Anyone concerned they could be at risk of fraud should consider changing their online passwords, monitor bank and other online accounts and be wary of emails regarding the breach as scammers may try and take advantage of it."" by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology editor On the face of it, this is terrible news for Dixons Carphone and its customers - it's as if a householder who discovered in June that burglars had stolen the telly has belatedly looked in the garage and found that the car has gone too. But remember, the really shocking thing about the first announcement last month was that details of 5.9 million payment cards had been accessed - it's not that number which has gone up tenfold but the separate and less serious total of non-financial personal records hacked. Now that still leaves many more people at the theoretical risk of phishing attacks and it's another stain on the company's reputation. But whereas Dixons Carphone shares fell after the news in June, they've risen slightly this morning. Investors have had so much bad news lately about the last electronics retailer left standing on the High Street that they seem able to shrug off something which may not have a huge effect on the bottom line. Dixons said it had been working with leading cyber security experts and had put in further security measures to safeguard customer information. The National Crime Agency began investigating the breach last month when it was first revealed. It is working with the National Cyber Security Centre, the Financial Conduct Authority and the UK's data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). An ICO spokesperson said: ""Our investigation into the incident is ongoing and we will take time to assess this new information. ""In the meantime, we would expect the company to alert all those affected in the UK as soon as possible and to take all steps necessary to reduce any potential harm to consumers."" Dixons Carphone chief executive Alex Baldock, said: ""Since our data security review uncovered last year's breach, we've been working around the clock to put it right. ""That's included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we're updating on today. ""As a precaution, we're now also contacting all our customers to apologise and advise on the steps they can take to protect themselves.""

"British man Scott Harry Richardson will face a retrial in Sydney A UK man who was found guilty last year of raping a sleeping woman in Australia has had his conviction quashed. Scott Harry Richardson will now face a retrial over the alleged attack on a US backpacker in Sydney in 2016, a court of appeal ruled. Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported,externalthat it followed the discovery of new DNA evidence. Mr Richardson, who pleaded not guilty, had been serving a minimum two-year jail sentence. During the 12-day trial last year, the court heard that the woman had fallen asleep on a couch before waking to find a man raping her. Mr Richardson testified that he had jumped on top of a duvetcovering the woman, after mistaking her for a friend - but then immediately left after realising his error. On Monday, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that a DNA test conducted recently had provided new evidence, the Daily Telegraph reported. The decision could have ramifications for other cases, the newspaper said, because that type of DNA test is not currently used in New South Wales. Mr Richardson is expected to apply for bail.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""No preconditions, if they want to meet, I'll meet"" Donald Trump has offered to meet Iran's leaders with ""no preconditions"" and ""any time they want"". ""I'd meet with anybody. I believe in meetings,"" the US president told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's conciliatory approach comes afterhe and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani traded hostile warningsearlier this month. In May, the US left a deal which curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington is preparing to re-impose sanctions on Tehran within days - despite objections from the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, which also signed the 2015 agreement. The US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes. Trump threatens Iran: Twitter responds Iran faces up to its options Who are the winners and losers? ""If they want to meet, we'll meet,"" Mr Trump said. Hamid Aboutalebi, an adviser to President Rouhani, tweeted in response to Mr Trump that""returning to the nuclear deal"" and ""respecting the Iranian nation's rights"" would pave way for talks,external. Such a meeting would be the first between US and Iranian leaders since before the 1979 Iranian revolution. Mr Trump's abrupt change in tone also echoes the run-up to his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, another diplomatic first, which took place after the two leaders had previously traded insults and threats. This video can not be played Iranian Americans on Trump's policies Shortly afterwards Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would support a meeting if Iran showed it was willing to change its behaviour. The ""president wants to meet with folks to solve problems"",he told CNBC,external. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter I was sitting in the East Room when Mr Trump said he'd be happy to meet Mr Rouhani, and I was almost not surprised. Most people would be cautious about such a meeting, especially if they'd just got into a word-battle of the kind Mr Trump has engaged in. But from watching Mr Trump over the past two years, I know he has confidence in his abilities as a negotiator and believes people respond well to his ambition. ""People may not always think big themselves,"" he wrote in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. ""But they can still get very excited by those who do."" His other meetings with controversial leaders may have been problematic. But this hasn't deterred him from trying again. Last week Mr Trump responded angrily to Mr Rouhani, who had earlier warned of the consequences of a conflict with his country. Mr Trump tweeted in capitals that Iran would ""suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before"" if it threatened the US. Mr Rouhani had told Iranian diplomats: ""America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars."" In MayMr Pompeo laid out 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" with Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Mr Trump has consistently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw the US release billions of dollars of frozen assets in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme The Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilising force in the Middle East, arguing the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there Gulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions In May, Mr Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a ""horrible, one-sided deal"". He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's ""destabilising activities"" in the region enough. Analysts also cited the influence of White House Iran hawks including Mr Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Mr Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor Barack Obama. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honouring its commitments. What is the nuclear accord? Pain for some of Europe's biggest companies Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.

"Allegations surfaced about abuse in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 The aid sector is guilty of ""complacency verging on complicity"" over an ""endemic"" sex abuse scandal, a damning report from MPs has said. Stephen Twigg, chairman of the international development committee, said charities were ""more concerned to protect their own reputation"". The committee's inquiry was launched in light of revelations thatsenior Oxfam staff paid survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake for sex,external. Charities welcomedthe MPs' report,external. Oxfam Trustees chairwoman Caroline Thomson said the committee had been right to challenge the charity sector and recognised ""we have further to go"". The Oxfam scandal, revealed in February in The Times, led to further allegations about UK-based charities. The report, which looked at allegations dating back to 2001, says the delivery of aid to people had been subverted by sexual predators. The committee said in their report: ""Having understood the length of time that the sector has been aware of these issues, we reflect with confusion on the apparent shock of those we spoke to in the immediate aftermath of the Times report. This has been a known problem in the international aid sector for years."" Oxfam worked in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake (file picture) ""So much more"" could have been done to tackle the ""open secret"" of people working in the aid sector committing such acts, the MPs added. Despite the charities knowing about the problem, the committee said there had been a ""collective failure of leadership"", with action only when there was a crisis. The report also said leaders were ""self-deluded"" in thinking they had addressed problems before they became public. MPs insisted more resources were needed to tackle the issue - and said victims had to be at the ""heart of solutions"", or the response could be ""harmful"". Mr Twigg suggested something akin to DBS checks, the criminal records check system used in the UK, could be adopted internationally, to provide details of past allegations to prospective employers. ""That won't cure this but it's one of the ways in which we can try to ensure this won't happen again,"" he said. The MPs also recommended an independent aid ombudsman should be introduced and have called for a global register of aid workers, who will operate according to expected standards. This video can not be played MPs are suggesting DBS-style checks for aid workers in a report into sexual abuse The committee also suggested: Ensuring the beneficiaries of humanitarian aid have knowledge of and confidence in their rights A zero-tolerance culture on sexual exploitation and abuse is the least that victims should expect Reports of wrongdoing should be proactively sought and responded to robustly, with feedback to victims and survivors Known perpetrators of sexual exploitation and abuse should be identified through improved reporting and accountability, and prevented from moving into new positions This video can not be played What's gone wrong with the foreign aid sector? The report looked at allegations of sex abuse and child abuse by aid workers, dating back to 2001. They found sexual assault and exploitation was ""predominately perpetrated against women and girls"" and mainly carried out by men. A 2008 Save the Children report into the under-reporting of child sexual exploitation and abuse, seen by the MPs, said the abusers were ""both foreign and national staff"", with the majority being ""local people employed by international humanitarian organisations"". A 2002 UNHCR and Save the Children report, which looked at refugee camps in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, found that humanitarian workers extorted ""sex in exchange for desperately needed aid supplies (biscuits, soap, medicines, plastic sheeting etc)"". The victims were mainly girls aged 13 to 18, who reported consequences including ""pregnancies, abortions, teenage motherhood, [and] exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS"". The committee found that a recurring theme was ""abuse of power"". ""No corner of the aid sector appears to be immune,"" their report said. ""The problem is a collective one."" Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, apologised to ""vulnerable women"" in Haiti Oxfam trustees chairwoman Caroline Thomson said the report made for ""painful reading"" for the whole aid sector, and apologised that Oxfam had failed to protect vulnerable women in Haiti. She said the charity had tripled funding for safeguarding, established an independent whistleblowing phone line and agreed to publish the details of safeguarding cases twice a year. Save the Children UK said it was strengthening its internal safeguarding systems and had called for greater government oversight. Chief executive Kevin Watkins said: ""We have made mistakes in our own handling of historical sexual harassment complaints from staff in the UK,"" adding, ""there is a great deal more to do"". International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt welcomed the report, saying: ""Until the sector is fully prepared to address the power imbalance, cultures, and behaviours that allow sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment to happen, we will never stamp it out."" An international summit on the issue is due to take place in October, and Ms Mordaunt has called for the sector to demonstrate the progress they have made by then. 22 aid organisations apologise after scandal How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Brendan Cox admitted to inappropriate behaviour when he worked at Save the Children In February the Times reported Oxfam male aid workersused prostitutes during a humanitarian mission after the Haiti earthquake in 2010. More allegations then followed, against Oxfam and other UK charities. Oxfam has since revealed it has tomake Â£16m of cutsbecause of reduced funding following the scandal, with thousands stopping their regular donations. Its chief executive Mark Goldringstood down in May. His deputy Penny Lawrence had quit in February. In a separate story relating to alleged misconduct in the charity sector,Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox,had to quit his role at the two charities set up in her memory. He denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 but admitted ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. And formerEx-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsythfaced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour against female staff. He said he had ""apologised unreservedly"" to the workers at the time. He resigned from his post at Unicef, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities.

"Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 There are ""no realistic lines of inquiry left"" in the investigation into the disappearance of RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, police have said. Mr Mckeague was 23 when he was last seen on 24 September 2016 walking into a bin loading bay in Bury St Edmunds. Suffolk Police said the inquiry, which has cost Â£2.1m, had been handed to a cold case team but remained open. Det Supt Katie Elliott said: ""It is extremely disappointing that we have not been able to find Corrie."" ""We have now reached a point where we are unable to make any further progress, and have gone as far as we realistically can with the information we have,"" she added. A police spokesman said the case had always been a missing persons investigation and there is no evidence of ""criminal activity or third party involvement"". A landfill site was extensively searched as part of the investigation By Alex Dunlop, BBC East senior defence reporter Corrie Mckeague had no reason to vanish. He comes from a loving family and has a strong second family - his fellow gunners at RAF Honington. I use the present tense because he is still officially missing, but the police and his parents now hold out little hope that the Scottish airman is still alive. Why has this 18-month investigation gained such huge public interest? A combination of factors: Corrie is a serviceman, his girlfriend - unbeknown to him - was pregnant with his baby daughter and his family have kept the search for him in the public domain thanks to social media. Now the case has 'gone cold', Corrie Mckeague's family will be devastated but not surprised. I have come to know Corrie's mother, Nicola Urquhart, well. She is articulate and determined. Her family is in Scotland, but she has had to make Suffolk her second home. Corrie's family cannot properly mourn until they have some resolution. For now that seems a long way off. Suffolk Police said it had been ""re-examining the evidence relating to all realistic theories to identify whether there is anything else that could be done to establish what could have happened to Corrie"". But the force said an assessment of the evidence ""still points to Corrie being transported from the 'horseshoe' area in a bin lorry and ultimately taken to the Milton landfill site"". The mystery of the airman who disappeared Missing airman search costs police Â£2.1m Landfill search for missing airman ends Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV pictures at about 03:25 BST after a night out and his phone was tracked as taking the same route as a bin lorry. As part of the inquiry, police trawled a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, for the missing airman's remains. However, after the search the force said they were ""content"" he was not in the landfill areas. Assistant Chief Constable Simon Megicks said he had ""absolute confidence"" in the way the investigation was conducted. ""The major investigation team inquiry has been reviewed at various points by senior officers within the constabulary and external experts,"" he said. Det Supt Elliott added: ""If any new, credible and proportionate inquiries relating to Corrie's disappearance emerge we will pursue them."" The airman was seen on CCTV pictures walking through Bury St Edmunds after a night out The force said Mr Mckeague's family have been informed of the decision. Mr Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart previously said the search of the waste site had given her ""immeasurable peace of mind"". The investigation into the disappearance has cost Â£2.1m and Suffolk's police and crime commissioner saidthe government had agreed to contribute with a special grant, expected to be about Â£800,000.

After the first meeting between sitting leaders from the two countries, the two men pledged to work towards denuclearisation. Mr Trump later said North Korea was ""no longer a nuclear threat"". But Mr Trump was criticised at home for making concessions without securing any firm commitment from Mr Kim to end the nuclear and missile programmes. Trump-Kim summit: Why did they meet? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? These are not the first reports that North Korea may be continuing its weapons programme, casting doubt on the real impact of the summit in Singapore. This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? On Monday, the Washington Post newspaper quoted officials as saying North Korea appeared to be building one or two new liquid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at the Sanumdong facility near the capital, Pyongyang. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Deciphering what happened in Singapore The factory is known to have produced the Hwasong-15, the first North Korean ICBM capable of reaching the US. However, a US official told news agency Reuters that a liquid-fuelled ICBM didn't ""pose nearly the threat that a solid-fuelled one would because they take so long to fuel"". Reuters also added that satellite imaging showed vehicles moving in and out of the facility, but not the extent of any missile construction. Satellite imagery of the Sanumdong facility shows that the site is ""active"", Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) told the Washington Post. ""[The facility] is not dead, by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Mr Lewis. ""We see shipping containers and vehicles coming and going. This is a facility where they build ICBMs and space-launch vehicles."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another North Korean expert from MIIS, Melissa Hanham, told the BBC that the facility had ""regular traffic in and out of the building"", adding that this ""traffic pattern"" on the site stayed ""about the same through the Panmunjom and Singapore meetings"". This indicated that there had not been a complete stop in activity during the summit talks. She also noted that large ""brightly coloured containers"" also showed up in satellite imagery, saying that ""containers similar to these have appeared during previous ICBM inspections by Mr Kim."" Ms Hanham added that while that experts at MIIS could not ""find a way to confirm the [intelligence] leak"", the information has matched evidence from satellite imagery. North Korea has carried out a total of six nuclear tests, the most recent of which took place in September last year. It has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear programme. But at their landmark meeting in Singapore, Mr Trump and Mr Kim agreed to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". The pair signed a document pledging they would work towards new relations It's been unclear what both sides mean by ""complete denuclearisation"", and no further details have been released about when or how Pyongyang would renounce its nuclear weapons nor how the process would be verified. Experts have also cast doubt on whether Pyongyang has been genuine in its apparent commitment to ""denuclearise"". What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? Last week, it appeared North Korea had begun dismantling part of a key rocket launch site, but according to recent reports based on US intelligence leaks, Pyongyang might still secretly be continuing its nuclear weapons programme. Reports had indicated that North Korea was upgrading its only official nuclear enrichment site, and was stepping up enrichment at other secret sites. Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was forced to admit that North Korea was continuing to produce nuclear fissile material, though he insisted that ""progress is happening"".

"This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Willsman said and why it matters Labour is facing growing calls to take action against an ally of Jeremy Corbyn after he was recorded criticising members of the Jewish community. During a meeting of the ruling National Executive Committee, Peter Willsman suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks. Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He has apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported. He also said he would be referring himself for equalities training. What's the anti-Semitism row doing to Labour? How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Councillor suspended in anti-Semitism row Jewish newspapers unite against Labour But Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said he should be ""summarily expelled"", and the Jewish Labour Movement called for his suspension and a disciplinary investigation. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused Mr Willsman of being a ""loud-mouthed bully"" and high-profile supporters of Mr Corbyn have also taken to Twitter to urge Mr Willsman to withdraw from the elections to the NEC. He was supported by Labour MP and former frontbencher Chris Williamson who endorsed him for the ruling body vote. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the row had added significance because Mr Willsman had been a ""fellow traveller politically"" of the Labour leader over the years and was a leading ""Corbynite"". The recording,published by the Jewish Chronicle,external, was made at an NEC meeting earlier this month which took place after more than 60 British rabbis signed an open letter that said anti-Semitism in sections of the Labour Party was ""severe and widespread"". This followedcriticism of the party's new code of conducton anti-Semitism, which  critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition.

In the recording, Mr Willsman can be heard discussing the rabbis' open letter with other NEC members. Mr Willsman says he does not want to be ""lectured to by Trump fanatics"", and argues the NEC should ask the rabbis for ""evidence of severe and widespread anti-Semitism"" in the party. He then asks those at the meeting to raise their hands if they had witnessed anti-Semitism in the Labour party - and said he was ""amazed"" when some said they had. Labour said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"". Asked about Mr Willsman's remarks, it said: ""We don't comment on individual cases."" The Jewish Labour Movement also accused the party of ""double standards"" over its decision to pursue disciplinary action against MPs Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin - both critics of Mr Corbyn and the new code of conduct. A Labour source said Mr Willsman's case had been treated ""like any other"", saying he had apologised and that meant the matter had been resolved. How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Jewish newspapers unite against Labour Following the publication of the recording, the NEC member said he had supported ""the decision to confirm the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism and to reopen development of the code in consultation with Jewish community organisations"". He added: ""Not all of what I said has been accurately reported. But I accept that what I did say, and the way I said it, fell short of the requirement, which I accept, for discussions of contentious issues to be conducted in a fully civil and respectful way."" He said he ""deeply"" apologised for any offence caused. Mr Willsman apologised again when speaking at the meeting of Labour's NEC, saying: ""I recognise the offensive nature of my comments.""

"Corrie Mckeague, pictured with his mother Nicola, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds Reported sightings of missing airman Corrie Mckeague who disappeared after a night out have topped 150, police say. Of those his mother, Nicola Urquhart, says she has been told 46 of those sightings were in Suffolk. Mr Mckeague, who was serving at RAF Honington, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September 2016. ""This number of reported sightings is not unusual in an inquiry of this length,"" Suffolk Police said. ""All reported sightings of Corrie have been subject to review and testing of their veracity based upon all the evidence held within this inquiry."" Writing on the Find Corrie Facebook page, Mrs Urquhart said she would now be reviewing information of the sightings in order to carry out independent targeted searches. She also urged anyone who had reported spotting Mr Mckeague in Suffolk to contact the force's major investigation team to check it was recorded. A police spokesman said searches have not only been carried out in the areas around Bury St Edmunds and Barton Mills but also other areas. In December, police called off their second landfill search, focused on an area next to the original excavation site Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST when he was captured on CCTV entering a bin loading bay known as the Horseshoe. In another Facebook post over the weekend, Mrs Urquhart said she still believed her son could have later left the Horseshoe without being recorded again on CCTV, but police had only collected some footage recorded after 06:00 on the day he disappeared. However, a police spokesman said: ""From footage seized both in and around the Horseshoe area and also in the wider Bury St Edmunds town centre area, Corrie is not seen.""

"The victims had been on a cycle tour of the Central Asian country (file image) Four foreign cyclists killed after a car hit them in Tajikistan on Sunday may have been victims of a deliberate attack, local officials say. Two Americans, a Swiss and a Dutch citizen died on Sunday in the Danghara district, about 70km (43 miles) south-east of the capital Dushanbe. Three other tourists were also injured by the car, which then drove off. Two people suspected of involvement in the incident were later killed by authorities in a special operation. The Islamic State (IS) group has claimed it carried out the attack on ""citizens of the crusader coalition"". According to the interior ministry, another four people were arrested in the same operation and a damaged car believed to have been involved was recovered. Another three suspects were ""rendered harmless"" after being traced to a village, officials said. It is unclear exactly what this means, however, Prague-based privately-owned Tajik news website Akhbor suggested they had been killed. How President Emomali Rakhmon consolidated his power Tajik leader's 'full title' rule comes into force Tajikistan profile Interior Minister Ramazon Rahimzoda said police were looking into various possible reasons for the incident - a road accident, robbery or a ""terrorist act"". He said the suspects ""had knives and firearms"". A video which appears to be of the same incident seems to capture the moment the car is driven into the unsuspecting cyclists. The grainy footage also seems to show a number of people already on the ground. According to the minister, three of the tourists died instantly and one on the way to a nearby hospital. ""One had knife wounds, he received medical help, now his condition is stable,"" Mr Rahimzoda told reporters. ""Another person is in a state of shock, he is receiving medical help as well. A third person, who fell behind the group, was not harmed so he was taken to the local (police) station, questioned and set free."" On Monday, Tajikistan's President Emomali Rakhmon sent notes of condolence to the US, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The victims were on a tour in the Central Asian country in a group with three other tourists from France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In a statement,,externalthe US embassy in Dushanbe said: ""We can confirm that two American cyclists were killed in the Danghara district on 29 July. Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to share further details."" The Dutch foreign ministry confirmed one of its citizens had died, telling news agency AFP that the man, 56, had been travelling with his 58-year-old partner. Authorities gave no further details about the victims. Tajikistan has struggled with poverty and instability since the former Soviet republic became independent in 1991.

"Dawn Sturgess' coffin was brought to the crematorium with a flower arrangement saying, ""Mum"". A ""very emotional service"" has taken place in Salisbury as family said goodbye to Dawn Sturgess, who died from exposure to the nerve agent Novichok. Over 100 people attended the ceremony, including her partner Charlie Rowley, who was also exposed to the agent. The Rev Philip Bromiley, who led the service, said Ms Sturgess ""won't be defined"" as a person by the tragic circumstances of her death. Her 11-year-old daughter told mourners how much she loved her mother. Public Health England had advised the funeral directors ahead of the ceremony, but reiterated itsadvice,externalthat risk to the public was low. Earlier reports that there would be no pallbearers were incorrect, and Ms Sturgess' coffin was carried into the crematorium. Ms Sturgess, 44, died on 8 July after she and Mr Rowley, 45, were exposed to Novichok the week before in Amesbury, Wiltshire. What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Mr Bromiley told the BBC that Mr Rowley was sitting on the front row throughout and Ms Sturgess' sister, Claire, delivered her eulogy. After Ms Sturgess' 11-year-old daughter read to the mourners, she received a round of applause. Speaking after the funeral, Mr Bromiley said: ""I think there was a lot of shock, but there were moments of laughter and moments of being able to remember who Dawn really was. ""Dawn won't be defined by being a story in a tragic set of circumstances. ""She was a mum and she was a person, and it was that person we commended to God today."" Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July High by James Blunt was played at the start of the service, and it ended with the title song from the musical Fame. Mr Bromiley said the theme of the funeral was peace. He added: ""Peace for her family, for her friends and the city of Salisbury and the surrounding towns and villages affected by the chaotic last few months."" Ms Sturgess' family and her partner attended the funeral The chief constable of Wiltshire Police, Kier Pritchard, also said he would be attending, along with deputy chief constable Paul Mills and the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, Angus Macpherson. The poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess came four months after the case of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The Skripals were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury in March after coming into contact with Novichok. They have since been discharged from hospital. Mr Rowley left hospital on 20 July Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on 29 June. They collapsed after exposure to the nerve agent at his house on 30 June. A murder inquiry was launched after Ms Sturgess' death. Mr Rowleytold ITV News,externalhe had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and gave it to his partner, who sprayed the substance on her wrists. Police refused to confirm Mr Rowley's claim but had previously said the substance was found in a ""small bottle"".

"This video can not be played 'My abortion pill took effect on the Tube home' Women are illegally taking abortion pills, which they have bought online, at home to avoid enduring abortions on public transport. In England, abortion pills must be administered in a clinic or hospital. For some this means the pill can take effect on their journey home. Campaigners say women should be able to take the second pill at home, as buying pills online can be dangerous. The Department of Health said it was monitoring the evidence on home use. Scotland and Wales have both recently changed the law to allow women to take the pill at home. Over the past three years, drug enforcement officers had seized almost 10,000 sets of abortion pills heading to addresses in Britain, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. England abortion pill rules 'out of step' Women having what is known as an early medical abortion must take two types of tablet, 24 to 48 hours apart. This means attending the same clinic twice, for each tablet. TheRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists(RCOG) has now called on England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, to change the legislation so that women can take the second pill at home. More than 50 MPs have done the same. RCOG's president, Prof Lesley Regan, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We know that when women are allowed to take the second tablet at home that it is safe, it's highly effective and they much, much prefer it."" Many experts believe current legislation is putting women at risk, due to the risks associated with buying the pills online. The World Health Organisation recommends home use of the abortion pill. Some hospitals and clinics in England are now allowing women to take both types of pill on the same day - even though this increases the risk of complications. Claudia Craig, who had an abortion last year, took a taxi home from hospital after taking the pill, and said within minutes the symptoms had begun. ""I started to feel really unwell and extremely nauseous,"" she said. ""I was getting that feeling in my chest like I was about to throw up."" Shortly after arriving home, following a 15-minute journey, she ""started retching and being very unwell on the bathroom floor"", she said. Claudia Craig says she felt ""extremely nauseous"" ""And then you lose control of your bowel movements."" She said had her taxi journey been a few minutes longer, she would not have made it home in time. ""All those symptoms would have been happening on the floor of the taxi. ""I would have been sick in the taxi, I would have started bleeding in the taxi and I would have lost control of my bowels in the taxi."" Another woman, Zoe Weldon, said she had started to feel the effects of the pill ""20 minutes into the journey on the Tube towards home"". ""I started to feel nauseous, started to sweat, started to feel really cold, went extremely pale apparently,"" she said. ""I had to get off the Tube. I lay down on a bench next to the Tube and basically decided I wasn't going to move any further. ""It was so painful and so frightening."" Kate Guthrie says more than 2,000 women have contacted her asking for pills Kate Guthrie, who has worked in abortion care for 30 years, now works for a service, Women on Web, which helps women who want to buy the tablets online. She told the Victoria Derbyshire programme in the past 18 months 2,212 women had contacted her asking for pills. Most were single mothers who could not get to clinics because they had children to look after. And others lived hundreds of miles away from a clinic. Since the change in law in Scotland, eight out of 10 women are now choosing to take the pill at home, according to NHS Lothian - equivalent to ""about 1,000 women"". One of their consultants, Dr Sharon Cameron, said the figure showed taking the pill at home was ""a really popular option and that this is what women want to do"". She added there had not been an increase in the rate of complications experienced by women. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was ""currently monitoring the proceedings in Scotland closely"". ""We have a tough regulator in place to ensure the care women receive is safe and of the highest quality.""

"Cathy Rentzenbrink said the court process was painful for families Legal permission will no longer be needed to withdraw treatment from patients in permanent vegetative state,the Supreme Court has ruled,external. It will now be easier to withdraw food and liquid to allow such patients to die across the UK. When families and doctors are in agreement, medical staff will be able to remove feeding tubes without applying to the Court of Protection. Lady Black ruled there was no violation under the Human Rights Convention. The families enduring 'an agonising wait' How many minimally conscious patients are there? Relatives who have faced the court process in the past said the ruling would help families dealing with a ""tragic situation"". But anti-assisted dying campaigners said vegetative patients are ""effectively going to be starved and dehydrated to death"". Previously the Court of Protection has ruled on cases but the process can take months or years, and it costs health authorities about Â£50,000 in legal fees to lodge an appeal. The ruling could have an impact on the thousands of families whose loved ones are in a vegetative state. There is estimated to be 1,500 new cases each year in England and Wales which would be affected, with about 3,000 of these patients alive at any one time. This video can not be played Court backs end-of-life judgement The case was brought to the Supreme Court after a banker in his 50s suffered a heart attack, resulting in severe brain damage. The man, known as Mr Y, was unresponsive after his heart attack last year and there was no chance of recovery. His family and his doctors agreed it would be in his best interests to allow him to die by withdrawing his feeding tube. The NHS trust asked the High Court to declare that it was not necessary to apply to the Court of Protection for a decision when the doctors and the family all believe it is in the patient's best interests. The judge agreed, but the official solicitor appealed on behalf of Mr Y - an appeal which has now been dismissed. Mr Y has since died but the case continued so that a court ruling could be made. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman For years -  so long as relatives agree, and it's in the best interests of a patient in a minimally conscious or vegetative state - doctors have been able to withdraw all sorts of treatment that will result in the end of someone's life. These include, for instance, the withdrawal of life-saving dialysis. Doctors do not need the permission of a court to be able to do this. However, withdrawing food and water - the most basic requirements for life - has been handled differently. Since the case of Hillsborough survivor Anthony Bland in 1993, it has been regarded as a matter of practice that doctors must seek the approval of a court, even when they and relatives agree withdrawal would be in the best interests of the patient. It has been treated as an exception, in part, perhaps, because of the emotional and psychological significance of the decision to remove sustenance from a person. This has resulted, some experts believe, in individuals spending longer on life support in a vegetative state than was necessary because hospitals have shied away from going to court due to the expense and bureaucracy involved. Monday's ruling makes clear that courts need not be involved in these sorts of cases, so long as doctors and families are in agreement, and it is in the best interests of the patient. However, the judgement cuts across ethical and religious beliefs and will divide opinion. Some will see it as compassionate and humane, others the removing of a vital legal safeguard for a highly vulnerable group. Author Cathy Rentzenbrink welcomed the ruling. Cathy Rentzenbrink's brother Matty spent eight years in a vegetative state Her brother Matty was severely brain damaged in a hit-and-run accident when he was 16 years old. He spent eight years in a vegetative state, and she says her family had to go through a painful process of allowing the court to allow food and water to be withdrawn so he could die in 1998. Ms Rentzenbrink, who wrote a book about her experience, told the BBC: ""For families to be put through a court case, on top of everything else that has happened to them, is a struggle."" She said not having to face a court would help families already facing an ""incredibly difficult"" time. She said one of the ""difficult things"" about her experience in court was being made to swear an affidavit that she wanted her brother to die. ""I didn't want my brother to die. I wanted him to get better,"" she said. ""I wanted him not to be knocked over in the first place - but I couldn't have any of those things."" She said: ""For all the families in this situation, they don't want to have to go to court and say they want someone to die."" The right to withdraw treatment from vegetative patients began in 1993 with Tony Bland, who had been in a vegetative state since 1989, until the House of Lords agreed that removing ""clinically assisted nutrition and hydration"" - where a patient is fed through tubes - did not constitute murder. But they did say referring similar cases to the Court of Protection was best practice. Hillsborough victim Tony Bland was in a vegetative state for four years until a landmark case allowed doctors to withdraw his feeding tubes In Monday's Supreme Court judgement, Lady Black said an agreement between families and doctors was sufficient safeguarding to ensure ""public confidence"". But she urged families to apply to court ""where there are differences of view"" between relatives or medical professionals.

They may open their eyes, wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals and have basic reflexes. They're also able to regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance A person in a vegetative state doesn't show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices. They also show no signs of experiencing emotions Continuing - or persistent - vegetative state is when this happens for more than four weeks Permanent vegetative state is defined as more than six months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury If a person is diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible Source: NHS Choices,external Dr Peter Saunders, director of anti-assisted dying group Care Not Killing, said he was ""very concerned and quite disappointed by the Supreme Court ruling"" on ending care for vegetative patients, who are ""effectively going to be starved and dehydrated to death"". He said it removed an ""additional layer"" of protection for vulnerable, and ""financial concerns"" about looking after vegetative patients could mean ""decisions may be made for the wrong reasons"". But the charity Compassion in Dying said it would ""allow those closest to a person - their loved ones and medical team - to feel supported and empowered to make the right decision for the person, even when it is a difficult one"".

"Corrie Mckeague was last seen entering a bin loading bay in Bury St Edmunds The police investigation into missing RAF airman Corrie Mckeague has cost Â£2.1m to date, according to figures. Mr Mckeague vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016. Information obtained by the BBC showed Suffolk Police has spent Â£1,325,000 on the investigation, plus Â£826,000 in officers' salaries. The force said ""careful consideration"" was given to resourcing all major, long-running investigations. Suffolk Police's budget for 2017/18 was Â£121.8m. The county's police and crime commissioner Tim Passmore has asked the government to cover the cost of the investigation. The mystery of the airman who disappeared Corrie Mckeague disappearance According to data received by the BBC following a Freedom of Information request, officers have spent 34,000 hours on the investigation - not including police staff time or overtime. The figures revealed 5,600 hours of overtime have been worked on the case, amounting to Â£235,000, excluding December's claims. Suffolk Police Federation said the inquiry had brought ""unique pressures"" to the force. Corrie Mckeague was last seen on CCTV at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 Figures from the Home Office show there were 249,349 missing person reports across 42 police forces in England and Wales in 2015/16. A study by the University of Portsmouth said the average cost of an investigation for a ""medium risk, medium term missing person"" was Â£2,415. It said 70% of all missing person cases were ""medium"" and on average took 36 hours and 37 minutes of officers' time to investigate. The Corrie Mckeague investigation has so far lasted one year and four months. Corrie Mckeague (front) was last seen walking into a bin loading bay Report co-writer Dr Karen Shalev Greene said the Mckeague investigation was ""one of the most expensive"". She said more costly cases included the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, which costmore than Â£10m, and April Jones,which topped Â£2m. ""But as an adult that went missing in as far as we know non-suspicious circumstances, I don't remember that intensity,"" she said. Suffolk Police Federation said overtime funded part of the search at a landfill site near Cambridge Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen about about 03:35 BST in Bury St Edmunds, walking into a bin loading bay. As part of the inquiry, police trawled a landfill site near Cambridge for Mr Mckeague's remains. The landfill search has ended but the police investigation is continuing. Darren Harris, chairman of Suffolk Police Federation, said the final eight weeks of the 28-week search were resourced by officers working on their rest days. He said: ""It's been unique, not only for Suffolk but for all police forces in England and Wales. ""Last time we have seen an investigation like this was in 2006 with the large-scale Steve Wright investigation with regards to the five working girls in Ipswich.""

"Corrie Mckeague, pictured with his mother Nicola, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds Reported sightings of missing airman Corrie Mckeague who disappeared after a night out have topped 150, police say. Of those his mother, Nicola Urquhart, says she has been told 46 of those sightings were in Suffolk. Mr Mckeague, who was serving at RAF Honington, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September 2016. ""This number of reported sightings is not unusual in an inquiry of this length,"" Suffolk Police said. ""All reported sightings of Corrie have been subject to review and testing of their veracity based upon all the evidence held within this inquiry."" Writing on the Find Corrie Facebook page, Mrs Urquhart said she would now be reviewing information of the sightings in order to carry out independent targeted searches. She also urged anyone who had reported spotting Mr Mckeague in Suffolk to contact the force's major investigation team to check it was recorded. A police spokesman said searches have not only been carried out in the areas around Bury St Edmunds and Barton Mills but also other areas. In December, police called off their second landfill search, focused on an area next to the original excavation site Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST when he was captured on CCTV entering a bin loading bay known as the Horseshoe. In another Facebook post over the weekend, Mrs Urquhart said she still believed her son could have later left the Horseshoe without being recorded again on CCTV, but police had only collected some footage recorded after 06:00 on the day he disappeared. However, a police spokesman said: ""From footage seized both in and around the Horseshoe area and also in the wider Bury St Edmunds town centre area, Corrie is not seen.""

"Struggling House of Fraser is understood to have been approached by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley over a fresh investment deal. The sports chain owns an 11.1% stake in House of Fraser, which last month detailed plans to close 31 of its 59 shops as part of a rescue deal. According to Sky News,,externalHouse of Fraser needs Â£50m to prevent it collapsing. But sources close to the department store chain have denied the chain's survival is under threat. House of Fraser to close 31 stores House of Fraser store closure plan backed Landlords challenge House of Fraser rescue The department store chain has previously said it has no short-term funding issues. Creditors have already backed House of Fraser's restructuring, buta group of landlords is taking them to courtover the plan which has thrown it into doubt. The landlords claim the plan - which will see their rents slashed - is unfair to them. The department store chain is currently awaiting a Â£70m investment from Chinese investor, C.banner, which also owns toy shop Hamley's. C.banner said in May it planned to take a majority stake in House of Fraser, but has said it will not go ahead with the deal until the store closure and rent reduction rescue plan is agreed. Mr Ashley is believed to have approached House of Fraser around four weeks ago, before landlords challenged the retailer's rescue deal. He is understood to have told House of Fraser's advisers he could ""offer something better"" than C.banner. Mr Ashley could not be reached for comment. House of Fraser is using company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a form of insolvency proceedings, to overhaul its business. CVAs are being increasingly used by struggling retailers as a way to close stores, but landlords argue that they are being abused as a quick way to cut rents. House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers struggling amid falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys R Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive. The House of Fraser Group has annual sales of Â£1.2bn. It employs about 5,000 people directly and also has 12,500 concession staff.

"This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Willsman said and why it matters Labour is facing growing calls to take action against an ally of Jeremy Corbyn after he was recorded criticising members of the Jewish community. During a meeting of the ruling National Executive Committee, Peter Willsman suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks. Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He has apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported. He also said he would be referring himself for equalities training. What's the anti-Semitism row doing to Labour? How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Councillor suspended in anti-Semitism row Jewish newspapers unite against Labour But Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said he should be ""summarily expelled"", and the Jewish Labour Movement called for his suspension and a disciplinary investigation. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused Mr Willsman of being a ""loud-mouthed bully"" and high-profile supporters of Mr Corbyn have also taken to Twitter to urge Mr Willsman to withdraw from the elections to the NEC. He was supported by Labour MP and former frontbencher Chris Williamson who endorsed him for the ruling body vote. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the row had added significance because Mr Willsman had been a ""fellow traveller politically"" of the Labour leader over the years and was a leading ""Corbynite"". The recording,published by the Jewish Chronicle,external, was made at an NEC meeting earlier this month which took place after more than 60 British rabbis signed an open letter that said anti-Semitism in sections of the Labour Party was ""severe and widespread"". This followedcriticism of the party's new code of conducton anti-Semitism, which  critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition.

In the recording, Mr Willsman can be heard discussing the rabbis' open letter with other NEC members. Mr Willsman says he does not want to be ""lectured to by Trump fanatics"", and argues the NEC should ask the rabbis for ""evidence of severe and widespread anti-Semitism"" in the party. He then asks those at the meeting to raise their hands if they had witnessed anti-Semitism in the Labour party - and said he was ""amazed"" when some said they had. Labour said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"". Asked about Mr Willsman's remarks, it said: ""We don't comment on individual cases."" The Jewish Labour Movement also accused the party of ""double standards"" over its decision to pursue disciplinary action against MPs Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin - both critics of Mr Corbyn and the new code of conduct. A Labour source said Mr Willsman's case had been treated ""like any other"", saying he had apologised and that meant the matter had been resolved. How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Jewish newspapers unite against Labour Following the publication of the recording, the NEC member said he had supported ""the decision to confirm the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism and to reopen development of the code in consultation with Jewish community organisations"". He added: ""Not all of what I said has been accurately reported. But I accept that what I did say, and the way I said it, fell short of the requirement, which I accept, for discussions of contentious issues to be conducted in a fully civil and respectful way."" He said he ""deeply"" apologised for any offence caused. Mr Willsman apologised again when speaking at the meeting of Labour's NEC, saying: ""I recognise the offensive nature of my comments.""

"Oxfam is to make Â£16m of cuts because of reduced funding in the wake of the Haiti sex scandal. The charity was accused of covering up claims that staff sexually exploited female victims of the 2010 earthquake. After the scandal emergedthousands of people stopped making regular donationsand the government suspended its funding to the charity. An Oxfam statement said it was ""devastated"" that it would have to reduce some of its aid programmes. However, it said it would target its head offices and support functions to ensure that the majority of its work on the ground could continue. Oxfam chief executive to stand down Oxfam GB banned from Haiti after sex scandal How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Claims first emerged in the Times,externalin February that staff, including former country director Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes while based in Haiti after the earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. The charity's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. In February, Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to Haiti. Oxfam GB chief executive Mark Goldring announced his resignation last month, saying that someone else should help ""rebuild"" the group following the scandal. Earlier this week it was confirmed that Oxfam GB had been banned from operating in Haiti. Oxfam GB's annual income last yearwas Â£408.6m and it says it spent Â£303.5m on ""charitable activities"".,external- including development and humanitarian projects and campaigning. Following the announcement of the cuts, an Oxfam spokesperson said: ""We are devastated that the appalling behaviour of some former staff in Haiti and shortcomings in how we dealt with that eight years ago means we now have less money to provide clean water, food and other support to people who need it. ""We are immensely grateful to all those - including more than nine in 10 of our regular givers - who have continued to support us during these difficult times.

"It is a ""scandal"" that some children start school unable to speak in full sentences, Education Secretary Damian Hinds has said in a speech. And if children reach Year 1 unable to read simple words, they rarely catch up, ""the gap just widens"", he said. He has pledged to halve the number of pupils starting school behind in early talking and reading skills by 2028. A group of companies and charities have been brought together to work out how best to support families in England. Educational researchers have long said that social mobility - or the lack of it - starts at home with what's known as the home learning environment. The idea is that a home with a lot of books and other early learning materials, plus engaged parents giving their children quality time, talking with them and teaching them how to make letter sounds, for example, provides a good start. But not all parents feel able to offer this kind of home environment or realise the importance of it. Researchers from the Education Policy Institute last week said the development gap between England's poorest pupils, and the others, was already at 4.3 months in the early years. And that it grew to 9.4 months by the end of primary school. Mr Hinds said, in the speech in London, that this early gap had a ""huge impact on social mobility"". ""The truth is the vast majority of these children's time is at home. ""Yes the home learning environment can be, understandably, the last taboo in education policy - but we can't afford to ignore it when it comes social mobility. ""I don't have interest in lecturing parents here... I know it's parents who bring up their children, who love them. who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children. ""But that doesn't mean extra support and advice can't be helpful."" The Department for Education says 28% of children in England do not have the required language skills by the end of Reception. Children who communicate well early tend to do better in their lives But this rises to much higher percentages in deprived areas. Mr Hinds also says he is particularly keen to use technology to build awareness of what parents can do to boost early language development. The speech comes a few months after communication charities, and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, published their own report on the lack of progress on improving speech and language services over the past decade. It was based on responses to a major independent cross-government review of such services chaired by John Bercow, which was published 10 years ago. Bercow 10 Years On,externalsaid that communication was crucial to children's life chances but awareness of its importance among the public and decision-makers was not sufficient. Services were inaccessible and inequitable, it said, and too often support for children's speech, language and communication needs was based on the available resources, rather than what was needed, leading to great variations across the country. It also said some measures shown to have worked well had been cut to save money. The government is yet to respond to that report. Bob Reitemeier,  chief executive of I Can, the children's communication charity,  welcomed the plans but said the coalition of companies and charities must include experts with experience of supporting children with speech, language and communication needs. ""Research shows that in some areas of deprivation 50% of children are starting school well behind their peers in language development. ""Without support, the gap between these children and other children will continue to widen, year on year, putting their life chances at risk.""

"The woman, who is from Leeds and is now 20, has had to assume a new identity A husband and wife have been jailed for tricking their daughter into travelling to Bangladesh in order to force her into marriage. The couple were described as ""monsters"" by their daughter who they had threatened to kill if she did not go ahead with the arrangement. The father was jailed for four-and-a-half years and the mother for three-and-a-half years at Leeds Crown Court. None of those involved in the case can be named. More stories from Yorkshire The then 18-year-old daughter had to be rescued from a remote village in an operation by the British High Commission involving armed police, the judge heard, The woman, who is from Leeds and is now aged 20, described in a victim impact statement how she had assumed a new identity and lived in fear of her family. She said: ""I know I will always have to remain cautious but, knowing those monsters are going to be in prison, I feel the uttermost freedom in my heart. ""I want other girls to know that forcing someone to marry is wrong."" The woman was taken to Bangladesh with other family members for what they had been told was a holiday. But the parents had made extensive plans for her wedding to a first cousin. She reacted against the plan and her father hit her, with her mother's encouragement, the court heard. Her father said he would ""chop her up in 18 seconds"" if she continued to reject the proposed marriage, the judge was told. The woman managed to alert the police through her boyfriend in the UK and the court was played some of the messages she left on his phone. Judge Simon Phillips QC said of the recordings: ""Her terror and distress is palpable."" Judge Phillips heard how the woman escaped with only the clothes she was wearing and a Leeds bus pass. The woman said: ""I was betrayed by the two people who are supposed to protect, love and keep you safe."" She was born in the UK, lived a Westernised-lifestyle and was hoping to go to university, the court heard. Dafydd Enoch QC, defending her father, told the court: ""These events are not borne out of malice, hate, greed or prejudice. They were borne of deep-seated culture."" The pair were found guilty of forced marriage and a count of using violence, threats or coercion to force their daughter into marriage, following a three-week trial earlier this year. Peter Mann, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said ""This successful prosecution and the custodial sentences imposed send a clear message that forced marriage is a very serious crime and those responsible will be prosecuted."" It is thought to be only the second case of its kind. A woman was jailed for four-and-a-half yearsat Birmingham Crown Court after forcing her daughter to marry in Pakistan in the first successful prosecution.
