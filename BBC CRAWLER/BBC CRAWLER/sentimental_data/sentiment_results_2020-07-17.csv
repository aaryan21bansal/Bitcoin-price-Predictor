"Fahim Selah was best known for his role in creating popular start-ups in Nigeria and Bangladesh A man has been charged with the murder of leading tech entrepreneur Fahim Saleh who was found dead in New York on Tuesday, police say. The body of Saleh, 33, was found decapitated and dismembered in his Manhattan apartment. His 21-year-old executive assistant Tyrese Haspil has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The suspect is alleged to have owed Saleh tens of thousands of dollars, police said. The entrepreneur was best known for his role in creating popular ride-sharing companies in Nigeria and Bangladesh. Mr Haspil is accused of using a taser on Saleh and then fatally stabbing him on Monday. ""[The suspect] handled [Saleh's] finances and personal matters,"" NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison told reporters after the arrest on Friday. ""It is also believed that he owed the victim a significant amount of money."" New York Police Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison announced the arrest on Friday Saleh's body was discovered by his cousin who checked on him on Tuesday afternoon after he had not been seen for several days, Chief Harrison said. According to US media reports, CCTV footage from the building in which Saleh lived showed him entering a lift with a man wearing a mask on Monday. His body was discovered with an electric saw placed nearby, police said. The 33-year-old was the son of Bangladeshi immigrants and created his first company while still in high school. He went on to co-found the ride company Pathao, which is popular in Bangladesh and Nepal, in 2015. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Both companies have paid tribute to the entrepreneur. Gokada described Saleh as""a great leader, inspiration and positive light for all of us"" in its tweet.,external Hussain M Elius, who co-founded Pathao with Saleh, told Bangladesh's Daily Star newspaper: ""Fahim believed in the potential for technology to transform lives in Bangladesh and beyond. ""He saw the promise in us when all we had was a common purpose and a shared vision. He was, and will forever remain, an incredible inspiration for Pathao and our entire ecosystem.""

"It's been 16 weeks since bowling alleys and casinos closed their doors, but on FridayBoris Johnson gave them the go-aheadto reopen from 1 August in England. Customers have been itching to get back, businesses say. But the experience will look a little different to what we're used to. Hollywood Bowl is preparing to reopen all 54 of its venues in two weeks' time, but it'll be out with the bowling shoes and in with the plastic gloves. The vast majority of the company's 1,900 furloughed staff members will return to work as soon as the doors reopen, says chief financial officer, Laurence Keen - but only after they've had their temperature checked. Like all firms reopening, they've had to make sure they're abiding by the government's Covid-secure guidelines, which involve grappling with dozens of safety questions specific to each business. For instance, coronavirus is known to spread through contact with surfaces, which isn't ideal for a game which involves repeatedly touching bowling balls. What can I do now? PM's plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM Staff at Hollywood Bowl will be cleaning bowling balls before and after each game, Laurence explains, with sanitiser on-hand for customers. The clattering of pins might not as deafening as usual though, as every other lane will be closed to allow for social distancing. Players will also be capped at six per lane - as opposed to eight before the pandemic. Staff will wear gloves, he says, and customers will be offered them too. So far, they've shelled out for 400,000 pairs of gloves, which Laurence expects will last ""a good 12 to 16 weeks"", depending on how many customers want them. They're also hoping bowling shoes will become a thing of the past, as people will be encouraged to wear their own. (If you're wondering what the point of bowling shoes were in the first place, they help you slide across the floor. ""But nobody does that apart from the professionals,"" Laurence says.) Lanes will look significantly emptier as every other one will be closed to allow for social distancing Many changes may have been made, but will customers turn up to see them? Laurence is feeling positive: ""A lot of the areas that have been allowed to open previously have been more targeted towards the older generation, but actually our kids are desperate to do things outside the four walls of the house."" They may be hoping to welcome back families in droves, but with every other lane closed, the company is having to cut their potential customer numbers in half. They aren't too worried though as they would usually only see 35% of lanes filled on weekdays before the pandemic, but they do expect to lose some custom on weekends. At 50% revenue, the company will still be profitable, Laurence says, ""albeit just"". Meanwhile, Jonathon Swaine, the managing director of venues at Grosvenor Casinos, says he's been waiting - ""patiently"" - for the green light from the government for months. The company is now getting ready to welcome back 4,500 employees, the vast majority of whom have been furloughed. Maintaining social distancing has been one of the biggest problems for many firms - but Jonathon says that ""isn't so much of a problem"" for them. ""We're lucky with our casinos that, even with 50% capacity, generally our casinos are very spacious venues. We don't have the problems that pubs have."" Floor markers will help players make their way round the building And he's confident that their longer opening hours will help mitigate against the customer cap they're introducing in their 43 venues. Players arriving at busier sites will face temperature checks as well as redesigned routes through the building to help keep people at a safe distance. And inside the casino, plastic screens will separate people playing blackjack and American roulette, with dealers wearing visors. Gaming chips present a similar problem to bowling balls, but Jonathon says all tokens will be sanitised before and after use, and customers will only play with their own chips. Adapting in this way hasn't come cheap. ""The screens, the sanitiser, the additional measures that we've put in place have all been significant investments,"" Jonathon says. ""But we clearly think it's the right thing to do to reassure our customers."" Plastic screens will become a regular sight at casinos in future Reassurance has been ""right at the top of the customers' needs"" according to their research, so it's important for them to get that right. But with some people still cautious, is he confident that reopening will be pay off? ""If we can bring as many people back as possible, and open as quickly and as safely as possible, we've got the best chance of a sustainable business,"" he says. ""We can't wait.""

"In the footage several police cars attend the arrest after officers are confronted by onlookers An officer has been suspended after footage emerged that appears to show police kneeling on a man's neck. Video recorded in Islington, London, shows two officers holding a handcuffed suspect, who is black, on the pavement. A second officer has been removed from operational duty following the arrest on Thursday evening. Deputy Met Police commissioner Sir Steve House said the footage was ""extremely disturbing"" and had been referred to the police watchdog. The force confirmed it had charged a 45-year-old man with possession of a knife in a public place. Marcus Coutain, of Islington, is due to appear in custody at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Saturday. In the footage, shared with the BBC, one of the officers appears to be using his knee to control the suspect and has his hand on the man's head. The man on the ground, who is in handcuffs, repeatedly shouts: ""Get off my neck."" He is eventually released from the ground and continues to talk to officers after they sit him up. Several police cars arrive at the scene after the arresting officers are confronted by onlookers. An eye witness told the BBC: ""I was worried he was going to get executed. That's just how George Floyd got killed. ""If not for the crowds filming the police they could have suffocated him or broken his neck. ""He was on the floor and in handcuffs, what's the reason for a kneeling on his neck?"" Sir Steve said: ""The video footage that I have seen today and is circulating on social media is extremely disturbing. ""Some of the techniques used cause me great concern - they are not taught in police training. ""One officer has been suspended and another officer has been removed from operational duty, but not suspended at this time. This decision will be kept under review."" The man had since been seen by a doctor, Scotland Yard said. It has also referred the arrest to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Sir Steve's comments were highly unusual both in tone and content, particularly because the force had seen police body-worn footage which has not been made publicly available. He added that the former Police Scotland chief constable had complained earlier this week that some officers were being unfairly targeted because of social media clips which did not show the full context of situations. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""I'm deeply concerned about this distressing incident and we have raised this with senior officers at the Met Police as a matter of urgency. ""I welcome the fact the incident has been reviewed quickly by the Met and it's right that they have referred it to the IOPC."" The IOPC said it would conduct an independent investigation, according to the Met.

"Brazil provides more than a quarter of EU beef imports Up to one-fifth of Brazil's soya exports to the European Union may be ""contaminated"" by illegal deforestation, a study has found. Researchers used freely available maps and data to identify the specific farms and ranches clearing forests to produce soya and beef destined for Europe. They found 2% of properties were responsible for 62% of illegal deforestation. These ""bad apples"" have global environmental consequences, they said. Prof Raoni RajÃ£o, of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Brazil, said it was up to the country's political and economic leaders to root out ""the bad apples in the soy and beef sectors"". ""Brazil has the information it needs to take swift and decisive action against these rule-breakers to ensure that its exports are deforestation-free,"" he said. Amazon forest fires in 2019 led to global protests Reports from non-governmental organisations and journalistic investigations have previously revealed cases of soya and beef being produced in areas of deforestation and exported. But this is the first study to link property-level illegal deforestation with export data. The research, published in the journalScience,external, found that 2% of properties in the Amazon rainforest and the Cerrado grasslands are responsible for 62% of all potentially illegal deforestation. Roughly 20% of soya exports and at least 17% of beef exports to the EU may be ""contaminated with illegal deforestation"", the researchers said. According to their analysis, two million tons of soya grown on properties with illegal deforestation may have reached EU markets annually during the period of analysis, 500,000 of which came from the Amazon. As the soya is fed mainly to livestock, customers can't be sure whether the meat they buy is ""deforestation-free"". Duncan Brack, of the Chatham House think tank, said the study strengthened the argument for government measures to end UK consumers' contribution to deforestation, such as a due-diligence or duty-of-care obligation on companies importing products such as beef or soya. A recent report found the majority of all soya (65%) comes from countries with high deforestation rates. The land required overseas to meet the UK's annual demand for soya between 2016 and 2018 equated to an area approaching the size of Wales, according to environmental groups WWF and the RSPB. ""Without knowing it, we're eating meat and dairy products from animals fed on soy grown on deforested land in Brazil,"" said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF-UK. ""We need to stop importing habitat destruction."" In 2019,an area of primary forest the size of a football pitch was lost every six seconds across the world, according to a study by the University of Maryland, US. Brazil accounted for a third of it, its worst loss in 13 years apart from huge spikes in 2016 and 2017 from fires. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"More than 2,530 officers were involved in the operation, police said German police have arrested a suspected gunman nicknamed ""Rambo"" after a five-day manhunt in the Black Forest. Yves Rausch, 31, is said to have fled into the forest near Oppenau, in south-west Germany, on Sunday after threatening four police officers and taking their pistols. An elite unit, helicopters, thermal detectors and sniffer dogs had been deployed to find him. More than 2,530 officers were involved in the operation, police said. The suspect was found hiding in a bush with four handguns placed in front of him and an axe in his lap, deputy regional police chief Juergen Rieger told reporters. Mr Rausch was slightly injured in the operation, as was a police officer by the axe, Mr Rieger added. Neither needed hospital treatment. A postal worker gave police information which helped lead to his arrest. ""I am very relieved - I think a line can be drawn under a really extraordinary situation for our little town,"" Mayor Uwe Gaiser said, according to Associated Press. Yves Rausch's hut near Oppenau Police were initially called over reports of a suspicious man hanging around a hut in forest near Oppenau on Sunday. They found Mr Rausch in a hut on the edge of the forest, and said he had first appeared co-operative before suddenly pulling out a pistol and disarming the four officers. He was wearing camouflage gear. Media reports have nicknamed him ""Rambo"" after the fictional, violent Vietnam war veteran who goes on the run from US police. Police say he had lived in the Oppenau area a long time and he is believed to know the forest well. German police released this image of the suspect, Yves Rausch His mother said he was evicted from his rented flat last year. It is unclear if it is the same flat which Bild reported he had rented above a local inn last year, where he had set up a shooting range in his attic. He had gone to stay at an aunt's home before finally making a home for himself in the forest, his mother added. She described him as a ""woodsman"", saying ""he wanted to escape into nature, to be free"". According to his mother, he grew his own vegetables, used the hut as his home, and carved wooden gnomes which he hoped to sell. His mother said she had had a coffee with him at a local market on 8 July and he had appeared ""perfectly normal"". He has a lengthy criminal record. Ten years ago, he was handed a juvenile sentence of more than three years for shooting a woman with a crossbow. Last year, he was found in possession of child pornography while under investigation for possession of explosives.

"Some fans were seen wearing Leeds United face masks during the celebrations Leeds supporters have gathered outside the club's stadium to celebrate their return to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years. Leeds' owner Andrea Radrizzani and the police had urged fans to stay at home. However, there was jubilation outside Elland Road as the club's place in the top-flight was confirmed when West Brom lost to Huddersfield Town earlier. Last month Liverpool fans flocked to Anfield to celebrate winning the league. Under social distancing guidelines, people in England should keep a distance of at least 1m while observing precautions toreduce the risk of coronavirus. Leeds United promoted to Premier League after 16-year absence This video can not be played Fans celebrate at home as Leeds are promoted in the midst of the coronavirus crisis Fans were seen celebrating together despite social distancing rules The smoke from blue and yellow flares filled the air outside Elland Road While hundreds of Leeds fans headed to the ground, countless others celebrated the historic moment at home, although manager Marcelo Bielsa hadsaid he would not watch the game. Phil Beeton, co-chairman of Leeds United Supporters Club said: ""It's absolutely brilliant, I'm just so pleased for everyone. ""It's been such an up and down few weeks and the games have come so thick and fast that you've not had one minute to get over the last game before you're looking at the next one. ""You've got to not lose sight of the fact that we've been through a horrendous period and an awful lot of people have lost their lives, I dare say a lot of Leeds fans too, and we've done it for them.""

""Let's hope we can consolidate for next year and I'm sure we'll put on a good show and show the world we deserve to be where we are.

""The fight against Covid-19 is not yet over and we must continue to be sensible,"" Radrizzani wrote in an open letter to supporters published in theYorkshire Evening Post.,external His sentiments were echoed by West Yorkshire Police. Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the force said:"" It's important to remember that Covid-19 is still with us and large gatherings are still not permitted. ""We understand that fans will want to celebrate but ask them to bear in mind their own safety and wellbeing, as well as that of others.

Blue and yellow flares were let off as people stood next to the Billy Bremner statue raising cans of beer in celebration. Obviously it's still against the rules to gather in large groups and stewards were trying to enforce social distancing with police also patrolling. But it was almost impossible for many of the fans not to be standing shoulder to shoulder and there were few masks on show. Leeds players were cheered when they appeared at a window overlooking the crowd Leeds-born Kalvin Phillips came out to celebrate with the crowd from a distance Leeds put themselves on the brink of promotion when they beat Barnsley 1-0 on Thursday to move six points clear of third-placed Brentford with two games remaining. The result meant their long exile from the top-flight would end if West Brom failed to beat Huddersfield or the Bees dropped points at Stoke.

"More than 140 prisoners have been housed in hotels and B&Bs after being released during the Covid-19 lockdown. They include some offenders who have been freed from their sentences early to relieve overcrowding and reduce the risk of infection in jails. A letter to hotel owners, seen by BBC News, says if they agree to take part in the scheme they will not be told the crime the prisoner has committed. The government said hotels were used only as a ""last resort"". All offenders due for release are ""thoroughly risk assessed"", the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) added. Virus response scheme sees 33 prisoners released Thousands of Covid-19 cases in prisons, says study The department said it had started using hotels in May, as part of the ""Conditional Release Date"" accommodation scheme, to prevent newly-freed prisoners having to sleep rough during the pandemic. The MoJ said 304 former inmates let out on their scheduled release date have been provided with housing, 136 of whom have been put up in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation. Hotels have also been used to house six offenders freed early under an emergency programme to reduce overcrowding, known as the ""End of Custody Temporary Release"" scheme. According to officials, hotels for prisoners are identified by two business travel, conference and accommodation agencies, CTM and Calder. A hotel owner in the north of England said he had received a letter, written by the Prison and Probation Service, asking whether he would have rooms available for offenders on the early release scheme. The letter says accommodation in hotels, B&Bs and serviced apartments would be needed for up to 56 days. It says: ""We will not share information with you regarding the offence(s) the individual has committed but would wish to reassure that they have been subject to strict vetting."" The letter explains that electronic monitoring equipment would have to be installed in an offender's hotel room to ensure they abide by a curfew, but says staff would not be responsible for managing a prisoner's licence conditions. ""All incidents of concern should be dealt with in the same way as you would deal with any other resident and if local measures don't work (eg a phone call from reception to keep the noise down) be reported to police,"" the letter says. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Although it is highly unusual for released prisoners to be accommodated in hotels, they have been used for asylum seekers, most recently, and controversially, in Glasgow. In June, six people were stabbed at a hotel in the city which had been used to house asylum claimants. Their attacker - Badreddin Abadlla Adam -was shot dead by police. A MoJ spokesperson said: ""All offenders due for release are thoroughly risk assessed and hotels have only been used as a last resort to reduce any potential spread of coronavirus.

"Campaigners are concerned about pedestrian safety standards for US vehicles Safety experts are urging the UK government to exclude American cars from any post-Brexit trade deal. They say imported vehicles should meet British safety standards for accidents with pedestrians, cyclists and children. UK PM Boris Johnson has indicated he expects cars to be included in any new transatlantic trade agreement. But safety campaigners point to a spike of pedestrian injuries and deaths in US road accidents. The increase is associated with a boom in large SUVs, which have been engineered to protect passengers but not pedestrians. The UK government said safety standards would not be ""diminished"" as a result of talks. UK-US trade talks will not be an easy ride Segway: End of the road for the much-hyped two-wheeler Traffic levels 'now double the lockdown low' In the UK and Europe, cars are designed to minimise harm to people on foot or on bikes if they are hit by a vehicle. SUVs sold in the UK must meet the standards. The Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety has written to Trade Secretary Liz Truss, saying: âWe note that in negotiations covering food safety the USA has argued against accepting higher UK standards. It has sought to characterise these as protectionism. âWe are concerned that pressure for lower safety standards will be applied in negotiations regarding the automotive sector. âUS vehicle safety standards are much lower than those permitted for vehicles sold in the UK.â David Ward, president of the Global New Car Assessment Programme, told BBC News: âUS crash standards are much lower for pedestrians... we simply canât let American vehicles into the UK if they donât meet our standards.â A Department for Transport spokeswoman told BBC News the government would decide its own safety regulations after Brexit. âRoad safety or environmental standards will not be diminished as part of a free trade agreement with the USA or any other country,â she said. But safety campaigners note that, on the parallel issue of whether to allow imports of chlorinated chicken from the US, ministers are under relentless pressure to give way. The head of the UK Transport Research Laboratory, Richard Cuerden, said: âWe know the PM and others have said the automotive sector is on the cards for a new trade deal after Brexit. Well, itâs fine to trade â but they have to meet our rules in this regard.â Donald Trump has spoken of his desire to sign a free trade deal with the UK US President Donald Trump has previously derided safety standards for pedestrians - although the White House later said he was joking. A Ford Europe spokesperson said the firm had no intention of trying to bring vehicles into Europe that did not comply with regulations. But Mr Cuerden said, from past experience, US negotiators would typically insist on equivalence of free access between markets. That meant cars could be used as a bargaining chip in the talks. Mr Cuerden also warned that many of the UKâs crash barriers were designed to resist a car of standard weight and height. If British drivers started to buy large US-style SUVs in big numbers, the barriers might have to be replaced. Big SUVs are thefocus of concern among US experts,,externaltoo. A study from the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) said while the number of people killed in road crashes had fallen overall, the number of pedestrians killed by vehicles had risen by 53% over a decade. Over the same period, the share of SUVs in the vehicle fleet rose to 29% from 21% - a trend replicated in the UK. IIHS said design changes meant US SUVs no longer posed a greater threat to the occupants of other vehicles but there had not been a similar effort to address the danger that large SUVs posed to pedestrians. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents US carmakers, said cars made there were just as safe as European vehicles. He told BBC News: ""Cars, SUVs and other light trucks that meet US safety standards achieve equivalent safety performance to the safety standards applied in the European Union. ""A US-UK trade agreement should address the tariff and technical barriers to open US-UK automotive trade. This would increase competition and provide more consumer choice.""

"Kirk Butcher was described by his family as a ""fun-loving husband"" who adored his three daughters A van driver who drove the wrong way down a motorway slip road, killing a father of three in a head-on crash, has been jailed. Thomas Hughes, 24, was trying to take his own life when he drove on to the M4 at Newport, hitting Kirk Butcher's car on 5 April. Mr Butcher, 45, was killed instantly. Hughes, from Cwmbran, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to seven years. The court heard how Hughes had been released from police custody, and had driven towards the M4 after being told by his flatmate he was not welcome back. It was told he was trying to take his own life when he drove the wrong way down the slip road. But the van he was driving crashed into Mr Butcher's car, who was on his way home from a 12-hour shift at a supermarket depot where he had started working during the coronavirus pandemic. Hughes left the scene of the crash, and another driver called 999. In a victim impact statement, Mr Butcher's widow Janet told the court the couple had been ""childhood sweethearts, soulmates who dreamed of getting old together"". She said ""nothing in our lives will be the same"" following her husband's death. Gwent Police said Hughes' actions were a ""senseless and selfish act"" Sentencing Hughes, Judge Richard Twomlow said he ""gave Mr Butcher no chance to avoid you"". ""This was an unbelievably dangerous piece of driving with no thought for anyone but yourself,"" he said. ""The consequences for others were quite terrible."" After the hearing, Mr Butcher's family called for a change in the law so that a car was recognised as a ""deadly weapon"". His stepsister, Sarah Higgins, said: ""We're devastated. He's left three children behind and a beautiful wife. ""He was the busiest, nicest guy you could ever hope to meet and he's gone. Nothing's going to change that."" PC Darren Sullivan, of Gwent Police, said Hughes' actions were a ""senseless and selfish act, which took the life of an innocent man"".""This tragedy was completely avoidable and Hughes will have to live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life, although that will provide little comfort to the Butcher family,"" he said.""Too many people die on our roads every year in senseless and often avoidable circumstances. ""I can only hope that the sentence passed today will act as a deterrent to anyone intent on driving in such a dangerous and reckless manner.""Hughes was also banned from driving for eight and a half years.

"Some of the restrictions on people shielding from coronavirus have been eased, allowing them to go out more. There are about 180,000 people shielding in Scotland and they are now able to go on holiday and visit outdoor markets and gardens. Couples who do not live together are also allowed to meet up without distancing. It is hoped the need for shielding could be paused entirely by August. The shielding group includes those who are at the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus such as people with cancer and severe respiratory conditions. Shielding extended until 31 July 'People shielding too scared to leave home' Who should be shielding? Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes to be able to pause the need for shielding entirely at the end of July, but added: ""We would still encourage those in this group to take extra care. ""I know returning to something like normal life will be welcome, but I appreciate it is also known to be quite daunting."" The change in advice means that the shielded can stay at holiday accommodation, including hotels, and visit outdoor markets or public gardens. Marie Seggie and her mum Katie who died of Alzheimer's at the start of May The easing of the lockdown restrictions will change little for Marie Seggie and her shielding regime. Living with a chronic condition that has left her with only 20% lung capacity means the nursery worker has not ventured far from her Coatbridge home since March. Marie's 88-year-old mother Katie died in May and this was by far the toughest phase of lockdown, the nursery worker explained. ""It was heartbreaking, the rest of the family could rally round but I was so restricted in what I could do - I couldn't be there for her at the end. ""I feel like I've not really been grieving either because everything has been on hold."" Shielding has also meant sacrifices for Marie's family. Daughter Emily, a midwife, moved out of the family home to ensure there was no danger of making her mum ill, while husband Bobby and their other daughter Laura are self-isolating with Marie. ""It's been hard not seeing my family properly and I also feel guilty when you see so many people around you helping others but I'm not,"" she said. ""I don't think the changes will make a huge difference to me just now, I can't wear a mask because of my chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and I am still really nervous about going to the shops."" The 57-year-old added: ""I think our first outing will be to a garden centre or somewhere outdoors like that, but even that feels like a big step right now.""

"Leeds United have been promoted to the Premier League after 16 years away. Their place in the top flight for next season was confirmed by West Brom's2-1 defeat at Huddersfield Townon Friday. Leeds will now be crowned champions if Brentford do not beat Stoke on Saturday or the Whites then take a point from Sunday's visit to Derby County. Argentine Marcelo Bielsa has led the Yorkshire side to promotion in his second season in charge after finishing third in the Championship in 2018-19. Even allowing for the enforced break because of the coronavirus pandemic, it has been a campaign where Leeds have never really looked like repeating mistakes of previous seasons and they have not been outside the top two since November. They had seemed set to win promotion last season only for back-to-back defeats by Wigan and Brentford to leave them third behind Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United, before a dramatic 4-3 play-off semi-final defeat by Derby. After that setback, fans could have been forgiven for fearing the worst about the future of Bielsa and the talented group of players he had assembled. But he opted to remain with the club and together they have reaped the rewards. Relive Huddersfield's victory that promoted Leeds Which clubs were in the top flight the last time Leeds were there? Leeds are back - 10 moments that mattered under Bielsa Leeds fans gather to celebrate promotion It has been a long and often painful journey back to the Premier League for Leeds and their fans, who had seen their team reach the semi-final of the Champions League in 2001. The club was in a dreadful financial position when they were relegated to the Championship in 2004 and though Kevin Blackwell - the first of 15 managers employed by Leeds since they were last in the top flight - steadied the ship initially and nearly took them back up in 2005-06, they were placed into administration in 2007 and went down to League One. Worse was to come in the form of a 15-point deduction to start the following campaign and it took them three seasons to eventually win promotion back to the second tier under the management of Simon Grayson. Jermaine Beckford starred for Leeds as they won promotion out of League One under Simon Grayson in 2010 Grayson eventually made way for Neil Warnock, who lasted just a year before Brian McDermott was brought in. McDermott came with a good reputation after bringing success to Reading but controversial new owner Massimo Cellino decided he wanted a head coach, not a manager, when he took over in 2014 and appointed former Forest Green boss David Hockaday. He lasted just six games, as did Hockaday's replacement Darko Milanic. Neil Redfearn, Uwe Rosler and Steve Evans all quickly came and went before Garry Monk fell just short of getting the team into the play-offs in 2016-17 and promptly left. Dane Thomas Christiansen started well but faded badly and was replaced by Paul Heckingbottom, who endured a difficult four months in charge. This video can not be played 'Back where we know we belong' - watch fans react to Leeds' promotion The appointment of world-renowned coach Bielsa in June 2018, by owner Andrea Radrizzani, brought a new spotlight to the club. The veteran had been widely praised by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino for his techniques and meticulous nature and had worked with Argentina, Chile and Athletic Bilbao during his long career. Leeds started the 2018-19 season brilliantly with few teams able to cope with their high tempo pressing and incisive passing. Even allowing for the controversy that occurred in January, when Bielsa admitted he had sent a member of staff to watch all the other clubs in the division train, they seemed set to end their long wait for promotion. Marcel Bielsa has won 54 of his 98 games in charge of Leeds However, they fell away badly at the end of the regular season before the Rams got the better of them in a play-off classic. There was to be no denying them in 2019-20 though and they once more find themselves back in football's elite. One of the key figures in Leeds' success this season has been homegrown midfielder Kalvin Phillips. The 24-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds he was struggling to put the promotion feeling into words. ""It's crazy,"" Phillips added. ""When the manager first came in I never thought I would be in this position two years down the line. ""The manager and the coaching staff are a massive part of that. He's the best manager in the world. There's no manager I would rather be under than Marcelo Bielsa right now. ""At an age when I'm trying to develop, he's the perfect manager to have. The Premier League is the best league in the world and, after 16 years, we're back in there."" Captain Liam Cooper said promotion took Leeds back to ""where we've always belonged"". ""It's unbelievable and it's still not properly sunk in,"" he told BBC Radio Leeds. ""Our club, our fans and our players have sacrificed so much - we've been in the doldrums for 16 years. ""To be part of this team and to lead this team to promotion back to where we know we've always belonged is unbelievable. ""We deserve it - we've been the best team all season on a consistent level and we've got the job done. We set out to get promoted and now we want to go and be champions and lift that trophy.""

"Mark Drakeford said 21,000 people were tested for the virus last weekend and 0.25% came back as positive Playgrounds, community centres and outdoor gyms will open in Wales from Monday, it has been confirmed. The First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced funfairs will be able to invite visitors back. It comes as he revealed just 0.25% of 21,000 people tested for Covid-19 last weekend came back as positive. ""A tiny proportion of people tested in Wales are turning out to have coronavirus,"" he said. Addressing the final daily coronavirus briefing on Friday, he added: ""We continue to look carefully at the latest medical and scientific evidence and the current state of the virus as we make decisions to unlock our society and economy,"" he said. ""With rates of the virus in Wales continuing to fall, we are able to carry on with our gradual, step-by-step lifting of the restrictions."" Shielding in Wales to end on 16 August Llangefni pub shuts after positive coronavirus test Coronavirus: What do the stats tell us in Wales? Neath Port Talbot Council said it would not reopen its playgrounds until 27 July. It said when they do reopen only one adult will be allowed to accompany children at a time and no food or drink will be permitted. On Thursday it was announced that those most at risk from coronaviruscan stop shielding after 16 August. Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton told the Welsh Government's daily briefing that about 130,000 people in Wales with underlying health conditions had been advised to stay indoors since the start of the pandemic to protect themselves. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said the recent test results had allowed the pause on advice to shielders: ""That's why the chief medical officer has concluded that it is now safe for people with those additional medical conditions to begin to gradually and carefully resume some of the activities that have been denied to them for all these weeks."" On Thursday, for the fifth day in the last 10no deaths with Covid-19 were announced in Wales. The total number of deaths remains at 1,545 and to date16,871 people have tested positive for Covid-19. Public Health Wales figures show the highest number of deaths occurred on the 9 and 13 of April with 43 people dying with Covid-19 on each of these days. Asked if he had more ""headroom"" to announce further relaxations to lockdown restrictions, he said: ""I don't think so.  We continue to move in our careful step-by-step way, coronavirus has not gone away."" He also warned the daily briefing: ""We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe."" Lockdown measures have been in place in Wales since March The Welsh Government has already set out plans for campsites and other accommodation with shared facilities to reopen from 25 July. Close contact services, such as beauty salons, tattoo shops and nail parlours, are due to restart on 27 July. The viewing of occupied homes for rent or sale will be allowed and cinemas, museums and galleries can also reopen on  27 July.

"Local responses to coronavirus outbreaks could be threatened by a historic lack of investment in public health, government advisers warn. Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were speaking as councils were given new powers to close indoor and outdoor spaces and cancel events. They were being questioned by peers on whether local public health teams would be able to cope over winter. Public Health England has identified 12 areas of concern around the country. Leicester remains subject to the highest level of concern, followed by Blackburn and Pendle in Lancashire. Speaking to peers on the Lords' Science and Technology committee, the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said, ""countries that invested heavily in their public health systems"" had coped best with the coronavirus pandemic. This had not been the case in the UK, Sir Patrick said. Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty added health protection had not been invested in ""over the last several years...I think we should all be honest about that"". Discussing the further easing of restrictions trailed by the prime minister on Friday, Prof Whitty said there were things that could be relaxed for ""three seasons of the year"" that might not be possible in the winter - ""because winter benefits respiratory diseases"". The prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that some restrictions may have to be re-introduced, he said. The higher the number of infections you have going into winter, the higher the likelihood is of having a ""significant peak"" in cases, Prof Whitty added. Prof Nick Phin at Public Health England (PHE), also appeared before peers and warned that budget reductions had ""taken away"" local public health resilience. On Friday, PHE set out the areas of England of greatest concern for local outbreaks. While Leicester and nearby Oadby and Wigston are subject to ""national intervention"" in the form of an extended lockdown, Blackburn & Darwen and Pendle in Lancashire are receiving ""enhanced support. Eight other authorities in England including Barnsley, Kirklees and Oldham were listed as ""areas of concern"". The positions of Bradford and Sheffield, while still areas of concern, had improved on last week, while Wakefield and Peterborough had moved up the watch-list.

"Businesses remain cautious about the latest lockdown easing for England, and warn that any mass return to work immediately was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on safety. And the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution out there"" in the country. New guidelinescover using public transport, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so, the PM has said. Plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM Can my boss make me go back to work if I don't want to? Coronavirus: What's the risk on transport? Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, doubted there would be a significant return to offices and other workplaces any time soon. ""Businesses need to balance the risks, and won't want to increase the possibility of closures down the line by rushing back. ""On top of this, not everything is in a company's control. Childcare is an issue for many employees, and even if the guidance is changed, some staff who use public transport will still be concerned."" Other employers' organisations said firms still wanted government support to help smooth the return to work process. At Clapham Junction station some seats are taped off to keep people apart Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said that smaller firms in particular would need more support in order to get workers back. ""Small firms are being tasked with consulting employees and putting the right measures in place to ensure a safe return to work,"" he said. ""After weeks of little or no income, they will need help - both funding and advice - to make that happen."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said companies should get tax breaks to re-open offices. BCC director general Adam Marshall said: ""Businesses should be able to offset the investments they make to ensure their premises are Covid-secure against their tax bill, which would help many to return to workplaces over the coming months."" ""We're not planning to reopen our offices until October despite Boris Johnson's revised advice,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth, who employs 60 people at the Savvy marketing agency in Leeds. ""I don't think that people are ready to get back to work yet, although we're consulting with our staff to ask them how they feel about it."" She said it felt a little ironic that Mr Johnson's statement came on the day when most schools are closing. ""Working parents will struggle to get child care over the next two months,"" she pointed out. The company is reconfiguring its offices to make them safer and give staff more space when they do return. ""We're also going to cut down how much we expect people in the office. We've been quite productive in lockdown, but we've lost things like the water-cooler conversations."" She is concerned about doing the right thing for people as well as for the economy. ""Our safety concerns are genuine. Have we got enough toilets in the office for instance? I felt Boris Johnson abdicated responsibility by leaving it to businesses to decide. She says she felt her decision to keep her offices shut was correct after listening to Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser on Thursday, who said there is ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home,. ""After listening to Boris today, I haven't changed my mind."" The TUC backed calls for more support for companies. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said Friday's announcement was the government ""passing the buck on this big decision to employers"". She pointed out that returning to work safely required a functioning NHS Test and Trace system, ""Yet progress on test and trace is still patchy"". She added: ""A safe return to workplaces also requires much greater investment in public transport if people are to be able to commute."" There is an expectation among many employers that home working will remain in place for thousands of companies despite Friday's announcement. ""People are not comfortable returning to the office yet,"" said Ruth Duston, chief executive of South Westminster Business Improvement District, which represents the interests of 5,000 businesses across London. ""Even when offices do start returning, we are looking at perhaps only a max of a third of workers returning to offices at any one time to allow for social distancing."" She said cities should prepare for a permanent shift in working practices. ""People will return [to offices] but this will likely be a gradual process over many months. When they do, it will be to collaborate and exchange with their colleagues rather than to spend eight hours at a desk."" From25 Julyindoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities can reopen On1 Augustthe government will update its advice on going to work, asking employers to make decisions about how and where their staff can work safely From the same date, most remaining leisure settings, including bowling, skating rinks, casinos and all close contact services such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen Live indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions for up to 30 people will also be allowed from next month FromSeptember, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, while universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible FromOctober, the government intends to allow audiences to return to stadiums, while conferences and other business events can recommence, subject to the outcome of pilots Mr Marshall said many of the BCC's members were focused on changes to flexible working practices rather than getting everyone back in the office. ""Firms will be weighing up how they want to work in future. Many have seen benefits to productivity and work-life balance over recent months and will want to keep elements of their new normal,"" he said. And the IoD said that as many as two thirds of its members said they intend to keep increased flexible working in place after lockdown ends. A recent Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development survey found that employers, overall, report home workers are at least as productive as other workers, and plan to double the proportion of staff who work from home regularly once the crisis is over.

"It's been 16 weeks since bowling alleys and casinos closed their doors, but on FridayBoris Johnson gave them the go-aheadto reopen from 1 August in England. Customers have been itching to get back, businesses say. But the experience will look a little different to what we're used to. Hollywood Bowl is preparing to reopen all 54 of its venues in two weeks' time, but it'll be out with the bowling shoes and in with the plastic gloves. The vast majority of the company's 1,900 furloughed staff members will return to work as soon as the doors reopen, says chief financial officer, Laurence Keen - but only after they've had their temperature checked. Like all firms reopening, they've had to make sure they're abiding by the government's Covid-secure guidelines, which involve grappling with dozens of safety questions specific to each business. For instance, coronavirus is known to spread through contact with surfaces, which isn't ideal for a game which involves repeatedly touching bowling balls. What can I do now? PM's plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM Staff at Hollywood Bowl will be cleaning bowling balls before and after each game, Laurence explains, with sanitiser on-hand for customers. The clattering of pins might not as deafening as usual though, as every other lane will be closed to allow for social distancing. Players will also be capped at six per lane - as opposed to eight before the pandemic. Staff will wear gloves, he says, and customers will be offered them too. So far, they've shelled out for 400,000 pairs of gloves, which Laurence expects will last ""a good 12 to 16 weeks"", depending on how many customers want them. They're also hoping bowling shoes will become a thing of the past, as people will be encouraged to wear their own. (If you're wondering what the point of bowling shoes were in the first place, they help you slide across the floor. ""But nobody does that apart from the professionals,"" Laurence says.) Lanes will look significantly emptier as every other one will be closed to allow for social distancing Many changes may have been made, but will customers turn up to see them? Laurence is feeling positive: ""A lot of the areas that have been allowed to open previously have been more targeted towards the older generation, but actually our kids are desperate to do things outside the four walls of the house."" They may be hoping to welcome back families in droves, but with every other lane closed, the company is having to cut their potential customer numbers in half. They aren't too worried though as they would usually only see 35% of lanes filled on weekdays before the pandemic, but they do expect to lose some custom on weekends. At 50% revenue, the company will still be profitable, Laurence says, ""albeit just"". Meanwhile, Jonathon Swaine, the managing director of venues at Grosvenor Casinos, says he's been waiting - ""patiently"" - for the green light from the government for months. The company is now getting ready to welcome back 4,500 employees, the vast majority of whom have been furloughed. Maintaining social distancing has been one of the biggest problems for many firms - but Jonathon says that ""isn't so much of a problem"" for them. ""We're lucky with our casinos that, even with 50% capacity, generally our casinos are very spacious venues. We don't have the problems that pubs have."" Floor markers will help players make their way round the building And he's confident that their longer opening hours will help mitigate against the customer cap they're introducing in their 43 venues. Players arriving at busier sites will face temperature checks as well as redesigned routes through the building to help keep people at a safe distance. And inside the casino, plastic screens will separate people playing blackjack and American roulette, with dealers wearing visors. Gaming chips present a similar problem to bowling balls, but Jonathon says all tokens will be sanitised before and after use, and customers will only play with their own chips. Adapting in this way hasn't come cheap. ""The screens, the sanitiser, the additional measures that we've put in place have all been significant investments,"" Jonathon says. ""But we clearly think it's the right thing to do to reassure our customers."" Plastic screens will become a regular sight at casinos in future Reassurance has been ""right at the top of the customers' needs"" according to their research, so it's important for them to get that right. But with some people still cautious, is he confident that reopening will be pay off? ""If we can bring as many people back as possible, and open as quickly and as safely as possible, we've got the best chance of a sustainable business,"" he says. ""We can't wait.""

"Aaron McKenzie must serve a minimum of 35 years in jail The ex-partner of a heavily pregnant woman has been jailed for stabbing her to death in her own home. Kelly Fauvrelle was knifed 21 times in the middle of the night in her Croydon bedroom. Her baby boy Riley, who was delivered by Caesarean, died four days later. Aaron McKenzie, 26, from Peckham, was found guilty of the murder of Ms Fauvrelle and Riley's manslaughter. He was sentenced to life with a minimum 35 years at the Old Bailey on Friday. He was also given 20 years for the manslaughter of baby Riley and three years for possession of a knife, to run concurrently. Kelly Mary Fauvrelle's baby was delivered by paramedics but died later in hospital Sentencing, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""At 03:15 on 29 June last year, you broke into Kelly's bedroom at the home she shared with her family. ""You then launched a ferocious attack on Kelly, inflicting no fewer than 21 stab wounds. ""Kelly's family woke to the noise of her screams, rushed to her room and sought to care for her. ""It's clear from all the evidence this was the most vicious and deliberate killing."" The trial heard Miss Fauvrelle's relationship with McKenzie, with whom she shared an interest in motorbikes, had ended early last year. Her death was the result of McKenzie's ""cowardly"" response to learning Miss Fauvrelle wanted nothing to do with him, while his actions afterwards demonstrated no ""sorrow or remorse"", the judge added. McKenzie gave the judge a thumbs up as he was sent down, while Miss Fauvrelle's family wept in court. In a victim impact statement, Miss Fauvrelle's sister Melissa said: ""This was an act of pure evil."" She said her sister was a selfless, caring, loving woman with a ""pure heart"". Her father Jean Fauvrelle said: ""Aaron McKenzie's evil act has devastated our lives. My heart physically aches, but those words do not feel sufficient."" Aaron McKenzie was captured on CCTV on his way to kill Kelly Fauvrelle Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said Miss Fauvrelle's family had been ""devastated"". ""This has been a harrowing and distressing case for all concerned. My thoughts today are with Kelly-Mary's family, who have suffered immeasurable loss and been put through the agony of a trial. ""Their future with Kelly and Riley was so cruelly taken from them, and it is fitting that McKenzie's future has today been taken from him.""

"Boris Johnson announces next steps for easing lockdown in England from 1 August Employers given more discretion over office working and indoor performances allowed to resume PM says local authorities will get more powers to bring in lockdowns in their areas to contain future outbreaks Health Secretary Matt Hancock calls for urgent review into data on deaths in England There have now been more than 1m confirmed cases in India, and 2m in Brazil In the US, the daily total of new cases hits another record The UK, US, and Canada accuse Russian spies of targeting vaccine researchers Globally there have been 13.8 million cases since the outbreak began, with 589,000 deaths We're wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today and will be back tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the biggest developments we've been bringing you from the UK and around the world:  You can follow all the latest news onthe BBC News website, or for coronavirus newshead here. Today's live page was written and edited by Alix Kroeger, Sophie Williams, Francesca Gillett, Alice Cuddy, Victoria Lindrea, George Wright and Ritu Prasad. There was some welcome news for the arts sector in Boris Johnson's announcement earlier: indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can take place in England from the start of August. In the same way that sports fans are going to be allowed in stadiums for a small number of matches to see how it goes, there will also be pilots of theatre shows and concerts with socially distanced audiences. The findings would feed into final guidance for venues in the run-up to them reopening, the PM said. However, with social distancing in place, many venues warn it's not financially viable to open. Theatre budgets tend to be based on a breakeven of around 70% capacity, and so with much less capacity the producer cannot afford to put the show on. Jon Morgan, the head of Theatres Trust welcomed the news as ""a step in the right direction"" - but said ""for most theatres it will not be economically viable to reopen with 30-40% audience required under social distancing"". He said they needed to progress to theatres being allowed to open fully ""with the appropriate safety measures"", adding: ""Without this most theatres cannot reopen viably and we need the go-ahead for Christmas shows, on which the survival of many theatres depends, in the next few weeks at the very latest."" There's more here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Local responses to coronavirus outbreaks could be threatened by a historic lack of investment in public health, UK government advisers warn. Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were speaking as councils were given new powers to close indoor and outdoor spaces and cancel events. Speaking to peers on the Lords' Science and Technology committee, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick said ""countries that invested heavily in their public health systems"" had coped best with the coronavirus pandemic. This had not been the case in the UK, Sir Patrick said. Chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Witty added health protection had not been invested in ""over the last several years"", adding: ""I think we should all be honest about that."" You can read more about their warninghere. On Friday, Public Health England set out the areas of England of greatest concern for local outbreaks. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was expected to release new guidance on reopening schools this week, but this update has been delayed, US media report. A spokesperson told CNN and NPR the new documents would likely be ready by the end of the month. Vice-President Mike Pence, who leads the White House Covid-19 task force, had earlier suggested the five new documents would still be released this week. At a news conference on Tuesday he said: ""To be very clear, we don't want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don't reopen their schools. ""We know that the risk the coronavirus presents to people under the age of 18 is very low but we also want to make sure that we have measures in place that protect faculty that may be vulnerable and so prevent kids from exposing others or bringing home the virus."" The update follows President Trump's complaints that the CDC's prior guidance for schools was ""very tough"" and costly. However, CDC director Robert Redfield has said the agency is not changing its recommendations about reopening schools, but that the new documents will provide additional information on enacting preventative measures. Current CDC guidelines recommend a number of social distancing and hygiene practices, like keeping desks apart, requiring face coverings and disinfecting. The president has urged schools to reopen for in-person education despite concerns from public health experts, parents and teachers. The US Justice Department released an image allegedly showing Andrew Marnell at a Black Jack table A man in California has been arrested
over claims he fraudulently obtained $8m (Â£6.4m) in coronavirus aid and used some of the
money to gamble in Las Vegas. Andrew Marnell, 40, is accused of
submitting bogus loan applications on behalf of several companies to secure
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds. These funds are intended to help small
companies and prevent layoffs during the pandemic. It is alleged that he spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars at casinos in Las Vegas and also used funds to make high-risk
stock market bets. Mr Marnell faces up to 30 years in
prison if convicted of bank fraud.

The actress had been self-isolating at home since she and her eight-year-old daughtertested positive for coronavirus on 12 July. Her husband Abhishek and father-in-law Amitabh, both also actors, were taken to hospital at the weekend with the virus. Ms Rai Bachchan, 46, is one of Bollywood's most famous faces. She is a former Miss World, a Goodwill Ambassador for UNAIDS, and became the first Indian actress to be a jury member at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003. The Scottish government has decided to delay its census, which was due to begin in March 2021. It's been pushed back by a year to March 2022. It's the first time the count has been postponed since 1941, with a census taking place in Scotland every 10 years since 1801. A census is also due to be carried out in England and Wales next year, but there has been no announcement about whether that will also be postponed. It it goes ahead, it would mean it would be out of sync with Scotland. In the UK, a further 114 have died over the past 24 hours in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, after testing positive for coronavirus. It brings the current UK death toll from Covid-19 to 45,233, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Separate figures, published by the UK's statistics agencies, show there have now been 55,700 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hour period up to 0900 BST on Friday, there had been a further 687 lab-confirmed UK cases. In total, 293,239 cases have been confirmed. Human rights groups in the Canadian province of Ontario have issued a legal challenge to limit police access to a database of people who have tested positive for Covid-19. A government memo said that police, paramedics and firefighters have access to the database to prevent or respond to Covid emergencies,the Globe and Mail reported,external. It is not clear whether law enforcement has used the database. The four organisations involved in the case say that giving police access to this information violates health privacy laws. They also argue that the data could harm to Indigenous and minority communities, who they say are disproportionately targeted by police, or lead to people refusing to get Covid tests. But some officials say that it is critical for first responders to have this Covid-19 data to reduce the spread of the virus. A hearing has been scheduled for November. Mink are bred at farms for their prized fur (file photo) Almost 100,000 mink at a farm in north-eastern Spain are to be culled after many of them tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities say. The outbreak in AragÃ³n province was discovered after a farm employee's wife contracted the virus in May. Her husband and six other farm workers have since tested positive for the disease. The mink, bred for their prized fur, were isolated and monitored closely after the workers became infected. But when tests on 13 July showed that 87% of the mink were infected, health authorities ordered for all 92,700 of the semi-aquatic animals to be culled. Full story here. The government's chief scientific adviser previously said there was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who's in charge of the lockdown restrictions in England -said that rather than telling employersto keep staff at home, the government is leaving the decision up to them. He said that could mean ""continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees"" - and that returning to the workplace must be done safely. The Welsh government has now responded, and said its advice is for people to carry on as they are - working from home if they can. âI positively don't want people to be returning to offices in the way that we did before coronavirus happened,"" said First Minister Mark Drakeford. He stressed the crisis had shown how it was possible for many to work from home very effectively âwithout the need for large numbers of people to be travelling at peak times of the day to office locationsâ. He said he did not share Mr Johnsonâs belief that there would be a significant return to normality by Christmas. ""You have to take a pretty sunny view of circumstances to think that that might be true,"" said the Welsh leader, adding that it did not fit with the scientific advice heâd seen. Fergus WalshMedical correspondent What if there was a way of returning life to what it was like before coronavirus? No more social distancing, no face coverings, no fear of Covid-19. Of course the reason for all the restrictions is an attempt to bear down on the virus, and to minimise its spread. What we need is a fast and reliable way of spotting those around us who are infected. Saliva tests could be a real gamechanger. Imagine if all you had to do was spit into a tube to find out if you have coronavirus. OK, it's not quite as simple as that. The saliva sample has to be sent to a laboratory, but the result can be turned around far quicker than a swab test. Jayne Lees and her family are part of a four-week trial of saliva tests under way in Southampton. I watched as Jayne and her three teenage children, Sam, Meg and Billy, sat round their kitchen table, spat on a spoon and tipped the spit into a test tube. ""A swab test feels quite invasive, especially if you are not feeling very well,"" says Jayne. ""The saliva test is so much easier."" More than 10,000 GP and other key workers and their families in the city are involved in the project. Full story here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Winter is the big concern. The problem is we donât know how
well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off
in our spring, so we donât know what a winter with Covid will look like. There is evidence the virus
survives longer in cooler temperatures and similar infections, including flu,
do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and
the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these
restrictions can actually be lifted. SAGE documents, released today,external,
raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to
return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus
protections that would be âdifficult to achieveâ. They advise the government
should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced.   Some employers' organisations said smaller firms in particular would need more support to get workers back Earlier, we heard from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said he would now leave it up to employers to decide whether to bring their staff back to work. So what do the employers themselves think? Well, many warned a mass return to work immediately was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on safety, while the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution out there"" in the country. ""Not everything is in a company's control,"" said Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. ""Childcare is an issue for many employees, and even if the guidance is changed, some staff who use public transport will still be concerned."" Read more about the reaction from businesses. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a further raft of changes taking place in England from the first day of August.Here are some of the key changes:  Read more. Customary handshakes and kisses made way for elbow bumps EU leaders are meeting in their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis, with low expectations of a deal on a â¬750bn (Â£670bn) post-Covid stimulus package. The mask-wearing leaders, who met with elbow bumps not handshakes, must also agree a seven-year, â¬1.07tn budget. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was a ""moment of truth"" for Europe. There are splits between leaders over whether the post-Covid package should be given as grants or loans. Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel want grants to mostly finance the fund. Four northern nations insist on loans. Arriving for the talks in Brussels, Mrs Merkel said ""the differences are very very big and I cannot say if we will find a solution this time"". It would be desirable, she said, but people had to remain realistic. Read more here. A total of 138 military personnel have tested positive for the virus at US bases in Okinawa Japanâs
Defence Minister Taro Kono has requested that US military personnel coming to Japan are
tested for coronavirus after an outbreak on the island of Okinawa. The
US, which is currently only testing those who are showing symptoms, says it is considering the idea, Kono said. As
of Thursday, 138 military personnel have tested positive at several bases in
Okinawa, where most of the US troops in Japan are based. Last
weekend Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki told reporters: âI canât help but have
strong doubts about the US militaryâs measures to prevent infections.â He
claimed that US service members had gone off base for 4 July beach parties and visits
to local nightlife areas. The
relationship between Okinawa locals and the US forces is already tense. Locals
have campaigned for their removal for years. Zindzi Mandela with her father Nelson in 2010 The family of the South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, have been praised for revealing that his daughter, Zindzi, who died on Monday, had Covid-19. The gesture will ""encourage acceptance"" of those infected, current President Cyril Ramaphosa said. The cause of death has not been disclosed. Zindzi was buried on Friday morning alongside her mother, anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. South Africa is the African country worst hit by coronavirus, with more than 320,000 cases. There have been more than 4,600 deaths, and government projections estimate this could rise to 50,000 by the end of the year. Despite public awareness of how the virus is spread, its symptoms and effects, there have been some reported cases of stigmatisation of those infected. Read more here. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty gave evidence by videolink on Friday The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance hailed the British public's ""extraordinary altruism and spirit"" when asked about face coverings by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. ""This is a classic public health issue and the communication needs to be clear about what benefit this brings. ""Face covering wearing is a classic one where there may be some protection to the wearer, but there's more protection to others."" England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, told the same committee hearing social distancing remained key - even with the introduction of face coverings - and was likely to be necessary for a long time. He said: ""There are some things which we started right at the beginning, which absolutely have to continue for a prolonged period of time - washing hands, isolation, household isolation. ""And then we've added to that things like contact tracing, most recently face coverings. ""The reality is distancing remains an important part of this mix and how it's interpreted in different governments has evolved. ""But it has not gone away. So, all of those need to continue for a long period of time."" A leading disability equality charity has expressed concern about the UK government's call for more employees in England to head back into the workplace from 1 August. James Taylor, from Scope, said Boris Johnson's comments ""will ring alarm bells for many disabled people"". âTwo thirds of those who have died from Covid-19 were disabled. The virus has not gone away. Millions of
disabled people at greater risk of coronavirus feel their fears are not being
taken into account and feel forgotten by the government. âDisabled people must be able
to have flexibility about returning to their workplace. Leaving this to the
discretion of employers will create inconsistency, and does little to reassure
those disabled people who fear being forced to choose between protecting their
health and paying the bills. Recent research by the charity found half of disabled people feel anxious about
shielding being paused, with one in five of those surveyed stating they will not leave home until there is a
vaccine or effective treatment against coronavirus. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Leeds United have been promoted to the Premier League after 16 years away. Their place in the top flight for next season was confirmed by West Brom's2-1 defeat at Huddersfield Townon Friday. Leeds will now be crowned champions if Brentford do not beat Stoke on Saturday or the Whites then take a point from Sunday's visit to Derby County. Argentine Marcelo Bielsa has led the Yorkshire side to promotion in his second season in charge after finishing third in the Championship in 2018-19. Even allowing for the enforced break because of the coronavirus pandemic, it has been a campaign where Leeds have never really looked like repeating mistakes of previous seasons and they have not been outside the top two since November. They had seemed set to win promotion last season only for back-to-back defeats by Wigan and Brentford to leave them third behind Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United, before a dramatic 4-3 play-off semi-final defeat by Derby. After that setback, fans could have been forgiven for fearing the worst about the future of Bielsa and the talented group of players he had assembled. But he opted to remain with the club and together they have reaped the rewards. Relive Huddersfield's victory that promoted Leeds Which clubs were in the top flight the last time Leeds were there? Leeds are back - 10 moments that mattered under Bielsa Leeds fans gather to celebrate promotion It has been a long and often painful journey back to the Premier League for Leeds and their fans, who had seen their team reach the semi-final of the Champions League in 2001. The club was in a dreadful financial position when they were relegated to the Championship in 2004 and though Kevin Blackwell - the first of 15 managers employed by Leeds since they were last in the top flight - steadied the ship initially and nearly took them back up in 2005-06, they were placed into administration in 2007 and went down to League One. Worse was to come in the form of a 15-point deduction to start the following campaign and it took them three seasons to eventually win promotion back to the second tier under the management of Simon Grayson. Jermaine Beckford starred for Leeds as they won promotion out of League One under Simon Grayson in 2010 Grayson eventually made way for Neil Warnock, who lasted just a year before Brian McDermott was brought in. McDermott came with a good reputation after bringing success to Reading but controversial new owner Massimo Cellino decided he wanted a head coach, not a manager, when he took over in 2014 and appointed former Forest Green boss David Hockaday. He lasted just six games, as did Hockaday's replacement Darko Milanic. Neil Redfearn, Uwe Rosler and Steve Evans all quickly came and went before Garry Monk fell just short of getting the team into the play-offs in 2016-17 and promptly left. Dane Thomas Christiansen started well but faded badly and was replaced by Paul Heckingbottom, who endured a difficult four months in charge. This video can not be played 'Back where we know we belong' - watch fans react to Leeds' promotion The appointment of world-renowned coach Bielsa in June 2018, by owner Andrea Radrizzani, brought a new spotlight to the club. The veteran had been widely praised by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and former Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino for his techniques and meticulous nature and had worked with Argentina, Chile and Athletic Bilbao during his long career. Leeds started the 2018-19 season brilliantly with few teams able to cope with their high tempo pressing and incisive passing. Even allowing for the controversy that occurred in January, when Bielsa admitted he had sent a member of staff to watch all the other clubs in the division train, they seemed set to end their long wait for promotion. Marcel Bielsa has won 54 of his 98 games in charge of Leeds However, they fell away badly at the end of the regular season before the Rams got the better of them in a play-off classic. There was to be no denying them in 2019-20 though and they once more find themselves back in football's elite. One of the key figures in Leeds' success this season has been homegrown midfielder Kalvin Phillips. The 24-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds he was struggling to put the promotion feeling into words. ""It's crazy,"" Phillips added. ""When the manager first came in I never thought I would be in this position two years down the line. ""The manager and the coaching staff are a massive part of that. He's the best manager in the world. There's no manager I would rather be under than Marcelo Bielsa right now. ""At an age when I'm trying to develop, he's the perfect manager to have. The Premier League is the best league in the world and, after 16 years, we're back in there."" Captain Liam Cooper said promotion took Leeds back to ""where we've always belonged"". ""It's unbelievable and it's still not properly sunk in,"" he told BBC Radio Leeds. ""Our club, our fans and our players have sacrificed so much - we've been in the doldrums for 16 years. ""To be part of this team and to lead this team to promotion back to where we know we've always belonged is unbelievable. ""We deserve it - we've been the best team all season on a consistent level and we've got the job done. We set out to get promoted and now we want to go and be champions and lift that trophy.""

"Businesses remain cautious about the latest lockdown easing for England, and warn that any mass return to work immediately was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on safety. And the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution out there"" in the country. New guidelinescover using public transport, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so, the PM has said. Plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM Can my boss make me go back to work if I don't want to? Coronavirus: What's the risk on transport? Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, doubted there would be a significant return to offices and other workplaces any time soon. ""Businesses need to balance the risks, and won't want to increase the possibility of closures down the line by rushing back. ""On top of this, not everything is in a company's control. Childcare is an issue for many employees, and even if the guidance is changed, some staff who use public transport will still be concerned."" Other employers' organisations said firms still wanted government support to help smooth the return to work process. At Clapham Junction station some seats are taped off to keep people apart Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said that smaller firms in particular would need more support in order to get workers back. ""Small firms are being tasked with consulting employees and putting the right measures in place to ensure a safe return to work,"" he said. ""After weeks of little or no income, they will need help - both funding and advice - to make that happen."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said companies should get tax breaks to re-open offices. BCC director general Adam Marshall said: ""Businesses should be able to offset the investments they make to ensure their premises are Covid-secure against their tax bill, which would help many to return to workplaces over the coming months."" ""We're not planning to reopen our offices until October despite Boris Johnson's revised advice,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth, who employs 60 people at the Savvy marketing agency in Leeds. ""I don't think that people are ready to get back to work yet, although we're consulting with our staff to ask them how they feel about it."" She said it felt a little ironic that Mr Johnson's statement came on the day when most schools are closing. ""Working parents will struggle to get child care over the next two months,"" she pointed out. The company is reconfiguring its offices to make them safer and give staff more space when they do return. ""We're also going to cut down how much we expect people in the office. We've been quite productive in lockdown, but we've lost things like the water-cooler conversations."" She is concerned about doing the right thing for people as well as for the economy. ""Our safety concerns are genuine. Have we got enough toilets in the office for instance? I felt Boris Johnson abdicated responsibility by leaving it to businesses to decide. She says she felt her decision to keep her offices shut was correct after listening to Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser on Thursday, who said there is ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home,. ""After listening to Boris today, I haven't changed my mind."" The TUC backed calls for more support for companies. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said Friday's announcement was the government ""passing the buck on this big decision to employers"". She pointed out that returning to work safely required a functioning NHS Test and Trace system, ""Yet progress on test and trace is still patchy"". She added: ""A safe return to workplaces also requires much greater investment in public transport if people are to be able to commute."" There is an expectation among many employers that home working will remain in place for thousands of companies despite Friday's announcement. ""People are not comfortable returning to the office yet,"" said Ruth Duston, chief executive of South Westminster Business Improvement District, which represents the interests of 5,000 businesses across London. ""Even when offices do start returning, we are looking at perhaps only a max of a third of workers returning to offices at any one time to allow for social distancing."" She said cities should prepare for a permanent shift in working practices. ""People will return [to offices] but this will likely be a gradual process over many months. When they do, it will be to collaborate and exchange with their colleagues rather than to spend eight hours at a desk."" From25 Julyindoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities can reopen On1 Augustthe government will update its advice on going to work, asking employers to make decisions about how and where their staff can work safely From the same date, most remaining leisure settings, including bowling, skating rinks, casinos and all close contact services such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen Live indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions for up to 30 people will also be allowed from next month FromSeptember, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, while universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible FromOctober, the government intends to allow audiences to return to stadiums, while conferences and other business events can recommence, subject to the outcome of pilots Mr Marshall said many of the BCC's members were focused on changes to flexible working practices rather than getting everyone back in the office. ""Firms will be weighing up how they want to work in future. Many have seen benefits to productivity and work-life balance over recent months and will want to keep elements of their new normal,"" he said. And the IoD said that as many as two thirds of its members said they intend to keep increased flexible working in place after lockdown ends. A recent Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development survey found that employers, overall, report home workers are at least as productive as other workers, and plan to double the proportion of staff who work from home regularly once the crisis is over.

"Indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can take place in England from the start of August, the prime minister has said. The government is working with the sector on pilots of performances with socially distanced audiences in theatres and music venues. Boris Johnson said the findings would feed into final guidance for venues in the run-up to them reopening. But the head of Theatres Trust said the move ""will not be economically viable"". Dame Judi Dench was among many theatre figures to voice concerns for her industry Although Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust welcomed the news as ""a step in the right direction"", he said that ""for most theatres it will not be economically viable to reopen with 30-40% audience required under social distancing"". He said they needed to progress to theatres being allowed to open fully ""with the appropriate safety measures"", adding: ""Without this most theatres cannot reopen viably and we need the go-ahead for Christmas shows, on which the survival of many theatres depends, in the next few weeks at the very latest."" The government stressed that ""audiences, performers and venues will be expected to maintain social distancing at all times."" This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic It added: ""This guidance will be for organisations in England. Organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should adhere to the advice of the devolved administrations at all times."" Venues have been shut since March as part of the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport added it was now working with venues including the London Symphony Orchestra on measures for reopening. However it added that singing and the playing of brass and wind instruments in groups or in front of an audience is ""still currently limited to professionals only"". The announcement is likely to be welcomed by theatre owners and producers, but a sense of frustration with the government is likely to remain. It makes no financial sense for many venues to open with social distancing rules in place; theatre budgets tend to be based on a breakeven of around 70% capacity. If social distancing measures mean a theatre can only run at 20-25% capacity, the producer cannot afford to put the show on. What the industry says it desperately needs from the government is some clear guidance on when stage five (fuller audiences indoors) of the phased return will be possible. The call is for the government to announce a ""not before"" date, which would allow producers and theatre owners to make a plan of action for the coming months, be that preparing a show or reducing overheads. The Society of London Theatre, which represents venues in London's West End, said it was ""delighted,external"" by what it called ""another welcome step on the road map towards reopening with full audiences"". Yet it said it would not be ""practical or economically viable"" for many shows to open with social distancing restrictions. ""We welcome the news that theatres & performance venues can reopen with social distancing in August, but the reality is the vast majority will not be opening,""tweeted,externalactors' union Equity. Choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne also expressed doubts about theatres' ability to open with social distancing in place. ""Why make these announcements when they know that the vast majority of theatre, dance and music is not financially viable under 'Covid secure' conditions?""he tweeted,external. The UK's media and entertainment union Bectu said the news was ""a significant development"" but that venues would need government support if they are to reopen. Mr Dowden said the announcement was a ""welcome step in the path to a return to normal"" ""We know that theatres and venues will not be open in two weeks' time,"" said its head Philippa Childs. ""Theatres will have to bring back productions, sell tickets, conduct rehearsals and prepare for how they will operate in a Covid-secure way before they can open up again. ""This announcement brings into sharp focus the need for urgent answers to the pressing questions that we have been asking since the arts recovery package was announced nearly two weeks ago."" Earlier this month the governmentannounced a Â£1.57bn support package, following several weeks of lobbying from theatres, music venues, art galleries and other cultural institutions, many of which had said they were on the brink of collapse. The government has also now outlined measures to ""support the safe return of audiences"", including: Reduced venue capacity and limited ticket sales to ensure social distancing can be maintained Tickets should be bought online and venues encouraged to use e-tickets to reduce contact and help with track and trace Venues should have clearly communicated social distancing marking in place in areas where queues form and adopt a limited entry approach Increased deep cleaning of auditoriums Performances should be scheduled to allow sufficient time to undertake deep cleaning before the next audience arrives Performers, conductors and musicians must observe social distancing wherever possible Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""The UK's performing arts sector is renowned across the world and I am pleased that we are making real progress in getting its doors reopened to the public with social distancing."" Beloved small gig venues succumb to Covid closure Fears over Â£1.57bn arts industry support package Two Theatre Royals, two cities, two job warnings This latest announcement will now see venues move to stage four of the government's ""five-stage roadmap for the return of professional performing arts"", which was recently outlined by Mr Dowden as follows: Stage One- Rehearsal and training (no audiences and adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Two- Performances for broadcast and recording purposes (adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Three- Performances outdoors with an audience plus pilots for indoor performances with a limited distance audience Stage Four- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (but with a limited distanced audience indoors) Stage Five- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (with a fuller audience indoors) Even as the government was preparing to unveil its latest measures, however, more venues announced they were having to consider staff redundancies. The Royal Opera House announced on Friday,external""with huge sadness"" that it had made the ""difficult decision"" to begin ""a restructure process"". And in Edinburgh, the Traverse Theatre said it had made the ""painfully difficult decision to enter into redundancy consultation"" with ""a number"" of its team. In a statement,external, the venue said it was likely that ""almost a third"" of its staff ""in customer-facing and technical roles"" would lose their jobs.

"Sport has been held behind closed doors since its return, including England's ongoing Test series against West Indies Spectators could be able to return to stadiums in England from October, says Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Pilots will take place from 1 August but any stadium reopenings would be subject to coronavirus guidelines. Some sports, including football and cricket, have resumed behind closed doors after the Covid-19 lockdown. ""We will pilot larger gatherings in venues like sports stadiums with a view to a wider reopening in the autumn,"" said Johnson on Friday. ""From October, we intend to bring back audiences in stadiums. ""Again, these changes must be done in a Covid-secure way, subject to the successful outcome of pilots."" The pilot projects will be held at: Two men'scounty cricketfriendly matches - including Surrey v Middlesex at The Oval on 26-27 July; TheWorld Snooker Championshipat Sheffield's Crucible Theatre from 31 July; The Goodwood horse racing festival - known asGlorious Goodwood- on 1 August. The Racecourse Association said the Goodwood event could cater for up to 5,000 people, plus participants. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said it was ""pleased that this announcement allows cricket to be among the first pilot events"" and that it would continue to work with the government on the safety measures required for supporters to return safely. ""For months, millions of us have felt the void of being unable to go to the match to support our team or attend a top-class sporting event,"" said sports minister Nigel Huddleston. ""So I am pleased that we are now able to move forward with a plan to help venues safely reopen their doors to fans. ""I recognise that not every sport, team or club has the benefit of huge commercial revenue, and it is often their dedicated fans that are the lifeblood which helps keep them going. By working closely with sports and medical experts, these pilots will help ensure the safe return of fans to stadiums. ""Although it will remain some time before venues are full to capacity, this is a major step in the right direction for the resumption of live spectator sport across the country."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport also said further pilot events are likely to be held in other sports. In order for fans to return to stadiums, the government has outlined operating guidelines that state: Fans must agree to a new code of behaviour that includes not attending if they potentially have symptoms of coronavirus or have been exposed to a person who has tested positive; Social distancing must be observed in seating arrangements; Crowd management plans should be in place, including the controlled entry and exit of fans and one-way systems; Additional hygiene facilities should be installed inside venues, particularly at entrances and exits; Screening procedures should be considered at stadium entrances. Attendance at Goodwood on 1 August - the final day of a five-day meeting - will initially be offered to the racecourse's annual members and their guests Domestic competitive sport in England resumed on 1 June for the first time since mid-March, with football's Premier League and English Football League (EFL) getting back under way on 17 and 20 June respectively. International cricket, golf, horse racing and snooker are among the other sports to have resumed. The Premier League is understood to be pleased by the proposals and wants the maximum number of fans allowed back in stadiums as soon as it is safe to do so. The league is also willing to offer pre-season games as possible trial events before the start of next season. The Football Association said it welcomes the government's ""positive update"" that allows them to ""step up"" efforts to get fans back into stadiums. ""Supporters are the lifeblood of our national game, and that has been underlined by how much their absence has been felt over the last month,"" said the FA. ""We will continue to work closely with relevant authorities on how we can bring them back in a safe and secure manner, including any help we can provide to the proposed pilot events."" The EFL said the Prime Minister's announcement started to ""provide some clarity"" as football authorities work to bring fans back. ""We will continue to work with our colleagues at DCMS, the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) and the wider football family in order to deliver on the timeframe and to assist clubs with the inevitable operational and financial challenges this will bring,"" said the EFL. Premiership Rugby says it would be ready to welcome fans back into grounds before the end of the season if given Government permission. The season is due to to resume on 14 August. In Scotland, no date has yet been set for fans returning to stadiums. Now in phase three of the Scottish government's route out of lockdown, the Premiership - football's top flight - will begin on 1 August behind closed doors. The second-tier Scottish Championship and Leagues One and Two kick off a reduced, 27-game season on 17 October, the same weekend as the first Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers of the 2020-21 campaign. TheScottish government has held talks with Scottish Rugbyabout using Murrayfield as a test venue, where fans could return but be physically distanced.

"With lockdown easing, many of us are planning to make the most of summer. But what exactly are we allowed to do over the holiday season? More than you might think. Here's a quick guide to some socially-distanced summer experiences in the UK. Just don't forget your mac and wellies. While many European destinations have declared themselves open to Brits, plenty are opting for a ""staycation"" this summer. The PM has himself urged people to holiday at home, saying the UK had ""peerless, wonderful, superlative places"" to visit. And with social distancing at the forefront of people's minds, rural retreats appear to be one of the options of choice. According to Airbnb, the top 10 most wish-listed homes on its site from the start of lockdown to the middle of June were composed entirely of UK destinations, indicating the staycation is very much back in fashion this year. Cabins, lodges, glamping and converted shipping containers have all been on the site'smost-wished-for list,,externalthe company said. UK accommodation of all kinds saw a surge in bookings after Boris Johnson gave the go-ahead for self-catering accommodation, hotels, bed and breakfasts and campsites to open from 4 July. However, the spectre of coronavirus means holidaymakers may experience big changes in the way destinations are run, such as contactless check-in, no breakfast buffets or mini bars, extra hand-washing basins and regular deep cleans. 'It's bonkers. The phone has not stopped ringing' The drive-in is no longer the sole preserve of frisky American teens. A host of new drive-in and open-air cinemas have been announced in recent weeks, with promoters converting under-utilised spaces into massive venues to entice nervous cinema-goers back to the big screen. The surge in UK drive-in options means film fans will be able to watch araft of cult classics from the comfort of their cars,externalor from the required social distance outside, while immersing themselves in 1950s Americana. New rules will apply, though. Some organisers are insisting on a two-metre separation between cars, sanitising wireless speakers and scanning tickets through closed windows or organising entry by number plate. Others are offering cinema-goers the chance to order snacks through an app, which will then be delivered to cars by roller-skating staff. Move over Pasadena, here comes Padstow. Could drive-in cinemas take off in the UK? But the drive-in opportunities don't stop there. A number of car-park raves, as well as live music and comedy gigs, are also being planned across the summer. The Comedy Story is hosting aseries of drive-in showsat rugby grounds and racetracks throughout July and August; while Gosforth Park in Newcastle will see performances by Supergrass, The Libertines and MaxÃ¯mo Park next month. Those shows will take place at what's been billed as the ""UK's first socially-distanced live arena"", where fans will have their own private viewing platforms, placed two metres apart with food and drinks available for pre-order. Get Comedy has also announced a number of drive-in events for London's Brent Cross this summer, while the Comedy Store and and Comedy Club, and comedian Mark Watson, among others, are also planning outdoor gigs. Drive-in raves, where people ""dance in their cars"" or are confined to a clearly-designated space, are also planned at anumber of outside venues.,external Organisers say the focus will be on production - including pyrotechnics, CO2 jets, fireworks and light shows. For those wanting more high-brow culture, Glyndebourne is offeringlive open-air opera as well as a series of garden concerts,external- though tickets are limited.  Outdoor spaces in Sheffield are also beingconverted to stage Shakespeare plays,externallasting 90 minutes. However, a series of drive-in shows organised by Live Nation, including a major tour of the hit musical Six,has been cancelled because of uncertainties over local lockdowns. How drive-in raves and cinemas will work in the UK With the 2020 car-boot season delayed because of lockdown, many organisers arenow reopening their gates,externalfor the summer - so eagle-eyed hunters will be able to track down bargain treasures once again. But as with other businesses, there will be extra rules in place. Many organisers are asking buyers to bring their own hand gel and use it on entry and exit, to maintain a two-metre distance and only touch goods they intend to purchase. But with people desperate to get rid of unwanted stuff after spending time sorting cupboards during lockdown, many are predicting sales on a bumper scale. Hiring a kayak, canoe or paddleboard has already become a popular socially-distanced way to spend time outdoors - and is likely to remain a go-to activity this summer. British Canoeing, which represents those taking part in paddlesport across the country, says record numbers of people have been getting involved, with membership of the organisation rising 23% on last year. Almost half of new members have been families and more than a third women, it says. Stand-up paddleboarding has been particularly popular, it adds. David Joy, British Canoeing's chief executive, says the organisation wants to see more people ""go paddling this summer"", and is offering tips to novices on where to paddle as well as information on the importance of the licences, insurance and paddling responsibly. More information on where to go and how to paddle safely can be found atGo Paddling.,external Another way of avoiding the crowds is heading off to a ""nearly-wild"" campsite, where you can get a taste of life in the wilderness. Unless you're in Dartmoor or parts of Scotland, wild camping itself is illegal without the landowner's permission, so a safer bet is pitching up at a remote, but official, campsite with few or none of the usual facilities. The Nearly Wild Camping Club -a co-operative of site owners and campers,external- provides information on locations across the UK that host those looking for a wilder, secluded or quieter camping experience. Each location is guaranteed to have no outdoor lights at night, a good distance between pitches and only basic facilities. Most are also campfire and barbecue-friendly. For those who want to go the full wild-camping route,communities advise getting a landowner's permission,externalas well as remaining discreet (arriving late, leaving early) and leaving no trace of the camp. This means you should take any litter back home with you and respect the environment at all times. We may have to wait at least another year for the real thing, but with a little imagination you could turn your garden or living room into a mini-festival experience. People took up the challenge over the Glastonbury weekend, withfans making the festival's greatest sites out of materials lying around the house.,external Other suggestions include camping out in the garden or living room, sorting festival lighting and cooking or ordering in festival-style food. But most important is the music. Footage of previous Glastonbury festivals can be found on theBBC iPlayer, as can gigs and sets from other artists. Weddings and civil partnerships are now permitted across the UK, meaning you can tie the knot or watch loved ones do so over the warmer months. Church wedding services have also restarted, but there is a ban on singing as it poses a ""particular"" threat of virus spread. There are also restrictions on numbers and strict rules on social distancing. In England, couples can invite up to 30 guests as long as they are kept apart by a minimum of one metre.  In Scotland and Northern Ireland, outdoor ceremonies can take place with limited numbers. In Scotlandguests should be from no more than three households, while in Northern Ireland up to 10 people can be invited.,external. In Wales, small ceremonies can take place in churches and register offices, with the number of guests determined by the ability of a venue to accommodate the two-metre social-distancing rule between households. With the average British wedding having about 100 guests, however, many face the awkward problem of uninviting some friends and family. Also, don't expect to celebrate at a reception or party afterwards, as such large gatherings remain banned across the UK. Government advice on holding a Covid-secure wedding or civil partnership,external What are the rules on weddings? What will a wedding look like in Wales? With people now looking for alternative sports that allow them to maintain social distance and play outside, the non-contact activities of bowls and golf are firmly back on the agenda. Before lockdown, anincreasing number of young people had been taking up lawn bowls- once the domain of elderly men and women dressed in white. Now Bowls England says the coming weeks and months are ""an opportunity"" for those ""who currently don't play, to give bowls a try"". However, there are strict rules. Empty rinks are to be kept between players, clubhouses must remain closed except for essential access, for example, the use of toilets and washing facilities, and equipment must be cleaned before, during and after play. Golf, too, has seen an uptick since lockdown. Clubs across the country have reported a boom in new members, with somein Scotland seeing more than a 100% increase in new sign-ups.,external You may also have the chance to pick up a bargain at an outdoor market or pop-up shop. Outdoor trading, summer fairs as well as on-street dining and drinking could become more common over the warmer months, with government proposals making it easier for businesses to set up ""al fresco"". Businesses will more easily be able to turn pavements, terraces and even car parks into outdoor areas under plans to boost the hospitality industry in England and Wales. The government has also announced a newÂ£5.3m fund to help town centres makenecessary changes to businesses, such as outdoor awnings, tables and chairs and heating, as well as setting up new local markets.

"Updates on Friday 17 July The prime minister says the NHS in England is to get an extra Â£3bn of funding to help it prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus. From August 1 the Government will change its advice on working from home, to give employers discretion over whether to ask staff to go back to work. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has called for an urgent review into how data on coronavirus deaths is compiled in England. Rochdale brings in new measures to avoid reintroducing lockdown Leicester's lockdown measures are eased after cases drop. Jennifer Meierhans and Jay Vydelingum Jennifer MeierhansBBC News Thank you for joining me for updates on coronavirus from across England. That's all from me, have a good weekend and stay safe. There'll be more live updates from 09:00 on Monday. This time of year Magaluf is usually packed with tourists. Punta Ballena also known as the ""strip"" is where you might head out for a drink, bite to eat and then onto a nightclub. But the authorities have decided to close it because people aren't following social distancing rules. The move comes after videos showing German and British tourists partying in packed bars without face masks. There was also a video of a man jumping up and downon a parked car. Businesses remain cautious about the latest lockdown easing for England, and warn that any immediate mass return to work was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on a safety. And the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution"" across the country. New guidelinescover using public transport, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so,the PM has said. Indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can take place in England from the start of August, the prime minister has said. The government is working with the sector on pilots of performances with socially distanced audiences in theatres and music venues. Boris Johnson said the findings would feed into final guidance for venues in the run-up to them reopening. But the head of Theatres Trust said the move""will not be economically viable"". Haim, Liam Gallagher and The Chemical Brothers should have been playing in front of tens of thousands of fans in a quiet corner of Suffolk this weekend. The festival now attracts about 40,000 people The coronavirus lockdown led to the cancellation of the Latitude Festival but what has that meant for thearea it calls home? Sonia KatariaBBC News The owner of a pub which is no longer in Leicester's lockdown area said she has mixed feelings over the news that she could reopen. Charlotte Foy, who owns The White Horse in Birstall, said: ""We're thrilled with the announcement, but feel very sorry for the rest of Leicester and Oadby and Wigston."" Ms Foy said they were preparing to reopen on 4 July - the day pubs and restaurants were allowed to open across the rest of England - but was forced to remain shut. ""We've got beer still fresh and ready to go,"" she said. ""I'm glad we did that because we can open with immediate effect."" She added staff would be trained before opening on Sunday. Captain Sir Tom Moore has been knighted in the Queen's first official engagement in person since lockdown began. The investiture to honour the 100-year-old was staged in a ""unique ceremony"" at Windsor Castle. He is being honoured for raising almost Â£33m for the NHS by walking more than 100 laps of his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire. Capt Sir Tom said it was""the most special of days for me"".

Employers in England will soon have more freedom to decide whether staff should return to their place of work. But with many people still worried about contracting coronavirus, what are your rights, and can your boss force you to go back? The health secretary's said some lockdown restrictions in Leicester would remain in place, though some ""but not all"" would ease from 24 July. It's left many people in the city confused about what is and isn't possible. Nursing student Emily Crawford feels the advice could have been clearer People in Leicester have been told to stay at home as much as possible, but some said the announcement had left them unsure of what they could do outside. Nursing student Emily Crawford said: ""It could have been clearer. ""They said what shops can open but I'm still not really sure what I as an individual am allowed to do or not."" Bowling alleys and indoor skating rinks will be able to open for the first time since lockdown was introduced, on 1 August. Spectators will also be admittedto some sport events on a trial basis,including cricket, snooker and horse racing. It is hoped this will lead to a wider return of fans to stadiums in October. Beauty salons which allow treatments on the face - including eyelashes, eyebrows and threading - can start offering the services from 1 August, in England. Nail bars, tanning salons and some beauty salons are already open. Here'syour guideto what you can do after changes to lockdown restrictions. Rochdale has brought in immediate new measures to avoid a reintroduction of lockdown, as the town's director of public health warned the ""fight against coronavirus is not over"". The borough followsBlackburn with Darwen and Pendlein urging residents to follow extra precautions such as wearing face coverings in shops and limiting home visitors to two people. Rochdale Council's director of public health, Andrea Fallon, said: ""The fight against coronavirus is not over.
"" Although lockdown measures are being relaxed across the country, we can see from our local data that we need to remain vigilant to the threat posed by the disease."" The measures will be reviewed in two weeks. Wool's popularity has been in decline since the 1950s - and this year, coronavirus has added problems that businesses can ill afford. The global wool market closed in February. This has led to vast volumes of wool lying unsold in depots and has pushed prices down. Most farmers sell their fleeces through British Wool, formerly the British Wool Marketing Board. Some 14 million kg of wool are waiting to be shifted from its stores, while the average price per kg has nearly halved: it is now 32p, compared with 60p the previous year. Rachel, who is based in Banbury in Oxfordshire, says: ""Farmers used to be able to pay a year's rent from the price of wool, but it'sbarely worth selling anymore."" Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? As countries around the world consider when and how to ease restrictions, attention is being focussed on the best ways to avoid second or even third waves of Covid-19 infections. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Could there be a second wave? People have been ""urged to protect themselves and others"" after a rise in coronavirus cases in a part of Yorkshire. New figures show the equivalent of 20 new cases per 100,000 people in Wakefield - up from 14.8 last week. Public health bosses in the area have a ""growing concern"" numbers would continue to increase. Several people have tested positive at Wakefield's Urban House, a centre for asylum seekers ""Two large workplace outbreaks"" caused the jump, said Anna Hartley, Wakefield's director of public health. The latest data, from Public Health England (PHE) for the seven days to 13 July, shows Leicester still has the highest figure in the country with 99.7 per 100,000,although that is a fall from 126.7. British Airways has retired its entire fleet of Boeing 747 jumbo jets as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline was the world's largest operator of 747s - which are more expensive to fly than more modern passenger planes. BA had initially planned to ground them in 2024, but has brought forward the decision due to a downturn in travel. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent There are questions about whether new announcements onlockdown restrictions being eased furtherare too optimistic. And people do say Boris Johnson is an optimist. But the prime minister says all of the plans are contingent on people behaving responsibly, they will be reviewed, and he is not ruling out some of these restrictions being put back. That would be done in a different way, though. The government is very much hoping a national lockdown wonât be needed again. Instead, it believes it can see local outbreaks happening and give more powers to local councils, and ministers, to act on that very, very quickly. What we are seeing Boris Johnson do is outline a longer term plan to, as he says, âget back to life as normalâ, or as normal as possible. But it is clear from listening to him that it is not going to feel normal for everybody for quite some time. The mayor of Leicesterhas accused the health secretary of ""playing silly games"" with its local lockdown. Last night, Matt Hancock said restrictions would remain in the city, though some ""but not all"" would ease from 24 July. Some suburbs under the Tory-controlled county council will be released from on Saturday - a decision city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said was ""political"". County council leader Nick Rushton said the move had been ""based on evidence"". Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Nudge, nudge, nudge. Boris Johnson emphasises that anybody can use public transport. And he says that from 1 August, the advice on working from home will change. Businesses are to be given more âdiscretionâ on whether staff should come back to work. It reflects deep concerns about the economy - not just that some people canât easily work from home or may, in some cases, be less productive, but also that businesses who rely on the passing trade from office workers are struggling. However, Johnson may face questions over whether heâs passing the buck to employers who now need to make some tough decisions. And what about the statement of his own chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance yesterday - that there was âabsolutely no reasonâ to change the advice on work from home? Guidance on using public transport and going to workplaces is to be relaxed in England as lockdown restrictions are eased further, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said people may use public transport for journeys immediately, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Mr Johnson said employers would have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it was safe to do so. The PM added he was ""hoping for the best and planning for the worst"". Mr Johnson said during a news conference at Downing Street he hoped the country would return to ""significant"" normality byChristmas this year. Â© 2025 BBC.

The government has also announced a newÂ£5.3m fund to help town centres makenecessary changes to businesses, such as outdoor awnings, tables and chairs and heating, as well as setting up new local markets.

"The coronavirus outbreak has sent a shockwave through the finances of millions of people in the UK. The effect has not been universal, nor has it been equal. Your age, your job, where you live, and the pre-virus state of your finances will all make a difference to how well you can cope. For a start, there has been the effect on income. For those who work, the amount of money coming in depends mostly on their wages. More than nine million people have been off work but paid by the state to stay in their jobs - in other words, placed on furlough. The government, to date, has paid 80% of someone's wages. Not every employer can afford to top this up. That has meant a 20% pay cut for millions of people. Some may have had bigger cuts, as the scheme pays only the first Â£2,500 of the monthly wage. Workers aged 17, particularly women, are most likely to be in jobs that have been furloughed, data from the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), shows. Men aged in their 40s and women aged 41 to 58 were least likely to have been put on the scheme. Many employers may find it hard to keep on staff as the furlough scheme is gradually removed. The extra cost may prompt them to cut jobs, even though the government has promised a Â£1,000 bonus in January for each furloughed worker they keep on. The self-employed have their own government support, used by 2.7 million people, but again it has meant falling income for many and it will not last beyond the summer. Then there are those whose work has dried up or who have lost their jobs. Going into this crisis, many young workers had insecure, temporary jobs. The outlook for them is highly uncertain. The last recession (a significant downturn in the economy) amid the financial crisis of a decade ago showed that it is young employees who are most at risk of unemployment. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the UK is ""entering one of the most severe recessions this country has ever seen"", so, as it bites, jobless levels could end up worse than last time. Those of working age on low incomes, or who have lost their jobs, have needed to claim benefits. For those claiming for the first time or after a period without benefits, that is likely to be universal credit. As lockdown took hold, so the applications shot up. Debt charities argue the amount paid in benefits is insufficient. With less money coming in, there is pressure on people's ability to pay out. Again, this is likely to hit the youngest the hardest. They have less in savings and need to spend more of their money on essentials, such as rent. Overall, households have saved money during lockdown thanks to not being able to spend on non-essentials, such as holidays and eating out, but it tends to be older households that have saved the most. Older people are more likely to be able to spend a bigger proportion of their money on non-essentials, such as eating out and holidays. During lockdown, they have simply been unable to do that. The result is that some of this money has been saved. On average, this is positive, but the general picture masks the fact that those who really need something to fall back on in a crisis may not have any savings at all. One big question is whether those with extra savings now go out and spend the money. The same is true of paying off debts. Figures show a dramatic and sudden repayment of debts such as overdrafts and credit cards - with repayments outstripping new borrowing. Why? Many people have been unable to flash their credit cards, with shops, and particularly travel services, closed for business. Some have had holidays cancelled and the money, possibly paid many months ago, has been refunded to their credit-card accounts during lockdown. The uncertainty means delving into an overdraft to buy big-ticket items, like a car or a new kitchen, may also have been off the agenda. Facing income pressures, some people have struggled to pay key bills. Many have taken the opportunity to defer their mortgage or rent for a few months, as lenders have offered what is known as a payment holiday. Similar breaks have been agreed for other bills, such as gas and electricity. That holiday, like a more traditional getaway, will end by the autumn and will have to be paid for. Whether people can pick up where they left off by paying those bills, which may well now be a little higher, will be vital in saving them from a financial hole from which it could take years to climb out.

"In the footage several police cars attend the arrest after officers are confronted by onlookers An officer has been suspended after footage emerged that appears to show police kneeling on a man's neck. Video recorded in Islington, London, shows two officers holding a handcuffed suspect, who is black, on the pavement. A second officer has been removed from operational duty following the arrest on Thursday evening. Deputy Met Police commissioner Sir Steve House said the footage was ""extremely disturbing"" and had been referred to the police watchdog. The force confirmed it had charged a 45-year-old man with possession of a knife in a public place. Marcus Coutain, of Islington, is due to appear in custody at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Saturday. In the footage, shared with the BBC, one of the officers appears to be using his knee to control the suspect and has his hand on the man's head. The man on the ground, who is in handcuffs, repeatedly shouts: ""Get off my neck."" He is eventually released from the ground and continues to talk to officers after they sit him up. Several police cars arrive at the scene after the arresting officers are confronted by onlookers. An eye witness told the BBC: ""I was worried he was going to get executed. That's just how George Floyd got killed. ""If not for the crowds filming the police they could have suffocated him or broken his neck. ""He was on the floor and in handcuffs, what's the reason for a kneeling on his neck?"" Sir Steve said: ""The video footage that I have seen today and is circulating on social media is extremely disturbing. ""Some of the techniques used cause me great concern - they are not taught in police training. ""One officer has been suspended and another officer has been removed from operational duty, but not suspended at this time. This decision will be kept under review."" The man had since been seen by a doctor, Scotland Yard said. It has also referred the arrest to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Sir Steve's comments were highly unusual both in tone and content, particularly because the force had seen police body-worn footage which has not been made publicly available. He added that the former Police Scotland chief constable had complained earlier this week that some officers were being unfairly targeted because of social media clips which did not show the full context of situations. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""I'm deeply concerned about this distressing incident and we have raised this with senior officers at the Met Police as a matter of urgency. ""I welcome the fact the incident has been reviewed quickly by the Met and it's right that they have referred it to the IOPC."" The IOPC said it would conduct an independent investigation, according to the Met.

"Kirk Butcher was described by his family as a ""fun-loving husband"" who adored his three daughters A van driver who drove the wrong way down a motorway slip road, killing a father of three in a head-on crash, has been jailed. Thomas Hughes, 24, was trying to take his own life when he drove on to the M4 at Newport, hitting Kirk Butcher's car on 5 April. Mr Butcher, 45, was killed instantly. Hughes, from Cwmbran, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to seven years. The court heard how Hughes had been released from police custody, and had driven towards the M4 after being told by his flatmate he was not welcome back. It was told he was trying to take his own life when he drove the wrong way down the slip road. But the van he was driving crashed into Mr Butcher's car, who was on his way home from a 12-hour shift at a supermarket depot where he had started working during the coronavirus pandemic. Hughes left the scene of the crash, and another driver called 999. In a victim impact statement, Mr Butcher's widow Janet told the court the couple had been ""childhood sweethearts, soulmates who dreamed of getting old together"". She said ""nothing in our lives will be the same"" following her husband's death. Gwent Police said Hughes' actions were a ""senseless and selfish act"" Sentencing Hughes, Judge Richard Twomlow said he ""gave Mr Butcher no chance to avoid you"". ""This was an unbelievably dangerous piece of driving with no thought for anyone but yourself,"" he said. ""The consequences for others were quite terrible."" After the hearing, Mr Butcher's family called for a change in the law so that a car was recognised as a ""deadly weapon"". His stepsister, Sarah Higgins, said: ""We're devastated. He's left three children behind and a beautiful wife. ""He was the busiest, nicest guy you could ever hope to meet and he's gone. Nothing's going to change that."" PC Darren Sullivan, of Gwent Police, said Hughes' actions were a ""senseless and selfish act, which took the life of an innocent man"".""This tragedy was completely avoidable and Hughes will have to live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life, although that will provide little comfort to the Butcher family,"" he said.""Too many people die on our roads every year in senseless and often avoidable circumstances. ""I can only hope that the sentence passed today will act as a deterrent to anyone intent on driving in such a dangerous and reckless manner.""Hughes was also banned from driving for eight and a half years.

"Aaron McKenzie must serve a minimum of 35 years in jail The ex-partner of a heavily pregnant woman has been jailed for stabbing her to death in her own home. Kelly Fauvrelle was knifed 21 times in the middle of the night in her Croydon bedroom. Her baby boy Riley, who was delivered by Caesarean, died four days later. Aaron McKenzie, 26, from Peckham, was found guilty of the murder of Ms Fauvrelle and Riley's manslaughter. He was sentenced to life with a minimum 35 years at the Old Bailey on Friday. He was also given 20 years for the manslaughter of baby Riley and three years for possession of a knife, to run concurrently. Kelly Mary Fauvrelle's baby was delivered by paramedics but died later in hospital Sentencing, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""At 03:15 on 29 June last year, you broke into Kelly's bedroom at the home she shared with her family. ""You then launched a ferocious attack on Kelly, inflicting no fewer than 21 stab wounds. ""Kelly's family woke to the noise of her screams, rushed to her room and sought to care for her. ""It's clear from all the evidence this was the most vicious and deliberate killing."" The trial heard Miss Fauvrelle's relationship with McKenzie, with whom she shared an interest in motorbikes, had ended early last year. Her death was the result of McKenzie's ""cowardly"" response to learning Miss Fauvrelle wanted nothing to do with him, while his actions afterwards demonstrated no ""sorrow or remorse"", the judge added. McKenzie gave the judge a thumbs up as he was sent down, while Miss Fauvrelle's family wept in court. In a victim impact statement, Miss Fauvrelle's sister Melissa said: ""This was an act of pure evil."" She said her sister was a selfless, caring, loving woman with a ""pure heart"". Her father Jean Fauvrelle said: ""Aaron McKenzie's evil act has devastated our lives. My heart physically aches, but those words do not feel sufficient."" Aaron McKenzie was captured on CCTV on his way to kill Kelly Fauvrelle Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said Miss Fauvrelle's family had been ""devastated"". ""This has been a harrowing and distressing case for all concerned. My thoughts today are with Kelly-Mary's family, who have suffered immeasurable loss and been put through the agony of a trial. ""Their future with Kelly and Riley was so cruelly taken from them, and it is fitting that McKenzie's future has today been taken from him.""

"Floral tributes have been placed at the site A 10-year-old boy has died following an accident at a works site in Glasgow. Shea Ryan died in hospital after suffering serious injuries on the site near Glenkirk Drive in Drumchapel on Thursday evening. His name was confirmed by his grandparents, Janis Meechan and William Brown, who told BBC Scotland Shea was a ""good boy"". Police said their inquiries into his death were continuing but it was not being treated as suspicious. Emergency services were called to the site at 21:55 on Thursday. Shea was taken by ambulance to the Royal Hospital for Children on the Queen Elizabeth campus in Glasgow. He died soon after arriving. His grandparents were among those who laid floral tributes at the site on Friday. ""We think our wee granddaughter was there when he fell,"" Ms Meechan said. ""We've just came up to put these flowers down and then we'll get him a big grandson flower.Â Â ""He was a good boy,"" she said. ""Wild, but good"". When Shea's grandfather found out what happened he said:Â Â ""I thought I was hearing things"".Â Â His grandparents said they saw Shea all the time Work was being carried out on the site by agencies including Scottish Water to address flooding problems from the Garscadden Burn. On Friday a children's slide that had been taped off could be seen at the very edge of the construction site with police standing guard. The Health and Safety Executive confirmed it was assisting police with their inquiries. The police investigation is being supported by the Health and Safety Executive Margaret Coyle, head teacher at Camstradden Primary School where Shea went to school, said they were devastated to learn of his death. ""In the short period of time Shea's been with us at the school he has made many friends with school staff and the children,"" she added. ""Everyone will be shocked to learn of his death and we will do all that we can to offer support to the family and wider community in Drumchapel."" Allow Twitter content?

That's not the average response to see police running down a hill towards something,'"" he explained. Mr Copland said the gaps in the construction site fence concerned him as a father himself because of the ""major excavation"" that was taking place. ""There are gaps in the fence and parts of the fence that have been torn down and replaced but because of Covid-19 I don't think a lot of people have been going round to check on it,"" he said. ""I think there has to be a consideration into security now, maybe more personnel here at night as a deterrent or more signs, something instead of just a fence with holes. ""The site just looks like a big sandy hill to a kid. It's devastating. Your heart goes out to them"". Police officers remained at the scene overnight A Drumchapel resident who heard the sirens, Agnes Ball, said the small community would pull together in the ""heartbreaking"" and ""tragic"" accident. Tributes to the 10-year-old have been posted on social media from ""devastated"" Drumchapel residents. A post on a community Facebook page said: ""So sorry to wake up and see this.

"Businesses remain cautious about the latest lockdown easing for England, and warn that any mass return to work immediately was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on safety. And the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution out there"" in the country. New guidelinescover using public transport, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so, the PM has said. Plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM Can my boss make me go back to work if I don't want to? Coronavirus: What's the risk on transport? Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, doubted there would be a significant return to offices and other workplaces any time soon. ""Businesses need to balance the risks, and won't want to increase the possibility of closures down the line by rushing back. ""On top of this, not everything is in a company's control. Childcare is an issue for many employees, and even if the guidance is changed, some staff who use public transport will still be concerned."" Other employers' organisations said firms still wanted government support to help smooth the return to work process. At Clapham Junction station some seats are taped off to keep people apart Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said that smaller firms in particular would need more support in order to get workers back. ""Small firms are being tasked with consulting employees and putting the right measures in place to ensure a safe return to work,"" he said. ""After weeks of little or no income, they will need help - both funding and advice - to make that happen."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said companies should get tax breaks to re-open offices. BCC director general Adam Marshall said: ""Businesses should be able to offset the investments they make to ensure their premises are Covid-secure against their tax bill, which would help many to return to workplaces over the coming months."" ""We're not planning to reopen our offices until October despite Boris Johnson's revised advice,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth, who employs 60 people at the Savvy marketing agency in Leeds. ""I don't think that people are ready to get back to work yet, although we're consulting with our staff to ask them how they feel about it."" She said it felt a little ironic that Mr Johnson's statement came on the day when most schools are closing. ""Working parents will struggle to get child care over the next two months,"" she pointed out. The company is reconfiguring its offices to make them safer and give staff more space when they do return. ""We're also going to cut down how much we expect people in the office. We've been quite productive in lockdown, but we've lost things like the water-cooler conversations."" She is concerned about doing the right thing for people as well as for the economy. ""Our safety concerns are genuine. Have we got enough toilets in the office for instance? I felt Boris Johnson abdicated responsibility by leaving it to businesses to decide. She says she felt her decision to keep her offices shut was correct after listening to Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser on Thursday, who said there is ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home,. ""After listening to Boris today, I haven't changed my mind."" The TUC backed calls for more support for companies. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said Friday's announcement was the government ""passing the buck on this big decision to employers"". She pointed out that returning to work safely required a functioning NHS Test and Trace system, ""Yet progress on test and trace is still patchy"". She added: ""A safe return to workplaces also requires much greater investment in public transport if people are to be able to commute."" There is an expectation among many employers that home working will remain in place for thousands of companies despite Friday's announcement. ""People are not comfortable returning to the office yet,"" said Ruth Duston, chief executive of South Westminster Business Improvement District, which represents the interests of 5,000 businesses across London. ""Even when offices do start returning, we are looking at perhaps only a max of a third of workers returning to offices at any one time to allow for social distancing."" She said cities should prepare for a permanent shift in working practices. ""People will return [to offices] but this will likely be a gradual process over many months. When they do, it will be to collaborate and exchange with their colleagues rather than to spend eight hours at a desk."" From25 Julyindoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities can reopen On1 Augustthe government will update its advice on going to work, asking employers to make decisions about how and where their staff can work safely From the same date, most remaining leisure settings, including bowling, skating rinks, casinos and all close contact services such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen Live indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions for up to 30 people will also be allowed from next month FromSeptember, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, while universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible FromOctober, the government intends to allow audiences to return to stadiums, while conferences and other business events can recommence, subject to the outcome of pilots Mr Marshall said many of the BCC's members were focused on changes to flexible working practices rather than getting everyone back in the office. ""Firms will be weighing up how they want to work in future. Many have seen benefits to productivity and work-life balance over recent months and will want to keep elements of their new normal,"" he said. And the IoD said that as many as two thirds of its members said they intend to keep increased flexible working in place after lockdown ends. A recent Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development survey found that employers, overall, report home workers are at least as productive as other workers, and plan to double the proportion of staff who work from home regularly once the crisis is over.

Mr Copland said the gaps in the construction site fence concerned him as a father himself because of the ""major excavation"" that was taking place. ""There are gaps in the fence and parts of the fence that have been torn down and replaced but because of Covid-19 I don't think a lot of people have been going round to check on it,"" he said. ""I think there has to be a consideration into security now, maybe more personnel here at night as a deterrent or more signs, something instead of just a fence with holes.

"Indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can take place in England from the start of August, the prime minister has said. The government is working with the sector on pilots of performances with socially distanced audiences in theatres and music venues. Boris Johnson said the findings would feed into final guidance for venues in the run-up to them reopening. But the head of Theatres Trust said the move ""will not be economically viable"". Dame Judi Dench was among many theatre figures to voice concerns for her industry Although Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust welcomed the news as ""a step in the right direction"", he said that ""for most theatres it will not be economically viable to reopen with 30-40% audience required under social distancing"". He said they needed to progress to theatres being allowed to open fully ""with the appropriate safety measures"", adding: ""Without this most theatres cannot reopen viably and we need the go-ahead for Christmas shows, on which the survival of many theatres depends, in the next few weeks at the very latest."" The government stressed that ""audiences, performers and venues will be expected to maintain social distancing at all times."" This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic It added: ""This guidance will be for organisations in England. Organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should adhere to the advice of the devolved administrations at all times."" Venues have been shut since March as part of the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport added it was now working with venues including the London Symphony Orchestra on measures for reopening. However it added that singing and the playing of brass and wind instruments in groups or in front of an audience is ""still currently limited to professionals only"". The announcement is likely to be welcomed by theatre owners and producers, but a sense of frustration with the government is likely to remain. It makes no financial sense for many venues to open with social distancing rules in place; theatre budgets tend to be based on a breakeven of around 70% capacity. If social distancing measures mean a theatre can only run at 20-25% capacity, the producer cannot afford to put the show on. What the industry says it desperately needs from the government is some clear guidance on when stage five (fuller audiences indoors) of the phased return will be possible. The call is for the government to announce a ""not before"" date, which would allow producers and theatre owners to make a plan of action for the coming months, be that preparing a show or reducing overheads. The Society of London Theatre, which represents venues in London's West End, said it was ""delighted,external"" by what it called ""another welcome step on the road map towards reopening with full audiences"". Yet it said it would not be ""practical or economically viable"" for many shows to open with social distancing restrictions. ""We welcome the news that theatres & performance venues can reopen with social distancing in August, but the reality is the vast majority will not be opening,""tweeted,externalactors' union Equity. Choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne also expressed doubts about theatres' ability to open with social distancing in place. ""Why make these announcements when they know that the vast majority of theatre, dance and music is not financially viable under 'Covid secure' conditions?""he tweeted,external. The UK's media and entertainment union Bectu said the news was ""a significant development"" but that venues would need government support if they are to reopen. Mr Dowden said the announcement was a ""welcome step in the path to a return to normal"" ""We know that theatres and venues will not be open in two weeks' time,"" said its head Philippa Childs. ""Theatres will have to bring back productions, sell tickets, conduct rehearsals and prepare for how they will operate in a Covid-secure way before they can open up again. ""This announcement brings into sharp focus the need for urgent answers to the pressing questions that we have been asking since the arts recovery package was announced nearly two weeks ago."" Earlier this month the governmentannounced a Â£1.57bn support package, following several weeks of lobbying from theatres, music venues, art galleries and other cultural institutions, many of which had said they were on the brink of collapse. The government has also now outlined measures to ""support the safe return of audiences"", including: Reduced venue capacity and limited ticket sales to ensure social distancing can be maintained Tickets should be bought online and venues encouraged to use e-tickets to reduce contact and help with track and trace Venues should have clearly communicated social distancing marking in place in areas where queues form and adopt a limited entry approach Increased deep cleaning of auditoriums Performances should be scheduled to allow sufficient time to undertake deep cleaning before the next audience arrives Performers, conductors and musicians must observe social distancing wherever possible Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""The UK's performing arts sector is renowned across the world and I am pleased that we are making real progress in getting its doors reopened to the public with social distancing."" Beloved small gig venues succumb to Covid closure Fears over Â£1.57bn arts industry support package Two Theatre Royals, two cities, two job warnings This latest announcement will now see venues move to stage four of the government's ""five-stage roadmap for the return of professional performing arts"", which was recently outlined by Mr Dowden as follows: Stage One- Rehearsal and training (no audiences and adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Two- Performances for broadcast and recording purposes (adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Three- Performances outdoors with an audience plus pilots for indoor performances with a limited distance audience Stage Four- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (but with a limited distanced audience indoors) Stage Five- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (with a fuller audience indoors) Even as the government was preparing to unveil its latest measures, however, more venues announced they were having to consider staff redundancies. The Royal Opera House announced on Friday,external""with huge sadness"" that it had made the ""difficult decision"" to begin ""a restructure process"". And in Edinburgh, the Traverse Theatre said it had made the ""painfully difficult decision to enter into redundancy consultation"" with ""a number"" of its team. In a statement,external, the venue said it was likely that ""almost a third"" of its staff ""in customer-facing and technical roles"" would lose their jobs.

"This video can not be played PM announces powers to tackle local outbreaks Coronavirus restrictions will ease further in England under plans for a ""significant return to normality"" by Christmas, Boris Johnson has announced. Under the new guidelines, people may use public transport for journeys immediately, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so, the PM explained. Mr Johnson added he was ""hoping for the best and planning for the worst"". At a news conference at Downing Street, the prime minister saidthe plan,external""remains conditional"" on continued progress in controlling the virus and preventing a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. ""It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest - possibly in time for Christmas,"" he said. Devolved administrations in Scotland,Walesand Northern Ireland have the power to set their own timings for the easing of restrictions. Councils to get coronavirus shutdown powers Reality Check: PM's statement fact-checked In the announcement, Mr Johnson said the government was making it clear to people in England they may use public transport now. From 1 August, he said: ""Instead of government telling people to work from home, we are going to give employers more discretion, and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely."" He explained that could mean ""continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees"". However, the Welsh government said it would carry on advising people to work from home. This video can not be played Labour's Starmer on lifting coronavirus lockdown measures Responding to Mr Johnson's announcement, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I positively don't want people to be returning to offices in the way that we did before coronavirus happened."" Will I have to return to the office if I don't want to? What will close during the next lockdowns?,external What's the risk on transport? The government's current social distancing guidance requires peopleto stay at least 1m apart with certain precautions. On Friday, a further 114 coronavirus deathswere announced,external, taking the total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK to 45,233. It comes as Public Health England saidit was pausing the publication of the daily death figure,externalwhile officials investigate claims thatthe numbers may have been distorted. Leicester has faced further restrictions which will begin to be lifted on 24 July On Thursday, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance,told MPs there was ""absolutely no reason""to change the government's current guidance on working from home. The government has advised people to ""work from home if you can"" since March, and Sir Patrick said home working was still a ""perfectly good option"" for many. Asked about those comments at the news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""totally agrees"" with Sir Patrick and that it was not for the government to tell employers where their workforce should be. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he will look at the details of the government's plan to get people back to work but stressed ""this can't be done on a wing and a prayer and requires a credible plan and national leadership"". Business groups warnedany mass return to work immediately was unlikely. Smaller companies in particular would need more support to get workers back, Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses said. ""Small firms are being tasked with consulting employees and putting the right measures in place to ensure a safe return to work,"" he said. ""After weeks of little or no income, they will need help - both funding and advice - to make that happen."" Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said childcare and concerns about using public transport were still issues for many employees. Trade union body the TUC accused ministers of ""passing the buck on this big decision to employers"" and said more investment in public transport would be needed to make commuting safer. From25 Julyindoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities can reopen On1 Augustthe government will update its advice on going to work, asking employers to make decisions about how and where their staff can work safely From the same date, most remaining leisure settings, including bowling, skating rinks, casinos and all close contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen Live indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions for up to 30 people will also be allowed from next month FromSeptember, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, while universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible FromOctober, the government intends to allow audiences to return to stadiums, while conferences and other business events can recommence, subject to the outcome of pilots The prime minister reiterated previously announced plans to pausethe shielding programmefor vulnerable people in England at the end of July. Butdisability groups expressed their concernthat this will come as employers are asked to consider bringing staff back to workplaces. James Taylor, from charity Scope, said the PM's announcement would ""ring alarm bells"" for disabled people who were ""extremely anxious"" about the change. Also from 1 August, Mr Johnson said most remaining leisure settings, such as bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos, and close-contact services, such as beauticians, could resume. This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic Indoor performanceswith socially-distanced audiences in theatres, music and performance venues will also be allowed from next month. However, soft play areas and nightclubs will remain closed beyond that date, although they ""will be kept under review"". From October, he said fanscould be able to return to sport stadiumsif pilot events go well. The upcoming World Snooker Championships in Sheffield, the Glorious Goodwood horse racing festival and two men's county cricket friendly matches are set to be among the trial sporting fixtures. Winter is the big concern. The problem is, we don't know how well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off in our spring so we don't know what a winter with Covid-19 will look like. There is evidence the virus survives longer in cooler temperatures - and similar infections, including flu, do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these restrictions can actually be lifted. Sage documents,external, released today, raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus protections that would be ""difficult to achieve"". They advise the government should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced. The PM indicated that social distancing measures could be relaxed further for loved ones. He said: ""Throughout this period, we will look to allow more close contact between friends and family, where we can."" Mr Johnsonalso confirmed an additional Â£3bn in funding for the NHSto help it prepare for a potential second wave of infections and to cope with its usual winter pressures. An expansion in testing capacity to a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of October would help identify positive coronavirus cases among people with symptoms of seasonal illnesses, he added. It comes days after scientists saidthe UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deathsin a second wave of infections this winter if no mitigations were put in place. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In addition to the further easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Mr Johnson unveiled new powers for local authorities to manage outbreaks of the virus in their areas. He said local authorities would have the power to close premises, close off public outdoors spaces and cancel events. Ministers would also receive clearer guidance on where they can intervene to ""close whole sectors or types of premises in an area"" and advise people in specific postcodes to stay at home. ""It has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country,"" Mr Johnson said.

"The NHS in England will get an extra Â£3bn of funding to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has announced. The funding will also help ease winter pressures on the health service, Downing Street said. It followswarnings a second wave this winter could see as many as 120,000 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals. The prime minister made the funding commitment at a No 10 briefing, where he also pledged a new testing target. Capacity will be increased to at least 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, Mr Johnson said. Confirming the extra Â£3bn in funding for the NHS in England, he said Covid-19 could become ""more virulent"" in winter. The prime minister said: ""Demand for testing is not the only challenge that winter will bring. It's possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months and it's certain that the NHS will face the usual annual winter pressures."" He added: ""We're making sure we're ready for winter and planning for the worst."" Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive additional funds, Mr Johnson added. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas called for an urgent reviewinto how coronavirus deaths have been recorded in England. Is a second wave of coronavirus on the way? How close to developing a vaccine are we? How can I get a coronavirus test? Downing Street said the new NHS funding would be available immediately and would allow the NHS to continue using additional private hospital capacity and maintain the temporary Nightingale hospitals until the end of March 2021. This will provide additional capacity for coronavirus patients, as well as allowing the NHS to carry out routine treatments and procedures, No 10 said. Non-urgent operations were suspended as the UK went into lockdown, to free up hospital beds during the first wave of coronavirus - but in May NHS England told hospitals they should restart procedures. In normal times an announcement of Â£3bn to help the NHS in England cope with winter pressures might look generous. But these are not normal times as the government pumps tens of billions into the economy to soften the blows of the coronavirus crisis. The head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, has been in talks with the Treasury to get guarantees that the Nightingale hospitals can stay open through until next spring in case there is another Covid surge. He also wanted secure funding in place to do a deal with private hospitals to help tackle the backlog of cancelled non urgent operations such as hip and knee replacements. That money now seems to have been secured, though we await further details. The question is, will this be enough to get the health service through what could be one of the most difficult winters in its history? There have been predictions that the waiting list for routine surgery will swell to 10 million as fears of a second wave of Covid cases in the depths of winter won't go away. Highlighting other measures to protect the NHS as it heads into the winter, Mr Johnson said the government would carry out the biggest flu vaccination programme in the history of the health service, while supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators had also increased. The announcement was made as the prime ministerannounced a further easing of lockdown measures. The prime minister encouraged people to return to using public transport, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. From the beginning of next month, Mr Johnson said employers would have more discretion to bring staff back to the workplace providing it was safe to do so. Since late March the government had been advising people to work from home if possible to help curb coronavirus. Last week Mr Johnson had signalled a change, saying: ""I think we should now say, well, 'Go back to work if you can'."" But the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told MPs on Thursdaythere was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the government's current guidanceon working from home. Sir Patrick wore a mask as he spoke to the Commons Science and Technology Committee on Thursday SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Earlier this week a report, requested by Sir Patrick, called for immediate action to reduce the risks posed by a second wave of coronavirus this winter. Among its recommendations were increasing the capacity of thetest and trace programmeand having more people vaccinated against flu. Asked to model a ""reasonable"" worst-case scenario, scientists suggested a range of between 24,500 and 251,000 virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February. The estimate does not take into account any lockdowns, treatments or vaccines. This video can not be played What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? Research suggests the virus can survive longer in colder conditions and is more likely to spread when people spend more time indoors. Experts are also concerned the NHS will be under extreme pressure, not just from a resurgence of coronavirus but also from seasonal flu and a backlog of regular, non-coronavirus workload. The British Medical Association chairman, Chaand Nagpaul, has called for more detail on how the Â£3bn funding will be used. ""The government talks of winter planning, but we need transparency on this, including how far this money can stretch in tackling a modelled worst-case forecast - including a second peak, additional non-Covid demand and a possible flu outbreak,"" Dr Nagpaul said. ""Crucially, the government must make prevention a priority and take every necessary step to try and avoid a national second spike all together."" NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS organisations, echoed the call for clarity over what the money will be used for, saying funding is already in place for Nightingale hospitals and private beds. While welcoming the financial support, deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery added: ""Trusts need more than that. They have got to recover the lost ground of the last four or five months and put measures in place to manage the additional activity that always happens in winter.""

"First Minister Mark Drakeford says playgrounds, funfairs, community centres and outdoor gyms can reopen on Monday People are urged to respect the countryside after ""widespread"" reports of visitors leaving litter and using beauty spots as toilets Thousands of jobs could be at risk in Wales' creative industries because freelancers cannot access UK government cash, a Senedd inquiry has been told Care home residents in Carmarthenshire have been meeting family face-to-face for the first time since lockdown began On Friday, one further death of someone with coronavirus in Wales was announced, taking the official death total to 1,546 Nicola Bryan, James McCarthy and Andy Roberts That's all from our live blog on coronavirus developments in Wales on Friday. Here are some of the main developments:  Thanks for joining us -click hereto keep up to date with coronavirus developments around the world. One more person with coronavirus has been confirmed to have died in Wales, taking the official total to 1,546. This graph shows the daily number of deaths according to the day they occurred, rather than the day they were announced. The average is now less than one coronavirus-related death per day in Wales. One more person with coronavirus has died in Wales, taking the official total to 1,546. The death was reported in the Betsi Cadwaldr health board area covering north Wales, which has had the highest number of deaths of people with Covid-19. Cardiff University's Class of 2020 has been taking part in virtual graduation celebrations. Students are also able to invite friends and family to join in. They celebrated by singing a version of the Elton John hit I'm Still Standing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One more person has died in Wales with coronavirus, it has been reported, with the official total now standing at 1,546. Public Health Wales (PHW) said there were 16 new cases, meaning 16,887 people had tested positive for Covid-19. The figures have been revised to include tests carried out at non-NHS laboratories. Asked when the Welsh Government had been first advised to bring in the lockdown, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he believed it was on 23 March, the date it happened. Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the UK government, has said Boris Johnson's administration was given advice to go into lockdown earlier, on 16 or 18 March. Mr Drakeford said: ""My
memory is that it was that meeting of 23  March, the Cobra meeting that
we attend and the first ministers of Scotland and Northern Ireland attend, it
was at that meeting of 23 March when the advice was put to Cobra to
institute a full lockdown. ""There had been meetings in
the previous week, in which the evolving pattern of coronavirus had been
identified, but my memory is pretty clear that it wasn't until the 23rd that
Cobra were advised that a full lockdown was now the right answer to the spread
of the virus across the United Kingdom."" Advice to stay at home and work from home if possible is not changing in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford says. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted to see a""significant return to normality"" by Christmaswith employers in England being given more discretion to bring staff back to
workplaces if it is safe to do so. But Mr Drakeford said he did not want to see people returning to offices âin the way we did before coronavirus"". He said one of the few positives of the last few months was learning how possible it is to work âvery effectivelyâ from home, without the need for large numbers to travel to and from office locations. âWe have managed extraordinarily well by working differently,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""I think thatâs been a positive lesson we can draw from coronavirus. âI will not be doing things to undermine our ability to learn from those lessons in Wales.â The pandemic has shown it is possible to work ""very effectively"" from home, the first minister said Speaking about local lockdowns, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government
had the powers it needs in Wales in order to take sensible measures. He said Boris Johnson's announcement earlier of sweeping new powers for national and local government to impose local lockdowns in England were âvery
sensible measuresâ of the sort Wales would follow in a similar situation. But Mr Drakeford added: âThe powers in England have been less clear as
to where they lie between local government and central government. âOur regulations are clear where the power lies in Wales and, if we did need to institute local lockdowns, we know where the responsibility
would lie and who would have to take those decisions.â The owners of one of Europe's largest campsites say they have made ""the hardest decision ever"" to not reopen this summer. Shell Island at Llanbedr, near Harlech in Gwynedd,will stay shut until 2021. The site, covering the equivalent of 150 football pitches, normally attracts thousands of holidaymakers every week, but has been shut during the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions on campsites in Walesare being lifted on 25 July. Neath Port Talbot Council will not reopen its playgrounds until 27 July, although the Welsh Government says they can reopen from Monday. The council said there would be a number of changes when they do reopen. This includes allowing only one adult to accompany children at a time.
and no food or drink in the play area. It would not be sensible to reopen sport stadiums to the public yet, the First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedstadiums in England could start to reopen from October. The move could have implications for Welsh clubs like Cardiff City and Swansea City who play in the English Football League. But Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government ""haven't had discussions yet about bringing large crowds of people back together"". ""It wouldn't be sensible to be doing that,"" he said. ""I think we're learning today that the UK government intends to pilot the possibility of bringing crowds back to stadiums, and I've spoken to [Cabinet Office minister] Michael Gove about that this morning, and reached an agreement that we will learn with from the results of those pilots."" Mr Drakeford stressed it was how people arrive at stadiums that poses the greatest concern. ""It's not the stadium itself or the organisation inside the stadium that may be the issue,"" he said. ""It will be how people get to the stadium, how they behave on the way in, how crowds gather around the stadium when things are going on inside the stadium where it's all very carefully and tightly organised."" Snowdonia National Park Authority is asking visitors to be considerate as they begin returning to the area. It has issued a ""welcome back"" guide where it asked people to maintain social distancing, follow good hand hygiene, park considerately and be considerate to other visitors, residents and people who work in the park. Park officials said that since reopening on 6 July,a ""small minority"" of hikers had left litter, dog mess and even human excrement. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed a Â£59m arts relief package for Wales has been received from the UK government. He said the plans being drawn up with the Arts Council for Wales and others on how to spend it were âdrawing to a conclusion.â An announcement will be made at the start of next week that will include details on the allocations of the first tranche of funding. He said: âWe are trying to do it in the way we have gone about things throughout the crisis, to make the plan first and then make the announcement, and weâre very close to being able to do that.â In his final daily briefing, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has thanked people across public
services, the NHS, the voluntary sector, businesses and society as a
whole for their efforts over ""these very difficult months"". ""A great many sad things
have happened here in Wales since March,"" he said. ""Livelihoods and businesses
have been lost; children's education has been affected; families have been
unable to see loved ones and more than 2,400 people have died from coronavirus
here in Wales alone, according to ONS figures. ""For their families this crisis
is certainly not over. ""But, because of all
efforts we have made together; because we have followed the 'stay at home' rules, the 'stay local' rules, those the worst fears have been averted."" But Mr Drakeford emphasised that ""it
is not over"". ""Coronavirus is still here
in Wales - and in the absence of a vaccine, it could be with us for some time
yet to come,"" he said. ""We will spend the summer
planning for the rest of this year."" From next week, the daily 12:30 news conferences will
mostly take place once a week on Tuesdays. ""I started my company because my
dad received approximately 3p per fleece for his Hebridean wool and I thought,
'We must be able to do better than that,'""says shepherd's daughter
Rachel Atkinson. Rachel
manufactures woollen products, but her firm is struggling. Wool's
popularity has been in decline since the 1950s - and this year, coronavirus has
added problems that businesses can ill afford. The
global wool market closed in February. This has led to vast volumes of wool
lying unsold in depots and has pushed prices down. Playgrounds, funfairs, community centres and outdoor gyms in Wales will be
allowed to reopen on Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed. He said: ""From
Monday, playgrounds and outdoor gyms will be able to reopen. ""Community centres will be able
to increase their activity, helping local authorities provide summer holiday
play schemes and childcare. ""Funfairs will also be able
to reopen as they have had time to consider how they can put appropriate
measures in place before customers return."" But Mr Drakeford said coronavirus had not ""gone away"". ""We could find our hard
work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in
every way we can, to keep Wales safe,"" he said. The Welsh Government has already
set out plans for campsites and other accommodation with shared facilities to
reopen from 25 July. Close contact services, such as
beauty salons, tattoo shops and nail parlours, are due to restart on 27 July. The viewing of occupied homes
for rent or sale will be allowed and cinemas, museums and galleries can also
reopen on 27 July. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and
bars are due to resume business indoors in Wales from 3 August. First Minister Mark Drakeford will give the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing at 12:30 BST. We'll give you the main updates here - you can
also watch the proceedings on BBC One Wales,via the BBC iPlayerand
via the Coronavirus Daily Update video link above. Thousands of jobs could be
at risk in Wales' creative industriesbecause freelancers cannot access UK
government cash, a Senedd inquiry has been told. The
Creative Industries Federation said 16,000 positions in Wales are at risk. The
Senedd's culture, Welsh language and communications committee welcomed a Â£59m
package for Wales from UK government support for the industry which has been hit hard by the lockdown. But
it warned the cash would be spread thinly, and urged the Welsh Government to
clarify funding priorities. The
committee wants to know how cash will be used to ensure no organisations are
forced to close or make employees redundant. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""We are
close to agreeing a first tranche of funding with the arts councils and other
bodies in Wales. ""I
hope to be able to be in a position to say something definite on that very
shortly."" Boris Johnson has announced somefurther relaxation of lockdown restrictions in England. The prime minister said people may use public transport for journeys immediately, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. Mr Johnson said employers in England would have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it was safe to do so. The PM added he was ""hoping for the best and planning for the worst"". Mr Johnson said during a news conference at Downing Street he hoped the country would return to ""significant"" normality by Christmas this year. But he said the plan ""remains conditional"" on the UK pulling together to win its ""long fight"" against Covid-19. Care home residents in Carmarthenshire havebeen meeting family
face-to-face for the first time since lockdown began. Managers have been calling residents' relatives to
offer appointments and tell them about new procedures. Visits
must be pre-arranged and strict procedures - including maintaining social
distancing - are in place. Jean
Emanuel, 90, said it was ""marvellous"" to see her granddaughter Clare
Hale again after four months. ""We've
never been ones for crying or tears, but it's just happiness,"" she said. ""We
talked about everything - children, the family. I can't explain it to
you."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Smiles all round' for Carmarthenshire care home family reunion Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9890682

Asked about those comments at the news conference, Mr Johnson said he ""totally agrees"" with Sir Patrick and that it was not for the government to tell employers where their workforce should be. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he will look at the details of the government's plan to get people back to work but stressed ""this can't be done on a wing and a prayer and requires a credible plan and national leadership"". Business groups warnedany mass return to work immediately was unlikely. Smaller companies in particular would need more support to get workers back, Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses said. ""Small firms are being tasked with consulting employees and putting the right measures in place to ensure a safe return to work,"" he said. ""After weeks of little or no income, they will need help - both funding and advice - to make that happen.""

The upcoming World Snooker Championships in Sheffield, the Glorious Goodwood horse racing festival and two men's county cricket friendly matches are set to be among the trial sporting fixtures. Winter is the big concern. The problem is, we don't know how well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off in our spring so we don't know what a winter with Covid-19 will look like. There is evidence the virus survives longer in cooler temperatures - and similar infections, including flu, do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these restrictions can actually be lifted. Sage documents,external, released today, raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus protections that would be ""difficult to achieve"". They advise the government should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced. The PM indicated that social distancing measures could be relaxed further for loved ones. He said: ""Throughout this period, we will look to allow more close contact between friends and family, where we can."" Mr Johnsonalso confirmed an additional Â£3bn in funding for the NHSto help it prepare for a potential second wave of infections and to cope with its usual winter pressures. An expansion in testing capacity to a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of October would help identify positive coronavirus cases among people with symptoms of seasonal illnesses, he added. It comes days after scientists saidthe UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deathsin a second wave of infections this winter if no mitigations were put in place. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In addition to the further easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Mr Johnson unveiled new powers for local authorities to manage outbreaks of the virus in their areas. He said local authorities would have the power to close premises, close off public outdoors spaces and cancel events. Ministers would also receive clearer guidance on where they can intervene to ""close whole sectors or types of premises in an area"" and advise people in specific postcodes to stay at home. ""It has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country,"" Mr Johnson said.

Winter is the big concern. The problem is, we don't know how well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off in our spring so we don't know what a winter with Covid-19 will look like. There is evidence the virus survives longer in cooler temperatures - and similar infections, including flu, do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these restrictions can actually be lifted. Sage documents,external, released today, raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus protections that would be ""difficult to achieve"". They advise the government should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced. The PM indicated that social distancing measures could be relaxed further for loved ones. He said: ""Throughout this period, we will look to allow more close contact between friends and family, where we can."" Mr Johnsonalso confirmed an additional Â£3bn in funding for the NHSto help it prepare for a potential second wave of infections and to cope with its usual winter pressures. An expansion in testing capacity to a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of October would help identify positive coronavirus cases among people with symptoms of seasonal illnesses, he added. It comes days after scientists saidthe UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deathsin a second wave of infections this winter if no mitigations were put in place. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In addition to the further easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Mr Johnson unveiled new powers for local authorities to manage outbreaks of the virus in their areas. He said local authorities would have the power to close premises, close off public outdoors spaces and cancel events. Ministers would also receive clearer guidance on where they can intervene to ""close whole sectors or types of premises in an area"" and advise people in specific postcodes to stay at home. ""It has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks - there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country,"" Mr Johnson said.

"Boris Johnson announces next steps for easing lockdown in England from 1 August Employers given more discretion over office working and indoor performances allowed to resume PM says local authorities will get more powers to bring in lockdowns in their areas to contain future outbreaks Health Secretary Matt Hancock calls for urgent review into data on deaths in England There have now been more than 1m confirmed cases in India, and 2m in Brazil In the US, the daily total of new cases hits another record The UK, US, and Canada accuse Russian spies of targeting vaccine researchers Globally there have been 13.8 million cases since the outbreak began, with 589,000 deaths We're wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today and will be back tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the biggest developments we've been bringing you from the UK and around the world:  You can follow all the latest news onthe BBC News website, or for coronavirus newshead here. Today's live page was written and edited by Alix Kroeger, Sophie Williams, Francesca Gillett, Alice Cuddy, Victoria Lindrea, George Wright and Ritu Prasad. There was some welcome news for the arts sector in Boris Johnson's announcement earlier: indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can take place in England from the start of August. In the same way that sports fans are going to be allowed in stadiums for a small number of matches to see how it goes, there will also be pilots of theatre shows and concerts with socially distanced audiences. The findings would feed into final guidance for venues in the run-up to them reopening, the PM said. However, with social distancing in place, many venues warn it's not financially viable to open. Theatre budgets tend to be based on a breakeven of around 70% capacity, and so with much less capacity the producer cannot afford to put the show on. Jon Morgan, the head of Theatres Trust welcomed the news as ""a step in the right direction"" - but said ""for most theatres it will not be economically viable to reopen with 30-40% audience required under social distancing"". He said they needed to progress to theatres being allowed to open fully ""with the appropriate safety measures"", adding: ""Without this most theatres cannot reopen viably and we need the go-ahead for Christmas shows, on which the survival of many theatres depends, in the next few weeks at the very latest."" There's more here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Local responses to coronavirus outbreaks could be threatened by a historic lack of investment in public health, UK government advisers warn. Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were speaking as councils were given new powers to close indoor and outdoor spaces and cancel events. Speaking to peers on the Lords' Science and Technology committee, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick said ""countries that invested heavily in their public health systems"" had coped best with the coronavirus pandemic. This had not been the case in the UK, Sir Patrick said. Chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Witty added health protection had not been invested in ""over the last several years"", adding: ""I think we should all be honest about that."" You can read more about their warninghere. On Friday, Public Health England set out the areas of England of greatest concern for local outbreaks. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was expected to release new guidance on reopening schools this week, but this update has been delayed, US media report. A spokesperson told CNN and NPR the new documents would likely be ready by the end of the month. Vice-President Mike Pence, who leads the White House Covid-19 task force, had earlier suggested the five new documents would still be released this week. At a news conference on Tuesday he said: ""To be very clear, we don't want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don't reopen their schools. ""We know that the risk the coronavirus presents to people under the age of 18 is very low but we also want to make sure that we have measures in place that protect faculty that may be vulnerable and so prevent kids from exposing others or bringing home the virus."" The update follows President Trump's complaints that the CDC's prior guidance for schools was ""very tough"" and costly. However, CDC director Robert Redfield has said the agency is not changing its recommendations about reopening schools, but that the new documents will provide additional information on enacting preventative measures. Current CDC guidelines recommend a number of social distancing and hygiene practices, like keeping desks apart, requiring face coverings and disinfecting. The president has urged schools to reopen for in-person education despite concerns from public health experts, parents and teachers. The US Justice Department released an image allegedly showing Andrew Marnell at a Black Jack table A man in California has been arrested
over claims he fraudulently obtained $8m (Â£6.4m) in coronavirus aid and used some of the
money to gamble in Las Vegas. Andrew Marnell, 40, is accused of
submitting bogus loan applications on behalf of several companies to secure
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds. These funds are intended to help small
companies and prevent layoffs during the pandemic. It is alleged that he spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars at casinos in Las Vegas and also used funds to make high-risk
stock market bets. Mr Marnell faces up to 30 years in
prison if convicted of bank fraud.

The actress had been self-isolating at home since she and her eight-year-old daughtertested positive for coronavirus on 12 July. Her husband Abhishek and father-in-law Amitabh, both also actors, were taken to hospital at the weekend with the virus. Ms Rai Bachchan, 46, is one of Bollywood's most famous faces. She is a former Miss World, a Goodwill Ambassador for UNAIDS, and became the first Indian actress to be a jury member at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003. The Scottish government has decided to delay its census, which was due to begin in March 2021. It's been pushed back by a year to March 2022. It's the first time the count has been postponed since 1941, with a census taking place in Scotland every 10 years since 1801. A census is also due to be carried out in England and Wales next year, but there has been no announcement about whether that will also be postponed. It it goes ahead, it would mean it would be out of sync with Scotland. In the UK, a further 114 have died over the past 24 hours in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, after testing positive for coronavirus. It brings the current UK death toll from Covid-19 to 45,233, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Separate figures, published by the UK's statistics agencies, show there have now been 55,700 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hour period up to 0900 BST on Friday, there had been a further 687 lab-confirmed UK cases. In total, 293,239 cases have been confirmed. Human rights groups in the Canadian province of Ontario have issued a legal challenge to limit police access to a database of people who have tested positive for Covid-19. A government memo said that police, paramedics and firefighters have access to the database to prevent or respond to Covid emergencies,the Globe and Mail reported,external. It is not clear whether law enforcement has used the database. The four organisations involved in the case say that giving police access to this information violates health privacy laws. They also argue that the data could harm to Indigenous and minority communities, who they say are disproportionately targeted by police, or lead to people refusing to get Covid tests. But some officials say that it is critical for first responders to have this Covid-19 data to reduce the spread of the virus. A hearing has been scheduled for November. Mink are bred at farms for their prized fur (file photo) Almost 100,000 mink at a farm in north-eastern Spain are to be culled after many of them tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities say. The outbreak in AragÃ³n province was discovered after a farm employee's wife contracted the virus in May. Her husband and six other farm workers have since tested positive for the disease. The mink, bred for their prized fur, were isolated and monitored closely after the workers became infected. But when tests on 13 July showed that 87% of the mink were infected, health authorities ordered for all 92,700 of the semi-aquatic animals to be culled. Full story here. The government's chief scientific adviser previously said there was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who's in charge of the lockdown restrictions in England -said that rather than telling employersto keep staff at home, the government is leaving the decision up to them. He said that could mean ""continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees"" - and that returning to the workplace must be done safely. The Welsh government has now responded, and said its advice is for people to carry on as they are - working from home if they can. âI positively don't want people to be returning to offices in the way that we did before coronavirus happened,"" said First Minister Mark Drakeford. He stressed the crisis had shown how it was possible for many to work from home very effectively âwithout the need for large numbers of people to be travelling at peak times of the day to office locationsâ. He said he did not share Mr Johnsonâs belief that there would be a significant return to normality by Christmas. ""You have to take a pretty sunny view of circumstances to think that that might be true,"" said the Welsh leader, adding that it did not fit with the scientific advice heâd seen. Fergus WalshMedical correspondent What if there was a way of returning life to what it was like before coronavirus? No more social distancing, no face coverings, no fear of Covid-19. Of course the reason for all the restrictions is an attempt to bear down on the virus, and to minimise its spread. What we need is a fast and reliable way of spotting those around us who are infected. Saliva tests could be a real gamechanger. Imagine if all you had to do was spit into a tube to find out if you have coronavirus. OK, it's not quite as simple as that. The saliva sample has to be sent to a laboratory, but the result can be turned around far quicker than a swab test. Jayne Lees and her family are part of a four-week trial of saliva tests under way in Southampton. I watched as Jayne and her three teenage children, Sam, Meg and Billy, sat round their kitchen table, spat on a spoon and tipped the spit into a test tube. ""A swab test feels quite invasive, especially if you are not feeling very well,"" says Jayne. ""The saliva test is so much easier."" More than 10,000 GP and other key workers and their families in the city are involved in the project. Full story here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Winter is the big concern. The problem is we donât know how
well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off
in our spring, so we donât know what a winter with Covid will look like. There is evidence the virus
survives longer in cooler temperatures and similar infections, including flu,
do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and
the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these
restrictions can actually be lifted. SAGE documents, released today,external,
raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to
return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus
protections that would be âdifficult to achieveâ. They advise the government
should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced.   Some employers' organisations said smaller firms in particular would need more support to get workers back Earlier, we heard from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said he would now leave it up to employers to decide whether to bring their staff back to work. So what do the employers themselves think? Well, many warned a mass return to work immediately was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on safety, while the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution out there"" in the country. ""Not everything is in a company's control,"" said Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. ""Childcare is an issue for many employees, and even if the guidance is changed, some staff who use public transport will still be concerned."" Read more about the reaction from businesses. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a further raft of changes taking place in England from the first day of August.Here are some of the key changes:  Read more. Customary handshakes and kisses made way for elbow bumps EU leaders are meeting in their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis, with low expectations of a deal on a â¬750bn (Â£670bn) post-Covid stimulus package. The mask-wearing leaders, who met with elbow bumps not handshakes, must also agree a seven-year, â¬1.07tn budget. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was a ""moment of truth"" for Europe. There are splits between leaders over whether the post-Covid package should be given as grants or loans. Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel want grants to mostly finance the fund. Four northern nations insist on loans. Arriving for the talks in Brussels, Mrs Merkel said ""the differences are very very big and I cannot say if we will find a solution this time"". It would be desirable, she said, but people had to remain realistic. Read more here. A total of 138 military personnel have tested positive for the virus at US bases in Okinawa Japanâs
Defence Minister Taro Kono has requested that US military personnel coming to Japan are
tested for coronavirus after an outbreak on the island of Okinawa. The
US, which is currently only testing those who are showing symptoms, says it is considering the idea, Kono said. As
of Thursday, 138 military personnel have tested positive at several bases in
Okinawa, where most of the US troops in Japan are based. Last
weekend Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki told reporters: âI canât help but have
strong doubts about the US militaryâs measures to prevent infections.â He
claimed that US service members had gone off base for 4 July beach parties and visits
to local nightlife areas. The
relationship between Okinawa locals and the US forces is already tense. Locals
have campaigned for their removal for years. Zindzi Mandela with her father Nelson in 2010 The family of the South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, have been praised for revealing that his daughter, Zindzi, who died on Monday, had Covid-19. The gesture will ""encourage acceptance"" of those infected, current President Cyril Ramaphosa said. The cause of death has not been disclosed. Zindzi was buried on Friday morning alongside her mother, anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. South Africa is the African country worst hit by coronavirus, with more than 320,000 cases. There have been more than 4,600 deaths, and government projections estimate this could rise to 50,000 by the end of the year. Despite public awareness of how the virus is spread, its symptoms and effects, there have been some reported cases of stigmatisation of those infected. Read more here. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty gave evidence by videolink on Friday The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance hailed the British public's ""extraordinary altruism and spirit"" when asked about face coverings by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. ""This is a classic public health issue and the communication needs to be clear about what benefit this brings. ""Face covering wearing is a classic one where there may be some protection to the wearer, but there's more protection to others."" England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, told the same committee hearing social distancing remained key - even with the introduction of face coverings - and was likely to be necessary for a long time. He said: ""There are some things which we started right at the beginning, which absolutely have to continue for a prolonged period of time - washing hands, isolation, household isolation. ""And then we've added to that things like contact tracing, most recently face coverings. ""The reality is distancing remains an important part of this mix and how it's interpreted in different governments has evolved. ""But it has not gone away. So, all of those need to continue for a long period of time."" A leading disability equality charity has expressed concern about the UK government's call for more employees in England to head back into the workplace from 1 August. James Taylor, from Scope, said Boris Johnson's comments ""will ring alarm bells for many disabled people"". âTwo thirds of those who have died from Covid-19 were disabled. The virus has not gone away. Millions of
disabled people at greater risk of coronavirus feel their fears are not being
taken into account and feel forgotten by the government. âDisabled people must be able
to have flexibility about returning to their workplace. Leaving this to the
discretion of employers will create inconsistency, and does little to reassure
those disabled people who fear being forced to choose between protecting their
health and paying the bills. Recent research by the charity found half of disabled people feel anxious about
shielding being paused, with one in five of those surveyed stating they will not leave home until there is a
vaccine or effective treatment against coronavirus. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Floral tributes have been placed at the site A 10-year-old boy has died following an accident at a works site in Glasgow. Shea Ryan died in hospital after suffering serious injuries on the site near Glenkirk Drive in Drumchapel on Thursday evening. His name was confirmed by his grandparents, Janis Meechan and William Brown, who told BBC Scotland Shea was a ""good boy"". Police said their inquiries into his death were continuing but it was not being treated as suspicious. Emergency services were called to the site at 21:55 on Thursday. Shea was taken by ambulance to the Royal Hospital for Children on the Queen Elizabeth campus in Glasgow. He died soon after arriving. His grandparents were among those who laid floral tributes at the site on Friday. ""We think our wee granddaughter was there when he fell,"" Ms Meechan said. ""We've just came up to put these flowers down and then we'll get him a big grandson flower.Â Â ""He was a good boy,"" she said. ""Wild, but good"". When Shea's grandfather found out what happened he said:Â Â ""I thought I was hearing things"".Â Â His grandparents said they saw Shea all the time Work was being carried out on the site by agencies including Scottish Water to address flooding problems from the Garscadden Burn. On Friday a children's slide that had been taped off could be seen at the very edge of the construction site with police standing guard. The Health and Safety Executive confirmed it was assisting police with their inquiries. The police investigation is being supported by the Health and Safety Executive Margaret Coyle, head teacher at Camstradden Primary School where Shea went to school, said they were devastated to learn of his death. ""In the short period of time Shea's been with us at the school he has made many friends with school staff and the children,"" she added. ""Everyone will be shocked to learn of his death and we will do all that we can to offer support to the family and wider community in Drumchapel."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Copland said the gaps in the construction site fence concerned him as a father himself because of the ""major excavation"" that was taking place.

"The RAF said the gravestone had been replaced ""as part of an ongoing review of its historical assets"" A gravestone honouring the Dambusters' dog - whose name is a racial slur - has been replaced. The 617 Squadron's mascot, a black Labrador, died on the day of its famous ""bouncing bomb"" raid on German dams in 1943. A memorial at the Dambusters' World War Two base, RAF Scampton, bearing the dog's name was removed. The RAF said it did not want to give prominence to an offensive term that went against its ethos. Sir Edward Leigh, Conservative MP for Gainsborough, said he was ""very fearful of our ability today to erase or re-write history"". More news and stories from Lincolnshire The dog's grave is at RAF Scampton, home to an exhibition about the mission, known as Operation Chastise Kris Hendrix, campaigns manager at the RAF Museum, said the dog - which the BBC is not naming - was a ""drinking buddy"" for squadron members and would consume litres of beer before passing out. He was hit by a car and killed on 16 May 1943, but his death was kept from the airmen as it was feared they might see it as a bad omen. Mr Hendrix added: ""It was such a famous dog, it was such a famous squadron and that meant the grave has been kept until today. ""The standards have changed throughout the years, while it may not have been a controversial name during the Second World War, things are very different now."" The Labrador was owned by the squadron's wing commander, Guy Gibson (centre) Sir Edward said he had written to the station commander of RAF Scampton about the change. In his letter, shared with the BBC, he said: ""Undoubtedly we are both more sensitive and more sensible today when it comes to the delicateness of racialist and derogatory terminology which had been used with unfortunate informality in the past. ""I am, however, very fearful of our ability today to erase or re-write history. The past needs to be explained, taught about, and learned from - not re-written.""

"Mark Drakeford said 21,000 people were tested for the virus last weekend and 0.25% came back as positive Playgrounds, community centres and outdoor gyms will open in Wales from Monday, it has been confirmed. The First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced funfairs will be able to invite visitors back. It comes as he revealed just 0.25% of 21,000 people tested for Covid-19 last weekend came back as positive. ""A tiny proportion of people tested in Wales are turning out to have coronavirus,"" he said. Addressing the final daily coronavirus briefing on Friday, he added: ""We continue to look carefully at the latest medical and scientific evidence and the current state of the virus as we make decisions to unlock our society and economy,"" he said. ""With rates of the virus in Wales continuing to fall, we are able to carry on with our gradual, step-by-step lifting of the restrictions."" Shielding in Wales to end on 16 August Llangefni pub shuts after positive coronavirus test Coronavirus: What do the stats tell us in Wales? Neath Port Talbot Council said it would not reopen its playgrounds until 27 July. It said when they do reopen only one adult will be allowed to accompany children at a time and no food or drink will be permitted. On Thursday it was announced that those most at risk from coronaviruscan stop shielding after 16 August. Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton told the Welsh Government's daily briefing that about 130,000 people in Wales with underlying health conditions had been advised to stay indoors since the start of the pandemic to protect themselves. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said the recent test results had allowed the pause on advice to shielders: ""That's why the chief medical officer has concluded that it is now safe for people with those additional medical conditions to begin to gradually and carefully resume some of the activities that have been denied to them for all these weeks."" On Thursday, for the fifth day in the last 10no deaths with Covid-19 were announced in Wales. The total number of deaths remains at 1,545 and to date16,871 people have tested positive for Covid-19.

Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton told the Welsh Government's daily briefing that about 130,000 people in Wales with underlying health conditions had been advised to stay indoors since the start of the pandemic to protect themselves. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said the recent test results had allowed the pause on advice to shielders: ""That's why the chief medical officer has concluded that it is now safe for people with those additional medical conditions to begin to gradually and carefully resume some of the activities that have been denied to them for all these weeks.""

"After days of preparation, deconstruction work at the historic Orfordness Lighthouse got under way For more than 200 years, the lighthouse at Orford Ness has warned mariners they are nearing Europe's longest shingle spit. But as the sea steadily reclaims the land on which it is built, its owner has decided the time is right for the lighthouse to come down, changing forever the skyline of the Suffolk coast. ""I feel highly emotional,"" says Nicholas Gold, owner of Orfordness Lighthouse. ""It's taken a big chunk of my life."" The Grade II-listed building is the 11th - and final - Orfordness Lighthouse. It was established 228 years ago on a particularly perilous stretch of England's coast. Although it is impossible to say how many souls it has helped save during that time, a single storm off Orford Ness, for example, wrecked 32 ships during a single day in 1627. On Thursday, the dismantling operation began and the roof was cut away Earlier in the week, a giant crane made its slow way along the spit towards the lighthouse. On Thursday, the dismantling operation began and the roof was cut away. Dismantling the lighthouse is expected to take about four weeks. It is hoped parts of the lighthouse can be used in a permanent memorial nearby. This video can not be played Drone footage captured the start of deconstruction work In the early 1980s, its base was 90m (295ft) from the sea. In the winter of 2013-14, four metres (13ft) of beach was lost in a single storm. It took a pounding in  2018's ""Beast from the East"" storms, and the sea is now just a few metres from the imposing red and white structure. Tides have slowly eroded the shingle beach on the Ness bringing the lighthouse perilously close to the sea Orfordness Lighthouse Trust plans to remove the lantern room and other artefacts that will one day form the basis of a lighthouse memorial on the other side of the Ness, facing Orford town's quay. Adrian Underwood's father Charlie was the last lighthouse keeper at Orford Ness, working there from 1965 until his retirement in 1994 and recognised with an MBE for his service. Mr Underwood,who published his father's second book on Orford in tribute to him after his death in 1997,external, has a small model of the lighthouse in his home in Ireland. ""I spent most of my Sundays on Orford Ness with him,"" said Mr Underwood, who, with no other vehicles on the shingle spit, taught himself to drive while his father worked. ""It was just part of life. When I look back on it, I was blessed. ""I have not been back to Orford since 2007 but in my mind the lighthouse will always be as it was. I'm almost glad that I've not seen it since so that for me it will always be as I remember it."" Adrian Underwood spent most Sundays as a teenager with his lighthouse man father Charlie on Orford Ness Relentless tides have started to take away the shingle from underneath the lighthouse's concrete footing To protect the lighthouse from erosion, the Orfordness Lighthouse Trust filled rubble sacks with shingle, bound them together with felt and laid them out in ""large sausages"" each weighing about 50 tonnes. This flexible wall has kept the building standing for longer than most expected. Longer-term defences, such as steel piling or rock armour, would not be allowed due to the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) status of Orford Ness. This status has also prevented the cutting-off of the lighthouse at the base and moving it back, as has been done with some others. Equally, as the sea can continue to cut around the sides, the trust would have had to keep adding to the defences to prevent this happening or the lighthouse could end up on its own small island. The lighthouse was never designed to be in the sea because the salt water would have made short work of its lime mortar. The lighthouse was decommissioned in 2013, after which Mr Gold bought it. He describes that decision as one made by a ""silly idiot"" since it was ""always doomed"". Since then, a small team of volunteers have sought to prolong the life of the building. Nicholas Gold bought the lighthouse in mid-2013 ""The whole point was the lighthouse had been such a celebrated landmark over so many years since the 18th Century,"" he said. ""It would be a wasted opportunity to leave it unkempt and sad in its final years. ""We did a deal. The headline price was Â£2,000 but I had a capital commitment to sort out the taking down and removal of it. I won't get any change from a six-figure sum.""

Why this Essex town decided to change its name Celeb high street 'shouting from same hymn sheet' Mr Gold previously worked as a financial adviser in London and has always had a passion for buying ""one-off buildings"". They include a redundant church and a former US spy station. The lighthouse ""seemed to fold naturally into the family,"" he said.

Charts would show mariners the sea marked into coloured sectors. Green was safe, white ""heading into danger"" and red meant you were about to run aground England is home to more than 130 lighthouses The first to be built on rock in the open sea was Winstanley's Tower in 1698, off Plymouth The 19m (62ft) Dover Pharos was built by the Romans in about 50AD and was still in use when William the Conqueror arrived in 1066 Thelast manned lighthouse closed in 1998 at North Foreland in Kent,external The site is closed to visitors and members of the public have been told to stay away while the deconstruction work takes place Volunteers from the lighthouse trust must now ""deconstruct"" the building while there is enough shingle beach left for a crane to come and lift its 14-tonne cap and lantern room - or they will be lost forever. The team will then collapse the walls inside the lighthouse so that the brickwork does not spill across the shingle beach. Work is also under way to save as many of the building's original features as possible, along with its bespoke curved furniture. The lighthouse in 1951, just over a decade before it became one of the first remote-controlled lighthouses in the British Isles While the lighthouse is owned by Mr Gold, the National Trust owns the surrounding Ness, an area with its own place in history as a site for ballistic weapons, radar and atomic research. But from its point of view, taking on the preservation of the lighthouse would have been too costly. Orfordness lighthouse has attracted artists for more than two centuries. Landscape and marine painter William Daniell featured it in his 1820s series A Voyage Round Great Britain Nick Collinson, its general manager for the Suffolk and Essex Coast, said the disappearance of the lighthouse was in keeping with the longer life and history of the Ness. ""Orfordness Lighthouse has been an iconic landmark on this stretch of Suffolk's coastline for centuries, and we are saddened to see it lost,"" he said. ""Sitting on such a dynamic shingle spit, constantly changed by the sea, man's presence here can often feel ephemeral."" ""I find Orford Ness hauntingly beautiful,"" said Norfolk-based illustrator Rebecca Pymar. ""The Ness is home to fragile and endangered habitats and species which is mirrored by the lighthouses' own fragility as it makes its sad decline into the sea. It will be missed."" The lighthouse trust hopes to sell off its ""local bricks in wonderful condition"" to help raise funds to recreate a likeness of its top third more than a mile inland, featuring as many of the original elements as possible. The nature reserve on which the lighthouse stands is currently closed to the public. The Orfordness Lighthouse Trust hopes it will be possible to construct a tribute to the lighthouse, featuring a number of original features, at a new location nearly 1.5 miles (2.4km) from the sea ""The lighthouse itself is an emotional thing, certainly for the people of Orford who've lived with it on their horizon for generations,"" said Mr Gold.

"The RAF said the gravestone had been replaced ""as part of an ongoing review of its historical assets"" A gravestone honouring the Dambusters' dog - whose name is a racial slur - has been replaced. The 617 Squadron's mascot, a black Labrador, died on the day of its famous ""bouncing bomb"" raid on German dams in 1943. A memorial at the Dambusters' World War Two base, RAF Scampton, bearing the dog's name was removed. The RAF said it did not want to give prominence to an offensive term that went against its ethos. Sir Edward Leigh, Conservative MP for Gainsborough, said he was ""very fearful of our ability today to erase or re-write history"". More news and stories from Lincolnshire The dog's grave is at RAF Scampton, home to an exhibition about the mission, known as Operation Chastise Kris Hendrix, campaigns manager at the RAF Museum, said the dog - which the BBC is not naming - was a ""drinking buddy"" for squadron members and would consume litres of beer before passing out. He was hit by a car and killed on 16 May 1943, but his death was kept from the airmen as it was feared they might see it as a bad omen. Mr Hendrix added: ""It was such a famous dog, it was such a famous squadron and that meant the grave has been kept until today. ""The standards have changed throughout the years, while it may not have been a controversial name during the Second World War, things are very different now."" The Labrador was owned by the squadron's wing commander, Guy Gibson (centre) Sir Edward said he had written to the station commander of RAF Scampton about the change. In his letter, shared with the BBC, he said: ""Undoubtedly we are both more sensitive and more sensible today when it comes to the delicateness of racialist and derogatory terminology which had been used with unfortunate informality in the past. ""I am, however, very fearful of our ability today to erase or re-write history. The past needs to be explained, taught about, and learned from - not re-written.""

"Some of the restrictions on people shielding from coronavirus have been eased, allowing them to go out more. There are about 180,000 people shielding in Scotland and they are now able to go on holiday and visit outdoor markets and gardens. Couples who do not live together are also allowed to meet up without distancing. It is hoped the need for shielding could be paused entirely by August. The shielding group includes those who are at the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus such as people with cancer and severe respiratory conditions. Shielding extended until 31 July 'People shielding too scared to leave home' Who should be shielding? Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes to be able to pause the need for shielding entirely at the end of July, but added: ""We would still encourage those in this group to take extra care. ""I know returning to something like normal life will be welcome, but I appreciate it is also known to be quite daunting."" The change in advice means that the shielded can stay at holiday accommodation, including hotels, and visit outdoor markets or public gardens. Marie Seggie and her mum Katie who died of Alzheimer's at the start of May The easing of the lockdown restrictions will change little for Marie Seggie and her shielding regime. Living with a chronic condition that has left her with only 20% lung capacity means the nursery worker has not ventured far from her Coatbridge home since March. Marie's 88-year-old mother Katie died in May and this was by far the toughest phase of lockdown, the nursery worker explained. ""It was heartbreaking, the rest of the family could rally round but I was so restricted in what I could do - I couldn't be there for her at the end. ""I feel like I've not really been grieving either because everything has been on hold."" Shielding has also meant sacrifices for Marie's family. Daughter Emily, a midwife, moved out of the family home to ensure there was no danger of making her mum ill, while husband Bobby and their other daughter Laura are self-isolating with Marie. ""It's been hard not seeing my family properly and I also feel guilty when you see so many people around you helping others but I'm not,"" she said. ""I don't think the changes will make a huge difference to me just now, I can't wear a mask because of my chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and I am still really nervous about going to the shops."" The 57-year-old added: ""I think our first outing will be to a garden centre or somewhere outdoors like that, but even that feels like a big step right now.""

"Boris Johnson announces next steps for easing lockdown in England from 1 August Employers given more discretion over office working and indoor performances allowed to resume PM says local authorities will get more powers to bring in lockdowns in their areas to contain future outbreaks Health Secretary Matt Hancock calls for urgent review into data on deaths in England There have now been more than 1m confirmed cases in India, and 2m in Brazil In the US, the daily total of new cases hits another record The UK, US, and Canada accuse Russian spies of targeting vaccine researchers Globally there have been 13.8 million cases since the outbreak began, with 589,000 deaths We're wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today and will be back tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the biggest developments we've been bringing you from the UK and around the world:  You can follow all the latest news onthe BBC News website, or for coronavirus newshead here. Today's live page was written and edited by Alix Kroeger, Sophie Williams, Francesca Gillett, Alice Cuddy, Victoria Lindrea, George Wright and Ritu Prasad. There was some welcome news for the arts sector in Boris Johnson's announcement earlier: indoor performances with socially distanced audiences can take place in England from the start of August. In the same way that sports fans are going to be allowed in stadiums for a small number of matches to see how it goes, there will also be pilots of theatre shows and concerts with socially distanced audiences. The findings would feed into final guidance for venues in the run-up to them reopening, the PM said. However, with social distancing in place, many venues warn it's not financially viable to open. Theatre budgets tend to be based on a breakeven of around 70% capacity, and so with much less capacity the producer cannot afford to put the show on. Jon Morgan, the head of Theatres Trust welcomed the news as ""a step in the right direction"" - but said ""for most theatres it will not be economically viable to reopen with 30-40% audience required under social distancing"". He said they needed to progress to theatres being allowed to open fully ""with the appropriate safety measures"", adding: ""Without this most theatres cannot reopen viably and we need the go-ahead for Christmas shows, on which the survival of many theatres depends, in the next few weeks at the very latest."" There's more here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Local responses to coronavirus outbreaks could be threatened by a historic lack of investment in public health, UK government advisers warn. Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were speaking as councils were given new powers to close indoor and outdoor spaces and cancel events. Speaking to peers on the Lords' Science and Technology committee, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick said ""countries that invested heavily in their public health systems"" had coped best with the coronavirus pandemic. This had not been the case in the UK, Sir Patrick said. Chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Witty added health protection had not been invested in ""over the last several years"", adding: ""I think we should all be honest about that."" You can read more about their warninghere. On Friday, Public Health England set out the areas of England of greatest concern for local outbreaks. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was expected to release new guidance on reopening schools this week, but this update has been delayed, US media report. A spokesperson told CNN and NPR the new documents would likely be ready by the end of the month. Vice-President Mike Pence, who leads the White House Covid-19 task force, had earlier suggested the five new documents would still be released this week. At a news conference on Tuesday he said: ""To be very clear, we don't want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don't reopen their schools. ""We know that the risk the coronavirus presents to people under the age of 18 is very low but we also want to make sure that we have measures in place that protect faculty that may be vulnerable and so prevent kids from exposing others or bringing home the virus."" The update follows President Trump's complaints that the CDC's prior guidance for schools was ""very tough"" and costly. However, CDC director Robert Redfield has said the agency is not changing its recommendations about reopening schools, but that the new documents will provide additional information on enacting preventative measures. Current CDC guidelines recommend a number of social distancing and hygiene practices, like keeping desks apart, requiring face coverings and disinfecting. The president has urged schools to reopen for in-person education despite concerns from public health experts, parents and teachers.

The Scottish government has decided to delay its census, which was due to begin in March 2021. It's been pushed back by a year to March 2022. It's the first time the count has been postponed since 1941, with a census taking place in Scotland every 10 years since 1801. A census is also due to be carried out in England and Wales next year, but there has been no announcement about whether that will also be postponed. It it goes ahead, it would mean it would be out of sync with Scotland. In the UK, a further 114 have died over the past 24 hours in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, after testing positive for coronavirus. It brings the current UK death toll from Covid-19 to 45,233, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Separate figures, published by the UK's statistics agencies, show there have now been 55,700 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The DHSC also said that in the 24-hour period up to 0900 BST on Friday, there had been a further 687 lab-confirmed UK cases. In total, 293,239 cases have been confirmed. Human rights groups in the Canadian province of Ontario have issued a legal challenge to limit police access to a database of people who have tested positive for Covid-19. A government memo said that police, paramedics and firefighters have access to the database to prevent or respond to Covid emergencies,the Globe and Mail reported,external. It is not clear whether law enforcement has used the database. The four organisations involved in the case say that giving police access to this information violates health privacy laws. They also argue that the data could harm to Indigenous and minority communities, who they say are disproportionately targeted by police, or lead to people refusing to get Covid tests. But some officials say that it is critical for first responders to have this Covid-19 data to reduce the spread of the virus. A hearing has been scheduled for November. Mink are bred at farms for their prized fur (file photo) Almost 100,000 mink at a farm in north-eastern Spain are to be culled after many of them tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities say. The outbreak in AragÃ³n province was discovered after a farm employee's wife contracted the virus in May. Her husband and six other farm workers have since tested positive for the disease. The mink, bred for their prized fur, were isolated and monitored closely after the workers became infected. But when tests on 13 July showed that 87% of the mink were infected, health authorities ordered for all 92,700 of the semi-aquatic animals to be culled. Full story here. The government's chief scientific adviser previously said there was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who's in charge of the lockdown restrictions in England -said that rather than telling employersto keep staff at home, the government is leaving the decision up to them. He said that could mean ""continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees"" - and that returning to the workplace must be done safely. The Welsh government has now responded, and said its advice is for people to carry on as they are - working from home if they can. âI positively don't want people to be returning to offices in the way that we did before coronavirus happened,"" said First Minister Mark Drakeford. He stressed the crisis had shown how it was possible for many to work from home very effectively âwithout the need for large numbers of people to be travelling at peak times of the day to office locationsâ. He said he did not share Mr Johnsonâs belief that there would be a significant return to normality by Christmas. ""You have to take a pretty sunny view of circumstances to think that that might be true,"" said the Welsh leader, adding that it did not fit with the scientific advice heâd seen. Fergus WalshMedical correspondent What if there was a way of returning life to what it was like before coronavirus? No more social distancing, no face coverings, no fear of Covid-19. Of course the reason for all the restrictions is an attempt to bear down on the virus, and to minimise its spread. What we need is a fast and reliable way of spotting those around us who are infected. Saliva tests could be a real gamechanger. Imagine if all you had to do was spit into a tube to find out if you have coronavirus. OK, it's not quite as simple as that. The saliva sample has to be sent to a laboratory, but the result can be turned around far quicker than a swab test. Jayne Lees and her family are part of a four-week trial of saliva tests under way in Southampton. I watched as Jayne and her three teenage children, Sam, Meg and Billy, sat round their kitchen table, spat on a spoon and tipped the spit into a test tube. ""A swab test feels quite invasive, especially if you are not feeling very well,"" says Jayne. ""The saliva test is so much easier."" More than 10,000 GP and other key workers and their families in the city are involved in the project. Full story here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Winter is the big concern. The problem is we donât know how
well coronavirus will spread as the nights draw in. The pandemic really kicked off
in our spring, so we donât know what a winter with Covid will look like. There is evidence the virus
survives longer in cooler temperatures and similar infections, including flu,
do get a winter boost. So how the virus behaves, and
the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace, will dictate how many of these
restrictions can actually be lifted. SAGE documents, released today,external,
raise serious doubts about how far we can go. They say it is not possible to
return to normality without levels of contact tracing and other coronavirus
protections that would be âdifficult to achieveâ. They advise the government
should already be planning how measures should be reintroduced.   Some employers' organisations said smaller firms in particular would need more support to get workers back Earlier, we heard from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said he would now leave it up to employers to decide whether to bring their staff back to work. So what do the employers themselves think? Well, many warned a mass return to work immediately was unlikely. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies still needed ""crystal-clear official guidance"" on safety, while the Institute of Directors said ""there is a significant amount of caution out there"" in the country. ""Not everything is in a company's control,"" said Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. ""Childcare is an issue for many employees, and even if the guidance is changed, some staff who use public transport will still be concerned."" Read more about the reaction from businesses. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a further raft of changes taking place in England from the first day of August.Here are some of the key changes:  Read more. Customary handshakes and kisses made way for elbow bumps EU leaders are meeting in their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis, with low expectations of a deal on a â¬750bn (Â£670bn) post-Covid stimulus package. The mask-wearing leaders, who met with elbow bumps not handshakes, must also agree a seven-year, â¬1.07tn budget. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was a ""moment of truth"" for Europe. There are splits between leaders over whether the post-Covid package should be given as grants or loans. Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel want grants to mostly finance the fund. Four northern nations insist on loans. Arriving for the talks in Brussels, Mrs Merkel said ""the differences are very very big and I cannot say if we will find a solution this time"". It would be desirable, she said, but people had to remain realistic. Read more here. A total of 138 military personnel have tested positive for the virus at US bases in Okinawa Japanâs
Defence Minister Taro Kono has requested that US military personnel coming to Japan are
tested for coronavirus after an outbreak on the island of Okinawa. The
US, which is currently only testing those who are showing symptoms, says it is considering the idea, Kono said. As
of Thursday, 138 military personnel have tested positive at several bases in
Okinawa, where most of the US troops in Japan are based. Last
weekend Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki told reporters: âI canât help but have
strong doubts about the US militaryâs measures to prevent infections.â He
claimed that US service members had gone off base for 4 July beach parties and visits
to local nightlife areas. The
relationship between Okinawa locals and the US forces is already tense. Locals
have campaigned for their removal for years. Zindzi Mandela with her father Nelson in 2010 The family of the South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, have been praised for revealing that his daughter, Zindzi, who died on Monday, had Covid-19. The gesture will ""encourage acceptance"" of those infected, current President Cyril Ramaphosa said. The cause of death has not been disclosed. Zindzi was buried on Friday morning alongside her mother, anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. South Africa is the African country worst hit by coronavirus, with more than 320,000 cases. There have been more than 4,600 deaths, and government projections estimate this could rise to 50,000 by the end of the year. Despite public awareness of how the virus is spread, its symptoms and effects, there have been some reported cases of stigmatisation of those infected. Read more here. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty gave evidence by videolink on Friday The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance hailed the British public's ""extraordinary altruism and spirit"" when asked about face coverings by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. ""This is a classic public health issue and the communication needs to be clear about what benefit this brings. ""Face covering wearing is a classic one where there may be some protection to the wearer, but there's more protection to others."" England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, told the same committee hearing social distancing remained key - even with the introduction of face coverings - and was likely to be necessary for a long time. He said: ""There are some things which we started right at the beginning, which absolutely have to continue for a prolonged period of time - washing hands, isolation, household isolation. ""And then we've added to that things like contact tracing, most recently face coverings. ""The reality is distancing remains an important part of this mix and how it's interpreted in different governments has evolved. ""But it has not gone away. So, all of those need to continue for a long period of time."" A leading disability equality charity has expressed concern about the UK government's call for more employees in England to head back into the workplace from 1 August. James Taylor, from Scope, said Boris Johnson's comments ""will ring alarm bells for many disabled people"". âTwo thirds of those who have died from Covid-19 were disabled. The virus has not gone away. Millions of
disabled people at greater risk of coronavirus feel their fears are not being
taken into account and feel forgotten by the government. âDisabled people must be able
to have flexibility about returning to their workplace. Leaving this to the
discretion of employers will create inconsistency, and does little to reassure
those disabled people who fear being forced to choose between protecting their
health and paying the bills. Recent research by the charity found half of disabled people feel anxious about
shielding being paused, with one in five of those surveyed stating they will not leave home until there is a
vaccine or effective treatment against coronavirus. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999607
"German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) called for a realistic approach EU leaders are meeting in their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis, with low expectations of a deal on a â¬750bn (Â£670bn) post-Covid stimulus package.

It would be desirable, she said, but people had to remain realistic. Other leaders gave her and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa birthday gifts - however, the good-natured scenes inside the summit come after weeks of squabbling over the rescue package. Customary handshakes and kisses made way for elbow bumps The meeting is due to continue on Saturday but EU leaders may need longer to reach a deal. ""The stakes couldn't be higher,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the meeting. ""The whole world is watching us."" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said nobody should lose sight of the big picture - ""we're faced with the biggest economic depression since the Second World War"". But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose country is part of the so-called ""Frugal Four"" northern states, said he ""put the chances of getting a deal this weekend at less than 50%"". Southern states including Italy and Spain want an urgent decision ""not weakened by a lesser compromise"", in the words of Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. They need to revive economies battered by a devastating pandemic that claimed 35,000 lives in Italy and a further 28,400 in Spain. The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank has already forecast an 8.7% slump in the eurozone economy this year because of the pandemic. But economies that only recently pulled out of a financial crisis want grants rather than taking on further debt. The French president said Europe was facing an unprecedented crisis The recovery plan, backed by France and Germany, for â¬500bn in grants and subsidies and â¬250bn in loans, is being resisted by several ""frugal"" Northern European countries, led by the Netherlands. The EU recovery fund is already controversial as the money would be borrowed on the financial markets, to be paid back some time after 2027. It's made up of a number of different instruments, but the biggest part of it would be geared to supporting green and digital investment, and reform. Some 30% of the funding could be tied to climate projects. The frugal states, which include Austria, Sweden, Denmark and to some degree Finland, want some control over how the money is handed out. The Southern states say that will hold the process back. There is also pressure to whittle down the size of the â¬750bn fund, so the solvency instrument devised to revive companies after lockdown could be under threat. But Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri told the Corriere website that Rome ""will fight hard not to modify"" the structure of the recovery fund. Some of the Central European leaders wanted rebates to be on the table too - the money paid back to wealthier EU states that pay more into the budget than they get out. Leaders have been criss-crossing Europe ahead of the summit in a bid to find a solution. Visiting Sweden, Spain's Pedro SÃ¡nchez warned: ""If we delay the response, we delay the recovery and the crisis could get worse."" Big choices face EU leaders on Covid recovery cash The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has also urged the EU27 to move quickly on an ""ambitious package"", warning that uncertainty remains high on the speed and scale of the economic rebound. If the package of grants or loans is agreed, then France would be able to put â¬39bn of EU funding towards its own â¬100bn national recovery plan. Prime Minister Jean Castex said this week that â¬20bn of that would go towards insulating buildings, and converting cities to using bicycles. A group of 150 scientists and celebrities joined climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday in signing an open letter urging EU leaders to end ""all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction"". As eurozone economic activity picks up and lockdowns are lifted, there are fears of a second surge. The ECB has confirmed its emergency â¬1.35tn bond-buying programme is on track to last until June next year, to help governments, banks and businesses. One of the main issues for EU leaders is whether any country can have a veto over money being handed out to a member state for recovery purposes. Ahead of the summit, a French official said the Netherlands was the only one of the so-called frugal states seeking strict control of conditions for paying out funds. Certainly Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insists on reforms to pensions, welfare and tax services in return for funding and he wants assurances that the money goes to modernising infrastructure and green investment. ""I'm only going to go along with subsidies if the reforms are nailed down,"" he said in aninterview with public broadcaster NOS,external. But Finland too wants conditions attached to EU funding, both from the recovery pot and from the wider 2021-27 EU budget. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The task facing EU leaders is to agree not only on the size and terms of the recovery fund, but the overall EU budget too. And Hungary's Viktor Orban has threatened to derail both the fund and the budget if any payments are linked to a member state's rule of law. His ruling Fidesz party has been suspended by the big European People's Party bloc for clamping down on media and civil society. ""We could veto it because it needs a unanimous decision. Hungary could say no,"" Mr Orban said last week.

"After days of preparation, deconstruction work at the historic Orfordness Lighthouse got under way For more than 200 years, the lighthouse at Orford Ness has warned mariners they are nearing Europe's longest shingle spit. But as the sea steadily reclaims the land on which it is built, its owner has decided the time is right for the lighthouse to come down, changing forever the skyline of the Suffolk coast. ""I feel highly emotional,"" says Nicholas Gold, owner of Orfordness Lighthouse. ""It's taken a big chunk of my life."" The Grade II-listed building is the 11th - and final - Orfordness Lighthouse. It was established 228 years ago on a particularly perilous stretch of England's coast. Although it is impossible to say how many souls it has helped save during that time, a single storm off Orford Ness, for example, wrecked 32 ships during a single day in 1627. On Thursday, the dismantling operation began and the roof was cut away Earlier in the week, a giant crane made its slow way along the spit towards the lighthouse. On Thursday, the dismantling operation began and the roof was cut away. Dismantling the lighthouse is expected to take about four weeks. It is hoped parts of the lighthouse can be used in a permanent memorial nearby. This video can not be played Drone footage captured the start of deconstruction work In the early 1980s, its base was 90m (295ft) from the sea. In the winter of 2013-14, four metres (13ft) of beach was lost in a single storm. It took a pounding in  2018's ""Beast from the East"" storms, and the sea is now just a few metres from the imposing red and white structure. Tides have slowly eroded the shingle beach on the Ness bringing the lighthouse perilously close to the sea Orfordness Lighthouse Trust plans to remove the lantern room and other artefacts that will one day form the basis of a lighthouse memorial on the other side of the Ness, facing Orford town's quay. Adrian Underwood's father Charlie was the last lighthouse keeper at Orford Ness, working there from 1965 until his retirement in 1994 and recognised with an MBE for his service. Mr Underwood,who published his father's second book on Orford in tribute to him after his death in 1997,external, has a small model of the lighthouse in his home in Ireland. ""I spent most of my Sundays on Orford Ness with him,"" said Mr Underwood, who, with no other vehicles on the shingle spit, taught himself to drive while his father worked. ""It was just part of life. When I look back on it, I was blessed. ""I have not been back to Orford since 2007 but in my mind the lighthouse will always be as it was. I'm almost glad that I've not seen it since so that for me it will always be as I remember it."" Adrian Underwood spent most Sundays as a teenager with his lighthouse man father Charlie on Orford Ness Relentless tides have started to take away the shingle from underneath the lighthouse's concrete footing To protect the lighthouse from erosion, the Orfordness Lighthouse Trust filled rubble sacks with shingle, bound them together with felt and laid them out in ""large sausages"" each weighing about 50 tonnes. This flexible wall has kept the building standing for longer than most expected. Longer-term defences, such as steel piling or rock armour, would not be allowed due to the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) status of Orford Ness. This status has also prevented the cutting-off of the lighthouse at the base and moving it back, as has been done with some others. Equally, as the sea can continue to cut around the sides, the trust would have had to keep adding to the defences to prevent this happening or the lighthouse could end up on its own small island. The lighthouse was never designed to be in the sea because the salt water would have made short work of its lime mortar. The lighthouse was decommissioned in 2013, after which Mr Gold bought it. He describes that decision as one made by a ""silly idiot"" since it was ""always doomed"". Since then, a small team of volunteers have sought to prolong the life of the building. Nicholas Gold bought the lighthouse in mid-2013 ""The whole point was the lighthouse had been such a celebrated landmark over so many years since the 18th Century,"" he said. ""It would be a wasted opportunity to leave it unkempt and sad in its final years. ""We did a deal. The headline price was Â£2,000 but I had a capital commitment to sort out the taking down and removal of it. I won't get any change from a six-figure sum.""

Why this Essex town decided to change its name Celeb high street 'shouting from same hymn sheet' Mr Gold previously worked as a financial adviser in London and has always had a passion for buying ""one-off buildings"". They include a redundant church and a former US spy station. The lighthouse ""seemed to fold naturally into the family,"" he said.

Green was safe, white ""heading into danger"" and red meant you were about to run aground England is home to more than 130 lighthouses The first to be built on rock in the open sea was Winstanley's Tower in 1698, off Plymouth The 19m (62ft) Dover Pharos was built by the Romans in about 50AD and was still in use when William the Conqueror arrived in 1066 Thelast manned lighthouse closed in 1998 at North Foreland in Kent,external The site is closed to visitors and members of the public have been told to stay away while the deconstruction work takes place Volunteers from the lighthouse trust must now ""deconstruct"" the building while there is enough shingle beach left for a crane to come and lift its 14-tonne cap and lantern room - or they will be lost forever. The team will then collapse the walls inside the lighthouse so that the brickwork does not spill across the shingle beach. Work is also under way to save as many of the building's original features as possible, along with its bespoke curved furniture. The lighthouse in 1951, just over a decade before it became one of the first remote-controlled lighthouses in the British Isles While the lighthouse is owned by Mr Gold, the National Trust owns the surrounding Ness, an area with its own place in history as a site for ballistic weapons, radar and atomic research. But from its point of view, taking on the preservation of the lighthouse would have been too costly. Orfordness lighthouse has attracted artists for more than two centuries. Landscape and marine painter William Daniell featured it in his 1820s series A Voyage Round Great Britain Nick Collinson, its general manager for the Suffolk and Essex Coast, said the disappearance of the lighthouse was in keeping with the longer life and history of the Ness. ""Orfordness Lighthouse has been an iconic landmark on this stretch of Suffolk's coastline for centuries, and we are saddened to see it lost,"" he said. ""Sitting on such a dynamic shingle spit, constantly changed by the sea, man's presence here can often feel ephemeral."" ""I find Orford Ness hauntingly beautiful,"" said Norfolk-based illustrator Rebecca Pymar. ""The Ness is home to fragile and endangered habitats and species which is mirrored by the lighthouses' own fragility as it makes its sad decline into the sea. It will be missed."" The lighthouse trust hopes to sell off its ""local bricks in wonderful condition"" to help raise funds to recreate a likeness of its top third more than a mile inland, featuring as many of the original elements as possible. The nature reserve on which the lighthouse stands is currently closed to the public. The Orfordness Lighthouse Trust hopes it will be possible to construct a tribute to the lighthouse, featuring a number of original features, at a new location nearly 1.5 miles (2.4km) from the sea ""The lighthouse itself is an emotional thing, certainly for the people of Orford who've lived with it on their horizon for generations,"" said Mr Gold.
