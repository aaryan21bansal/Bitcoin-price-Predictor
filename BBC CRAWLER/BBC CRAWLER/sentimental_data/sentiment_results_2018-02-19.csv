"This video can not be played Matthew Falder: Paedophile with 'rap sheet from hell' A ""warped and sadistic"" paedophile who blackmailed victims and shared abuse tips and images on the dark web has been jailed for 32 years. Cambridge graduate Matthew Falder, 29, admitted 137 charges - including rape - against 46 people, some of whom were in court to see him jailed. He coerced victims into acts including licking toilet seats and self-harming. At Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Philip Parker QC labelled Falder an ""internet highwayman"" with a ""lust to control"". The former geophysics researcher at the University of Birmingham will spend a further six years on licence when he is released from prison. This video can not be played Victim: ""I don't speak to my family anymore"" The court heard Falder, who lived in Edgbaston, had no previous convictions and excelled at school, where he was described as ""one of the finest students with an international impact"". How global taskforce caught 'worst paedophile' However, his offending lasted nearly 10 years and became ""increasingly menacing"", Judge Parker said. Victims described how they ""will never get over"" what happened to them. Falder showed no emotion in court Others described how they feel ""dirty, like used goods"" since their interactions with Falder. One mother, who was duped into sending Falder images of her daughter, said: ""I feel as if I failed my daughter massively by being too trusting. ""That will never go away, and it is something I have to live with and struggle with the guilt for the rest of my life. ""I am carrying the weight of what happened on my shoulders daily and its been exhausting."" In 25 years as a reporter covering countless trials I have never heard evidence so sickening. Matthew Falder never showed any emotion during the three-and-a-half days of sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court, but for the brave few victims who faced their tormentor during sentencing, it was hard to contain their tears. Hardened investigators were also visibly upset as some of the evidence was read out. Those who suffered extreme abuse and degradation say they are still suffering the impact of what he made them do, but it's hoped that the knowledge he's behind bars will begin to ease their nightmares. Four of Falder's victims attempted suicide. Falder duped victims on Gumtree, then immediately moved them away from the website's servers and on to email. This meant he could maintain anonymity to his victims, demanding increasingly depraved images. Once he had compromising images of his victims, Falder told them to send him more material or he would share images with their friends and family. He forced victims to lick toilet seats and eat dog food and then posted the images on ""hurtcore"" websites, described as hidden forums on the dark web dedicated to sharing images and videos of rape, torture, paedophilia and degradation. Some of the posts Falder made to these websites included: ""Glad you are all enjoying her suffering"" and ""I love blackmail, especially forcing someone met online to do things they don't want to for amusement"". This video can not be played ""Worst internet offender I've ever seen"" Watch experts discuss Falder In one post, he described what he had made his victims do: ""I have had a few push pins into themselves, sometimes to attach signs, and had one victim stand on them in bare feet."" The court heard how, because of the images he provided on dark web forums, he was given ""VIP status"" on the sites. A total of 484 images were found on Falder's computer after his arrest. He evaded capture for so long by using heavily encrypted email addresses, which he obtained through Russian email services. Falder was eventually caught by an international global taskforce, involving security services from Europe, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. The University of Cambridge said it was ""actively pursuing"" stripping Falder of his academic qualifications and could not say if that had ever happened before. Falder was given ""VIP status"" on some of the sites he used on the dark web The investigation to catch him began in August 2013 when the FBI began looking into dark web paedophilia sites, identifying a user known as ""Inthegarden"" and passing files to the National Crime Agency (NCA). This was the start of a four-year operation which saw law enforcement seek to identify Inthegarden, and eventually linking Falder to the username along with others ""evilmind"" and ""666devil"". Scott Crabb, of US Homeland Security said: ""There's some closure to be had with a sentence like this. ""I've just never seen anything like this, where someone is willing to go to these lengths to torment people. ""It's testament to the NCA who stuck with it for all these years, to ultimately catch him."" August 2013 - FBI begins its investigation into dark web paedophilia sites, identifying user known as Inthegarden and passing files to the NCA. April 2015 - The NCA investigate 666devil with ""daughter"" icon posting on a dark web forum. Officers discover links between 666devil, evilmind and Inthegarden while seeking to ""safeguard"" the girl. August 2015 - Suspect's webmail accounts are accessed, identifying the girl in his profile and further US victims. Taskforce set up between NCA, GCHQ, Homeland Security, Europol and Australian Federal Police. March 2017 - ""Person of interest"" identified at an address in Birmingham. April 2017 - Falder identified as the suspect. June 2017 - Falder arrested while at work at the University of Birmingham. Devices seized and Edgbaston home raided. Three days of questioning reveals Falder is behind 666devil. June to October 2017 - Falder admits to and is charged with 137 offences. A further 51 remain on file. Will Kerr, director of vulnerabilities for the NCA, said: ""At one point there were 100 investigators working on this case using the broadest range of new covert capabilities to try and identify and catch him. ""It's a bit of a watershed moment this investigation for policing."" This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the dark web? Prosecutor Ruona Iguyovwe, said: ""These things are repulsive. ""The sentencing is a very strong reminder to people if they abuse children, no stone will be left unturned in finding them.""

"This video can not be played The prime minister told ITV's This Morning there were 'issues' with university tuition fees The prime minister has called for better value for students in England, but has ruled out completely scrapping tuition fees. Theresa May has launched her review of tuition fees and university funding, to be chaired by the author and financier, Philip Augar. Labour has said it would abolish fees and bring back maintenance grants. But Mrs May said scrapping fees would push up taxes and mean limiting the number of university places. Will the fee review really make any difference? Kuenssberg: What will May do? Reality Check: Would cutting fees really help poorer students? 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees Which degrees earn the most? The prime minister, in a speech in Derby, said she remained committed to the principle that students ""who benefit directly from higher education should contribute directly towards the cost of it"". Announcing the year-long review of student finance and university funding, Mrs May warned that the system has failed to deliver sufficient competition on price. Almost all courses are charged at the maximum Â£9,250 per year and interest rates are up to 6.1%. The prime minister said students in England faced ""one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world"" and ""the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course"". There are ""serious concerns"" about the cost among parents and grandparents as well as students, she said. There is a temporary freeze on fees at Â£9,250 and that is likely to be extended for at least another year during the review. But there were no signs from ministers of any radical cutting in the headline price of fees. This video can not be played The education secretary wants more variety in the fees charged Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the review was an ""unnecessary waste of time"" and showed that ""Theresa May has finally admitted that her government got it wrong"". ""Labour will abolish tuition fees, bring back maintenance grants and provide free, lifelong education in further education colleges,"" said Ms Rayner. But the prime minister said that completely scrapping fees would be unfair and damaging to universities. She argued it would mean higher taxes for those who did not go to university and would mean universities had to compete for funding with schools and hospitals, with the likely outcome that limits would be introduced on the number of university places. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wants""more variety"" in the level of fees, rather than almost all courses and universities charging the maximum amount. He also calls for more flexibility in how courses are delivered, such as two-year degrees, encouraging ""commuter degrees"" where students live at home and making it easier for part-time students and those who want to carry on working while studying. Former Labour education minister, Lord Adonis, called for a more significant change - arguing that fees should be much lower or abolished, in the way that had happened in Germany. He accused universities of being ""bloated"" on high fees and said they needed to ""get real"" over how much they should charge. Lord Adonis rejected the idea of different subjects having different costs as a ""big backward step"", which would reduce numbers applying for science subjects, if they became more expensive than arts and humanities. The tuition fee review also will consider ways of reducing costs such as cutting interest rates on loans and reintroducing maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, as well as examining the level of fees. UK reacts to 'underwhelming' earthquake Sexual 'exploitation' warning to driving instructors WATCH: Ram-raid on Rolex shop caught on camera Mrs May said that sure poorer students should have an ""equal chance"" in higher education - but that at present they had the greatest burden of debt. Students from poorer families are offered bigger loans for living costs than better-off students, who are expected to be partly supported by their parents, but it means they graduate with bigger debts. Restoring maintenance grants for poorer students, scrapped last year, would reduce their level of borrowing. Support for vocational training and apprenticeships in ""post-18 education"" will also be considered. The prime minister warned that the route into further technical and vocational training is ""hard to navigate"", saying the standards across the sector ""are too varied"" and the funding ""is patchy"". This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt The Treasury select committee, chaired by former education secretary Nicky Morgan, has raised concerns about the high level of interest rates. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says students in England face more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university - contributing to average graduate debts of more than Â£50,000. Other former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarkehave all raised concerns about the level of interest charges. Universities can charge up to Â£9,250 per year Students do not pay this up-front, but can borrow the full amount They can also take a loan for living costs Disadvantaged students can borrow more for living costs, on the assumption that better-off students are supported by their parents Interest of up to 6.1% is charged on loans from when students start at university Students begin to repay loans once they earn Â£21,000, with this threshold being raised to Â£25,000 Any unpaid debts are written off after 30 years In Scotland's universities,there are no fees for Scottish students,external InNorthern Ireland,external, fees are up to Â£4,030 InWales,external, fees are up to Â£9,000 with plans for higher levels of maintenance support Mrs Morgan has also called for more support for part-time students, saying that their numbers had ""collapsed"". She said that the review needed to find a way to encourage more flexibility in courses and costs, saying that when the fees system was introduced it was ""naively assumed"" there would be be more competition. But there have been warnings against different levels of fees for sciences or humanities and arts, or for different types of university. Lord Willetts said higher fees for courses with the highest graduate earnings would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", giving even more money to the most advantaged courses and institutions. Labour's Angela Rayner says fees are unsustainable and should be scrapped Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, backed calls for more flexible approaches - such as two-year degree courses - but warned that setting different fee levels would be a ""bad idea"". Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said the current system needed to be ""better understood and feel fairer to students"". The priorities should be support for disadvantaged students and reversing the collapse in numbers of part-time and mature students, said the university group leader.

"Falder set up cameras in the bathrooms of his family homes A university lecturer who blackmailed people he met online into sending him degrading photos including acts of paedophilia has been jailed for 32 years. Dr Matthew Falder's conviction is thought to be the first UK prosecution related to sadistic ""hurtcore"" material located on the dark web. It follows a four-year, worldwide investigation involving security services from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Europe. Falder was, on the surface, a Cambridge-educated academic with a good job, family and friends. His Twitter feed revealed a love of dinosaurs, baking, table-tennis and 3D-printing, featuring selfies, crossword puzzles and innocuous questions about how to ""put nice quality videos online?"" Yet, behind the scenes, he operated under anonymous usernames on the dark web to share videos and images of paedophilia, blackmailing victims into sending him horrific material he would then pass on to other offenders. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the 29-year-old simply enjoyed inflicting pain, describing him as one of the most prolific and depraved offenders they had ever encountered. They estimate he had more than 50 victims over a period of eight years from 2009 to 2017. A ""sadistic and manipulative"" man, Falder admitted 137 charges out of the 188 against him, ranging from encouraging the rape of a four-year-old to possessing a paedophile manual. This video can not be played ""Worst internet offender I've ever seen"" Watch experts discuss Falder One of the officers involved in hunting Falder down, Will Kerr, of the NCA, said in all his 28 years of policing he had never encountered a more ""dangerous individual"". Supervising senior investigations officer Scott Crabb, of Homeland Security in the US, described him as a ""monster"" and ""pure evil"". He said: ""Falder is absolutely the worst child exploitation and blackmail offender I have ever seen."" Falder was caught thanks to the culmination of work by agents which first began in the United States in 2013, as the FBI worked to expose users of dark web paedophilia sites. Specialists built their own websites on the servers which hosted the offending sites to track what was being said and done on them. In doing so, they were able to access the so-called hurtcore communities who are defined by their sharing of images of rape, murder, sadism, torture, paedophilia, blackmail and humiliation. 'Hurt 2 The Core', described by the NCA as ""the world's worst website"", was one such site. A user known only as ""Inthegarden"" posted blackmail pictures of a teenage girl. The user was tracked online and found to have also made posts on online marketplace Gumtree. Falder was known as ""666devil"" and ""evilmind"" on the dark web There, the suspect approached potential victims by masquerading as a depressed female artist. He went by the names Liz, Jess and Shona to lure victims into talking to him, using at least 30 different email addresses encrypted via services which originated in Russia. He promised hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds, which he never paid, for naked or partially-clothed images of people. After building a rapport with them, he would obtain their personal information and immediately move the conversation away from Gumtree's servers. His victims would then be blackmailed into sending increasingly horrific images, with Falder threatening to send them to friends and relatives if they did not submit to his demands. Victims as young as 14 years old were told to strip naked, write racist and homophobic messages on signs and take pictures of themselves with them. Others were forced to lick toilet seats and used tampons as well as eat dog food. Some were forced to pose in their school uniforms. These images were then posted on hurtcore forums where they could be seen by countless members of global child sex abuse networks. Not only this, but the suspect also offered advice to other paedophiles on how to evade capture, suggesting they avoid using money but instead use ""vouchers to get kids to trust you"". Many of the suspect's UK victims reported abuse by Inthegarden to police, but there was not enough evidence to identify who was behind the username. Then in April 2015, the NCA discovered someone posting under the username ""666devil"". 666devil used a picture of a young girl as his icon on the forum, claiming she was his ""daughter"". He said he planned to ""torture"" her during what he dubbed ""hell week"" and requested ideas from members about what he could do to her. Officers scrambled to identify the girl in the profile image, accessing the user's webmail accounts to find out who she was and protect her. That was when they realised 666devil, evilmind and Inthegarden were the same person, and that whoever they were, they had approached more than 200 victims worldwide, including victims living in the US. However, at this stage, there was still not enough intelligence to identify the suspect. A special taskforce involving the NCA, GCHQ, Homeland Security Investigations in the US, the Australian Federal Police and Europol - as well as law enforcement in Israel and Slovenia - was set up specifically to ""enhance evidence gathering against the suspect"". It proved to be successful as, by the end of March 2017, intelligence linked a person of interest to an address in Birmingham. Falder was identified as the suspect in April and placed under covert surveillance for three months. He was filmed on the train, using his laptop. NCA officer Matthew Long said Falder was a ""highly manipulative"" and ""sadistic"" man who boasted he would never be caught. However, he could no longer evade justice and on 21 June last year plain clothes officers were deployed to capture him, arresting him at his workplace. He was handcuffed in his office at the University of Birmingham, with footage from the arrest revealing how he described the charges against him as the ""rap sheet from hell"". Two of Falder's devices were immediately seized, revealing what the NCA called ""significant evidence"". They showed that Falder's offending went back to 2009, when he was a 21-year-old student. Police found these early voyeurism offences in fact took place at a total of eight locations, involving 13 victims. Falder was questioned by police over three days, during which he largely refused to comment but did admit to controlling the evilmind account. Falder's bedroom was raided following his arrest Falder's computer was seized by officers who found information on it was heavily encrypted His home in Harborne Park Road, Edgbaston, was raided, revealing a chaotic student-like living space, an untidy bedroom with laundry, old pizza boxes and coins scattered across the carpet. A desktop computer and laptop were also found, surrounded by drawers of tools and masses of wires stuffed into bulging plastic containers. Officers found information on the devices often had double layers of encryption. Throughout June and August of last year, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) worked with authorities in the US, eventually deciding to prosecute Falder in the UK. He admitted and was charged with 137 offences in October last year, making him one of the country's most prolific paedophiles, according to BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw. A further 51 charges remain on file. August 2013 - FBI begins its investigation into dark web paedophilia sites, identifying user known as Inthegarden and passing files to the NCA April 2015 - The NCA investigate 666devil with ""daughter"" icon posting on a dark web forum. Officers discover links between 666devil, evilmind and Inthegarden while seeking to ""safeguard"" the girl August 2015 - Suspect's webmail accounts are accessed, identifying the girl in his profile and further US victims.

Devices seized and Edgbaston home raided. Three days of questioning reveals Falder is behind 666devil June to October 2017 - Falder admits to and is charged with 137 offences. A further 51 remain on file Documents released by the CPS and the NCA show that during Falder's near-decade of offending, his multiple victims included boys, girls, men and women. Ruona Iguyovwe, of the CPS, said: ""He sought out his innocent victims on Gumtree and even targeted victims on pro-anorexia websites."" To get what he wanted, Falder posed as a teenage girl on these websites to obtain images of six girls. Ms Iguyovwe added: ""He enjoyed humiliating his victims."" Some victims said since coming into contact with him they had attempted suicide multiple times. Others said they would never get over what happened, that they would always feel ""dirty, like used goods"". Matthew Falder's case raises further questions about how police can stay one step ahead of those with such an advanced technical knowledge that they're able to exploit the most vulnerable and expose them. He was a manipulative person whose prime motivation was power and control.  He wanted his victims to feel embarrassed and humiliated. His in-depth knowledge of the internet meant he could post obscene photos in a space only visible to a restricted audience. The National Crime Agency worked with its international partners to identify the man behind the pseudonyms but he managed to carry out his crimes for several years without detection. A mother, who gave Falder photographs of her daughter, said: ""I was physically ill when I found out that my child's image had been coerced from me and was so shook up that I was in no fit state to go into work. ""I feel as if I failed my daughter massively by being too trusting, as it is my job as her mum to protect her and I put her in danger. ""That will never go away and it is something I have to live with and struggle with the guilt for the rest of my life."" Clinical and forensic psychologist Kirsty Lowe said Falder took pleasure from torturing his victims. ""He refers to enjoyment,"" she said. ""He said he enjoys seeing the reluctant look on her face, seeing how far he could push the person."" Other victims are of course unable to speak for themselves, as Falder shared images of baby torture, Birmingham Crown Court was told. A spokesman for website Gumtree said it maintained strong relationships with law enforcement and had given its ""full support and co-operation to the NCA in their investigation of this case"". Senior investigations officer for the NCA, Matt Sutton, said that Falder's ""victim targeting"" showed ""organisation and advanced manipulation"". He added: ""His primary motivation was for power, control, suffering and humiliation. Believing he had superior intellectual and computational abilities, he was confident that he could outwit law enforcement. ""There is little doubt that Falder would have continued his offending, causing untold pain and distress to many other vulnerable people."" GCHQ said it was ""an horrific case"" and that the hearts of its staff ""go out to the victims"". ""GCHQ is determined to use our expertise to counter this type of terrible online child sexual abuse."" Steven Wilson, head of department for the European Cybercrime Centre at Europol, said he was ""proud to have been able to have contributed to bringing this offender to justice"".

"On university campuses across England, arts, humanities and social studies students are subsidising those on lab-based science courses, which are more expensive to run. This is because nearly all undergraduate courses come with the maximum Â£9,250 price tag. Ministers are looking at introducing a more variable system as part of a review of fees. What do students think about this? Jasper Williams, 20, studies physics at Manchester (with a little bit of philosophy on the side). He is set to leave university with debts of about Â£30,000, mainly for his fees but also for his maintenance loan. He paid Â£6,000 in his first year to live in university halls of residence, but was helped by his family with this hefty housing bill. ""It would be lovely for it to be free, but I do recognise that more people are going to university. ""I do believe that university is an investment in my future. ""I can't speak for everyone, but I hope that by studying a physics-based course I will be able to get a higher paid job so I hope it will be worth it."" He agrees wholeheartedly, however, that arts students are subsidising science students. ""My sister did English. She was always saying she was subsidising sciences students, and she was right because the running costs of her degree was incredibly lower than it was for physics. ""Also your contact time is much lower. Some people doing more humanities-based subjects - they have half the contact time that I have. ""The flipside is that we are meant to be doing the same amount of work."" Additionally, he says the ratio of students to tutors in tutorials can be very different. ""I do both. And in my philosophy there are 12 to 16 people in a tutor group, and in physics it's three to four."" Asked about reducing fees for those on arts courses, he says he might be for it, in terms of ""you get what you pay for"". ""But also it would discourage people from doing science, and that's not something that we should be doing."" However, he would like to see a different funding system brought in and finds it especially unfair that students are charged a 6.1% interest rate on their loans. Kat is studying social sciences ""That's incredibly high. It's higher than most interest rates you would pay on a bank loan."" Kat Ferris, 21, is in her third year of a sociology degree at York University and is expecting to graduate with about Â£37,500 of debt. The bulk of this is for her tuition fees. Her parents support her by paying her rent and she qualifies for a yearly maintenance loan of Â£3,500 a year. She says she feels utterly overwhelmed by the amount of money she will owe. ""It's such a huge amount of money that it doesn't really feel very real to me at the moment. ""It probably will feel real when I start working, but it hasn't quite hit me yet - it's too overwhelming."" ""Then again, some of my friends are on a low income, so they will be coming out with debts of about Â£50,000. ""In  terms of the disparity in courses it's not just contact time, it's also the state of the departments. ""For example, York has a real push on sciences and there's a brand new biology building and the sciences have all this sponsorship coming in. ""The sociology building - it's got to be the oldest  building on the campus. It looks a bit shabby. ""Whereas in science, we have all these state-of-the-art labs, and you think, 'How can this be the same university?'"" However, she says she doesn't feel this ""subsidising"" is a massive issue. ""I know what I pay doesn't just go to my department, it goes to the university as a whole. ""But there is something flawed in just how much difference there is in the different departments."" But Kat is more concerned with students from low-income backgrounds graduating with larger debts than those with wealthier families, because of the maintenance loans these students have to take out. ""People are going in with less money but coming out with a bigger debt. ""A reintroduction of a grant would make much more sense in terms of equality.""

"Ex-football coach Barry Bennell has been jailed for 31 years at Liverpool Crown Court for 50 counts of child sexual abuse. Bennell, described as the ""devil incarnate"" by the judge, was convicted of abusing 12 boys aged eight to 15 between 1979 and 1991. Judge Clement Goldstone QC said Bennell, 64, was ""sheer evil"". He will serve half of a 30-year sentence in custody, with the rest on licence. He was also sentenced to an additional year on licence. 'He took my innocence and my career' Bennell shook his head as the judge sentenced him and there was clapping from the public gallery as he left court. ""To those boys you appeared as a god... in reality you were the devil incarnate,"" Judge Goldstone said. ""You stole their childhoods and their innocence."" Barry Bennell: A cruel and arrogant paedophile A mother's horror at son's sexual abuse Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' This video can not be played Micky Fallon: 'Today we looked evil in the face and we smiled' Bennell remained impassive in the dock, staring at the floor, as victims' statements were read. He was ordered to attend Liverpool Crown Court for the hearing, having previously appeared via video-link throughout the five-week trial due to illness. The BBC's John Harrison, in court, said seven of the 11 jurors came back to hear the sentencing. The judge said Bennell, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, was ""hell-bent"" on abusing boys, and left a ""trail of psychological devastation"". ""If the boys tried to resist, you convinced them their football careers would suffer,"" he said. Outside court, victim Andy Woodward said: ""No sentence is long enough for that man and right to the death he didn't show any remorse or say sorry to anyone. ""I'm proud that I did speak out. If I hadn't have done, we all wouldn't be stood here now today."" Another victim, Micky Fallon, said: ""Today we looked evil in the face and smiled because, Barry Bennell, we have won."" Bennell in 2012 Gary Cliffe, another victim, said: ""We did not forget, we came after you, Bennell, and now you are in prison due to us."" He urged other victims to come forward, saying: ""The hurt is not yours to carry, it is his."" And Chris Unsworth added: ""This is a testament that love will always conquer evil."" In a statement outside court, Bennell was described as a ""predatory paedophile"" by Cheshire Police's detective inspector Sarah Oliver. ""To this day there is no evidence that he has any remorse or regret for the dreams he has shattered and the lives he has damaged,"" she added. She said that although ""no term of imprisonment can ever return a childhood taken away... I hope that this sentence will serve as a beacon of light to others that have been abused"". By John Harrison, BBC News, at Liverpool Crown Court Bennell shook his head as the judge at Liverpool Crown Court detailed his horrific crimes. The ex-football coach had earlier listened to the impact statements of some of his victims. Some spoke of feeling suicidal. Two said they felt unable to have children after suffering abuse. Others spoke about using drink and drugs to numb the mental anguish they suffered in later years. After reading out his statement, Gary Cliffe, one of Bennell's numerous victims, walked towards the dock asking: ""Barry, Barry, why?"" Bennell did not give him an answer. After the judge ordered him to return to the cells, there was stifled applause from the packed public gallery. Bennell, the judge added, was likely to die in prison. ""Barry, Barry, why?"" asked Gary Cliffe Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Earlier, victim impact statements were read to the court, with one saying Bennell ""took his one and only childhood"". Another statement, from a man abused when he was aged 12 to 13, said: ""I did not want it, did not ask for it. That monster decided it was fun to use me as a sex toy."" At the sentencing hearing, Bennell's lawyer, Eleanor Laws QC, had argued that poor health ""means his time in custody will be less comfortable and more difficult than it would be for someone without all these concerns."" She said he had suffered from cancer in the past and had operations to remove tumours from his tongue but was presently cancer free. She said he was also on anti-anxiety medication. Bennell was previously convicted of of child abuse on three occasions.  He received jail sentences in the UK and in the US in 1995, 1998 and 2015.

"This video can not be played ""Angry, sad, disappointed and hungry"": We talk to KFC customers KFC has closed more than half of its 900 UK outlets after delivery problems meant they ran out of chicken. Last week, the fried chicken chain switched its delivery contract to DHL, which blamed ""operational issues"" for the supply disruption. It was unclear when the delivery problems would be rectified, a KFC spokesperson said. Workers are being encouraged to take holiday but would not be forced to do so, he added. ""Our teams are working flat out all hours to get the rest back up and running as soon as possible - but it's too early to say how long it will take to clear the backlog."" KFC has set up aweb page,externalwhere ""fans"" can find their nearest outlet that is still open. It said that in the restaurants owned by the chain, staff on short-term contracts would be paid the average hours worked per day over the past 12 weeks, while those on salaries would be paid as normal. However, 80% of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. ""Franchisees will be seeking their own independent advice, but we're encouraging them to adopt this policy too,"" said the chain.

Until last Tuesday, KFC's chicken was delivered by South African-owned distribution group Bidvest, which describes itself as ""the leading supplier of logistical and supply chain solutions to the UK hospitality and restaurant sector"". But after the change in the contract, many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. ""The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants,"" KFC said on Twitter. ""We've brought a new delivery partner onboard, but they've had a couple of teething problems - getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex!"" it added, apologising to customers for the inconvenience. ""We won't compromise on quality, so no deliveries has meant some of our restaurants are closed, and others are operating a limited menu or shortened hours."" The statement listedKFC restaurants that were still open,externaldespite the problems. The distribution network uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL). DHL said: ""Due to operational issues, a number of deliveries in recent days have been incomplete or delayed. We are working with our partners, KFC and QSL, to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience."" The GMB union said it had tried to warn KFC that switching from Bidvest to DHL was a mistake. The change led to 255 job losses and the closure of a Bidvest depot, said Mick Rix, GMB national officer. He said: ""Bidvest are specialists - a food distribution firm with years of experience. DHL are scratching around for any work they can get, and undercut them. ""KFC are left with hundreds of restaurants closed while DHL try and run the whole operation out of one distribution centre. Three weeks ago, KFC knew they had made a terrible mistake, but by then it was too late."" One KFC customer, Claire, told BBC Radio 5 live she was surprised when she went out with her children at the weekend. ""We went on Saturday night to our local KFC in Luton and queued for about 20 minutes in the drive-thru, about 15 cars in the queue, and when we got to the actual counter and asked for our standard family bucket, we were told there was no chicken,"" she said. ""The kids, who are nine-year-old twins, they wanted chicken and clearly it wasn't available, so we said there's nothing available that we wanted, and we then had the joy of queuing to get back out again."" Other disgruntled KFC customers have been taking to Twitter to express their dismay at the shortages. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? US President Donald Trump supports efforts to improve background checks on gun ownership, the White House says. He spoke with Republican Senator John Cornyn about a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the checks in place before someone can buy a gun. The suspect in last week's Florida school shooting, in which 17 people died, bought his gun legally. Nikolas Cruz appeared in court on Monday. Students from the school have demanded action on gun control. It has emerged that Mr Cruz was able to buy seven rifles in the past year, despite being examined by Florida mental health workers in 2016, US media report. One of those was the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle used to carry out last Wednesday's attack. Mr Cruz appeared in court on Monday in Fort Lauderdale ""While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Monday. Federal licensed dealers must run checks on anyone trying to purchase a gun. A potential buyer fills in a form with personal information and criminal history. That information is submitted to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which processed more than 25 million applications last year. Why the NRA wields so much power US students say 'Never Again' after attack Should US gun raffles be cancelled? But the system has holes because it relies on state and federal officials to report any criminal convictions and mental health issues that should legally stop someone buying a gun to NICS. Its failings were put in the spotlight last year afterthe US Air Force admitted it had failed to flag a gunman's domestic violence convictionbefore he killed 26 people at a church in Texas. Demonstrators held a ""lie-in"" protest supporting gun control reform outside the White House on Monday After that shooting, a bipartisan bill was introduced by Mr Cornyn and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. It would require federal agencies to report background information thoroughly and accurately. It also proposed offering states financial incentives to do the same through a penalty and reward system. At the time, Mr Cornyn presented it as a fix to a ""nationwide, systematic problem"". But the bill has not been passed by Congress. This video can not be played Mr Obama told the BBC that gun control was his biggest frustration On Monday, Mr Murphy said the president's support for the bill was ""another sign the politics of gun violence are shifting"", but added that ""no-one should pretend this bill alone is an adequate response to this epidemic"". Mr Trump's view on gun control has changed over time. He spoke out against gun control during the 2016 election race. Mr Trump has repeatedly emphasised the role of the shooter's mental health in the Florida attack, butlast year he repealed an Obama-era rulethat allowed certain people who receive mental health-related benefits to be entered into a criminal database.

His guardians, James and Kimberly Snead, said on Monday that they had no idea that he had violent tendencies. ""I told him there'd be rules and he followed every rule to the T,"" Mr Snead, 48, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel newspaper. ""We had this monster living under our roof and we didn't know,"" his wife added. The couple also said they knew Nikolas Cruz possessed weapons but they were not worried, as they had a gun safe and James Snead believed he had the only key.

"The thumb was removed from a warrior on display in Philadelphia. Chinese authorities have demanded ""severe punishment"" for a man who allegedly stole the thumb of a terracotta warrior statue on display in the US, Chinese state media report. The 2,000-year-old statue, worth $4.5m (Â£3.2m), is one of 10 on loan to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. Last week, Michael Rohana was charged with theft and concealment of a major artwork, and later released on bail. The Terracotta Army is one of China's most important archaeological finds. According to court documents, Mr Rohana, 24, was attending an Ugly Sweater Party at the Franklin Institute on 21 December whenhe made his way into the Terracotta Warriors exhibit,external, which was then closed. Mr Rohana allegedly used a mobile phone as a torch and took a selfie with one of the warriors, according to Chinese state media Xinhua, quoting the FBI. Ancient Chinese warriors to invade Britain The terracotta army that conquered the world The ruthless Chinese emperor who burned books He then allegedly put his hand on the left hand of the statue and appeared to break something off from it. He pocketed the item and left. Museum staff noticed the missing thumb on 8 January and the FBI later traced it to Mr Rohana. He later admitted that he had kept the thumb in a desk drawer. On Monday, the director of the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Centre, the government-run organisation which loaned the statues out, ""strongly condemned"" the Franklin Institute for being ""careless"" with the statues, CCTV reported. ""We ask that the US severely punish the perpetrator. We have lodged a serious protest with them,"" said Wu Haiyun. Mr Wu said the centre would be sending two experts to the US to assess the damage and repair the statue with the recovered thumb. There would be a claim for compensation, he added. The warriors have been called the greatest archaeological find of the 20th Century The 10 statues currently on display at the Franklin Institute are part of an army of 8,000 life-size clay warriors which make up the Terracotta Army. The statues were built by the Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang, who died in 210 BCE, and who believed they would protect him in the afterlife. They were discovered in China's Xi'an city in 1974 by a group of Chinese farmers.

"Religious groups have condemned a bill in Iceland's parliament that would ban circumcision for non-medical reasons. The draft law would impose a six-year prison term on anyone guilty of ""removing part or all of the [child's] sexual organs"", arguing the practice violates the child's rights. Jewish and Muslim leaders however have called the bill an attack on religious freedom. Iceland would be the first European country to ban the procedure. The country is thought to have roughly 250 Jewish citizens and around 1,500 Muslim citizens. MP Silja DÃ¶gg GunnarsdÃ³ttir of the Progressive Party, who introduced the bill at the start of the month, said: ""We are talking about children's rights, not about freedom of belief. ""Everyone has the right to believe in what they want, but the rights of children come above the right to believe."" Iceland passed a law in 2005 banning female genital mutilation, and supporters of this move have compared it to that law. The latest bill (in Icelandic) says circumcision ""involves permanent interventions in a child's body that can cause severe pain"",external. If it passes its first reading, the draft law will go to a committee stage before it can come into effect. The Nordic Jewish Communities issued a statement,externalcondemning the ban on ""the most central rite"" in their faith. ""You are about to attack Judaism in a way that concerns Jews all over the world,"" the open letter reads. Jewish campaign group Milah UK stated that comparisons with female genital mutilation are unwarranted, given that in the case of male circumcision there is ""no recognised long-term negative impact on the child"". Circumcision: A parenting dilemma Religions and circumcisions Imam Ahmad Seddeeq at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Iceland also criticised the move. ""It's... part of our faith,"" he said."" It's something that touches our religion and I believe that this is... a contravention [of] religious freedom."" The Bishop of Reykjavik, Agnes M. SigurÃ°ardÃ³ttir, warned Jewish and Muslim people could feel ""unwelcome"" in Iceland. ""The danger that arises, if this bill becomes law, is that Judaism and Islam will become criminalised religions,"" she said. ""We must avoid all such forms of extremism."" By Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editor Although it is a relatively simple medical procedure, circumcision is not entirely risk free. Doctors may recommend that a man or boy is circumcised if he has an unusually tight foreskin, known as phimosis, or suffers from recurrent infections of the foreskin and penis, known as balanitis. There is also some evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of contracting HIV from HIV-positive female partners. It is not clear if circumcision reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted infections too, but studies suggest it may lower the chance of catching genital warts caused by a family of viruses called HPV. The main risks of the surgery are bleeding and infection. In the UK, the chance of these occurring is between one in 10 and one in 50,according to the NHS website,external, although that is a figure for older boys and men, not the newborns who would be most affected by the Icelandic ban. Circumcision is legal throughout Europe, although the practice is becoming more controversial. A court in Germany passed a local ban in 2012 after the circumcision of a four-year-old Muslim boy led to complications, with the judge saying it ""permanently and irreparably changed"" the body. However, the German government later that year clarified the act is legal provided it is performed by trained practitioners. The following year, the Council of Europe recommended countries take steps to ensure good medical and sanitary practices when performing a circumcision. And in the UK in 2016, a court ruled that a Muslim father could not have his sons circumcised after their mother disagreed. Is it fair to circumcise newborn boys?

"Jeremy Corbyn says he regularly met representatives of foreign government during the 1980s Jeremy Corbyn should be ""open and transparent"" about his alleged contacts with a Communist spy during the 1980s, Theresa May has suggested. Asked about claims a Czech intelligence officer met and tried to recruit Mr Corbyn during the Cold War, she said MPs must ""account"" for past actions. The Labour Party has said claims he was an agent were a ""ridiculous smear"". Czech officials say files show he was a ""person of interest"" but was never a secret collaborator or an informer. Files held by the Czech Security Service Archive,first reported by the Sun,,externaldetail contacts Mr Corbyn is alleged to have had with a Czechoslovakian diplomat and agent in London in 1986 and 1987. Jan Sarkocy told the newspaper he met Mr Corbyn on several occasions, including in the House of Commons, while he was working undercover in the London Embassy under the name of Jan Dymic. At an event in Derby, the prime minister was asked whether she agreed with her defence secretary Gavin Williamson that Mr Corbyn's file - which reportedly gives insights into his character and views on foreign policy issues from the time - should now be released so people could make up their own mind about the claims. ""It is for individual members of Parliament to be accountable for their actions in the past,"" she replied. ""Where there are allegations of this sort, MPs should be prepared to be open and transparent."" The director of the Czech Security Service Archive told the BBC that their files suggest Mr Corbyn was seen as a possible ""contact"" but no more than that. ""Mr Corbyn was not a secret collaborator working for the Czechoslovak intelligence service,"" Svetlana Ptacnikova said. ""The files we have on him are kept in a folder that starts with the identification number one. This video can not be played âJeremy has been interested in foreign policy issues his entire political careerâ says Labour MP Louise Haigh ""Secret collaborators were allocated folders that start with the number four. If he had been successfully recruited as an informer, then his person of interest file would have been closed, and a new one would have been opened, and that would have started with the number four."" She added: ""He stayed in that basic category - and in fact he's still described as that, as a person of interest, in the final report issued by the StB agent shortly before he [the agent] was expelled from the UK."" Labour has acknowledged Mr Corbyn met Czechoslovakian and other diplomats ""for a cup of tea"" but said Mr Sarkocy's accounts of his meetings with him had ""no credibility whatsoever"". In a statement released when the Sun's initial report was published, Labour said ""the claim that Jeremy Corbyn was an agent, asset or informer for any intelligence agency is entirely false and a ridiculous smear"". ""Jeremy neither has nor offered any privileged information to this or any other diplomat,"" it added. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said the leader had instructed lawyers to contact Conservative MP Ben Bradley over a tweet he said was libellous. ""Jeremy has instructed solicitors to contact Ben Bradley to delete his libellous tweet or face legal action,"" the spokesman said. The tweet, which claimed the Labour leader ""sold British secrets to Communist spies"", has now been deleted.

Parts of the 11-page document are blacked out to hide people's identities, including the names of the three men accused of intimidating witnesses. Oxfam presented the original, unedited report to the government in Haiti on Monday. Speaking after the meeting with Haitian minister Aviol Fleurant, Simon Ticehurst, Oxfam regional director for Latin America, said the charity would be starting ""the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens.

By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Oxfam is reeling under the revelations that some of its staff were guilty of bullying, intimidation and sexual misconduct, including using prostitutes on the charity's premises. So it is trying to start recovering some of its reputation by being as transparent as it can. Hence the publication of the internal report into what happened in Haiti in 2011. In the short term this may produce more damaging revelations not only about the inappropriate behaviour of staff but also the mismanagement and lack of transparency by senior managers. There are also likely to be more revelations when the Charity Commission and MPs begin their own investigations, as well as Oxfam's own internal inquiry. So few would disagree with the Prime Minister's spokesman when he says Oxfam has a long way to go to restore public trust. Theresa May told BBC London the revelation that three Oxfam staff physically intimidated witnesses during the charity's investigation was ""absolutely horrific"". ""This is exactly the problem that we see which means that all too often people don't feel able to come forward to report what has happened to them,"" the prime minister said. One former Oxfam aid workertold the BBC she was sexually and physically abused by a senior male colleague while in Haiti. She claimed she was also sexually assaulted by another Oxfam worker in South Sudan months later. Seven Oxfam employees left the organisation as a result of their behaviour in Haiti in 2011, the report shows. One employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises. The use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out. Two more were dismissed for bullying and intimidation - one of whom also downloaded pornography - and another man was sacked for failing to protect staff. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence when questioned by the investigation team. Mr Van Hauwermeiren last weekdenied paying prostitutes for sex. UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, on the provision that he fully co-operated with the rest of the investigation. It is not known if he is one of the suspects accused of threatening witnesses. The BBC has discovered that one of the staff dismissed from Oxfam for gross misconduct in Haiti was Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan aid worker who is based outside the capital Nairobi. Asked by a reporter whether he had been with Mr Van Hauwermeiren, Mr Mutiku said ""no"".

"Great Ormond Street Hospital has indicated that it may change its mind about returning donations from a scandal-hit charity. The hospital had said it would hand back money previously given to it by the Presidents Club Charitable Trust. The decision followed allegations of sexual harassment at a men-only Presidents Club dinner. The charity has since closed down, making it difficult to return the Â£530,000 previously donated. The final decision on what to do with the money will be made at a meeting of hospital charity trustees on 27 March. In a statement, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Children's Charity said: ""Guiding all our thinking is our aim to maximise the support to the hospital and the families it cares for. ""We can confirm that we are in discussions with the Charity Commission and are scheduled to meet them later this week. ""Following this meeting and taking into account the latest developments with the Presidents Club Charitable Trust and feedback from our supporters, we will consider our position at our March Trustee meeting."" Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims Are charities allowed to return money? GOSH did not receive any money from the controversial dinner, held at the Dorchester Hotel in London on 18 January. However, it had been a beneficiary of three earlier Presidents Club events that took place between 2009 and 2016. On 24 January, a hospital spokeswoman said that ""due to the wholly unacceptable nature of the event"", previous donations would be returned. However, some of its other donors reportedly objected to the hospital's stance and are said to have threatened not to give it any more money in the future.

"Authorities have warned that a number of residents remain unaccounted for At least 17 people - including children - have been killed in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, and many more injured after a huge mound of rubbish collapsed, officials say. The pile of waste, some 15m (49ft) high, gave way in heavy rains at 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Monday. The dump is known to be home to some of the city's poorest residents, who build makeshift camps amid the rubbish. Five homes on the edge were also crushed in the disaster. Rescue workers are continuing to search for survivors. Mozambique country profile Africa Live: More on this and other stories A spokesman for the emergency services, Leonilde Pelembe, warned it was likely there were more victims under the waste. ""The information we received from local authorities is that the number of people living in those houses exceeds the number of deaths recorded,"" Mr Pelembe said. The Hulene district of Maputo is one of the most deprived parts of the capital. Many, including children, have little choice but to make their homes either on or next to the dump. The dump not only provides them with food but also goods to sell, our correspondent Jose Tembe explains. Analysis by Jose Tembe, BBC Africa, Maputo The dump was here when I began living in the area in the 1980s. I saw the buildings being erected around it. The municipal authorities have tried to clear it. Each time the rainy season comes, they remove people and give them plots of land. Rescue workers clear rubbish as they continue to search for survivors But when there is no rain, people move back to the rubbish dump. It is where they can be close to the city and collect things that have been dumped - things like outdated food to either eat or sell. The government keeps on promising and promising to close the dump for good but they never do it. They never close it, and so people continue to pile garbage in the same area. The authorities said they had previously asked residents in the area to leave because their homes were constructed illegally, Reuters news agency reports. However one local resident whose son was injured in the landslide, Maria Huo, said: ""I live in this neighbourhood because I have nowhere to go. Had the government told me to go to another place to live, I would have left here."" The city of Maputo has experienced heavy rainfall since Sunday, which has damaged homes and flooded roads. In the poorer suburbs of cities such as Maputo, people sometimes live on land they do not own in the hope of finding work. The dwellings can be built on land that is unsafe.

"A third of people in the UK underestimate how many calories they are eating, according to an analysis of Office of National Statistics data. It suggests British men eat more than 3,000 a day while claiming to eat 2,000. And women say they eat about 1,500 while consuming nearly 2,500. The recommended daily calorie allowance is 2,500 for men and 2,000 for women. The study of more than 4,000 people looked at energy expenditure and self-reporting information on food eaten. Public Health England chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said under-reporting of calorie intakes ""has always been a feature of all diet surveys"". ""Some people forget what they've consumed and some change what they record knowing they are part of a survey. ""There's no way to get rid of under-reporting, but the steps we take to minimise it makes the National Diet and Nutrition Survey the most robust data on the population's diet."" As a rule of thumb, Public Health England recommends consuming about 400 calories for breakfast and 600 calories each for lunch and dinner to allow for extra drinks and snacks throughout the day. But many cafes and restaurant do not have calorie information readily available and often include extra ingredients that add flavour but also calories. Some restaurant portions may also be bigger than ones eaten at home. But portion size can also be an issue at home. Many food labels state the number of calories in ""one portion"". But the manufacturer's idea of ""one portion"" may not be the same as those dished up at the dinner table. Many snacks also give calorie information, but this can be hard to understand and research suggests people spend just six seconds, on average, looking at food before buying it. A large glass of wine can contain as many calories as a doughnut, and a pint of lager has about the same calorie count as a packet of crisps. The average wine drinker in England takes in about 2,000 calories from alcohol every month. Drinking five pints of lager a week adds up to 44,200 calories over a year, equivalent to eating 221 doughnuts.

"Authorities have warned that a number of residents remain unaccounted for At least 17 people - including children - have been killed in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, and many more injured after a huge mound of rubbish collapsed, officials say. The pile of waste, some 15m (49ft) high, gave way in heavy rains at 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Monday. The dump is known to be home to some of the city's poorest residents, who build makeshift camps amid the rubbish. Five homes on the edge were also crushed in the disaster. Rescue workers are continuing to search for survivors. Mozambique country profile Africa Live: More on this and other stories A spokesman for the emergency services, Leonilde Pelembe, warned it was likely there were more victims under the waste. ""The information we received from local authorities is that the number of people living in those houses exceeds the number of deaths recorded,"" Mr Pelembe said. The Hulene district of Maputo is one of the most deprived parts of the capital. Many, including children, have little choice but to make their homes either on or next to the dump. The dump not only provides them with food but also goods to sell, our correspondent Jose Tembe explains. Analysis by Jose Tembe, BBC Africa, Maputo The dump was here when I began living in the area in the 1980s. I saw the buildings being erected around it. The municipal authorities have tried to clear it. Each time the rainy season comes, they remove people and give them plots of land. Rescue workers clear rubbish as they continue to search for survivors But when there is no rain, people move back to the rubbish dump. It is where they can be close to the city and collect things that have been dumped - things like outdated food to either eat or sell. The government keeps on promising and promising to close the dump for good but they never do it. They never close it, and so people continue to pile garbage in the same area. The authorities said they had previously asked residents in the area to leave because their homes were constructed illegally, Reuters news agency reports. However one local resident whose son was injured in the landslide, Maria Huo, said: ""I live in this neighbourhood because I have nowhere to go. Had the government told me to go to another place to live, I would have left here."" The city of Maputo has experienced heavy rainfall since Sunday, which has damaged homes and flooded roads. In the poorer suburbs of cities such as Maputo, people sometimes live on land they do not own in the hope of finding work. The dwellings can be built on land that is unsafe.

"Ex-football coach Barry Bennell has been jailed for 31 years at Liverpool Crown Court for 50 counts of child sexual abuse. Bennell, described as the ""devil incarnate"" by the judge, was convicted of abusing 12 boys aged eight to 15 between 1979 and 1991. Judge Clement Goldstone QC said Bennell, 64, was ""sheer evil"". He will serve half of a 30-year sentence in custody, with the rest on licence. He was also sentenced to an additional year on licence. 'He took my innocence and my career' Bennell shook his head as the judge sentenced him and there was clapping from the public gallery as he left court.

The judge said Bennell, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, was ""hell-bent"" on abusing boys, and left a ""trail of psychological devastation"". ""If the boys tried to resist, you convinced them their football careers would suffer,"" he said. Outside court, victim Andy Woodward said: ""No sentence is long enough for that man and right to the death he didn't show any remorse or say sorry to anyone. ""I'm proud that I did speak out. If I hadn't have done, we all wouldn't be stood here now today."" Another victim, Micky Fallon, said: ""Today we looked evil in the face and smiled because, Barry Bennell, we have won."" Bennell in 2012 Gary Cliffe, another victim, said: ""We did not forget, we came after you, Bennell, and now you are in prison due to us."" He urged other victims to come forward, saying: ""The hurt is not yours to carry, it is his."" And Chris Unsworth added: ""This is a testament that love will always conquer evil."" In a statement outside court, Bennell was described as a ""predatory paedophile"" by Cheshire Police's detective inspector Sarah Oliver. ""To this day there is no evidence that he has any remorse or regret for the dreams he has shattered and the lives he has damaged,"" she added. She said that although ""no term of imprisonment can ever return a childhood taken away... I hope that this sentence will serve as a beacon of light to others that have been abused"". By John Harrison, BBC News, at Liverpool Crown Court Bennell shook his head as the judge at Liverpool Crown Court detailed his horrific crimes. The ex-football coach had earlier listened to the impact statements of some of his victims. Some spoke of feeling suicidal. Two said they felt unable to have children after suffering abuse. Others spoke about using drink and drugs to numb the mental anguish they suffered in later years. After reading out his statement, Gary Cliffe, one of Bennell's numerous victims, walked towards the dock asking: ""Barry, Barry, why?"" Bennell did not give him an answer. After the judge ordered him to return to the cells, there was stifled applause from the packed public gallery. Bennell, the judge added, was likely to die in prison. ""Barry, Barry, why?"" asked Gary Cliffe Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Earlier, victim impact statements were read to the court, with one saying Bennell ""took his one and only childhood"". Another statement, from a man abused when he was aged 12 to 13, said: ""I did not want it, did not ask for it. That monster decided it was fun to use me as a sex toy."" At the sentencing hearing, Bennell's lawyer, Eleanor Laws QC, had argued that poor health ""means his time in custody will be less comfortable and more difficult than it would be for someone without all these concerns."" She said he had suffered from cancer in the past and had operations to remove tumours from his tongue but was presently cancer free. She said he was also on anti-anxiety medication. Bennell was previously convicted of of child abuse on three occasions.  He received jail sentences in the UK and in the US in 1995, 1998 and 2015.

" The Hughes Glomar Explorer In the summer of 1974, a large and highly unusual ship set sail from Long Beach in California. It was heading for the middle of the Pacific where its owners boasted it would herald a revolutionary new industry beneath the waves. Equipped with a towering rig and the latest in drilling gear, the vessel was designed to reach down through the deep, dark waters to a source of incredible wealth lying on the ocean floor. It was billed as the boldest step so far in a long-held dream of opening a new frontier in mining, one that would see valuable metals extracted from the rocks of the seabed. But amid all the excited public relations, there was one small hitch - the whole expedition was a lie. This was a Cold War deception on a staggering scale, but one which also left a legacy that has profound implications nearly half a century later. A Soviet submarine of the same class as K-129 The real target of the crew on board this giant ship was a lost Soviet submarine. Six years earlier, the K-129 had sunk 1,500 miles north-west of Hawaii while carrying ballistic nuclear missiles. The Russians failed to find their sub despite a massive search, but an American network of underwater listening posts had detected the noise of an explosion that eventually led US teams to the wreck. It was lying three miles down, deeper than any previous salvage operation. The weapons and top-secret code books were surely beyond reach. But in the struggle for military advantage, the sub represented the crown jewels – a chance to explore Moscow’s nuclear missiles and to break into its naval communications. So the CIA hatched an audacious plan, Project Azorian, to retrieve the submarine. That would have been hard enough. But there was another challenge as well - it had to be done without the Russians knowing. The spies needed to create a smokescreen so they pretended to be exploring the possibility of deep sea mining. A PR campaign conveyed a determined effort to find manganese nodules. These potato-sized rocks lie scattered in the abyss, the great plains of the deep ocean. There had to be a frontman - someone rich and eccentric enough to be plausible. The reclusive billionaire inventor Howard Hughes was perfect for the role. Howard Hughes, pictured in 1952 - by the 1970s the billionaire was living a reclusive existence He agreed to take part and, in his name, a unique ship was designed. Publicly, it was fitted with everything needed to dig up the seabed. But, covertly, the Hughes Glomar Explorer was also built with ingenious devices straight from a Bond film. The ship’s hull had enormous doors that could swing apart to create a “moon pool”, an underwater opening large enough to accommodate the Soviet sub and keep it hidden. Tucked away out of sight inside the ship was a “capture vehicle” which had a giant set of claws to straddle the sub and secure it. It took until 1974, six years after the sinking of the sub, for the CIA to be ready. The cost of the project - $500m - was equivalent then to building a couple of aircraft carriers or launching an Apollo mission to the moon. We really misled a lot of people and it’s surprising that the story held together for so long” No-one had ever attempted anything on this scale in such incredible depths. The sub itself had a weight of nearly 2,000 tonnes but the three miles of thick steel pipe needed to haul it up added even more. New systems were needed to keep the Glomar Explorer in position as well as to handle the huge load, and everyone on board was nervous. Dave Sharp, one of the few CIA figures happy to talk about the project, tells me it was “really frightening” when heavy seas threatened to tear their unusual vessel apart. Dave Sharp, pictured aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer But even more alarming was the suspicion of the Russians. To convince them that Howard Hughes was genuinely interested in nodules, executives were despatched to conferences on ocean mining where they described in detail their plans to harvest the rocks. “We made ocean mining seem a lot more credible,” Sharp says. “We really misled a lot of people and it’s surprising that the story held together for so long.” The cover was so good that it prompted US universities to move to start courses in deep sea mining and it also whipped up the share prices of the companies involved. “People thought, ‘if Howard Hughes is into it, we need to be too’,” says Sharp. “We even collected a few nodules,” he remembers, which was fortunate because Soviet spy ships kept a constant vigil and once even came close enough to overhear the Americans’ conversations. A Soviet spy ship monitoring the Hughes Glomar Explorer “When we realised they were right alongside, we started talking about nodules, like ‘here’s a good one’ so it looked like we were checking them.” Yet another complication arose. The project needed calm weather and that was only likely in summer. But just when it was about to begin in summer 1974, US President Richard Nixon was visiting Moscow for a peace-making summit. Being caught stealing a Soviet sub would not exactly have helped, so Nixon insisted that the operation could not begin until he had left Russia. That was on 3 July. By then the Hughes Glomar Explorer was in position and the winches whirred into action the next day. Things did not go smoothly. Sharp recalls that pumps and connections kept breaking. Huge vibrations rocked the ship as the “capture vehicle” was “banging back and forth in the waves”. But on 30 July, he watched as underwater cameras relayed video of the sub as well as “dozens of crawling crab-like crustaceans” and a big white fish that looked like a shark. Inside the Hughes Glomar Explorer control room Amazingly, the giant steel claws successfully seized the sub. But then disaster struck. At some point on the way up, the immense strain became too much, part of a claw snapped off and most of the sub slipped back to the seabed. Only the front section made it up. The bodies of six Soviet submariners were recovered and were later given a formal burial at sea. But the missiles and code books were never found. The CIA official history asserts that the operation was one of the greatest intelligence coups of the Cold War, but it had cost vast sums and questions immediately arose about its value. A year later, the sensational details became public and plans to recover the remaining section were abandoned. As Sharp puts it, the revelation that the deep sea mining project was fake was “a sudden shock” to other mining companies and also to diplomats at the UN who were right in the middle of negotiating future rights to ocean minerals. Share prices tumbled amid a wave of recriminations. This might have derailed the very notion of deep sea mining for good. But in fact it proved that with clever engineering and a lavish budget it was possible – just - to operate in the otherworldly depths. “It’s really difficult but we showed it could be done,” says Sharp. In an air-conditioned cabin in a teeming port in Papua New Guinea, Leslie Kewa reaches for a joystick that will control a machine the size of a house. Nearly half a century after the CIA men pretended to mine the ocean floor, he’s about to do it for real. A burly figure with a kindly face, Kewa is from a village in the remote highlands of Papua New Guinea. In a country blighted by poverty, he grew up in relative comfort because his father, and the rest of the men in his family, made careers in the mining industry. Kewa became a specialist in handling gargantuan devices. But the one standing nearby is unique, not only because of the destructive power of its whirling steel teeth, and its menacing resemblance to something from a Mad Max film, but also because it’s designed to be used far beyond human reach. As Kewa’s fingertips send the first commands, and the machine crunches over the ground outside, he admits to feeling a bit scared. In these first trials, he’s learning to steer by remote control, relying on CCTV to show him where the huge steel tracks are pointing as they inch their way forward. “I’m used to the feel of machinery in my hands so having to trust the equipment and the screens is hard,” he says. But there’s no other option. The machine will soon be deployed not in the huge pits of an opencast mine on land but in the sunless depths a mile underwater on the ocean floor. If work starts as planned next year, Kewa will earn himself a place in history as the first person to break rock in the world’s first deep sea mine.

Run by a Canadian firm, Nautilus Minerals, the project will be managed from a ship in the tropical waters of the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea. Three of the vast machines will be lowered to the slopes of an undersea volcano. There they will encounter a stretch of seabed covered in hydrothermal vents. These strange twisting chimneys are formed by boiling water blasting up from the rock. As with most fields of vents, this one is astonishingly rich in valuable metals. The site is namedSolwara 1- “salt water” in the local language. But the hydrothermal vents host thriving communities of marine life - snails, worms and shrimp that have evolved to cope with very specific conditions. In some cases these creatures are extremely rare, which is why the prospect of deep sea mining is highly controversial. The plan is for Kewa to guide the steel teeth of the mining machines so they methodically demolish the vents, pulverising them into fragments. The tiny pieces of rock should then be small enough to be piped up to the surface. On board the ship, a processing plant will churn out a multitude of specks of copper and gold that could be worth billions. A Chinese firm has already agreed to buy the lot. Once the riches of Solwara 1 have been extracted, the machines will be moved to another dozen sites lined up nearby. On the sea bed the ores are exceptionally rich. Every tonne of material dug up in a typical copper or gold mine on land only yields a tiny fraction of useful metal. By contrast, the hydrothermal vents off Papua New Guinea are at least 10 times richer. And it’s the same story with gold and many other metals too. A Japanese expedition to another set of vents off Okinawa discovered enough zinc to keep Japan supplied for an entire year. Those behind that project kept it quiet until it was over, causing real surprise in the mining industry. Nautilus Minerals forecasts that in copper alone an emerging undersea industry in oceans around the world could be worth $30bn a year by 2030. And it claims that by mining a small area of seabed, the venture will be friendlier to the environment. It contrasts its work with mines on land where trees and topsoil are swept away across vast areas. The footprint of the Solwara-1 mining area, compared with an existing copper mine in South Australia For the government of Papua New Guinea, the attraction is obvious - badly needed income as a partner in the venture. And Nautilus has agreed to funnel some of the proceeds to local administrations too, to let ordinary people benefit. But the history of mining in Papua New Guinea does not inspire confidence. Millions still live well below the poverty line despite the massive extraction of ores from the mountains. And for some, venturing into the sea spells danger for precious waters. Jonathan Mesulam first heard about deep sea mining when he was reading the business section of a newspaper. The story shocked him. Born and brought up in Papua New Guinea’s New Ireland, he realised that the site of Solwara 1 was only about 15 miles (25km) from his home on the shore. “As soon as I read the article I felt so numb,” Mesulam says. Like many parts of Papua New Guinea, his village has the appearance of a tropical paradise. Palm trees overlook aquamarine shallows and wooden fishing boats lie on the golden beaches. But the beauty masks a chronic lack of development. People live in homes built of bamboo and sago leaves. Mesulam himself achieved a big break by becoming a secondary school teacher, but he has shunned city life to be at home to fight the mine. “We have a connection with the sea,” he says. “It’s been part of our culture for generations and traditional knowledge of the sea goes back to our ancestors.” Polite and softly spoken, Mesulam says the coastal communities depend on fishing which could be threatened if the waters are filled with dust generated by the mining, or if they are polluted. Jonathan Mesulam is a leading opponent of plans for deep sea mining off the coast of Papua New Guinea The tuna industry employs thousands in Papua New Guinea. And the villages on New Ireland are famous for the unique practice of “shark calling” - local people lure the creatures to their boats and soothe them before hauling them in. All this, Mesulam says, could be “grievously harmed” by digging up the ocean floor, and he’s become a leading figure in a campaign group, the Alliance of Solwara Warriors, which is opposing Nautilus Minerals. The company says that at a mile deep, the mining will be far below the habitats of any important fisheries and will not affect them. A traditional fisherman in New Ireland, Papua New Guinea “Where we’ll be operating, it’s cold and dark,” says one senior Nautilus executive. “There are no tuna there, they need entirely different conditions near the surface of the ocean.” This reassurance has been emphasised in public meetings. And Nautilus has also been investing in community relations, paying for mobile health care and even a new bridge. For Mesulam this is mere PR. He calls the mine “experimental” - there could be unexpected consequences, and he has the churches and some politicians on his side. But he’s up against a great force - the incredible and surging demand the world has for key minerals. Stung by accusations that they are failing to tackle dirty air, governments around the world are setting new standards for cleaner vehicles. That means millions more electric cars in the next few years. Source: The Copper Alliance All the batteries and the wiring, the processors and the charging points, will need raw materials. Last year the German giant Volkswagen tried to corner the market in cobalt. Supplies of lithium are also in hot demand. And copper has never been so badly needed. And with renewable power like wind and solar being installed at a frantic pace, every turbine and every panel also requires key metals. Add to that the boom in consumer electronics and there are real concerns about future supplies. With cobalt, it’s estimated that by 2025 Volkswagen will need one-third of the current entire global supply for its electric cars. Source: The Copper Alliance Massive new battery factories are being constructed – like Tesla owner Elon Musk’s famous Gigafactory - and they too will be hungry for cobalt. Bram Murton, a geologist with the UK’s National Oceanography Centre, says that if all the cars on Europe’s roads are electric by 2040, and if they use the same kind of batteries as the Tesla Model 3, that would require 28 times more cobalt than is produced right now. At the moment more than 60% of all cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. For decades allegations of corruption and human rights abuses have swirled around parts of its mining industry. Source: The Copper Alliance Last year Amnesty International said there were children as young as seven working in the DRC’s cobalt mines, “in narrow man-made tunnels, at risk of fatal accidents and serious lung disease”. Microsoft, Renault and Huawei were among the companies named as failing to check if their supplies of cobalt involved child labour. They’ve all since promised to improve their systems for checking how cobalt is sourced. Amnesty International has raised concerns about child labour in African cobalt mines Advocates of exploiting the ocean also point to the size of mines on land compared with those that would be operated underwater. Kennecott in Utah and Chuquicamata and Escondida in Chile involve mind-bogglingly large holes in the ground. They stretch nearly three miles across (4km) and reach more than half a mile deep (645m-1200m). By contrast, the Solwara 1 mine, in the waters off Papua New Guinea, will be small – 1150ft (350m) across and 65ft (20m) deep. For Michael Lodge, secretary general of the International Seabed Authority, a UN body set up to manage deep sea mining, there’s a clear case for pressing ahead. “Are we going to continue to develop huge mines that destroy villages, alter rivers, pollute water courses, take thousands of years to restore, remove whole mountains? You don’t have any of that with deep seabed mining.” The first inkling that the ocean floor might hold a treasure trove of minerals came in the late 19th Century when a Royal Navy ship, HMS Challenger, was sent on a pioneering expedition. Instead of exploring the coasts of new lands, the ship was to investigate the oceans themselves. The ship’s scientists discovered the existence of underwater mountains in the Atlantic, as well as establishing the presence of life in the deep. But perhaps their most unexpected find came from the seabed. Scientists aboard the HMS Challenger When the seabed was dredged, the nets brought up teeth from sharks and ear bones from whales but also small rocks. Initially described as “nodular concretions”, and looking a bit like cobblestones, it turned out that vast fields of them were lying on the sand and sediment. In 1877,in a lecture given in Manchester, one of the expedition’s scientists, John Murray, reported that they were made up of manganese, iron and nickel. Later expeditions confirmed that these manganese nodules were scattered across the seabed as far apart as the Pacific and Indian Oceans. By the 1950s, with the world’s population booming, researchers turned their attention to these potential resources. In a book published in 1964, American marine geologist John Mero wrote that the nodules were so plentiful and so rich that even if only 10% of them could be mined, they would keep a world of 20 billion people supplied with key metals for “thousands of years”. At that time the nodules were inaccessible and the prices for the metals weren’t nearly high enough to justify the effort.But Mero had planted a germ of an idea. On 1 November 1967, a UN committee was meeting in New York and the ambassador from the island nation of Malta was invited to speak. Dr Arvid Pardo faced an uphill struggle. He was suggesting that the deep oceans should be reserved for peaceful activities and that the mineral wealth should be shared by all of mankind. Manganese nodules on the bed of the Pacific Ocean Some delegations were already hostile, but Pardo was well prepared and passionate, even lyrical. The dark oceans, he said, “were the womb of life”. He then quoted John Mero’s research into the “astounding” contents of the billions of nodules lying untouched on the seabed – enough aluminium to last 20,000 years, zirconium for 100,000 years and cobalt for 200,000 years. Pardo floated a radical suggestion - a slice of any earnings from deep sea mining would have to go to developing nations. This controversial concept was to be haggled over for decades. But today, Pardo’s vision is becoming reality as the UN’s International Seabed Authority has drawn up maps dividing the ocean into blocks. There are 29 exploration areas, licensed for mineral prospecting for 15 years. In total they stretch over an astonishing 500,000 square miles (1.3m sq km) of seabed in the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. Ventures from 19 different countries have paid for the rights to investigate them. China has four of them. Russia and South Korea each have three. France and Germany have two. And so does the UK, via a company called UK Seabed Resources. The company’s owner, Lockheed Martin, has an interesting connection. It was one of the contractors secretly hired by the CIA to retrieve the Soviet submarine – and it has remained genuinely interested in manganese nodules ever since. Although no-one has yet started mining the ocean floor, dozens of research expeditions are under way “at an intense pace”, says Michael Lodge, from the International Seabed Authority. Based in Jamaica, the ISA must come up with a set of rules before exploitation of the seabed can start in international waters - what environmental controls there will be and how much money will go to poorer countries. Companies digging for minerals close to shore – like those in Papua New Guinea or Japan – need not wait because individual governments can decide what to do in their own territorial waters. No deep sea mine can start operating until the ecology of each zone has been assessed. And the rush to mine has generated something unexpected - a wealth of new information about life in some of the least explored parts of the world. Among those are thousands of new species ranging from sponges to crustaceans. Pedro Martinez, who works at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany, told a conference at London’s Natural History Museum how hundreds of creatures spotted in the depths are completely new to science. “We don’t even have names for these species...there are no books to identify them.” “The abyssal plains,” he asserted, “may have the highest biodiversity in the oceans, maybe the highest biodiversity on the planet.” There’s an emerging scientific consensus that the tracts of ocean floor in line to be mined – whether hydrothermal vents or fields of nodules - are thriving habitats with intricate ecosystems. And they are still largely unknown. Adrian Glover, a marine biologist at the NHM, has an analogy. Imagine trying to survey a rainforest while hovering in a hot air balloon. Making the task harder is a thick fog. And all you can do is lower a bucket at a few random points to drag up the odd branch and lump of soil. “Think of all the things you’d miss,” he says. “That’s what it’s like investigating the deep ocean.” Some prospecting expeditions have not released their findings about marine life, as they’re meant to. And few of the ventures have the funding for biologists to publish detailed results. While Glover is optimistic that mining will not be allowed “in areas where they don’t know what lives there”, he says, “we do need a reasonable understanding and we just haven’t got that yet”. Until the biology is understood, the danger is that species will be wiped out. Hoff crab One example is a type of hairy crab known as the Hoff. It lives in the Longqi – or Dragon’s Breath - hydrothermal vents in the Indian Ocean, an area which China is licensed to explore for minerals. Although it’s similar to crabs elsewhere, this particular variant may be unique. The scaly foot snail is another rare creature only known to live in two spots in the ocean, both of which are licensed for mining. Scaly foot snail While these might not be the most iconic symbols of conservation, they may later prove to have a key ecological role or even a medical application. Some deep sea organisms are known to have high levels of substances that may be useful in combating Alzheimers. So what impact will mining have on marine life? Huge excavators will rumble over the seabed. Either they will tear up hydrothermal vents or they will vacuum up nodules. It will be highly destructive. Michael Lodge admits that but also argues that the areas affected will be tiny compared with the vastness of the oceans – “much less than half a per cent” – and that big areas have been earmarked as reserves to be left untouched. But many biologists wince at the thought of what might happen. Habitats in the path of the machines will obviously be wiped out. And a group of leading marine scientists recently warned of the risks of “unavoidable and possibly irrevocable” losses to biodiversity. Mining will raise plumes of sediment - like clouds of dust from a quarry. This could affect marine life far beyond the mining site. To assess what might happen if nodules are mined, Annemiek Vink and her colleagues at Germany’s Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources ran computer models. They assume that the massive mining machines might be as wide as five bulldozers, side-by-side, advancing over the sea floor. That would stir up as much as 1,000 tonnes of sediment an hour. Within 10 days, she estimates, a thin blanket of dust could settle up to 12km away, smothering everything that lives there.A study released at the NHM conferencesays the effects on the ecosystems would “last many decades”. And with so much uncertainty about the risks to the marine environment, the European Parliament has called for a moratorium on mining until more research is done. We’ve drilled the ocean floor for oil and gas, scarred it with trenches for communications cables, poisoned it with old radioactive waste and chemical weapons, and polluted its remotest corners with a blizzard of discarded plastic. So, is mining a step too far? I put that question to Sir David Attenborough at the launch of his series Blue Planet II. When he sees our video of the giant machines being readied in Papua New Guinea, he is aghast. “It’s heartbreaking,” he says. His greatest concern is for the hydrothermal vents, those delicate mineral-rich chimneys which act as oases for unusual creatures. “That’s where life began, and that we should be destroying these things is so deeply tragic - that humanity should just plough on with no regard for the consequences, because they don’t know what they are.” But there is a vigorous debate among scientists. The geologist Bram Murton has warned of “an ill-informed knee-jerk reaction” to ocean mining which, he says, offers the potential to support a low-carbon future. But Glover says that ultimately it’s about whether it’s right for humans to go into an area and destroy species we know nothing about. All this raises an awkward set of questions. Where should we get our minerals from? Should phones and wind turbines and electric cars carry a label explaining the origins of their raw materials? Tins of tuna state that they are “dolphin-friendly” so should products using cobalt say if the metal was mined on land or in the ocean? What would the best choice be anyway? Should the vents so special to Attenborough be spared and only nodule mining allowed? Some argue that proper recycling of metals would negate the need for deep sea mining in the first place, but others think that that won’t produce a fraction of what’s needed. Time is running out to come up with answers. More than 40 years since the CIA faked a deep sea mining operation, the first genuine ones may start work far sooner than most people realise.

"This video can not be played The rescue was caught on the student police officer's bodycam A police officer who dived 8ft (2.4m) into a freezing river to save a man from drowning said he can't swim. PC Mohammed Nadeem leapt into the River Irwell in Bury, Greater Manchester, on Saturday after a man fell in the water. He said he ""just had to go in"" after seeing the man drowning, and that he spent about 25 minutes in the water after diving in. The student officer's actions were commended by Greater Manchester Police. PC Nadeem said he did not think about how cold or deep the water was nor about taking his heavy body armour off when he saw the man in distress. ""I can't swim. I'm not a good swimmer at all and having all the extra body gear was very hard but somehow I got to him... and we got to the side and waited for help. ""It was very dangerous but I just had to go in... seeing this man drowning I just couldn't wait."" PC Nadeem said he ""just had to go in"" to rescue the man from drowning The whole incident was captured on PC Nadeem's body camera. The fire service then helped the pair up a ladder to safety and they were taken to hospital for treatment. PC Nadeem said: ""I was really cold, my legs were shaking. I couldn't really talk much because we were in the water for about 25 minutes. ""It was absolutely freezing."" Supt Rick Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police said: ""Without hesitation, PC Nadeem dived off an eight foot drop into freezing, deep and fast moving water."" He said this was ""a prime example of why people join the force - to protect people and make sure they are away from harm"". He added that PC Nadeem has now been nicknamed ""The Hoff"" by his colleagues. QUIZ: Which Black Panther character are you?

"Great Ormond Street Hospital has indicated that it may change its mind about returning donations from a scandal-hit charity. The hospital had said it would hand back money previously given to it by the Presidents Club Charitable Trust. The decision followed allegations of sexual harassment at a men-only Presidents Club dinner. The charity has since closed down, making it difficult to return the Â£530,000 previously donated. The final decision on what to do with the money will be made at a meeting of hospital charity trustees on 27 March. In a statement, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Children's Charity said: ""Guiding all our thinking is our aim to maximise the support to the hospital and the families it cares for. ""We can confirm that we are in discussions with the Charity Commission and are scheduled to meet them later this week. ""Following this meeting and taking into account the latest developments with the Presidents Club Charitable Trust and feedback from our supporters, we will consider our position at our March Trustee meeting."" Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims Are charities allowed to return money? GOSH did not receive any money from the controversial dinner, held at the Dorchester Hotel in London on 18 January. However, it had been a beneficiary of three earlier Presidents Club events that took place between 2009 and 2016. On 24 January, a hospital spokeswoman said that ""due to the wholly unacceptable nature of the event"", previous donations would be returned. However, some of its other donors reportedly objected to the hospital's stance and are said to have threatened not to give it any more money in the future.

"A meat supplier being investigated by the Food Standards Agency has fallen into administration with the loss of almost 270 jobs. KPMG has been appointed as administrators to Derby-based Russell Hume Limited. Its meat products were recalled last month and chains including Wetherspoon took them off their menus. The FSA said its investigation concerned Russell Hume's failure to comply with food hygiene regulations. The firm's directors called the decision to call in administrators ""heartbreaking"", but said the regulator's action had ""created impossible trading conditions for us"". Chris Pole, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said the recent product recall and halt in operations had resulted in a customer exodus. Wetherspoon's meat supplier probed over food hygiene Russell Hume recall 'centres on use-by dates' As there was little prospect of production restarting, he said a total of 266 people had been made redundant. ""Our priority over the coming days will be to work with all affected employees to provide the assistance they need in claiming monies owed from the Redundancy Payments Office,"" Mr Pole said. ""We will also be seeking buyers for the business and its assets. Any interested parties are advised to contact us as soon as possible."" Russell Hume's directors said they would continue to work with the FSA over the issues it had raised, but added: ""We still feel its action has been out of all proportion to the concerns it says it has identified. ""The fact that its investigations have become industry-wide and a number of other firms have also had issues strongly suggests there is a lack of clarity in the industry and in current FSA guidelines. ""Prior to this, we had a long, unblemished record for supplying quality meat products."" The FSA said its investigation into the company was continuing and that it had taken ""proportionate action based on serious and widespread problems"". ""We do not take these decisions lightly and we recognise this will be a worrying time for employees and their families,"" a spokesman said. ""It is for food businesses to ensure the food they produce is safe and our role is to provide assurances that a business is meeting its responsibilities."" Russell Hume supplied meat to a range of hotels, restaurants and pubs across the UK and had six production sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Boroughbridge, Exeter and Fife.

"Rescue helicopters have been hit by bad weather high in the Zagros mountain range Search and rescue teams are continuing to look for an Iranian plane that crashed in bad weather on Sunday. Local government officials reported that the wreckage had been found, but a Red Crescent official later said there was no evidence of this. A civil aviation official was also unable to confirm the reports. The Aseman Airlines passenger plane came down in the Zagros mountains on Sunday, and all 66 people on board are feared to have been killed. Hundreds of mountaineers with dogs and drones are trying to reach the site, in bad conditions. Due to fog and strong winds, helicopters that were deployed for the search at dawn on Monday have had to be grounded, a Red Crescent official told local media. And on Sunday, teams had to stop work altogether due to winds and snow. Air disasters timeline 2017: Safest year for air travel The ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop was travelling from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later in the Mount Dena area, about 22km (14 miles) from its destination. All 66 people on board the Iranian plane are feared dead On Monday officials from the region told news channels rescuers had reached the site. But both channels - IRINN and English-language Press TV - said they could not confirm the reports independently. Later, a civil aviation spokesman told Reuters news agency the reports could not be confirmed, and then a Red Crescent official said there was ""no reliable news"" that the wreckage had been found. The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Following the crash, the airline initially said that all on board had died, but later on Sunday said that it could not confirm this as no-one had reached the site. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the accident ""saddened the hearts"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.

"Sarah Rees was made redundant while on maternity leave with her daughter Caitlin, now four Sarah Rees was working for a large charity when she fell pregnant with her first child and took maternity leave. She was keen to return to work quickly, but her attempts to contact her employer were met with silence. Eventually she was made redundant, and she could not afford to take the case to a tribunal. Ms Rees says her experience is not uncommon, and a new report says many employers still live in the ""dark ages"" when it comes to recruiting women. In apoll for the Equality and Human Rights Commission,external(EHRC), 36% of employers thought it reasonable to ask a woman about her plans to have children. Some 59% agreed that a woman should have to disclose during the recruitment process whether she is pregnant. The commission said the poll of 1,106 male and female decision-makers showed worrying attitudes. Ms Rees, who lives in Cardiff, said she wanted to return to work when her daughter was 12 weeks old: ""I loved my job,"" she says. She emailed the organisation but did not receive a reply. She then popped into the office one day. She says the atmosphere was ""very cold and icy"" and there was ""no comment"" when she said she wanted to talk about returning. ""Because no-one had contacted me I did things like I looked at the company website and I realised that I had been removed from the list of staff, so things started to add up and I realised I wasn't wanted any more,"" she told the BBC. MPs pressure City firms over diversity Google sued over 'male discrimination' More mothers with young children have jobs The position was driven home when a trustee contacted her because she was concerned the charity was discussing Ms Rees' redundancy without her knowledge. Ms Rees did receive a formal notice of redundancy, but she decided against going to an employment tribunal because at the time she would have had to pay for it and she could not afford it. ""Also I didn't want to go into anything so difficult when I was already in a very stressful time, being a new mum,"" she says. She says her experience is not uncommon. She now runs her own business helping women get back into the workplace and she says she heard of ""plenty"" of other people who have had similar experiences. The EHRC said its study showed that many employers needed more support to better understand the basics of discrimination law and the rights of pregnant women and new mothers. EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: ""It is a depressing reality that, when it comes the rights of pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace, we are still living in the dark ages. ""We should all know very well that it is against the law not to appoint a woman because she is pregnant or might become pregnant. ""Yet we also know women routinely get asked questions around family planning in interviews."" Other findings from the YouGov survey of small, medium and large firms included: 46% of employers agreed it was reasonable to ask women if they have young children during the recruitment process 44% agree women should work for an organisation for at least a year before deciding to have children About one third believe that women who become pregnant and new mothers in work are ""generally less interested in career progression"" 41% of employers agreed that pregnancy in the workplace puts ""an unnecessary cost burden"" on the workplace 51% agree there is sometimes resentment towards women who are pregnant or on maternity leave The EHRC said its survey revealed antiquated beliefs, including two out of five employers saying women who have had more than one child while in the same job can be a ""burden"" to their team. The EHRC wants companies to sign up to its Working Forward initiative which aims to stamp out pregnancy and maternity discrimination. Member firms, which include Nationwide, Royal Mail and Transport for London, are given advice and help to improve in areas such as flexible working and employee confidence. Ms Rees, whose second child is now aged one, advises women to make sure that they discuss clearly with their employer how they want to go back to work and to ""join your trade union, because it's something that I didn't, because thinking I was working for a charity that I'd be protected"".

"Victims Chris Unsworth (front left) and Steve Walters (front right) arrive at Liverpool Crown Court for the sentencing Some of the victims of the former football coach, Barry Bennell, have faced him in court as the sentencing of the convicted paedophile begins. Bennell, 64, who worked at Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra, will be sentenced for 50 counts of child sexual abuseagainst 12 boys aged eight to 15,between 1979 and 1991. Gary Cliffe, abused by Bennell hundreds of times, confronted him to ask: ""Why?"" Another victim said Bennell ""took his one and only childhood"". Bennell remained impassive in the dock, staring at the floor, as victims' statements were read. He was ordered to attend Liverpool Crown Court for the hearing, having previously appeared via video-link throughout the five-week trial due to illness. One statement, from a man abused when he was aged 12-13, said: ""I did not want it, did not ask for it. That monster decided it was fun to use me as a sex toy."" Barry Bennell: A cruel and arrogant paedophile A mother's horror at son's sexual abuse Who is Barry Bennell? Crewe 'brushed scandal under carpet' Chris Unsworth, who was also abused, said in a statement read to the court that Bennell had ""destroyed all of my childhood dreams of becoming a professional footballer"". Addressing Bennell, Mr Unsworth continued: ""You may have stolen my childhood and impacted my relationships but you have by no means ruined my life... you are nothing."" Bennell worked for Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City's youth teams Mr Cliffe said in his statement that he looked back at his childhood with ""regret and deep sadness"" because of Bennell. ""I simply did not have the vocabulary or know how to disclose the abuse that happened to me weekly and daily during the school holidays,"" he said. ""I have suffered mental health issues for over 30 years now, wrestling with my irrational thoughts, anxiety attacks, nerves and will most likely be on medication for the rest of my life."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Victim Micky Fallon is among those in court. Speaking ahead of sentencing, he told the BBC: ""This man does not deserve to walk in society. ""I feel like the impact on my football career was pretty damning. The impact that you carry with you - carrying this dirty secret - is quite devastating."" Mr Fallon said that during his early 20s he turned to alcohol which cumulated in an attempt to take his own life. Bennell was previously convicted of of child abuse on three occasions.

"Falder set up cameras in the bathrooms of his family homes A university lecturer who blackmailed people he met online into sending him degrading photos including acts of paedophilia has been jailed for 32 years. Dr Matthew Falder's conviction is thought to be the first UK prosecution related to sadistic ""hurtcore"" material located on the dark web. It follows a four-year, worldwide investigation involving security services from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Europe. Falder was, on the surface, a Cambridge-educated academic with a good job, family and friends. His Twitter feed revealed a love of dinosaurs, baking, table-tennis and 3D-printing, featuring selfies, crossword puzzles and innocuous questions about how to ""put nice quality videos online?"" Yet, behind the scenes, he operated under anonymous usernames on the dark web to share videos and images of paedophilia, blackmailing victims into sending him horrific material he would then pass on to other offenders. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the 29-year-old simply enjoyed inflicting pain, describing him as one of the most prolific and depraved offenders they had ever encountered. They estimate he had more than 50 victims over a period of eight years from 2009 to 2017. A ""sadistic and manipulative"" man, Falder admitted 137 charges out of the 188 against him, ranging from encouraging the rape of a four-year-old to possessing a paedophile manual. This video can not be played ""Worst internet offender I've ever seen"" Watch experts discuss Falder One of the officers involved in hunting Falder down, Will Kerr, of the NCA, said in all his 28 years of policing he had never encountered a more ""dangerous individual"". Supervising senior investigations officer Scott Crabb, of Homeland Security in the US, described him as a ""monster"" and ""pure evil"". He said: ""Falder is absolutely the worst child exploitation and blackmail offender I have ever seen."" Falder was caught thanks to the culmination of work by agents which first began in the United States in 2013, as the FBI worked to expose users of dark web paedophilia sites. Specialists built their own websites on the servers which hosted the offending sites to track what was being said and done on them. In doing so, they were able to access the so-called hurtcore communities who are defined by their sharing of images of rape, murder, sadism, torture, paedophilia, blackmail and humiliation. 'Hurt 2 The Core', described by the NCA as ""the world's worst website"", was one such site. A user known only as ""Inthegarden"" posted blackmail pictures of a teenage girl. The user was tracked online and found to have also made posts on online marketplace Gumtree. Falder was known as ""666devil"" and ""evilmind"" on the dark web There, the suspect approached potential victims by masquerading as a depressed female artist. He went by the names Liz, Jess and Shona to lure victims into talking to him, using at least 30 different email addresses encrypted via services which originated in Russia. He promised hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds, which he never paid, for naked or partially-clothed images of people. After building a rapport with them, he would obtain their personal information and immediately move the conversation away from Gumtree's servers. His victims would then be blackmailed into sending increasingly horrific images, with Falder threatening to send them to friends and relatives if they did not submit to his demands. Victims as young as 14 years old were told to strip naked, write racist and homophobic messages on signs and take pictures of themselves with them. Others were forced to lick toilet seats and used tampons as well as eat dog food. Some were forced to pose in their school uniforms. These images were then posted on hurtcore forums where they could be seen by countless members of global child sex abuse networks. Not only this, but the suspect also offered advice to other paedophiles on how to evade capture, suggesting they avoid using money but instead use ""vouchers to get kids to trust you"". Many of the suspect's UK victims reported abuse by Inthegarden to police, but there was not enough evidence to identify who was behind the username. Then in April 2015, the NCA discovered someone posting under the username ""666devil"". 666devil used a picture of a young girl as his icon on the forum, claiming she was his ""daughter"". He said he planned to ""torture"" her during what he dubbed ""hell week"" and requested ideas from members about what he could do to her. Officers scrambled to identify the girl in the profile image, accessing the user's webmail accounts to find out who she was and protect her. That was when they realised 666devil, evilmind and Inthegarden were the same person, and that whoever they were, they had approached more than 200 victims worldwide, including victims living in the US. However, at this stage, there was still not enough intelligence to identify the suspect. A special taskforce involving the NCA, GCHQ, Homeland Security Investigations in the US, the Australian Federal Police and Europol - as well as law enforcement in Israel and Slovenia - was set up specifically to ""enhance evidence gathering against the suspect"". It proved to be successful as, by the end of March 2017, intelligence linked a person of interest to an address in Birmingham. Falder was identified as the suspect in April and placed under covert surveillance for three months. He was filmed on the train, using his laptop. NCA officer Matthew Long said Falder was a ""highly manipulative"" and ""sadistic"" man who boasted he would never be caught. However, he could no longer evade justice and on 21 June last year plain clothes officers were deployed to capture him, arresting him at his workplace. He was handcuffed in his office at the University of Birmingham, with footage from the arrest revealing how he described the charges against him as the ""rap sheet from hell"". Two of Falder's devices were immediately seized, revealing what the NCA called ""significant evidence"". They showed that Falder's offending went back to 2009, when he was a 21-year-old student. Police found these early voyeurism offences in fact took place at a total of eight locations, involving 13 victims. Falder was questioned by police over three days, during which he largely refused to comment but did admit to controlling the evilmind account. Falder's bedroom was raided following his arrest Falder's computer was seized by officers who found information on it was heavily encrypted His home in Harborne Park Road, Edgbaston, was raided, revealing a chaotic student-like living space, an untidy bedroom with laundry, old pizza boxes and coins scattered across the carpet. A desktop computer and laptop were also found, surrounded by drawers of tools and masses of wires stuffed into bulging plastic containers. Officers found information on the devices often had double layers of encryption. Throughout June and August of last year, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) worked with authorities in the US, eventually deciding to prosecute Falder in the UK. He admitted and was charged with 137 offences in October last year, making him one of the country's most prolific paedophiles, according to BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw. A further 51 charges remain on file. August 2013 - FBI begins its investigation into dark web paedophilia sites, identifying user known as Inthegarden and passing files to the NCA April 2015 - The NCA investigate 666devil with ""daughter"" icon posting on a dark web forum. Officers discover links between 666devil, evilmind and Inthegarden while seeking to ""safeguard"" the girl August 2015 - Suspect's webmail accounts are accessed, identifying the girl in his profile and further US victims. Taskforce set up between NCA, GCHQ, Homeland Security, Europol and Australian Federal Police March 2017 - ""Person of interest"" identified at an address in Birmingham April 2017 - Falder identified as the suspect June 2017 - Falder arrested while at work at the University of Birmingham. Devices seized and Edgbaston home raided. Three days of questioning reveals Falder is behind 666devil June to October 2017 - Falder admits to and is charged with 137 offences. A further 51 remain on file Documents released by the CPS and the NCA show that during Falder's near-decade of offending, his multiple victims included boys, girls, men and women. Ruona Iguyovwe, of the CPS, said: ""He sought out his innocent victims on Gumtree and even targeted victims on pro-anorexia websites."" To get what he wanted, Falder posed as a teenage girl on these websites to obtain images of six girls. Ms Iguyovwe added: ""He enjoyed humiliating his victims."" Some victims said since coming into contact with him they had attempted suicide multiple times. Others said they would never get over what happened, that they would always feel ""dirty, like used goods"". Matthew Falder's case raises further questions about how police can stay one step ahead of those with such an advanced technical knowledge that they're able to exploit the most vulnerable and expose them. He was a manipulative person whose prime motivation was power and control.  He wanted his victims to feel embarrassed and humiliated. His in-depth knowledge of the internet meant he could post obscene photos in a space only visible to a restricted audience. The National Crime Agency worked with its international partners to identify the man behind the pseudonyms but he managed to carry out his crimes for several years without detection. A mother, who gave Falder photographs of her daughter, said: ""I was physically ill when I found out that my child's image had been coerced from me and was so shook up that I was in no fit state to go into work. ""I feel as if I failed my daughter massively by being too trusting, as it is my job as her mum to protect her and I put her in danger. ""That will never go away and it is something I have to live with and struggle with the guilt for the rest of my life."" Clinical and forensic psychologist Kirsty Lowe said Falder took pleasure from torturing his victims. ""He refers to enjoyment,"" she said. ""He said he enjoys seeing the reluctant look on her face, seeing how far he could push the person."" Other victims are of course unable to speak for themselves, as Falder shared images of baby torture, Birmingham Crown Court was told. A spokesman for website Gumtree said it maintained strong relationships with law enforcement and had given its ""full support and co-operation to the NCA in their investigation of this case"". Senior investigations officer for the NCA, Matt Sutton, said that Falder's ""victim targeting"" showed ""organisation and advanced manipulation"". He added: ""His primary motivation was for power, control, suffering and humiliation. Believing he had superior intellectual and computational abilities, he was confident that he could outwit law enforcement. ""There is little doubt that Falder would have continued his offending, causing untold pain and distress to many other vulnerable people."" GCHQ said it was ""an horrific case"" and that the hearts of its staff ""go out to the victims"". ""GCHQ is determined to use our expertise to counter this type of terrible online child sexual abuse."" Steven Wilson, head of department for the European Cybercrime Centre at Europol, said he was ""proud to have been able to have contributed to bringing this offender to justice"".

"This video can not be played ""Angry, sad, disappointed and hungry"": We talk to KFC customers KFC has closed more than half of its 900 UK outlets after delivery problems meant they ran out of chicken. Last week, the fried chicken chain switched its delivery contract to DHL, which blamed ""operational issues"" for the supply disruption. It was unclear when the delivery problems would be rectified, a KFC spokesperson said. Workers are being encouraged to take holiday but would not be forced to do so, he added. ""Our teams are working flat out all hours to get the rest back up and running as soon as possible - but it's too early to say how long it will take to clear the backlog."" KFC has set up aweb page,externalwhere ""fans"" can find their nearest outlet that is still open. It said that in the restaurants owned by the chain, staff on short-term contracts would be paid the average hours worked per day over the past 12 weeks, while those on salaries would be paid as normal. However, 80% of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. ""Franchisees will be seeking their own independent advice, but we're encouraging them to adopt this policy too,"" said the chain.

Until last Tuesday, KFC's chicken was delivered by South African-owned distribution group Bidvest, which describes itself as ""the leading supplier of logistical and supply chain solutions to the UK hospitality and restaurant sector"". But after the change in the contract, many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. ""The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants,"" KFC said on Twitter. ""We've brought a new delivery partner onboard, but they've had a couple of teething problems - getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex!"" it added, apologising to customers for the inconvenience. ""We won't compromise on quality, so no deliveries has meant some of our restaurants are closed, and others are operating a limited menu or shortened hours."" The statement listedKFC restaurants that were still open,externaldespite the problems. The distribution network uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL). DHL said: ""Due to operational issues, a number of deliveries in recent days have been incomplete or delayed. We are working with our partners, KFC and QSL, to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience."" The GMB union said it had tried to warn KFC that switching from Bidvest to DHL was a mistake. The change led to 255 job losses and the closure of a Bidvest depot, said Mick Rix, GMB national officer. He said: ""Bidvest are specialists - a food distribution firm with years of experience. DHL are scratching around for any work they can get, and undercut them. ""KFC are left with hundreds of restaurants closed while DHL try and run the whole operation out of one distribution centre. Three weeks ago, KFC knew they had made a terrible mistake, but by then it was too late."" One KFC customer, Claire, told BBC Radio 5 live she was surprised when she went out with her children at the weekend. ""We went on Saturday night to our local KFC in Luton and queued for about 20 minutes in the drive-thru, about 15 cars in the queue, and when we got to the actual counter and asked for our standard family bucket, we were told there was no chicken,"" she said. ""The kids, who are nine-year-old twins, they wanted chicken and clearly it wasn't available, so we said there's nothing available that we wanted, and we then had the joy of queuing to get back out again."" Other disgruntled KFC customers have been taking to Twitter to express their dismay at the shortages. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The note was left on an ambulance in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent A 26-year-old woman has been arrested afteran abusive note was left on an ambulance dealing with a 999 call. The handwritten message, in which the writer said she did not care ""if the whole street collasped [sic]"", was left in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, on Sunday. Staffordshire Police said the incident was not reported, but the force took action after seeing details on Twitter. Ch Insp John Owen tweeted: ""Emergency services must be able to carry out their roles without fear of abuse."" Midlands Live: Dark web paedophile jailed for 32 years; 'illicit activities' shut woods car park The woman, from Tunstall, was arrested on suspicion of public order offences and remains in police custody. Mike Duggan, operational manager from the West Midlands Ambulance Service, said the paramedics also received verbal abuse as well as the note. ""This is not solely about the note,"" Staffordshire Police said, ""the arrest related to matters of verbal abuse."" The note, which was left on the parked ambulance, read: ""If this van is for anyone but Number 14 then you have no right to be parked here."" The note ended by saying: ""Now move your van from outside my house."" Mr Duggan told the BBC he thinks people who abuse emergency staff need to be dealt with more ""robustly"". ""What is it going to take? Is one of us going to have to die before they take it seriously?"" he said.

"University tuition fees in England have become a political battleground - with renewed calls that they should be scrapped. When they were increased a few years ago to Â£9,000 they became a literal battleground, with activists clashing with police on the streets around Westminster. Now they are going to rise again. But what has the impact of higher fees been? Have they cut student numbers? And are they worth the money? Students in England leave university with higher debts than almost anywhere else in the developed world,the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week. Charging Â£9,250 a year for an undergraduate degree makes England a real outlier by international standards. It's even an outlier in the UK, where Scotland has no fees for Scottish students, and fees in Wales and Northern Ireland are much lower. Much of Europe still sticks with low fees or no fees - and Germany, which used to charge fees, has scrapped them. There are also lower costs in many European countries where many more students live at home. The only country with comparable fees is the United States. But the US is not a straightforward comparison because courses are four years rather than three and any ""average"" covers a hugely diverse market. Top private colleges can charge more than Â£30,000 per year while state colleges can charge local students less than fees in England. Tuition fees have been abolished in German universities The University of Washington has lower annual fees than the University of Wolverhampton and until the pound's value slipped, fees would have been cheaper at UCLA in California than UCLAN in Preston. In New York state, with a population bigger than many European countries, fees are being scrapped for families earning less than about Â£100,000. But there is another very important aspect to all this - England's system requires no money up front and repayment depends on earning at least Â£21,000. Not in the long term. Student numbers have increased relentlessly, regardless of funding changes, fees and economic ups and downs. It represents a huge aspirational demand for higher education. It's easy to forget what a massive change this represents. In 1980, there were only 68,000 people starting university - this autumn there will be more than 500,000. Twice as many people are now getting a degree as were getting five O-levels in the early 1980s. Applications have dipped only three times - on each occasion when fees were introduced or increased - but they have always recovered. And one of the main arguments in favour of fees has been that such wide access is unsustainable unless students make a contribution to the cost. In the early 1980s only about one in six young people could expect to go to university - now, for girls at least, it's over half. Students from all backgrounds are more likely to go to university than ever before - including the poorest. There are different ways of identifying disadvantaged students - either living in areas where few people go to university, having been eligible for free meals at school or under measures of multiple deprivation. And they all show the same pattern - more of these youngsters are going to university, with the numbers rising through the years of fee increases. But there is another important dimension to this. Poorer youngsters are still much less likely to go to university than their better-off classmates. There is a brutal economic symmetry to this. Each upward notch in affluence is linked to a higher entry rate into university. There are also significant cross-currents of gender and geography.Women are 35% more likely to go to university than men, and youngsters in London are more likely to go to university than anywhere else in the UK. There are ethnic differences too, withpoor white men, in places such as north-east England, the least likely to get university places. A tuition fees protest, London 2015 Fees are going up to Â£9,250 and interest rates on loans are rising to 6.1%, which will push up average student debt on graduation to more than Â£50,000, including maintenance loans. The clock on interest charges starts ticking as soon as students begin their course - and it means that they will have run up Â£5,800 in interest charges before they have even left university. A high-earning graduate could pay back Â£40,000 in interest charges, on top of repaying the amount they have borrowed. These figures could go even higher. Interest rates are linked to inflation and if that begins to rise, then so will the amount charged for repayments. The rapid increase in tuition fees - trebling in 2006 and then trebling again in 2012 - means that the amount of outstanding debt has soared. The figures from the Student Loans Company show the debt level has almost doubled in four years and will continue to climb if fee levels and interest rates rise further. But about three-quarters of students will not repay their debts in full before the 30-year limit when the loans are written off. The government wants tosell off student debt to private investorsand has begun looking for a buyer for pre-2012 loans. If this is achieved it will mean another big step away from the idea of universities receiving direct public funding. At most universities, no matter what course you are following, the level of fee is likely to be the same flat rate of Â£9,000 (soon to be Â£9,250). But the cost of delivering costs is going to vary widely. Science courses need more expensive equipment and courses such as medicine are going to get much more teaching time and personal instruction. As the chart shows, subjects such as history will have significantly fewer classroom hours. But there is no recognition of this in the fees system. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, raising fees to Â£9,000 brought universities 25% more funding per student. But for arts and humanities, they made an extra 47% on each student. Students say university value for money is falling Students face sharp rise in interest rates Student loan debt up for private sale A lack of teaching hours - and a lack of information about how tuition fees are spent - are among the factors that have seen a plunging level of students thinking they're getting value for money. The chart shows an annual tracking of student attitudes, which in recent years has seen asteady fall in satisfied customersand a rising level of discontent. Five years ago, 53% of students across the UK thought university was ""good"" or ""very good"" value - but this has now slumped to its lowest level of 35%. Students getting more hours and with expectations of high future earnings, such as medicine, were most likely to think they were getting good value for money. Least convinced about the value were business and social studies students. The Higher Education Policy Institute, which carried out the survey, says the quality of teaching is a key factor in perceptions of value. Everyone has heard a story about someone getting a degree and then ending up in a job that didn't need such qualifications. And there are stories of millionaires who never bothered with college. But all the evidence suggests a relentless link between level of qualifications and future earnings. As the chart shows, that is the case at every level of education. According to the OECD, there is no sign that the increase in graduates will take away the financial advantage. Having a degree means better pay and a lower likelihood of being unemployed. And the stories about maverick billionaires who never went to college are the exception rather than the rule, as an analysis of billionaires' education showed that they are usually highly educated andmore likely to have two degrees than no degree. The question of ""value"" from a degree isn't just about a monetary return. There's a much wider social and cultural dimension. But even in narrow financial terms, the relationship between the cost of fees and earnings is not straightforward. For example, there are big differences in the future average earnings between people who studied for medicine and those who took media degrees, even though the annual fee might have been the same. Medical students pay the same as arts students although their projected earnings are often far higher Degrees from top-ranking universities can also convert into greater earning power and class of degree is another factor. And any calculation of financial return on fees will be a combination of factors - what you studied, where you studied and the current demand in the jobs market. The political attention over tuition fees has focused on the impact on young people taking undergraduate, full-time degrees. But the biggest change, often overlooked, has been the collapse in part-time students. These were often adults with other responsibilities who were more sensitive to increased costs. And the recession saw a big reduction in firms willing to pay for their staff to take qualifications. There have been repeated warnings from industry about a skills gap, but there are few signs of any recovery in part-time student numbers. 10 charts that show what's gone wrong with social care 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble 10 charts demonstrating the impact of the smoking ban Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Data research by Eleanor Lawrie and Catherine Bean Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"The level of fees and debt for students is going to be the subject of a major review More ""variety"" is needed in the price of university education, the secretary of state said ahead of a government review of the system. Damian Hinds also suggested tuition fees should reflect each degree's value ""to our society as a whole"". It comes as a committee of MPs said there was no justification for such ""high interest rates"" on student loans. Labour said another review would not solve the problems posed by interest rate increases and fee rises. A day of reckoning for tuition fees? 10 charts showing the effect of tuition fees The review, to be launched by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, will consider cutting or freezing Â£9,250 tuition fees and lowering interest rates to reduce levels of graduate debt. There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hinds would not go into specifics about the review, which he said would be carried out by an independent panel. Damian Hinds became education secretary in January's reshuffle He defended the current system - under which students begin to repay fees when they earn over Â£21,000, rising to Â£25,000. But he said that when it was devised, ministers had not expected so many courses to be charging the same fee. ""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing - the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future,"" he said. He said politicians would not be setting the price of different courses, but added: ""What we are doing in the review is looking at how that system works, making sure there are alternatives, making sure there is more variety."" This could include cheaper ways of delivering university education like shorter courses and part-time study, he said. Mr Hinds' predecessor as education secretary, Conservative MP Justine Greening, said student finance should not be a ""political football"" and warned against the issue being ""kicked into the long grass"" with a review. She predicted the review would face a ""challenge"" in trying to work out which degrees were most beneficial to the country. Labour's education spokeswoman Angela Rayner said the government had announced three reviews of tuition fees in 12 months and that another one would not ""solve the problem of the hike in interest rates which this government has done and the tripling of tuition fees"". BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan This might have been heralded as taking an axe to tuition fees, but in practice it sounds more like prudent pruning. Damian Hinds has signalled that university fees and student debts in England are much higher than anyone really expected when the current system was introduced in 2012. The forthcoming review will look for ways to push down the cost - such as lowering interest rates, restoring maintenance grants or reducing fees for some courses. The most definite impact for students is that tuition fees are not going above Â£9,250 any time soon, and the freeze on fees could continue indefinitely. But there is no sign of any radical cutting of the headline figure for fees or pressure for a fundamentally different system. And Mr Hinds seemed to play down suggestions of any intervention from ministers to set different fee levels for sciences, arts and humanities. On schools, Mr Hinds has positioned himself as a pragmatic traditionalist. He's supportive of grammar schools - but there are no plans for any new grammars to be opened. And he will revive the prime minister's stalled plan to allow more free schools to be set up by faith groups. According to the Treasury select committee, the review should reconsider the level of interest rates and whether these charges should be applied when students are still studying. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that students in England will run up more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university. Former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarke have allraised concerns about the level of interest charges. Nicky Morgan says there is no convincing reason for such high interest charges on loans for fees There is also a call to consider reinstating maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, after these were abolished last year. Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, warned that the maintenance loans available to students were not enough to cover all their living costs. ""If a student can't access additional sources of income, they may be priced out of university,"" said the committee chairman. The MPs are also asking for a clearer explanation of why such a high level of tuition fee is necessary. The review of fees, first promised in the autumn by the prime minister, will examine whether students are paying a fair amount, whether it is the most efficient way of funding universities and whether students are getting value for money when they are graduating with an average of Â£50,000 in debt. It will also consider the funding of the broader post-18 education system and whether students not on three-year degree courses are getting enough support. Part-time student numbers fell sharply after the last fees increase - and the Treasury Select Committee has called on the review to find ways to reverse this. Peter Horrocks, vice-chancellor of the Open University, said the committee of MPs ""rightly recognised that part-time students have been the real victims of the 2012 reforms"". ""The collapse in part-time student numbers in England is undermining attempts to tackle the skills crisis in the economy,"" said Mr Horrocks. Day of reckoning for tuition fees?

"Two hikers were also hurt in an avalanche in Switzerland over the weekend A father and daughter have been killed in an avalanche while skiing in the French Alps, rescue officials say. The man, 43, and his 11-year-old daughter were from the Paris region and disappeared on a slope in the Pisaillas glacier area of the Val d'IsÃ¨re resort. The area had been closed because of the avalanche risk, officials said. The pair were found on Sunday at an altitude of about 2,930m (9,670 ft). A cross-country skier was also killed in a separate incident in the region. Authorities have launched an investigation into why the father and daughter were skiing in an area determined to be at risk after rescue services warned skiers to stay on marked slopes. Their disappearance on Sunday sparked large-scale search operations involving helicopters and rescue teams from the High Mountain Police. They were discovered in the early afternoon in a hollow surrounded by cliffs.

"This video can not be played ""Angry, sad, disappointed and hungry"": We talk to KFC customers KFC has closed more than half of its 900 UK outlets after delivery problems meant they ran out of chicken. Last week, the fried chicken chain switched its delivery contract to DHL, which blamed ""operational issues"" for the supply disruption. It was unclear when the delivery problems would be rectified, a KFC spokesperson said. Workers are being encouraged to take holiday but would not be forced to do so, he added. ""Our teams are working flat out all hours to get the rest back up and running as soon as possible - but it's too early to say how long it will take to clear the backlog."" KFC has set up aweb page,externalwhere ""fans"" can find their nearest outlet that is still open. It said that in the restaurants owned by the chain, staff on short-term contracts would be paid the average hours worked per day over the past 12 weeks, while those on salaries would be paid as normal. However, 80% of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. ""Franchisees will be seeking their own independent advice, but we're encouraging them to adopt this policy too,"" said the chain.

Until last Tuesday, KFC's chicken was delivered by South African-owned distribution group Bidvest, which describes itself as ""the leading supplier of logistical and supply chain solutions to the UK hospitality and restaurant sector"". But after the change in the contract, many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. ""The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants,"" KFC said on Twitter. ""We've brought a new delivery partner onboard, but they've had a couple of teething problems - getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex!"" it added, apologising to customers for the inconvenience. ""We won't compromise on quality, so no deliveries has meant some of our restaurants are closed, and others are operating a limited menu or shortened hours."" The statement listedKFC restaurants that were still open,externaldespite the problems. The distribution network uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL). DHL said: ""Due to operational issues, a number of deliveries in recent days have been incomplete or delayed. We are working with our partners, KFC and QSL, to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience."" The GMB union said it had tried to warn KFC that switching from Bidvest to DHL was a mistake. The change led to 255 job losses and the closure of a Bidvest depot, said Mick Rix, GMB national officer. He said: ""Bidvest are specialists - a food distribution firm with years of experience. DHL are scratching around for any work they can get, and undercut them. ""KFC are left with hundreds of restaurants closed while DHL try and run the whole operation out of one distribution centre. Three weeks ago, KFC knew they had made a terrible mistake, but by then it was too late."" One KFC customer, Claire, told BBC Radio 5 live she was surprised when she went out with her children at the weekend. ""We went on Saturday night to our local KFC in Luton and queued for about 20 minutes in the drive-thru, about 15 cars in the queue, and when we got to the actual counter and asked for our standard family bucket, we were told there was no chicken,"" she said. ""The kids, who are nine-year-old twins, they wanted chicken and clearly it wasn't available, so we said there's nothing available that we wanted, and we then had the joy of queuing to get back out again."" Other disgruntled KFC customers have been taking to Twitter to express their dismay at the shortages. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Liam was helped near the G&J building before walking towards a local park The family of a man who disappeared during a stag party in Germany have revealed details of his first confirmed sighting. Liam Colgan, from Inverness, has been missing for more than a week following the party for his brother Eamonn. The sighting was a short time after the group had last seen him in the Veermaster Bar in Hamburg on Saturday 10 February. The family said this creates new lines of inquiry that are now being followed. CCTV footage seen by the family shows Liam arriving at the vehicle barrier of G&J building in Baumwall, Hamburg, at about 02:20. A witness reports seeing the 29-year-old and helping him up some steps to the main entrance of that building after he fell. This was corroborated by the CCTV. The footage goes on to show Liam trying unsuccessfully to get in to the building, before walking towards the Michelwiese Park. Liam walked towards Michelwiese Park before going towards the Portuguese Quarter He is helped again by the same witness to get into this park, and is last seen heading towards the Portuguese quarter at about 02:30. Liam's family are now receiving support from the Lucie Blackman Trust, set up to help families whose loved ones have gone missing or died abroad. Chief executive Matt Searle said: ""There have been a few people coming forward thinking they have seen him but this is the first one that has been confirmed by the family as being Liam. ""It is only about an hour or so after he was last seen but the family sees this as positive. ""It gives them an idea of where he was going."" As the search for Liam Colgan entered its second week, his family urged the public to continue their support. Liam's brother Eamonn last night confirmed a body pulled from the River Elbe on Sunday was not his sibling. He said his family had been encouraged by sightings of a ""confused Scotsman"" wandering the city of Hamburg and asked for help to ""bring Liam home"". Liam Colgan is the best man and planned the trip to Germany Eamonn Colgan, 33, from Broughty Ferry, said: ""I would like to make it clear the police have stated to me that the male that was recovered from the Elbe does not match the description of Liam. ""I'm obviously incredibly relieved that this was not Liam, however pass on my condolences to the family involved in what must be a horrible time for them. ""My brother is still out there and we are still receiving sightings. We need to find Liam and bring him home to his family and friends."" He has asked that Scots with connections in Hamburg and the surrounding areas continue to share the appeal. He said: ""We need your assistance to help do this by sharing the appeal and contacting your friends in Germany to do so. I feel humbled and eternally grateful for everyone's assistance in helping bring Liam home."" The Lucie Blackman Trust is currently sifting through photographs, CCTV and other intelligence. Liam Colgan went missing while celebrating his brother's stag do Matt Searle explained: ""We have had an unprecedented amount of photos sent to us, ones people have taken with who they think is Liam in the background. ""None of these has been him so far, but it only takes one to be able to find him so we urge people to keep supporting the search. ""It's been great that Liam's case has seen so much exposure, both in mainstream and social media. ""But what we tend to see is that after the initial headlines and flurry of interest, these cases can lose momentum.

"Oxfam has revealed that three of the men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses during a 2011 investigation. The charity has published,externalits internal report on alleged abuse by some of its staff following public pressure. In the 2011 report, Oxfam said ""more needed"" to be done to prevent ""problem staff"" working for other charities. Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to the Haitian government at a meeting with its minister of planning. Earlier this month, the Times newspaper published allegations that Oxfam aid workers in Haiti had used prostitutes in 2011. Oxfam denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandalis being investigated by the Charity Commission. Oxfam UK boss: Attacks 'out of proportion' How much UK money goes to Oxfam? 'Sex between locals and employees' Oxfam - which has almost 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - has released a redacted version of its internal report, saying it wants to be ""as transparent as possible"" about the decisions it made. Parts of the 11-page document are blacked out to hide people's identities, including the names of the three men accused of intimidating witnesses. Oxfam presented the original, unedited report to the government in Haiti on Monday. Speaking after the meeting with Haitian minister Aviol Fleurant, Simon Ticehurst, Oxfam regional director for Latin America, said the charity would be starting ""the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens. ""We stand ready to engage with the Haitian people and have expressed our openness to co-operate as much as required with the Haitian government."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Oxfam is reeling under the revelations that some of its staff were guilty of bullying, intimidation and sexual misconduct, including using prostitutes on the charity's premises. So it is trying to start recovering some of its reputation by being as transparent as it can. Hence the publication of the internal report into what happened in Haiti in 2011. In the short term this may produce more damaging revelations not only about the inappropriate behaviour of staff but also the mismanagement and lack of transparency by senior managers. There are also likely to be more revelations when the Charity Commission and MPs begin their own investigations, as well as Oxfam's own internal inquiry. So few would disagree with the Prime Minister's spokesman when he says Oxfam has a long way to go to restore public trust. Theresa May told BBC London the revelation that three Oxfam staff physically intimidated witnesses during the charity's investigation was ""absolutely horrific"". ""This is exactly the problem that we see which means that all too often people don't feel able to come forward to report what has happened to them,"" the prime minister said. One former Oxfam aid workertold the BBC she was sexually and physically abused by a senior male colleague while in Haiti. She claimed she was also sexually assaulted by another Oxfam worker in South Sudan months later. Seven Oxfam employees left the organisation as a result of their behaviour in Haiti in 2011, the report shows. One employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises. The use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out. Two more were dismissed for bullying and intimidation - one of whom also downloaded pornography - and another man was sacked for failing to protect staff. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence when questioned by the investigation team. Mr Van Hauwermeiren last weekdenied paying prostitutes for sex. UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, on the provision that he fully co-operated with the rest of the investigation. It is not known if he is one of the suspects accused of threatening witnesses. The BBC has discovered that one of the staff dismissed from Oxfam for gross misconduct in Haiti was Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan aid worker who is based outside the capital Nairobi. Asked by a reporter whether he had been with Mr Van Hauwermeiren, Mr Mutiku said ""no"".  As he got into a vehicle, he was asked why he had been let go by Oxfam but not did not answer and closed its door. This video can not be played What do Haitians think of the foreign charities operating in their country? Another section entitled ""lessons learned"" sets out the need for tighter safeguarding across the industry to stop disgraced aid workers moving to new posts. It reads: ""Need better mechanisms for informing other regions/affiliates/agencies of behavioural issues with staff when they move and to avoid 'recycling' poor performers/problem staff."" Despite the warning, several of those implicated subsequently worked for other aid organisations, including at Oxfam. Mr Van Hauwermeiren ended up taking another high-profile position, as the head of mission for Action Against Hunger in Bangladesh. Action Against Hunger said it had carried out a series of checks on Mr Hauwermeiren but received no information from Oxfam of inappropriate or unethical behaviour.

""If they have been abusing the most vulnerable people in the worldâ¦ we should not be allowing them to go from one charity to another without any stain on their character,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said it would not currently be commenting on the report.

"Rescue helicopters have been hit by bad weather high in the Zagros mountain range Search and rescue teams are continuing to look for an Iranian plane that crashed in bad weather on Sunday. Local government officials reported that the wreckage had been found, but a Red Crescent official later said there was no evidence of this. A civil aviation official was also unable to confirm the reports. The Aseman Airlines passenger plane came down in the Zagros mountains on Sunday, and all 66 people on board are feared to have been killed. Hundreds of mountaineers with dogs and drones are trying to reach the site, in bad conditions. Due to fog and strong winds, helicopters that were deployed for the search at dawn on Monday have had to be grounded, a Red Crescent official told local media. And on Sunday, teams had to stop work altogether due to winds and snow. Air disasters timeline 2017: Safest year for air travel The ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop was travelling from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later in the Mount Dena area, about 22km (14 miles) from its destination. All 66 people on board the Iranian plane are feared dead On Monday officials from the region told news channels rescuers had reached the site. But both channels - IRINN and English-language Press TV - said they could not confirm the reports independently. Later, a civil aviation spokesman told Reuters news agency the reports could not be confirmed, and then a Red Crescent official said there was ""no reliable news"" that the wreckage had been found. The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Following the crash, the airline initially said that all on board had died, but later on Sunday said that it could not confirm this as no-one had reached the site. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the accident ""saddened the hearts"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.

"The note was left on an ambulance in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent A 26-year-old woman has been arrested afteran abusive note was left on an ambulance dealing with a 999 call. The handwritten message, in which the writer said she did not care ""if the whole street collasped [sic]"", was left in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, on Sunday. Staffordshire Police said the incident was not reported, but the force took action after seeing details on Twitter.

"Liam was helped near the G&J building before walking towards a local park The family of a man who disappeared during a stag party in Germany have revealed details of his first confirmed sighting. Liam Colgan, from Inverness, has been missing for more than a week following the party for his brother Eamonn. The sighting was a short time after the group had last seen him in the Veermaster Bar in Hamburg on Saturday 10 February. The family said this creates new lines of inquiry that are now being followed. CCTV footage seen by the family shows Liam arriving at the vehicle barrier of G&J building in Baumwall, Hamburg, at about 02:20. A witness reports seeing the 29-year-old and helping him up some steps to the main entrance of that building after he fell. This was corroborated by the CCTV. The footage goes on to show Liam trying unsuccessfully to get in to the building, before walking towards the Michelwiese Park. Liam walked towards Michelwiese Park before going towards the Portuguese Quarter He is helped again by the same witness to get into this park, and is last seen heading towards the Portuguese quarter at about 02:30. Liam's family are now receiving support from the Lucie Blackman Trust, set up to help families whose loved ones have gone missing or died abroad. Chief executive Matt Searle said: ""There have been a few people coming forward thinking they have seen him but this is the first one that has been confirmed by the family as being Liam. ""It is only about an hour or so after he was last seen but the family sees this as positive. ""It gives them an idea of where he was going."" As the search for Liam Colgan entered its second week, his family urged the public to continue their support. Liam's brother Eamonn last night confirmed a body pulled from the River Elbe on Sunday was not his sibling. He said his family had been encouraged by sightings of a ""confused Scotsman"" wandering the city of Hamburg and asked for help to ""bring Liam home"". Liam Colgan is the best man and planned the trip to Germany Eamonn Colgan, 33, from Broughty Ferry, said: ""I would like to make it clear the police have stated to me that the male that was recovered from the Elbe does not match the description of Liam. ""I'm obviously incredibly relieved that this was not Liam, however pass on my condolences to the family involved in what must be a horrible time for them. ""My brother is still out there and we are still receiving sightings. We need to find Liam and bring him home to his family and friends."" He has asked that Scots with connections in Hamburg and the surrounding areas continue to share the appeal. He said: ""We need your assistance to help do this by sharing the appeal and contacting your friends in Germany to do so. I feel humbled and eternally grateful for everyone's assistance in helping bring Liam home."" The Lucie Blackman Trust is currently sifting through photographs, CCTV and other intelligence. Liam Colgan went missing while celebrating his brother's stag do Matt Searle explained: ""We have had an unprecedented amount of photos sent to us, ones people have taken with who they think is Liam in the background. ""None of these has been him so far, but it only takes one to be able to find him so we urge people to keep supporting the search. ""It's been great that Liam's case has seen so much exposure, both in mainstream and social media. ""But what we tend to see is that after the initial headlines and flurry of interest, these cases can lose momentum.

"This video can not be played Parents say ""pain will never leave"" The parents of a five-year-old boy who died after falling into a river in Ballymena have spoken of their ""nightmare"" since their son's death. Kayden Fleck was recovered from the Braid River just over a week ago. Leanne and Darrel Fleck want anyone who saw Kayden and his twin, Jayden, near the river on 10 February to get in touch with police, as they try to piece together Kayden's last movements. Mr and Mrs Fleck told BBC News NI what happened on the day Kayden died. PSNI appeal over Ballymena river death Boy who drowned 'just melted your heart' The family was in the process of moving house and had returned to their former home in Ballykeel to collect their final belongings. Mrs Fleck said: ""The boys asked if they could go outside to the back yard and I said, 'Yes, but please don't go away'. Kayden Fleck, pictured on the right, with his twin brother, Jayden ""We didn't think that was going to be the last time that we were going to see the two boys as the two musketeers."" Mr Fleck had been taking down a shed in the back yard where the boys were playing. ""I set the drill down and the boys were gone - I turned my back and they were away within seconds. Within minutes we were out to look for them,"" he said. ""We never thought to look near the river first because they've never been there alone in their lives."" The couple assumed their sons would be in a play park just yards from their former home. Mrs Fleck said: ""We went straight to the play park but they weren't there. We started searching, wondering where abouts they could be but it was when Jayden then cried for help over at the Ecos Centre - that's whenever we knew something terrible had happened."" Mr Fleck said he found Jayden running from the river, which is around half a mile from the family's former home, his clothes soaked. Leanne and Darrel Fleck have described what happened on the day their son Kayden died The couple said he has since told his parents he tried to help his twin brother out of the water, but could not reach him. Mr Fleck said he then ran to the river, but Kayden had already been swept downstream. The child travelled more than six km (four miles) along the river from the point where he entered the water to the point where he was pulled out. Mrs Fleck said: ""Jayden has just told us that Kayden wanted to see the ducks. ""He's saying they were playing and then Kayden wanted to go home but that he wanted to take a path that he thought would take him home more quickly. We can't understand how they got so far. ""Other than that he's been very quiet, he's playing but he's just lost."" Kayden was a pupil at Harryville Primary School in Ballymena Mr and Mrs Fleck have appealed for anyone who saw the two boys to come forward. ""We need answers,"" she said. ""We cannot put the pieces of this puzzle together. ""I just want to know if anyone saw them, what were they doing? Were they with anyone? What directions did they take? ""We just need to know what happened, and how it happened."" Paying tribute to their son, Mr and Mrs Fleck said Kayden had been born with a congenital heart defect and chronic lung disease but had never let his tough start in life hold him back. Kayden spent the first year of his life in hospital, and travelled between Northern Ireland and England having six open heart operations. ""He was our little fighter,"" said Mrs Fleck. ""He was special in every way, not only because he was unwell as a baby but because of his personality. ""I'll always remember Kayden as my wee sunshine. ""That was how he made us feel, he was just a ray of sunshine."" Kayden spent the first year of his life in hospital, and travelled between Northern Ireland and England having six open heart operations Mr Fleck said ""he was just my wee son, a cheeky wee monkey. I just loved him to bits"". Speaking about the impact Kayden's death has had on her family, Mrs Fleck added: ""It's been a nightmare, it's been terrible. ""We just feel so empty and so lost. He was the life and soul of the house. He was fun, he was bubbly, when things got bad he made them right. ""He was there to give you a hug and wipe away the pain, but the pain is never going to go away. ""My 14-year-old son doesn't know what to say to me and our daughter, who's four, keeps asking when Kayden is coming back. We've told her the angels had to take him."" The couple were married just three weeks ago. Mrs Fleck said: ""It was the best day of our lives, we were finally going to be the family we'd always wanted to be. It was magical."" Mr and Mrs Fleck are now appealing for greater safety measures to be put in place around rivers close to built up residential areas. ""I don't want another family to go through this. In this estate and other housing estates where there could be rivers, children go out to play and I don't want another child to be Kayden,"" Mrs Fleck said. The couple said that while they are heartened by the support they have received in the local community, they have been left devastated by comments left on social media about their son's death. Mrs Fleck said: ""People have been commenting, 'Where were the parents, what were they doing?' Those people don't know us, they don't know what kind of family we were. ""The boys never went that far. They never got the chance to go that far but children will be children, they will explore. ""It's just so hurtful that people could think that we didn't care or that we just let them run wherever they wanted to run because that's not the way we are. ""To all those people who are just basically being nasty - please just think before you speak.""

Theresa May has launched her review of tuition fees and university funding, to be chaired by the author and financier, Philip Augar. Labour has said it would abolish fees and bring back maintenance grants. But Mrs May said scrapping fees would push up taxes and mean limiting the number of university places. Will the fee review really make any difference? Kuenssberg: What will May do? Reality Check: Would cutting fees really help poorer students? 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees Which degrees earn the most? The prime minister, in a speech in Derby, said she remained committed to the principle that students ""who benefit directly from higher education should contribute directly towards the cost of it"". Announcing the year-long review of student finance and university funding, Mrs May warned that the system has failed to deliver sufficient competition on price. Almost all courses are charged at the maximum Â£9,250 per year and interest rates are up to 6.1%. The prime minister said students in England faced ""one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world"" and ""the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course"". There are ""serious concerns"" about the cost among parents and grandparents as well as students, she said. There is a temporary freeze on fees at Â£9,250 and that is likely to be extended for at least another year during the review. But there were no signs from ministers of any radical cutting in the headline price of fees. This video can not be played The education secretary wants more variety in the fees charged Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the review was an ""unnecessary waste of time"" and showed that ""Theresa May has finally admitted that her government got it wrong"". ""Labour will abolish tuition fees, bring back maintenance grants and provide free, lifelong education in further education colleges,"" said Ms Rayner. But the prime minister said that completely scrapping fees would be unfair and damaging to universities. She argued it would mean higher taxes for those who did not go to university and would mean universities had to compete for funding with schools and hospitals, with the likely outcome that limits would be introduced on the number of university places. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wants""more variety"" in the level of fees, rather than almost all courses and universities charging the maximum amount. He also calls for more flexibility in how courses are delivered, such as two-year degrees, encouraging ""commuter degrees"" where students live at home and making it easier for part-time students and those who want to carry on working while studying. Former Labour education minister, Lord Adonis, called for a more significant change - arguing that fees should be much lower or abolished, in the way that had happened in Germany. He accused universities of being ""bloated"" on high fees and said they needed to ""get real"" over how much they should charge. Lord Adonis rejected the idea of different subjects having different costs as a ""big backward step"", which would reduce numbers applying for science subjects, if they became more expensive than arts and humanities. The tuition fee review also will consider ways of reducing costs such as cutting interest rates on loans and reintroducing maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, as well as examining the level of fees. UK reacts to 'underwhelming' earthquake Sexual 'exploitation' warning to driving instructors WATCH: Ram-raid on Rolex shop caught on camera Mrs May said that sure poorer students should have an ""equal chance"" in higher education - but that at present they had the greatest burden of debt. Students from poorer families are offered bigger loans for living costs than better-off students, who are expected to be partly supported by their parents, but it means they graduate with bigger debts. Restoring maintenance grants for poorer students, scrapped last year, would reduce their level of borrowing. Support for vocational training and apprenticeships in ""post-18 education"" will also be considered. The prime minister warned that the route into further technical and vocational training is ""hard to navigate"", saying the standards across the sector ""are too varied"" and the funding ""is patchy"". This video can not be played Five things you should know about your student loan debt The Treasury select committee, chaired by former education secretary Nicky Morgan, has raised concerns about the high level of interest rates. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says students in England face more than Â£5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university - contributing to average graduate debts of more than Â£50,000. Other former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarkehave all raised concerns about the level of interest charges. Universities can charge up to Â£9,250 per year Students do not pay this up-front, but can borrow the full amount They can also take a loan for living costs Disadvantaged students can borrow more for living costs, on the assumption that better-off students are supported by their parents Interest of up to 6.1% is charged on loans from when students start at university Students begin to repay loans once they earn Â£21,000, with this threshold being raised to Â£25,000 Any unpaid debts are written off after 30 years In Scotland's universities,there are no fees for Scottish students,external InNorthern Ireland,external, fees are up to Â£4,030 InWales,external, fees are up to Â£9,000 with plans for higher levels of maintenance support Mrs Morgan has also called for more support for part-time students, saying that their numbers had ""collapsed"". She said that the review needed to find a way to encourage more flexibility in courses and costs, saying that when the fees system was introduced it was ""naively assumed"" there would be be more competition. But there have been warnings against different levels of fees for sciences or humanities and arts, or for different types of university. Lord Willetts said higher fees for courses with the highest graduate earnings would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", giving even more money to the most advantaged courses and institutions. Labour's Angela Rayner says fees are unsustainable and should be scrapped Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, backed calls for more flexible approaches - such as two-year degree courses - but warned that setting different fee levels would be a ""bad idea"". Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said the current system needed to be ""better understood and feel fairer to students"". The priorities should be support for disadvantaged students and reversing the collapse in numbers of part-time and mature students, said the university group leader.

"Some newspapers have again questioned the amount spent on overseas aid by the UK afterallegations of sexual misconductby aid workers. International aid summits since the 1970s have been urging countries to spend 0.7% of their national income on overseas development assistance (ODA), popularly known as foreign aid. The UK government first did so in 2013, and approved legislation requiring it to do so in 2015. In 2016, that translated to a total spend of Â£13.4bn,according to the Department for International Development,external. Some of that money went to charities. Oxfam received Â£31.7m,externalfrom the UK government, which is about a quarter of a percent of what the government spends on foreign aid each year. But it is a sizeable chunk of Oxfam's funding. The charity had a total income of Â£409m last year, of which Â£176m came from government and other public authorities. Of the rest, Â£108m came from donations and legacies and Â£91m from sales in its shops. Its total income put it at number four on the list of UK charities, behind Cancer Research, the British Heart Foundation and Macmillan Cancer Support, according to the 2017Top 100 Charities Fundraising Spotlight.,external About 64% of UK foreign aid is bilateral aid, which is sent directly to the countries involved. Last year, the top three recipients were Pakistan, Syria and Ethiopia. The remaining 36% is multilateral aid, which is distributed by international organisations including charities. The top recipient of UK multilateral aid is the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank. It received Â£1.1bn from the UK last year. The second item in the graph above was the part of the UK's contribution to the EU budget that may be counted as development aid. The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future. Oxfam's Â£31.7m puts it just outside the top 20 recipients of multilateral aid.

"The Oxfam Charity""s CEO Mark Goldring (l) and Chair Caroline Thomson (r) leave the Department for International Development Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, has said the scale and intensity of the criticism against his organisation in the wake of claims its workers used prostitutes in Haiti is out of proportion to its level of culpability. He told the Guardian newspaper,external: ""The intensity and the ferocity of the attack makes you wonder, what did we do? ""We murdered babies in their cots?"" Mr Goldring also suggested that critics are motivated by an anti-aid agenda. The charity boss said that ""anything we say is being manipulated... even apologies only make matters worse."" Oxfam aid worker tells of sex assault Oxfam chief promises justice for victims How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? He acknowledged Oxfam could have acted faster but said ""what I felt really clearly is many people haven't wanted to listen to explanations"". Earlier this month, news reports said that during a humanitarian mission in Haiti in 2011, the charity's country director hired prostitutes at a villa paid for by Oxfam. The charity faced more criticism when it emerged that it had not shared details of the allegations with the Haitian government. Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in today's Guardian in which it says sorry to the people of Haiti and the charity's supporters. The ad, paid for by supporters rather than the charity, also sets out the actions the organisation plans to take, including tripling Oxfam's safeguarding capacity and establishing a review into improving its culture. The charity apologises in a full-page advertisement in the Guardian newspaper Another charity - MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) - has now come under question as the president of Haiti called for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country. Jovenel Moise, asked why the medical charity MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members. He told the Reuters news agency:  ""The Oxfam case is the visible part of the iceberg, ""It is not only Oxfam, there are other NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the same situation, but they hide the information internally."" MSF said it took reports of staff misconduct seriously and was seeking to clarify questions raised by the president. Oxfam has agreed to stop bidding for UK government funding until it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the charity had ""a long way to go"" before regaining the trust of the public, its staff and the people it aims to help. The charity, which had a total income of Â£409m last year, received Â£31.7m from the government in 2016, accounting for about 8% of the charity's income. The amount also represents about a quarter of a percent of the government's annual foreign aid spending. Oxfam is setting up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff. Other planned reforms include new funding for safeguarding measures and a crackdown on references issued to former staff. Do you have any information related to this story that you wish to share?

"Rescue helicopters have been hit by bad weather high in the Zagros mountain range Search and rescue teams are continuing to look for an Iranian plane that crashed in bad weather on Sunday. Local government officials reported that the wreckage had been found, but a Red Crescent official later said there was no evidence of this. A civil aviation official was also unable to confirm the reports. The Aseman Airlines passenger plane came down in the Zagros mountains on Sunday, and all 66 people on board are feared to have been killed. Hundreds of mountaineers with dogs and drones are trying to reach the site, in bad conditions. Due to fog and strong winds, helicopters that were deployed for the search at dawn on Monday have had to be grounded, a Red Crescent official told local media. And on Sunday, teams had to stop work altogether due to winds and snow. Air disasters timeline 2017: Safest year for air travel The ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop was travelling from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later in the Mount Dena area, about 22km (14 miles) from its destination. All 66 people on board the Iranian plane are feared dead On Monday officials from the region told news channels rescuers had reached the site. But both channels - IRINN and English-language Press TV - said they could not confirm the reports independently. Later, a civil aviation spokesman told Reuters news agency the reports could not be confirmed, and then a Red Crescent official said there was ""no reliable news"" that the wreckage had been found. The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Following the crash, the airline initially said that all on board had died, but later on Sunday said that it could not confirm this as no-one had reached the site. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the accident ""saddened the hearts"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.

"Oxfam has revealed that three of the men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses during a 2011 investigation. The charity has published,externalits internal report on alleged abuse by some of its staff following public pressure. In the 2011 report, Oxfam said ""more needed"" to be done to prevent ""problem staff"" working for other charities. Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to the Haitian government at a meeting with its minister of planning. Earlier this month, the Times newspaper published allegations that Oxfam aid workers in Haiti had used prostitutes in 2011. Oxfam denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandalis being investigated by the Charity Commission. Oxfam UK boss: Attacks 'out of proportion' How much UK money goes to Oxfam? 'Sex between locals and employees' Oxfam - which has almost 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - has released a redacted version of its internal report, saying it wants to be ""as transparent as possible"" about the decisions it made. Parts of the 11-page document are blacked out to hide people's identities, including the names of the three men accused of intimidating witnesses. Oxfam presented the original, unedited report to the government in Haiti on Monday. Speaking after the meeting with Haitian minister Aviol Fleurant, Simon Ticehurst, Oxfam regional director for Latin America, said the charity would be starting ""the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens. ""We stand ready to engage with the Haitian people and have expressed our openness to co-operate as much as required with the Haitian government."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Oxfam is reeling under the revelations that some of its staff were guilty of bullying, intimidation and sexual misconduct, including using prostitutes on the charity's premises. So it is trying to start recovering some of its reputation by being as transparent as it can. Hence the publication of the internal report into what happened in Haiti in 2011. In the short term this may produce more damaging revelations not only about the inappropriate behaviour of staff but also the mismanagement and lack of transparency by senior managers. There are also likely to be more revelations when the Charity Commission and MPs begin their own investigations, as well as Oxfam's own internal inquiry. So few would disagree with the Prime Minister's spokesman when he says Oxfam has a long way to go to restore public trust. Theresa May told BBC London the revelation that three Oxfam staff physically intimidated witnesses during the charity's investigation was ""absolutely horrific"". ""This is exactly the problem that we see which means that all too often people don't feel able to come forward to report what has happened to them,"" the prime minister said. One former Oxfam aid workertold the BBC she was sexually and physically abused by a senior male colleague while in Haiti. She claimed she was also sexually assaulted by another Oxfam worker in South Sudan months later. Seven Oxfam employees left the organisation as a result of their behaviour in Haiti in 2011, the report shows. One employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises. The use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out. Two more were dismissed for bullying and intimidation - one of whom also downloaded pornography - and another man was sacked for failing to protect staff. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence when questioned by the investigation team. Mr Van Hauwermeiren last weekdenied paying prostitutes for sex. UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, on the provision that he fully co-operated with the rest of the investigation. It is not known if he is one of the suspects accused of threatening witnesses. The BBC has discovered that one of the staff dismissed from Oxfam for gross misconduct in Haiti was Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan aid worker who is based outside the capital Nairobi. Asked by a reporter whether he had been with Mr Van Hauwermeiren, Mr Mutiku said ""no"".  As he got into a vehicle, he was asked why he had been let go by Oxfam but not did not answer and closed its door. This video can not be played What do Haitians think of the foreign charities operating in their country? Another section entitled ""lessons learned"" sets out the need for tighter safeguarding across the industry to stop disgraced aid workers moving to new posts. It reads: ""Need better mechanisms for informing other regions/affiliates/agencies of behavioural issues with staff when they move and to avoid 'recycling' poor performers/problem staff."" Despite the warning, several of those implicated subsequently worked for other aid organisations, including at Oxfam. Mr Van Hauwermeiren ended up taking another high-profile position, as the head of mission for Action Against Hunger in Bangladesh. Action Against Hunger said it had carried out a series of checks on Mr Hauwermeiren but received no information from Oxfam of inappropriate or unethical behaviour. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Tory MP Pauline Latham, a member of the Commons International Development Committee, has said there should be a global central aid worker register of suspected perpetrators to stop them moving from one charity to another. ""If they have been abusing the most vulnerable people in the worldâ¦ we should not be allowing them to go from one charity to another without any stain on their character,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said it would not currently be commenting on the report.

"The collapse of Carillion has delayed the opening of the new Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital Carillion's investors fled the failing company as it headed for disaster, according to MPs. The construction firm's annual reports were a worthless guide to its financial health and raise major questions about corporate governance, the MPs say. The comments come in a joint report published on Monday by the Work and Pensions and Business committees. Carillion's former auditor, KPMG, will be questioned by MPs on Thursday. On Monday, the Official Receiver - the body in charge of liquidating the business - said a further 152 Carillion workers would be made redundant this week. That takes the total number of jobs lost to 1,141since the UK's second-largest construction company collapsed last month. The failure has also led to job cuts and widespread disruption among sub-contractors. However, the Official Receiver said it had saved 7,610 jobs, including 942 over the past week, as other firms buy contracts held by Carillion. The Work and Pensions and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committeeshave already taken evidence from former Carillion directors. On Monday, the MPs released details of written comments from the company's big shareholders. Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said there was a ""disconnect"" between what Carillion directors told MPs and the information from shareholders. ""On one hand, the Carillion directors told us all was sunny"" until a major contract in Qatar went wrong. ""On the other hand, investors were fleeing for the hills, and it appears those who looked closest ran fastest,"" Mr Field said. It has emerged that one leading investor - Kiltearn Partners - considered suing Carillion. Ex-boss takes blame for Carillion failure Carillion collapse delays new Â£335m Liverpool hospital UK puts up Â£100m to back Carillion contractor loans Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened The company, which at one stage held 10% of Carillion's shares, said in a letter to the committees that it believes ""there are clear grounds for an investigation into whether Carillion's management knew, or should have known"" about the need for a major financial provision earlier than July 2017. In that month Carillion shocked the City with a profit warning and by writing down the value of contracts by Â£845m. Kiltearn's letter says that if Carillion had not gone into liquidation, it would have ""considered participation in civil legal action against Carillion with a view to recovering a proportion of its clients' crystalised losses"". Kiltearn began selling shares in August. At a meeting with Carillion on 13 October, they said former interim chief executive Keith Cochrane could only provide ""limited and vague"" responses to ""fundamental"" questions - and consequently Kiltearn sold all shares by 4 January this year. The investment firm Standard Life Aberdeen, in a letter to the MPs, said it began a process of divestment in December 2015 due to concerns about financial management, strategy and corporate governance. Standard Life said these were issues it raised with the board in regular meetings from the end of 2015 until the firm sold up completely in July 2017. Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee, said investors spotted that Carillion was heading for disaster and fled. The difficulty in getting a true sense of Carillion's financial health raised ""serious"" corporate governance issues, she added. ""KMPG will have to explain why they signed-off on accounts which appeared to bear so little relation to reality,"" Ms Reeves said.

Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later in the Mount Dena area, about 22km (14 miles) from its destination. All 66 people on board the Iranian plane are feared dead On Monday officials from the region told news channels rescuers had reached the site. But both channels - IRINN and English-language Press TV - said they could not confirm the reports independently. Later, a civil aviation spokesman told Reuters news agency the reports could not be confirmed, and then a Red Crescent official said there was ""no reliable news"" that the wreckage had been found. The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Following the crash, the airline initially said that all on board had died, but later on Sunday said that it could not confirm this as no-one had reached the site. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the accident ""saddened the hearts"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.

"Scientists have taken the first steps towards what they say could become a new blood and urine test for autism. Their study tested children with and without the condition and found higher levels of protein damage in those with the disorder. The researchers said the tests could lead ultimately to the earlier detection of the condition, which can be difficult to diagnose. But experts expressed caution, saying such a test was still a long way off. Autism diagnoses 'could be reduced' Autism found in brain long before symptoms 'I'm scared of my own autistic child' Autism affects behaviour and particularly social interaction but it is difficult to spot and is not usually diagnosed before the age of two, and often much later. Currently, there are no biological tests that can spot the condition, which is diagnosed through behavioural assessments by clinicians. For this newstudy, published in the Molecular Autism journal,external, researchers looked for chemical differences in the blood and urine of 38 autistic children and 31 children without the condition, all aged between five and 12. In those with autism they found higher levels of protein damage - particularly in the blood plasma - which they said were associated with ill health. Dr Naila Rabbani, from the University of Warwick, who led the study, told the BBC the tests could ultimately be used by doctors to diagnose autism earlier in childhood by detecting these markers. But she said the next step was to replicate the study's findings in other groups. She said: ""We have the method, we have everything. All we need to do is repeat it. ""I would really like to go forward with younger children, maybe two years, or even one year old. ""Then the next step will be to validate in a larger cohort. Then the tests will be ready for screening."" Dr Rabbani added that she hoped the tests could also eventually reveal some of the factors that cause autism and improve its diagnosis. One in every 100 people in the UK has autism More men are diagnosed with autism than women - estimates vary from twice to 16 times as many The number of diagnosed cases has increased during the past 20 years, reportedly because of more accurate diagnoses Autism doesn't just affect children - autistic children grow up to be autistic adults You can't always tell if someone is autistic There is no cure, but a range of interventions are available Source:The National Autistic Society,external However, other researchers expressed caution about the study. Dr James Cusack, director of science at the UK autism research charity Autistica, said: ""This study may give us clues about why autistic people are different but it does not provide a new method for diagnosis. It is far too early for that. ""We don't know whether this technique can tell the difference between autism, ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. The study also only looked at a small group of people. ""The best way to diagnose autism is still through clinical interview and observation."" Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it was a promising area of research but it was a ""very long way indeed from a test for autism"". ""While we applaud the arrival of this interesting area of research, it is important that it is not adopted with too much enthusiasm - if applied to a large population it will produce large numbers of 'false positives', causing huge worry and potential harm to children and families.""

"Sir Philip Green has vehemently denied a report that he is planning to sell his Arcadia retail empire. In a statement, Arcadia said a story inThe Sunday Times,externalclaiming Sir Philip is in talks to offload all or part of the Topshop-owner is ""totally false"". The newspaper said Sir Philip is in discussions with China's Shandong Ruyi about a potential deal. However, Arcadia said neither Sir Philip or its directors ""have ever met or had any contact with Shandong Ruyi"". The article also alleges that Sir Philip has been in discussions with bankers from HSBC about separating Topshop from Arcadia. But Arcadia said the statement regarding discussions with HSBC are ""totally untrue"", and claimed the report was ""further evidence"" of a ""personal vendetta against Sir Philip and his companies"". It said: ""The 22,000 people that work at Arcadia should not be subjected to this type of malicious rumour-mongering."" In response, The Sunday Times said: ""This is a public interest story, which The Sunday Times investigated thoroughly before publication, and we stand by our report."" Sir Philip's Arcadia group, whose brands also include Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis, has 2,800 stores across the world. However, his flagship chain, Topshop, has struggled against competition from the rise of online rivals such as Boohoo and Asos. Sir Philip Green reached an agreement with the Pensions Regulator in February According to latest figures,profits at Taveta, Arcadia's holding company, fell 79% in 2016. Last year,Sir Philip revamped management in a bid to revive the brands. FollowingThe Sunday Times,externalstory, Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said that he had written to Sir Philip Green asking if he will he seek clearance from The Pension Regulator for any deal. Arcadia, which confirmed receipt of the letter, said that it had promised to pay Â£50m a year into its pension fund, ""the most recent payment being made this month"". It added: ""The group remains unborrowed at the operating level and has substantial property assets."" The Work and Pensions Committee last year investigated the sale and subsequent collapse of BHS, which Sir Philip sold to an investment vehicle called Retail Acquisitions Ltd in 2015 before it went bust the following year. The failed High Street chain was left with a huge pension deficit, althoughSir Philip later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap. Mr Field has criticised Sir Philip's actions,and last August the businessman sent a legal warning to the MP. Shandong Ruyi has been expanding in Europe. It has bought controlling stakes in the Swiss luxury leather goods company Bally and London-listed fashion manufacturer Bagir. The Chinese company bought Acquascutum last year for Â£95m.

"Israeli police are now investigating the incident Swastikas have been drawn on the gates of Poland's embassy in Israel, a day after the country's PM said Jews were among perpetrators of the Holocaust. Police in Tel Aviv launched an inquiry after profanities and the word ""murderer"" were also discovered. Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki's comments have been strongly condemned by Israel. He has since said through a spokeswoman that he did not intend to blame Jewish victims for ""a Nazi German perpetrated genocide"". The fresh dispute comes just weeks after Israel criticised a new Polish law making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation or state of complicity in Nazi crimes. The legislation was signed into lawby President Andrzej Duda but also referred to the country's highest court to consider its constitutionality. New Holocaust law threatens 'whitewash' of Polish history Swastikas and anti-Polish profanities were on Sunday found drawn in marker pen on the gates and also on a bulletin board. No-one has so far claimed responsibility for vandalising the diplomatic mission. A police investigation is now under way, Tel Aviv authorities say. The Polish prime minister made the controversial remarks at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Mateusz Morawiecki's office later issued a statement, explaining his comments He was responding to an Israeli journalist,externalwho asked if anyone who said there were Polish collaborators in the Holocaust would be considered a criminal in Poland under the new law. Mr Morawiecki said: ""It's extremely important to first understand that, of course, it's not going to be punishable, not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators - as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian.... not only German perpetrators."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later on Saturday that the remarks were ""outrageous"" and showed ""an inability to understand history"". On Sunday, he spoke by telephone with Mr Morawiecki to discuss the issue. In the call, he ""pointed out that the goal of the Holocaust was to destroy the Jewish people and that all Jews were under sentence of death"", Mr Netanyahu's office said. ""He told his Polish counterpart that the distortion regarding Poland could not be corrected by means of another distortion."" Meanwhile, Polish government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinsk said that Mr Morawiecki's comments in Munich ""were by no means intended to deny the Holocaust, or charge the Jewish victims of the Holocaust with responsibility for what was a Nazi German perpetrated genocide"". It says that ""whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reichâ¦ shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years"". Poland has long objected to phrases which suggest shared responsibility for Nazi Germany's actions But it adds the caveat that a person ""is not committing a crime if he or she commits such an act as part of artistic or scientific activities"". The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love The country has long objected to the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland in 1939. But the more contentious point raised by the law is whether it will outlaw references to acts of individual complicity by Poles with the Nazis - something historians say there is clear evidence for. The Israelis have been furious about the legislation, which Mr Netanyahu has described as an attempt to rewrite history and deny the Holocaust. Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. In total, six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. More Poles have been honoured by Israel for saving the lives of Jews during the war than nationals of any other country. However, historians say other Poles were complicit in acts such as informing on Jews in hiding for rewards, and participating in massacres - including in Jedwabne, where hundreds of Jews were murdered by their neighbours. In 2003, Poland's National Remembrance Institute (IPN) concluded that the killings in Jedwabne were committed by Polish perpetrators but inspired by German Nazis (link in Polish).,external Polish PM rebuked for Holocaust remark Poland Holocaust complicity bill passed Naked Auschwitz demonstrators convicted The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love Convicted Auschwitz guard asks for mercy Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Passengers' relatives have been gathering as they await news of relatives Relatives of 66 people who were on board a plane that crashed in Iran are desperately waiting for any news. State media says the Aseman Airlines passenger plane that came down in the Zagros mountains on Sunday has been found. All those on board are feared to have been killed. Heavy wind and snow forced rescuers to stop the search late on Sunday. The ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop was travelling from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later on Dena Mountain, near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province. The crash site is about 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, Iranian media reported. The plane that crashed was a French-Italian made ATR 72-500 The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Search and rescue teams were dispatched to look for the site where the plane came down, but were later forced to stop the operation. ""With the wind intensifying, and with snow, rain and darkness, it is not possible for rescue and relief teams to reach high altitudes and the search operation has been postponed until tomorrow,"" broadcaster IRIB announced. ""Five helicopters are on alert to resume the search at dawn if the weather conditions are better."" Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Aseman Airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: ""Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane."" Major air disasters timeline 2017 safest year for air travel Air France jet engine fails mid-flight Passengers' relatives earlier gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to AFP news agency. ""I can't bring myself to believe it,"" said one woman whose husband was on the plane. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight. Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: ""God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives."" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"".

"This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains Turkey has warned the Syrian government not to help Kurds fighting against Turkish forces in northern Syria. Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkey's operations were going ahead as planned and it would be a ""disaster"" if Syrian troops were to intervene. Syrian media had earlier said the army would help Kurds resist Turkish operations in the enclave of Afrin. But there has been no sign of this so far, and the Kurdish YPG militia has denied there is a deal with Damascus. Turkey regards the Kurdish fighters, just across its border in Afrin, as terrorists. It launched a major offensive against them last month. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Russia's Vladimir Putin that Damascus would face ""consequences"" if it struck a deal with the Kurds, CNN Turk reported on Monday. Both Mr Bozdag and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu delivered a similar message later in the day. The abridged back story How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war Viewpoint: Chemical weapons âthreat to Westâ ""If [the Syrian army] comes in to defend the YPG, then nothing and nobody can stop Turkish soldiers,"" Mr Cavusoglu told reporters in Jordan. Mr Erdogan, Mr Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani are planning to meet in Turkey in April to discuss the situation in Syria, a Kremlin spokesperson said. Elsewhere in Syria, pro-government forces were also reported to be preparing a ground assault on the rebel-controlled Eastern Ghouta area, on the edge of Damascus. Syrian activists said dozens of civilians had been killed over the past 24 hours in government attacks, in one of the deadliest days in the Eastern Ghouta since Syrian forces stepped up their campaign to retake it earlier this month. On Monday Syrian state Sana news agency said ""popular forces"" would arrive in Afrin ""to support its people's stand against the Turkish regime's attack"". A senior Kurdish official, Badran Jia Kurd, told Reuters news agency that government soldiers would deploy to some border positions. But later YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud said: ""There is no agreement. There is only a call from us for the Syrian army to come in and protect the borders."" If a deal were to be struck, Turkish troops could find themselves confronting not only Kurdish fighters in Afrin, but the Syrian army too, correspondents say. Turkey began its cross-border offensive- which it has dubbed operation Olive Tree - in January. It is trying to oust the People's Protection Units (YPG), the armed wing of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The Kurds have administered semi-autonomous enclaves south of the Turkish border since Syrian forces pulled out in 2012, and the YPG has taken control of other territory after driving out Islamic State (IS) fighters. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct military or political links with the PKK. Thousands of civilians have fledsince Turkey's offensive began just over a month ago. Neither side has released much information about fatalities, making the death toll difficult to gauge. Turkish-backed Syrian rebel fighter guards a checkpoint on the road to Afrin Kurdish media reported intensified Turkish air and artillery attacks in the region on Monday. A child was killed and eight other civilians were injured in shelling of Basute village, according to the Kurdish Hawar News Agency (ANHA). Turkey has said it is targeting only combatants, not civilians. Syria has not had a military presence in the Afrin area for nearly six years. During the course of the Syrian war, pro-government forces have largely avoided direct conflict with the YPG, but they have had sporadic clashes. The government of President Bashar al-Assad opposes the YPG's demands for autonomy and has vowed to retake control of all Syrian territory. However the two sides are united in wanting to block Turkey's advances. From the Kurdish perspective, Mr Jia Kurd said: ""We can co-operate with any side that lends us a helping hand in light of the barbaric crimes and the international silence."" Northern and north-western Syria hosts a complex mix of alliances between different international and regional players. This video can not be played Why do the two biggest military powers in Nato risk fighting each other in Syria? The situation is further complicated by the YPG receiving funding from Turkey's Nato ally the United States, as partners in the fight against IS. Turkey has supported rebels fighting Syrian government forces since the civil war began in 2011, but there has been no direct confrontation between the two powers since Syria shot down a Turkish fighter plane in 2012, killing two crew.

"Sarah Rees was made redundant while on maternity leave with her daughter Caitlin, now four Sarah Rees was working for a large charity when she fell pregnant with her first child and took maternity leave. She was keen to return to work quickly, but her attempts to contact her employer were met with silence. Eventually she was made redundant, and she could not afford to take the case to a tribunal. Ms Rees says her experience is not uncommon, and a new report says many employers still live in the ""dark ages"" when it comes to recruiting women. In apoll for the Equality and Human Rights Commission,external(EHRC), 36% of employers thought it reasonable to ask a woman about her plans to have children. Some 59% agreed that a woman should have to disclose during the recruitment process whether she is pregnant. The commission said the poll of 1,106 male and female decision-makers showed worrying attitudes. Ms Rees, who lives in Cardiff, said she wanted to return to work when her daughter was 12 weeks old: ""I loved my job,"" she says. She emailed the organisation but did not receive a reply. She then popped into the office one day. She says the atmosphere was ""very cold and icy"" and there was ""no comment"" when she said she wanted to talk about returning. ""Because no-one had contacted me I did things like I looked at the company website and I realised that I had been removed from the list of staff, so things started to add up and I realised I wasn't wanted any more,"" she told the BBC. MPs pressure City firms over diversity Google sued over 'male discrimination' More mothers with young children have jobs The position was driven home when a trustee contacted her because she was concerned the charity was discussing Ms Rees' redundancy without her knowledge. Ms Rees did receive a formal notice of redundancy, but she decided against going to an employment tribunal because at the time she would have had to pay for it and she could not afford it. ""Also I didn't want to go into anything so difficult when I was already in a very stressful time, being a new mum,"" she says. She says her experience is not uncommon. She now runs her own business helping women get back into the workplace and she says she heard of ""plenty"" of other people who have had similar experiences. The EHRC said its study showed that many employers needed more support to better understand the basics of discrimination law and the rights of pregnant women and new mothers. EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: ""It is a depressing reality that, when it comes the rights of pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace, we are still living in the dark ages. ""We should all know very well that it is against the law not to appoint a woman because she is pregnant or might become pregnant. ""Yet we also know women routinely get asked questions around family planning in interviews."" Other findings from the YouGov survey of small, medium and large firms included: 46% of employers agreed it was reasonable to ask women if they have young children during the recruitment process 44% agree women should work for an organisation for at least a year before deciding to have children About one third believe that women who become pregnant and new mothers in work are ""generally less interested in career progression"" 41% of employers agreed that pregnancy in the workplace puts ""an unnecessary cost burden"" on the workplace 51% agree there is sometimes resentment towards women who are pregnant or on maternity leave The EHRC said its survey revealed antiquated beliefs, including two out of five employers saying women who have had more than one child while in the same job can be a ""burden"" to their team. The EHRC wants companies to sign up to its Working Forward initiative which aims to stamp out pregnancy and maternity discrimination. Member firms, which include Nationwide, Royal Mail and Transport for London, are given advice and help to improve in areas such as flexible working and employee confidence. Ms Rees, whose second child is now aged one, advises women to make sure that they discuss clearly with their employer how they want to go back to work and to ""join your trade union, because it's something that I didn't, because thinking I was working for a charity that I'd be protected"".

"This video can not be played Emotional plea to allow medical cannabis for Alfie Requests for a medical cannabis licence to help a boy whose rare form of epilepsy improved after taking the drug have been denied by the Home Office. Six-year-old Alfie Dingley, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, suffers up to 30 violent seizures a day. His parents want to treat him with medical cannabis oil, which is illegal in the UK. The Home Office said the drug ""cannot be practically prescribed, administered or supplied to the public"". A spokesperson added that it can only be used for research. Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, said ""you've got to fight for your kids, I want to know that I've done everything I can"". Members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on drug policy reform is calling on the government to assist with Alfie's plight. Ms Deacon said Alfie's cannabis dose was ""very small"", just three drops of the oil Ms Deacon said Alfie went to the Netherlands to take a cannabis-based medication in September. She said that while there, the medication, prescribed by a paediatric neurologist, saw his seizures reduce in number, duration and severity. At one point while in the UK, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year, but while abroad he went 24 days without a single attack. ""It's very rare and very aggressive, there's only nine boys in the world with Alfie's condition,"" Ms Deacon said. ""We never imagined how well it would work. He's just a six-year-old boy, he deserves a happy life. We've found something that makes him happy and now we've got to take that away."" Ms Deacon said his cannabis dose was ""very small"" and he was taking three drops of the oil, which is made using whole plant cannabis. At one point, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year Alfie's mother said the steroids he currently takes in hospital could eventually cause his organs to fail if he keeps taking them at the rate he is.

Group co-chair, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said: ""It would be heartless and cruel not to allow Alfie to access the medication. ""Parliament really must look at reforming our laws to allow access to cannabis for medical purposes, which has huge public support."" MPs have called for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to issue a medical cannabis licence The Home Office said it recognised that people with chronic pain and debilitating illnesses are ""looking to alleviate their symptoms"". A spokesperson added: ""However, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards before being placed on the market, so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. ""Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 drug, as in its raw form it is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit and is therefore subject to strict control restrictions.

"Doctors examine wounded patients in a hospital in Kizlyar Five women have been killed in a shooting at a church in Russia's volatile republic of Dagestan. Five others, including a police officer and a national guardsman, were injured, Russian officials said. Two are said to be in a critical condition. A man fired at people leaving an evening service in the city of Kizlyar. The attacker was shot and killed at the scene. He was later identified as 22-year-old Khalil Khalilov, a resident of Dagestan. The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack but did not immediately provide any evidence. Islamic State may threaten Russia's Caucasus Dagestan profile The most dangerous place in Europe? Jihadist shadow hangs over Georgia's Pankisi Gorge The gunman used a hunting rifle, opening fire on worshippers leaving a service during celebrations for Maslenitsa - a traditional pre-Lent festival, Russian media report. Four women were killed at the scene, and another woman died later in a hospital. One of them was an award-winning doctor, Lyudmila Shcherbakova, who had more than 40 years' experience working in Dagestan's hospitals, Tass news agency reports. Russian news outlet RBK quoted an Orthodox Christian priest as saying the attack took place immediately following the afternoon service. ""We had finished the mass and were beginning to leave the church. A bearded man ran towards the church shouting 'Allahu Akbar' (God is greatest) and killed four people,"" the priest said. ""He was carrying a rifle and a knife,"" he added. IS later said - through its information wing Amaq - that one of its ""soldiers"" had carried out the attack. However, it provided no evidence to back up its claims. The Dagestan Muftiate - the administrative body for Sunni Muslims in the region - expressed sorrow over the attack and condemned the gunman as a ""Wahhabi... one of those who espouse pseudo-Islam, which has no connection to true Islam"". Wahhabism is an ultra-conservative form of Sunni Islam followed by Saudi Arabia's ruling family and religious establishment. IS made the claim in the name of its so-called ""Caucasus Province"", the last official branch set up by the group in 2015. The branch has claimed a number of deadly attacks against security personnel in Dagestan. Dagestan, located in Russia's North Caucasus, is an ethnically diverse and largely Muslim federal republic. The Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church called the shooting a ""monstrous crime"" aimed at sowing discord between Christians and Muslims in Dagestan.

"Oxfam has revealed that three of the men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses during a 2011 investigation. The charity has published,externalits internal report on alleged abuse by some of its staff following public pressure. In the 2011 report, Oxfam said ""more needed"" to be done to prevent ""problem staff"" working for other charities. Oxfam offered its ""humblest apologies"" to the Haitian government at a meeting with its minister of planning. Earlier this month, the Times newspaper published allegations that Oxfam aid workers in Haiti had used prostitutes in 2011. Oxfam denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandalis being investigated by the Charity Commission. Oxfam UK boss: Attacks 'out of proportion' How much UK money goes to Oxfam? 'Sex between locals and employees' Oxfam - which has almost 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries - has released a redacted version of its internal report, saying it wants to be ""as transparent as possible"" about the decisions it made. Parts of the 11-page document are blacked out to hide people's identities, including the names of the three men accused of intimidating witnesses. Oxfam presented the original, unedited report to the government in Haiti on Monday. Speaking after the meeting with Haitian minister Aviol Fleurant, Simon Ticehurst, Oxfam regional director for Latin America, said the charity would be starting ""the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens. ""We stand ready to engage with the Haitian people and have expressed our openness to co-operate as much as required with the Haitian government."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Oxfam is reeling under the revelations that some of its staff were guilty of bullying, intimidation and sexual misconduct, including using prostitutes on the charity's premises. So it is trying to start recovering some of its reputation by being as transparent as it can. Hence the publication of the internal report into what happened in Haiti in 2011. In the short term this may produce more damaging revelations not only about the inappropriate behaviour of staff but also the mismanagement and lack of transparency by senior managers. There are also likely to be more revelations when the Charity Commission and MPs begin their own investigations, as well as Oxfam's own internal inquiry. So few would disagree with the Prime Minister's spokesman when he says Oxfam has a long way to go to restore public trust. Theresa May told BBC London the revelation that three Oxfam staff physically intimidated witnesses during the charity's investigation was ""absolutely horrific"". ""This is exactly the problem that we see which means that all too often people don't feel able to come forward to report what has happened to them,"" the prime minister said. One former Oxfam aid workertold the BBC she was sexually and physically abused by a senior male colleague while in Haiti. She claimed she was also sexually assaulted by another Oxfam worker in South Sudan months later. Seven Oxfam employees left the organisation as a result of their behaviour in Haiti in 2011, the report shows. One employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises. The use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out. Two more were dismissed for bullying and intimidation - one of whom also downloaded pornography - and another man was sacked for failing to protect staff. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence when questioned by the investigation team. Mr Van Hauwermeiren last weekdenied paying prostitutes for sex. UN aid agencies fear Oxfam backlash He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, on the provision that he fully co-operated with the rest of the investigation. It is not known if he is one of the suspects accused of threatening witnesses. The BBC has discovered that one of the staff dismissed from Oxfam for gross misconduct in Haiti was Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan aid worker who is based outside the capital Nairobi. Asked by a reporter whether he had been with Mr Van Hauwermeiren, Mr Mutiku said ""no"".  As he got into a vehicle, he was asked why he had been let go by Oxfam but not did not answer and closed its door. This video can not be played What do Haitians think of the foreign charities operating in their country? Another section entitled ""lessons learned"" sets out the need for tighter safeguarding across the industry to stop disgraced aid workers moving to new posts. It reads: ""Need better mechanisms for informing other regions/affiliates/agencies of behavioural issues with staff when they move and to avoid 'recycling' poor performers/problem staff."" Despite the warning, several of those implicated subsequently worked for other aid organisations, including at Oxfam. Mr Van Hauwermeiren ended up taking another high-profile position, as the head of mission for Action Against Hunger in Bangladesh. Action Against Hunger said it had carried out a series of checks on Mr Hauwermeiren but received no information from Oxfam of inappropriate or unethical behaviour. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Tory MP Pauline Latham, a member of the Commons International Development Committee, has said there should be a global central aid worker register of suspected perpetrators to stop them moving from one charity to another. ""If they have been abusing the most vulnerable people in the worldâ¦ we should not be allowing them to go from one charity to another without any stain on their character,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said it would not currently be commenting on the report.

"Some newspapers have again questioned the amount spent on overseas aid by the UK afterallegations of sexual misconductby aid workers. International aid summits since the 1970s have been urging countries to spend 0.7% of their national income on overseas development assistance (ODA), popularly known as foreign aid. The UK government first did so in 2013, and approved legislation requiring it to do so in 2015. In 2016, that translated to a total spend of Â£13.4bn,according to the Department for International Development,external. Some of that money went to charities. Oxfam received Â£31.7m,externalfrom the UK government, which is about a quarter of a percent of what the government spends on foreign aid each year. But it is a sizeable chunk of Oxfam's funding. The charity had a total income of Â£409m last year, of which Â£176m came from government and other public authorities. Of the rest, Â£108m came from donations and legacies and Â£91m from sales in its shops. Its total income put it at number four on the list of UK charities, behind Cancer Research, the British Heart Foundation and Macmillan Cancer Support, according to the 2017Top 100 Charities Fundraising Spotlight.,external About 64% of UK foreign aid is bilateral aid, which is sent directly to the countries involved. Last year, the top three recipients were Pakistan, Syria and Ethiopia. The remaining 36% is multilateral aid, which is distributed by international organisations including charities. The top recipient of UK multilateral aid is the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank. It received Â£1.1bn from the UK last year. The second item in the graph above was the part of the UK's contribution to the EU budget that may be counted as development aid. The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future. Oxfam's Â£31.7m puts it just outside the top 20 recipients of multilateral aid.

"Haiti became the world's first black-led republic and the first independent Caribbean state when it threw off French colonial control and slavery in the early 19th Century. But independence came at a crippling cost. It had to pay reparations to France, which demanded compensation for former slave owners. The 19th Century ""independence debt"" was not paid off until 1947. There have been recent calls for France to repay the money. Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left it as the poorest nation in the Americas. A 2010 earthquake killed some 300,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy. A UN peacekeeping force was put in place in 2004 to help stabilize the country, and only withdrew in 2019. In 2021, President Jovenel MoÃ¯se was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince. Since then the country has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control, and increasingly violent gang warfare. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Port-au-Prince Area:27,800 sq km Population:11.3 million Languages:French, Haitian Creole Life expectancy:62 years (men) 66 years (women) Acting Prime Minister: Michel Patrick Boisvert In April 2024, Haiti's prime minister Ariel Henry resigned and a nine-member transitional council was sworn in, with former finance minister Michel Patrick Boisvert serving as interim prime minister. Mr Boisvert said the country was at a ""crossroads"" in its search for solutions to overcome the political crisis, which was harming the population, property and infrastructure. The council was set up amid months of gang violence, the UN said more than 1,500 people had been killed and 800 injured in the first three months of 2024. Its aim is to restore order and democratic rule, and is backed by other Caribbean nations and the US. It will set the agenda of a new Cabinet, form a national security council and appoint an electoral commission to pave the way for a vote. Its mandate will expire on 7 February 2026, when a new president is expected to be sworn in. One of Haiti's most powerful gang leaders, Jimmy ChÃ©rizier, also known as Barbecue, said he would consider laying down weapons if armed groups were allowed to take part in talks to establish the new government. ChÃ©rizier is the most prominent figure in a loose alliance of gangs known as Viv Ansanm (Live Together), which controls around 80% of Port-au-Prince. He warned the crisis could continue if groups like his - which rail against ""corrupt politicians"" - were not part of a future government. Aid groups have reported difficulties in getting food and water into the capital, warning that millions are unable to find sustenance - with some on the verge of famine. Numerous local radio stations, such as this one, were destroyed in the 2010 quake Radio is Haiti's leading news medium and there are hundreds of local, privately-owned stations.
