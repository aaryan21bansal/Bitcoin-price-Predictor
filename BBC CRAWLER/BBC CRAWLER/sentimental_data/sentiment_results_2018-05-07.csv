"Prince Charles laid flowers at the memorial to the July 2016 Nice terror attack The Prince of Wales has been meeting families of the victims of the Nice terror attack as part of a five-day tour of France and Greece. One man who attempted to stopthe July 2016 attacksaid Prince Charles called him ""remarkable and courageous"". The prince, who is touring with Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, laid flowers at the city's memorial. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel killed 86 people when he drove a lorry into a large crowd on Bastille Day. The 31-year-old Tunisian was shot and killed by French Police. The royal couple stood in silence as they looked at the memorial on the Promenade des Anglais, the beach front road where the attack took place. Who were the Nice attack victims? What do we know about the attack? Nice attack: In pictures The prince then began speaking to some of the victims' families and was shown a framed photograph of two girls who lost their lives. The royal couple signed a book of condolence One young woman cried as she spoke to the couple about one of her loved ones. The prince also met Franck Terrier, 51, who drove his scooter alongside the speeding lorry and jumped on to its cab, punching the driver through the window in a desperate attempt to force him to stop. Mr Terrier said he was ""honoured"" to receive the prince's praise but said he did not think of himself as a hero. He said he was just ""eating an ice cream"" with his family when the attacker accelerated at them. Prince Charles and Camilla visited Nice as part of a five-day tour of France and Greece Anne Murris, whose daughter Camille was one of the victims, said she showed the prince a collage of pictures of her daughter when he paid his respects at the memorial. She said she told him of the different ways in which the victims are remembered in the city - including 86 stones on the city's beach each, with a victim's name painted on it. Ms Murris described the royal visit as ""an honour"". The royal couple met relatives of victims and members of the emergency services who responded to the 2016 attack When given a memorial stone as a gift, the prince said: ""I hardly think I merit it."" The royal couple also met Dr Daniele Navarro and his wife Nathalie who were the only first-aiders present for some 15 minutes after the attack. The Navarros lost a very close friend and brother in the attack. Mrs Navarro said the prince and Duchess of Cornwall showed ""extraordinary sympathy"" and spoke to her ""with heart"" and ""great sincerity"". Prince Charles said Britain cried for the people of Nice At an evening reception, Prince Charles spoke of a mutual ""deep affection"" and ""enduring"" close ties with the people of Nice. The prince said: ""You cried with the Nicois and the Nicois cried with all the British people after the tragedies of Manchester and London. ""We are neighbours by fate, partners by choice and friends because of the shared experience and deep affection that binds us. ""Time and again we have stood together, and struggled together, for the values that we both cherish. ""These are ties that bind and ones that will endure as our relationship continues to evolve.""

"Jay-Z's mum has spoken of how supportive her son was when she told him she was gay. Gloria Carter told an audience at the GLAAD Media Awards that it was the first time she's spoken to anyone about who she really was. The mother-of-four was presented with a special recognition gong for her contribution to his song Smile, released last year. She said: ""Smile became a reality because I shared with my son who I am."" The GLAAD Media Awards recognise people and organisations for their fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the LGBT community and the issues that affect their lives. ""My son cried and said: 'It must have been horrible to live that way for so long.'"" ""My life wasn't horrible,"" she added. ""I chose to protect my family from ignorance. I was happy but I was not free."" Jay-Z has previously told how he cried with joywhen his mother spoke to him about being a lesbian and of being in love with her female partner. In the song on the rapper's latest 4:44 album he says: ""Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian/Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian. Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate/Society shame and the pain was too much to take."" He told US talk show host David Letterman: ""For my mother to have to live as someone that she wasn't and hide and like, protect her kids â and didn't want to embarrass her kids... for all this time. ""For her to sit in front of me and tell me, 'I think I love someone'. I mean, I really cried,"" he told the David Letterman Netflix show. Allow YouTube content?

"This video can not be played ""It feels like we're living in Spain"" The UK has enjoyed record-breaking spring sunshine, with a high of 28.7C recorded at RAF Northholt in west London by the Met Office. It marks the hottest day over the Early May Bank Holiday weekend since the holiday was introduced in 1978. South-east England, the Midlands and East Anglia were the warmest spots. The Met Office's Charlie Powell said temperatures in the high 20s were ""the exception rather than the rule"" for the UK as a whole. The Met Office said Scotland and Wales just missed out on breaking their own bank holiday weekend records but still enjoyed their hottest day of the year so far with 23.1C recorded at Charterhall, Berwickshire, and 25.7C at Usk. Parks were a draw on the hottest Early May Bank Holiday Monday The 23.6C record for the Early May Bank Holiday Monday - set in 1999 - was broken when Herstmonceux in East Sussex reached 24.2C. The previous record for an overall Early May Bank Holiday temperature was set in 1995, when 28.6C was recorded on the Saturday of the long weekend. Allow Twitter content?

However, it is also important that we are sun safe. She suggests the following: Stay out of the sun when it is at its hottest (between 11:00 and 15:00 BST) Try to cover up as much as possible - wear a hat Apply plenty of sunscreen, particularly with children as their skin is a lot more sensitive. Re-apply sunscreen every one to two hours Drink lots of fluids Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Vet Dr Simon Constable says sun safety is as important for pets, and suggests the following key pointers: Use non-toxic pet sunscreen, particularly on pale-coloured pets, such as horses and dogs Give animals plenty of water to keep them hydrated - check their water is full all the time Consider buying booties to keep pets' paws and feet safe from getting burned on hot sand or hot pavements Let them have a swim if possible If travelling in a car with animals, stop regularly and give them frequent drinks of water Never leave pets in a car You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

"Hezbollah and its allies are reported to have made significant gains in parliament Hezbollah's leader says the Iran-backed militant Shia group and its allies have achieved ""victory"" in Lebanon's first parliamentary elections since 2009. Although the official results have not been announced, Hassan Nasrallah said their gains guaranteed the protection of the ""resistance"" against Israel. Sunni Prime Minister Saad Hariri said his Western-backed Future Movement had lost a third of its seats. Mr Hariri is still expected to be asked to form a new unity government. But analysts said he would emerge a weaker figure, and be even less able to exert influence over Hezbollah than he was in the past. A power-sharing system stipulates that the prime minister should be a Sunni Muslim, the speaker of parliament a Shia and the president a Maronite Christian. Saad Hariri pledged to work with other factions to secure Lebanon's ""political stability"" In a televised address a day after the elections, Hassan Nasrallah declared what he called a ""great political and moral victory for the resistance option that protects the sovereignty of the country"". He did not say how many seats his group and its allies had secured, but said the aim of their election campaign had been ""achieved and accomplished"". Reuters news agency said a tally based on preliminary results showed Hezbollah and its allies had won at least 67 of the 128 seats in parliament,external. But the number of Hezbollah MPs was little changed at around 13. Formed as a resistance movement during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s, Hezbollah is today a political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in the country. It is designated a terrorist group by Western states and Israel, with which it fought a war in 2006, and several of its members are accused of being behind the 2005 assassination of Mr Hariri's father Rafik - himself a former Lebanese prime minister. What is Hezbollah? Lebanon country profile Mr Hariri said his party had ended up with 21 seats, down from 33 nine years ago. ""We had hoped for a better result, it's true. And we were hoping for a wider bloc, with a higher Shia and Christian representation, that's also true,"" he added. ""But everyone could see that the Future Movement was facing a project to eliminate it from political life."" Despite the results, Mr Hariri pledged to ""to participate in securing political stability and to improve the lives of all the Lebanese"". An Israeli minister said the election results meant Lebanon and Hezbollah were indistinguishable. ""The state of Israel will not differentiate between the sovereign state of Lebanon and Hezbollah, and will view Lebanon as responsible for any action from within its territory,"" Naftali Bennett wrote on Twitter. Turnout was only 49.2% on Sunday, down from 54% nine years ago Lebanon should have held elections in 2013, but MPs extended their terms several times because parties could not agree on a new electoral law. The new law redrew constituency boundaries and changed the system from first past the post to proportional representation in an attempt to encourage voting. However, turnout among the 3.6 million eligible voters was only 49.2% on Sunday, down from 54% nine years ago. Mr Hariri blamed the reduced turnout on the complexities of the new electoral law. ""The problem with this election: a lot of people didn't understand it,"" he said. The elections were also the first since the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011. More than a million refugees have fled to Lebanon since then, swelling the population by 25% and overwhelming public services. Hezbollah has also sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in battles against predominantly Sunni rebel forces and the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).

"The 13-year-old boy was hit by pellets as he walked with his parents in Wealdstone A 13-year-old boy shot in north-west London was an innocent bystander, according to police. The teenager was one of five people shot in the capital within 24 hours. He was hit by shotgun pellets as he walked with his parentsin Wealdstone High Street on Sunday. Police believe two others were injured including a 15-year old boy who is in hospital with a head injury. A third victim was hit in the arm, but has not come forward. The Met described the attack as ""callous, reckless and brazen"". Wayne Bent, who was part of a group who helped treat the 13-year-old until an ambulance arrived, said: ""There was lots of blood. ""The main area was the back of the head - it was just constantly bleeding."" Wayne Bent said he was part of a group who helped treat the 13-year-old boy in a shop doorway The teenager was treated in hospital and has now been discharged. Resident Jonathan Smith said he had ""heard gunshots before"" in the area. He said: ""I sometimes feel a little bit unsafe living around here. There's quite of lot of youths hanging around."" The only sign of the violence from the day before were spots of blood on the pavement near a branch of Specsavers, where the 13-year-old victim had fled after being hit by a stray shotgun pellet. Detectives are still investigating the motive for the attack but one line of inquiry is a link to drugs. Residents told me that dealers openly sell drugs in an alley off the High Road. They also pointed to the absence of facilities for young people - and the closure of Wealdstone police station. It was shut as part of a Scotland Yard drive to save money and remains boarded up - a symbol, some say, of the lack of police presence in the area. Officers from the Met's gang crime unit believe the missing man and the 15-year-old were the intended targets of the attack. A 39-year-old man was arrested on Sunday and has been released under investigation. Police are looking for two male suspects. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was ""trying to make a difference"" by learning to work with children, his mother said In separate attacks,17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was shot dead in Southwarkon Friday and a 22-year-old suffered non life-threatening wounds in a shooting in New Cross Road, Lewisham, on Sunday.

"This video can not be played World Snooker Championship: Williams holds nerve to win pulsating final Mark Williams won his third World Championship - 15 years after his last - by holding off John Higgins' stunning fightback in a classic Crucible final. Williams, 43, won 18-16 to become the oldest champion since fellow Welshman Ray Reardon, who was 45 in 1978. He won seven frames on the trot to take a 14-7 lead but Scot Higgins, 42, came back magnificently to take eight of the next nine and level at 15-15. However, Williams responded in style to secure a famous victory. The final was the closest since 2005 when Shaun Murphy beat Matthew Stevens by the same scoreline. Williams claimed a record Â£425,000 at the Sheffield venue, taking his total prize money to Â£750,000 for the year, while Higgins' wait for a fifth title continues. ""It's unbelievable. Twelve months ago I wasn't even here. I watched it in a caravan,"" Williams told BBC Sport. ""I was seriously thinking of giving up, but my wife Joanne said I can't sleep in the house 24 hours a day."" And after saying earlier in the tournament that he would speak to the media naked if he won the title, Williams walked into his news conference undressed apart from a towel. This video can not be played Williams appears naked at news conference after winning title Third title is unbelievable - Williams Young players have gone soft - Hearn Reaction, analysis and frame-by-frame coverage Final frame scores and complete tournament results The final pitted two players from snooker's 'class of 92', turning professional in that year alongside Ronnie O'Sullivan - and as far as sporting fairytales go, this is a remarkable one. Only last summer, Williams failed to qualify for the Crucible and considered retirement, before deciding to continue. He claimed two ranking titles earlier this season, six years after his last, and now has 21 in his career. Williams showcased his best snooker in Sheffield, knocking in long pots when Higgins had seemingly got the cue ball safe, before compiling frame-winning contributions in amongst the reds. His laid-back manner and languid appearance around the table - sometimes even making pots with his eyes closed - was a throwback to the turn of the century when he was the best player in the world and claimed world titles in 2000 and 2003. He finished his dramatic semi-final against Barry Hawkins at 23:50 BST on Saturday and two hours later was eating a kebab and chips at a takeaway in the city. During the final, he asked to share some crisps, sweets and chocolate snacks with a fan who was sitting beside him in the arena. Despite being under extreme pressure late on, Williams - who was never behind in the match - held himself together for an outstanding success which will move him up to third in the world rankings. This video can not be played I wasn't here last year, I watched it in a caravan - Williams For Higgins, it was a case of another missed opportunity. The Scot has now lost three finals, winning the last of his four titles in 2011 against Judd Trump. He blew a 10-4 lead against Mark Selby last year, which he admitted could have been his best opportunity to add a fifth world crown and draw alongside O'Sullivan. A mixed tournament this time saw him thrash Jack Lisowski 13-1 in the second round, before edging a thrilling final-frame decider against Trump in the last eight. However, in the final, he was always chasing the game against Williams, trailing 10-7 overnight, and although he got level at 15-15 and made four centuries, never managed to edge in front and was punished for uncharacteristic mistakes. There was even a chance Williams could finish the match with a session to spare, but Higgins' epic fightback prevented that. ""I was worried if I would take it to the fourth session,"" said Higgins. ""I didn't want to lose with a session to spare. ""It was a good match to watch but obviously I'm disappointed. He is a great champion.""Williams wins world title for third time This video can not be played Watch: Best shots of the Championship Trailing 15-10 Higgins came out firing in the final session with a century and punished Williams for breaking down on 58 by compiling a 67 in response. He did the same in the next as Williams missed a red on 47 and Higgins stroked in a superb 82, as well as taking the 29th to trail by one. And the same pattern emerged in the next as Williams made another 47 only for Higgins to make 62 and level the match. Williams showed great courage to take the next two, including a century break, but missed championship ball on the pink as Higgins' 65 won the frame by two points. However, a run of 69 in the 34th frame gave him another world title. This video can not be played Williams pots brilliant red to clinch dramatic third world title ""To play John in a final is an experience in itself,"" added Williams. ""You've got to expect a comeback because when you're 50 or 60 in front he's the best I've ever seen at clearing up - and that includes Ronnie O'Sullivan. ""I was thinking: 'I'm not going to get over the line here.' ""I knew if I didn't get enough he was going to clear up again. But I'm over the moon."" Six-time world champion Steve Davis on BBC Two:""What a magnificent performance from Mark Williams. The mental fortitude to not wilt under that pressure is immense. It was one of the greatest finals we've ever seen. The standard was fantastic."" Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry:""You have to admire the way Mark Williams played after Higgins levelled the match. He was so calm and showed what an incredible temperament he has. He found a gear from somewhere and eased away again from his opponent."" Masters champion Mark Allen on Twitter:""The best final I've ever watched. Twists and turns, comebacks and clearances. Credit to the game. The rest of us have to catch up with these old guys well done @markwil147 and hard lines John Higgins."" Crucible semi-finalist Kyren Wilson on Twitter:""What an incredible final.

"The 13-year-old boy was hit by pellets as he walked with his parents in Wealdstone A 13-year-old boy shot in north-west London was an innocent bystander, according to police. The teenager was one of five people shot in the capital within 24 hours. He was hit by shotgun pellets as he walked with his parentsin Wealdstone High Street on Sunday. Police believe two others were injured including a 15-year old boy who is in hospital with a head injury. A third victim was hit in the arm, but has not come forward. The Met described the attack as ""callous, reckless and brazen"". Wayne Bent, who was part of a group who helped treat the 13-year-old until an ambulance arrived, said: ""There was lots of blood. ""The main area was the back of the head - it was just constantly bleeding."" Wayne Bent said he was part of a group who helped treat the 13-year-old boy in a shop doorway The teenager was treated in hospital and has now been discharged. Resident Jonathan Smith said he had ""heard gunshots before"" in the area. He said: ""I sometimes feel a little bit unsafe living around here. There's quite of lot of youths hanging around."" The only sign of the violence from the day before were spots of blood on the pavement near a branch of Specsavers, where the 13-year-old victim had fled after being hit by a stray shotgun pellet. Detectives are still investigating the motive for the attack but one line of inquiry is a link to drugs. Residents told me that dealers openly sell drugs in an alley off the High Road. They also pointed to the absence of facilities for young people - and the closure of Wealdstone police station. It was shut as part of a Scotland Yard drive to save money and remains boarded up - a symbol, some say, of the lack of police presence in the area. Officers from the Met's gang crime unit believe the missing man and the 15-year-old were the intended targets of the attack. A 39-year-old man was arrested on Sunday and has been released under investigation. Police are looking for two male suspects. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was ""trying to make a difference"" by learning to work with children, his mother said In separate attacks,17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was shot dead in Southwarkon Friday and a 22-year-old suffered non life-threatening wounds in a shooting in New Cross Road, Lewisham, on Sunday. Rhyhiem's mother, Pretana Morgan,has called for an end to the violencein London. ""Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone. Just let it stop,"" she said.

"Texas has executed far more people than any other US state, and one former employee of the state has watched hundreds of executions unfold. She speaks to Ben Dirs about the profound effect that had on her. It is 18 years since Michelle Lyons watched Ricky McGinn die. But it still makes her cry. When she least expects it, she'll see McGinn's mother, in her Sunday best, her hands pressed against the glass of the death chamber. Dressed to the nines to watch her son get executed. Some farewell party. For 12 years - first as a newspaper reporter, then as a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) - it was part of Lyons' job to witness every execution carried out by the state. Between 2000 and 2012, Lyons saw almost 300 men and women die on the gurney, violent lives being brought to a peaceful conclusion, two needles trumping the damage done. Lyons witnessed her first execution when she was 22. After seeing Javier Cruz die, she wrote in her journal: ""I was completely fine with it. Am I supposed to be upset?"" She thought her sympathy was best set aside for more worthy causes, such as the two elderly men Cruz bludgeoned to death with a hammer. ""Witnessing executions was just part of my job,"" says Lyons, whose cathartic memoir, Death Row: The Final Minutes, which I collaborated on, has just been published. ""I was pro-death penalty, I thought it was the most appropriate punishment for certain crimes. And because I was young and bold, everything was black and white. ""If I had started exploring how the executions made me feel while I was seeing them, gave too much thought to the emotions that were in play, how would I have been able to go back into that room, month after month, year after year?"" Since 1924, every execution in the state has taken place in the small east Texas city of Huntsville. There are seven prisons in Huntsville, including the Walls Unit, an imposing Victorian building which houses the death chamber. Huntsville death chamber, Texas In 1972, the Supreme Court suspended the death penalty on the grounds that it was a cruel and unusual punishment but within months some states were rewriting statutes to reinstate it. Texas brought it back less than two years later and soon adopted lethal injection as its new means of execution. In 1982, Charlie Brooks was the first offender to be put to death by needles. Crime makes Huntsville honest, and has earned it a reputation as the ""capital punishment capital of the world"". Certain journalists, usually from Europe, have written of the pervasive sense of death in the town, but they clearly arrived armed with an agenda. Huntsville is a neat little place, set amid the beautiful Piney Woods, on the buckle of the Bible Belt. There are churches everywhere, the locals are polite, and you could spend a few days in the city without ever knowing it was where bad folk met their maker. Whatever you imagine an execution witness to be like, Lyons isn't it. Over beers in Time Out Sports Bar - the sort of dive you might see on a documentary about a shooting in small-town America - Lyons speaks 19 to the dozen about any subject you fancy. Smart, cultured, and possessing a rapid-fire wit, she makes a mockery of that lazy British stereotype about Americans not doing irony. With Lyons, you bring your A game or get buried. But when the conversation turns to the things she saw in the death chamber, sass gives way to vulnerability and it's not difficult to detect the toll it took. In 2000, Texas carried out 40 executions, a record for the most in a single year by an individual state, and almost as many as the rest of United States combined. Lyons, in her role as a prison reporter for The Huntsville Item, witnessed 38 of them. But her apparent nonchalance, which manifested itself in blithe entries in her journal, was merely a short-term coping mechanism. ""When I look at my execution notes now, I can see that things bothered me. But any misgivings I had, I shoved into a suitcase in my mind, which I kicked into a corner. It was the numbness that preserved me and kept me going."" Reading those early journal entries, it's the mundanities that jump out at you. Carl Heiselbetz Jr, who murdered a mother and her daughter, was still wearing his glasses on the gurney. Betty Lou Beets, who buried husbands in her garden as if they were dead pets, had tiny little feet. Thomas Mason, who murdered his wife's mother and grandmother, looked like Lyons' grandfather. The Americans volunteering to watch executions ""Watching the final moments of someone's life and their soul leaving their body never becomes mundane or normal. But Texas was executing offenders with such frequency that it had perfected it and removed the theatre."" That is not to say Lyons took her job lightly. And when she joined TDCJ's public information office in 2001, her duties became more onerous. Now, Lyons wasn't only telling the people of Huntsville, she was telling the rest of the United States - and the world - what went on in the Texas death chamber. Lyons described the procedure as like watching someone going to sleep, which was a great disappointment to some victims' loved ones, who thought ""Old Sparky"" - the electric chair, by which 361 offenders were put to death between 1924 and 1964 - put on a better show than the less theatrical lethal injection. The room where lethal injections take place But she also had to relay the desperate pleas for forgiveness, the anguished apologies and outlandish claims of innocence, as well as Biblical passages, quotes from rock songs, even the occasional joke (in 2000, Billy Hughes went out with, ""If I'm paying my debt to society, I am due a rebate and a refund""). Rarely did Lyons hear anger, and only once did she hear an inmate sobbing. She heard the sounds of offenders' last breaths - a cough, or a gasp, or a rattle - as the drugs did their work and their lungs collapsed, pushing the air out like a set of bellows. And after the inmate had died, she watched them turn purple. Lyons received letters and emails from all over the world, from people condemning her for taking part in ""state sponsored murder"". Sometimes she wrote back, angrily telling them to keep their noses out of Texas' business. Is the death penalty dying out in the US? ""Pretty much the whole world beyond America thought it was weird that we were still putting people to death. European journalists would often use the word 'killing' instead of 'executing'. They thought we were murdering people."" There were occasional circuses, such as when Gary Graham was put to death in 2000 and the world's media descended on Huntsville, along with Jesse Jackson, Bianca Jagger, the New Black Panthers, toting AK-47s, and the Ku Klux Klan, in full regalia. Graham robbed 13 different victims in less than a week, pistol-whipped two of them, shot one in the neck and struck another with the car he was stealing from him. The final victim in his spree was kidnapped, robbed and raped. None of this is disputed, because Graham pleaded guilty to the charges. However, he denied committing a murder at the start of his rampage. Lyons thought there were more deserving poster boys for the anti-death penalty movement. The execution of Gary Graham sparked bitter protests in Huntsville in 2000 But sometimes, an offender's last moments were witnessed by a few prison staff and a sole journalist from the Associated Press. As the drugs started flowing, there were no loved ones, either of the offender or his victims, to see him die. Even the local newspaper might not send a reporter. The state was carrying out the ultimate bureaucratic act on their doorstep and most of the citizens of Huntsville had no idea it was happening. A condemned man or woman might be on death row for decades, so Lyons got to know some of them well, including serial killers, child murderers and rapists. Not all of them were monsters, and she came to like a few of them, and she even thought they might have been friends, had they met in the free world. After Napoleon Beazley, who was only 17 when he murdered the father of a federal judge, was executed in 2002, Lyons cried all the way home. ""Not only did I get the sense that Napoleon wouldn't have been in any more trouble, I thought he could have been a productive member of society. ""I was rooting for him to win his appeals, but felt guilty about feeling that way. It was a heinous crime, and had I been the victim's family, I'd have absolutely wanted Napoleon to be executed. Did I have any right to feel sympathy for Napoleon, when Napoleon hadn't taken anything from me?"" This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs But it was when Lyons became pregnant in 2004 that ambivalence began to set in and the mask began to slip. ""Executions ceased to be an abstract concept and became deeply personal. I started to worry that my baby could hear the inmates' last words, their pitiful apologies, their desperate claims of innocence, their sputtering and snoring. ""When I had my daughter, executions became things I dreaded. Usually, any emotion would come from the inmate's witness room, because while the victim's family had had a long time to process their loss, the inmate's family were watching a loved one die. They were just setting out on a long, hard road. ""I had a baby at home that I would do anything for, and these women were watching their babies die. I'd hear moms sobbing, yelling, pounding the glass, kicking the wall. ""I'd be standing in the witness room thinking: 'There are no winners, everybody is being screwed over'. Executions were just sad situations all round. And I had to witness all that sadness, over and over again."" This video can not be played The US executioner who wants the death penalty abolished Lyons soldiered on for another seven years, watching inmate after inmate walk to their death with an unsettling docility, until a bitter divorce from TDCJ, which resulted in her winning a case for gender discrimination. As well as heartbroken, Lyons felt lost, like a prisoner escaped after a lengthy sentence. ""I thought being away from the prison system would make me think about the things I'd seen less, but it was quite the opposite. I'd think about it all the time. It was like I'd taken the lid off Pandora's Box and I couldn't put it back on. ""I'd open a bag of chips and smell the death chamber, or something on the radio would remind me of a conversation I'd had with an inmate, hours before he was executed. Or I'd see the wrinkled hands of Ricky McGinn's mother, pressed against the glass of the death chamber, and I'd dissolve into tears."" There are signs that Texas is losing its appetite for the ultimate punishment. The last major poll in the state, in 2013, revealed that 74% of Texans supported the death penalty, so the death chamber is unlikely to be dismantled any time soon. How US death penalty capital changed its mind However, seven executions took place in Huntsville last year, the same as 2016 and a long way down from the record 40 in 2000. But while Lyons believes Texas has employed the death penalty too often, she remains a supporter, at least for the worst of the worst. And Texas, as Lyons concedes, still does crime ""bigger and crazier"" than anywhere else in the US. In the Joe Byrd Cemetery, a pretty plot of land where unclaimed Texas prisoners have been buried for more than 150 years, Lyons stands among the rows of crosses and wonders how many of these men she saw die. But it's not the executions she remembers that trouble her most, it's those she's forgotten. ""You don't see many flowers on the graves here,"" says Lyons. ""And what does it say about me that I can't recall some of those men I saw executed? Maybe they deserve to be lonely and forgotten. Or maybe it's my job to remember."" Update 22nd May 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that Michelle Lyons' new book was written with Ben Dirs.

"Travellers from affluent countries are a key part of emissions growth in tourism A new study says global tourism accounts for 8% of carbon emissions, around three times greater than previous estimates. The new assessment is bigger because it includes emissions from travel, plus the full life-cycle of carbon in tourists' food, hotels and shopping. Driving the increase are visitors from affluent countries who travel to other wealthy destinations. The US tops the rankings followed by China, Germany and India. Tourism is a huge and booming global industry worth over $7 trillion, and employs one in ten workers around the world. It's growing at around 4% per annum. Previous estimates of the impact of all this travel on carbon suggested that tourism accounted for 2.5-3% of emissions. However in what is claimed to be the most comprehensive assessment to date, this new study examines the global carbon flows between 160 countries between 2009 and 2013. It shows that the total is closer to 8% of the global figure. As well as air travel, the authors say they have included an analysis of the energy needed to support the tourism system, including all the food, beverage, infrastructure construction and maintenance as well as the retail services that tourists enjoy. ""It definitely is eye opening,"" Dr Arunima Malik from the University of Sydney, who's the lead author of the study, told BBC News. ""We looked at really detailed information about tourism expenditure, including consumables such as food from eating out and souvenirs. We looked at the trade between different countries and also at greenhouse gas emissions data to come up with a comprehensive figure for the global carbon footprint for tourism."" The researchers also looked at the impacts in both the countries where tourists came from and where they travelled. They found that the most important element was relatively well off people from affluent countries travelling to other well to do destinations. In the leading countries, US, China, Germany and India, much of the travel was domestic. Travellers from Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark exert a much higher carbon footprint elsewhere than in their own countries. Small island states like the Maldives are hugely dependent on long distance tourism When richer people travel they tend to spend more on higher carbon transportation, food and pursuits says Dr Malik. ""If you have visitors from high income countries then they typically spend heavily on air travel, on shopping and hospitality where they go to. But if the travellers are from low income countries then they spend more on public transport and unprocessed food, the spending patterns are different for the different economies they come from."" When measuring per capita emissions, small island destinations such as the Maldives, Cyprus and the Seychelles emerge as the leading lights. In these countries tourism is responsible for up to 80% of their annual emissions. ""The small island states are in a difficult position because we like travelling to these locations and those small island states very much rely on tourist income but they are also at the same time vulnerable to the effects of rising seas and climate change,"" said Dr Malik. Demand for international tourism is also being seen in emerging countries like Brazil, India, China and Mexico, highlighting a fundamental problem - wealth. The report underlines the fact that when people earn more than $40,000 per annum, their carbon footprint from tourism increase 13% for every 10% rise in income. The consumption of tourism does ""not appear to satiate as incomes grow,"" the report says. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) has welcomed the research but doesn't accept that the industry's efforts to cut carbon have been a flop. As countries get wealthier their citizens' appetite for global travel rapidly increases ""It would be unfair to say that the industry is not doing anything,"" said Rochelle Turner, director of research at WTTC. ""We've seen a growing number of hotels, airports and tour operators that have all become carbon neutral so there is a momentum."" Experts say that offsetting, where tourists spend money on planting trees to mitigate their carbon footprint will have to increase, despite reservations about its effectiveness. Awareness is also the key. The WTTC say that the recent water crisis in Cape Town has also helped people recognise that changes in climate can impact resources like water. ""There is a real need for people to recognise what their impact is in a destination,"" said Rochelle Turner, ""and how much water, waste and energy you should be using compared to the local population."" ""All of this will empower tourists to make better decisions and only through those better decisions that we'll be able to tackle the issue of climate change.""

"President Mattarella urged parties to rally behind a ""neutral government"" Italy's coalition-building talks have failed, leaving the country facing fresh elections or a neutral caretaker government until the end of the year. President Sergio Mattarella said on Monday that those were the only two options left after a third round of negotiations were unsuccessful. No single party or alliance won a majority in the March general election. The most influential parties, Five Star and The League, favour a new vote in July. Mr Mattarella has the final say. Following the latest round of talks aimed at forming a coalition, the biggest single party, the anti-establishment Five Star movement, could not agree on joining forces either with the right-wing alliance of Forza Italia and The League or with the centre-left Democratic Party. Previous attempts to break the deadlock since the inconclusive result on 4 March also came to nothing, with the parties' starting positions reportedly remaining unchanged. Italy's vote: Who's who and why it matters What does Italy's election result mean? In a televised public statement on Monday, Mr Mattarella urged party leaders to rally behind a ""neutral government"" after conceding that there would be no coalition deal. ""We can't wait any longer,"" he said. ""Let the parties decide of their own free will if they should give full powers to a government... or else new elections in the month of July or the autumn."" A caretaker administration would be made up of policy experts appointed by the president. It would have the responsibility of drawing up a 2019 budget with the aim of avoiding the possible ""recessionary effects"" of a scheduled increase in sales taxes later in the year, Mr Marrarella said. Such a government would run until the end of the year and would then dissolve ahead of elections to be held at the start of 2019, Mr Mattarella added. However, neither the Five Star movement nor The League have yet shown any interest in supporting the move. Populist leaders promise Italians tax cuts Italy election: What does the result mean?

"This video can not be played A support vehicle crashed through a traffic island during the final stage of the race. A Tour de Yorkshire race marshal who had to leap out of the path of a support car said he had a sleepless night wondering how the car missed. Phillip Sullivan was volunteering in Leeds on the final stage of the four-day race when the crash occurred. A car for the Astana race team narrowly missed him as it went over the traffic island he was standing on. Mr Sullivan was unhurt and said he did not want the crash to ""tarnish the Tour de Yorkshire"". He was working as a flag marshal behind a bollard on the traffic island to warn cyclists of the hazard. Mr Sullivan, 35,  said: ""I am still thinking how close it was, but luckily I do not have a scratch."" Phillip Sullivan said he would volunteer to work at the event again After the near-miss he composed himself and took his place again because he ""knew the riders were coming and I had a job to do"". He said: ""But I do want it investigated, I don't want something like this to ever happen again and it to lead to someone getting killed."" A spokesperson for Welcome to Yorkshire - one of the organisers of the race - said it had ""launched an immediate investigation to determine the facts of exactly what happened"". The final stage started at the Piece Hall in Halifax Mr Sullivan revealed his mother was watching the race further down the road and saw the crash. She only realised he was unhurt when he took his place again. ""It felt like it was in slow motion and it was sheer luck the car missed,"" he said. Mr Sullivan said he had watched a video of his near-miss and worried about the driver of the car. The Luxembourg-basedAstana team said it was ""deeply sorry""and has telephoned Mr Sullivan.

"Two recent cases of rape that made headlines have sparked massive outrage in India A 17-year-old girl in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand is in a critical condition after she was raped and then set on fire, police say. A local man has been arrested in connection with the attack. It is the second such incident to be reported in Jharkhand in recent days - another teenage girl who police say was raped and burned alive died on Sunday. Police have not indicated the two cases are connected. They come as India reels from a string of violent sexual crimes. One of them involves an eight-year-old Kashmiri Muslim girl who was gang raped, drugged and murdered in January. The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the trial of eight men, all of them Hindus, who have been arrested in the case must be held in Punjab because of the deep divisions between the communities. In the latest case in Jharkhand, the girl is undergoing treatment in hospital after suffering 95% burn injuries, police told BBC Hindi's Ravi Prakash. ""The accused told us that he wanted to marry the victim but she wasn't ready,"" police officer Shailendra Barnwal said. They added that he attacked her on Friday in her relative's house in a village in Pakur district. The accused lived close by. Police say the suspect's marriage request had been spurned According to the police, he waited until she was alone, then broke into the house and raped her before setting her alight. Neighbours reportedly rushed to the house on hearing her screams and took her to hospital. India outrage spreads over rape of eight-year-old girl Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating The main suspect and 14 others have already been arrested in connection with the earlier rape and burning case in the state. It took place in Chatra district, about 380km (236 miles) from Pakur, late on Friday. The shocking case in Kashmir and another in Uttar Pradesh state have caused outrage in India. Following protests, the cabinet approved the introduction of the death penalty for people convicted of raping children. A number of serious crimes in India carry the death penalty, but raping a child was not among them until now. About 40,000 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. Many cases, however, are believed to go unreported because of the stigma that is attached to rape and sexual assault.

"Travellers from affluent countries are a key part of emissions growth in tourism A new study says global tourism accounts for 8% of carbon emissions, around three times greater than previous estimates. The new assessment is bigger because it includes emissions from travel, plus the full life-cycle of carbon in tourists' food, hotels and shopping. Driving the increase are visitors from affluent countries who travel to other wealthy destinations. The US tops the rankings followed by China, Germany and India. Tourism is a huge and booming global industry worth over $7 trillion, and employs one in ten workers around the world. It's growing at around 4% per annum. Previous estimates of the impact of all this travel on carbon suggested that tourism accounted for 2.5-3% of emissions. However in what is claimed to be the most comprehensive assessment to date, this new study examines the global carbon flows between 160 countries between 2009 and 2013. It shows that the total is closer to 8% of the global figure. As well as air travel, the authors say they have included an analysis of the energy needed to support the tourism system, including all the food, beverage, infrastructure construction and maintenance as well as the retail services that tourists enjoy. ""It definitely is eye opening,"" Dr Arunima Malik from the University of Sydney, who's the lead author of the study, told BBC News. ""We looked at really detailed information about tourism expenditure, including consumables such as food from eating out and souvenirs. We looked at the trade between different countries and also at greenhouse gas emissions data to come up with a comprehensive figure for the global carbon footprint for tourism."" The researchers also looked at the impacts in both the countries where tourists came from and where they travelled. They found that the most important element was relatively well off people from affluent countries travelling to other well to do destinations. In the leading countries, US, China, Germany and India, much of the travel was domestic. Travellers from Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark exert a much higher carbon footprint elsewhere than in their own countries. Small island states like the Maldives are hugely dependent on long distance tourism When richer people travel they tend to spend more on higher carbon transportation, food and pursuits says Dr Malik. ""If you have visitors from high income countries then they typically spend heavily on air travel, on shopping and hospitality where they go to. But if the travellers are from low income countries then they spend more on public transport and unprocessed food, the spending patterns are different for the different economies they come from."" When measuring per capita emissions, small island destinations such as the Maldives, Cyprus and the Seychelles emerge as the leading lights. In these countries tourism is responsible for up to 80% of their annual emissions. ""The small island states are in a difficult position because we like travelling to these locations and those small island states very much rely on tourist income but they are also at the same time vulnerable to the effects of rising seas and climate change,"" said Dr Malik. Demand for international tourism is also being seen in emerging countries like Brazil, India, China and Mexico, highlighting a fundamental problem - wealth. The report underlines the fact that when people earn more than $40,000 per annum, their carbon footprint from tourism increase 13% for every 10% rise in income. The consumption of tourism does ""not appear to satiate as incomes grow,"" the report says. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) has welcomed the research but doesn't accept that the industry's efforts to cut carbon have been a flop. As countries get wealthier their citizens' appetite for global travel rapidly increases ""It would be unfair to say that the industry is not doing anything,"" said Rochelle Turner, director of research at WTTC. ""We've seen a growing number of hotels, airports and tour operators that have all become carbon neutral so there is a momentum."" Experts say that offsetting, where tourists spend money on planting trees to mitigate their carbon footprint will have to increase, despite reservations about its effectiveness. Awareness is also the key. The WTTC say that the recent water crisis in Cape Town has also helped people recognise that changes in climate can impact resources like water. ""There is a real need for people to recognise what their impact is in a destination,"" said Rochelle Turner, ""and how much water, waste and energy you should be using compared to the local population."" ""All of this will empower tourists to make better decisions and only through those better decisions that we'll be able to tackle the issue of climate change.""

"Gina Haspel is a 33-year CIA veteran President Donald Trump has defended his nominee to head the CIA after she offered to withdraw amid concern over her role in harsh interrogation techniques widely seen as torture. Mr Trump said Gina Haspel had ""come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists"". Ms Haspel, who faces a tough Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, has now decided not to withdraw. The tight 51-49 party split in the Senate makes confirmation uncertain. CIA director Gina Haspel's Thailand torture ties Who is Gina Haspel? The post became vacant after Mike Pompeo was appointed secretary of state last month. Ms Haspel would be the first woman to head the CIA if confirmed.

She has been at the CIA for 33 years, almost entirely undercover but most recently as deputy director, and her time at the agency covered the period when techniques that included waterboarding were used in a controversial interrogation programme for terrorist suspects. Ms Haspel herself ran a so-called ""black site"" in Thailand, a secretive overseas prison where such interrogations were carried out. The Washington Post says she was summoned to the White House,externalon Friday by officials worried about her previous support for the techniques. It was at that meeting she apparently indicated her interest in withdrawing, reportedly fearing the Senate questioning could damage her reputation and the CIA's. She also apparently feared repeating the fate of Ronny Jackson,who withdrew his nomination for Veterans Affairs secretary amid questions over alleged past misconduct. Her misgivings prompted senior White House aides, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, to rush later on Friday to meet her at CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia. The Post said it was not until Saturday that Ms Haspel decided to remain the nominee. The Senate confirmation hearing will not be easy and Ms Haspel has been preparing for it with mock questioning at CIA HQ. Democrats will be sure to raise the question of her role in the interrogation programme and some have said she should be disqualified because of her actions at the Thailand site. She has reportedly said she would firmly oppose the reintroduction of any such programme,something Mr Trump has hinted at in the past. Another line of questioning could concern the destruction of videotapes showing al-Qaeda suspects being submitted to the interrogation techniques. Ms Haspel drafted the cable that ordered their destruction in 2005, although her boss, Jose Rodriguez, reportedly sent it without her knowledge or that of then CIA director Porter Goss. She certainly has her supporters. Ms Sanders earlier tweeted: ""There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel."" CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani told the Post that those who had worked with Ms Haspel ""almost uniformly support her"" and would ""finally have a chance to see the true Gina Haspel on Wednesday"". But human rights organisation Reprieve said Ms Haspel was ""not fit"" to run the CIA. The 51-49 Republican-Democrat split in the Senate makes her confirmation vulnerable, particularly with the longstanding absence of John McCain, who is ill. The Post said some advisers had told Mr Trump her confirmation was unlikely.

Rhyheim's death came less than 24 hours beforetwo other teenage boys were shot on Sundayon a street in north-west London. A 13-year-old boy suffered a shotgun pellet wound to the head and was later discharged from hospital. A 15-year-old was also injured in a gun attack and remains in hospital being treated for a head injury. Police said a third victim was also hit in the arm, but has not come forward. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said they were investigating whether the incidents, which occurred at two separate locations on Wealdstone High Street, were linked. Harrow Borough Commander Det Ch Supt Simon Rose added: ""This was a callous, reckless and brazen act, without any thought by those responsible for the fact that there were families with children and people in the high street enjoying their weekend. ""This was quite simply, appalling."" A 39-year-old man was arrested on Sunday and has now been released under investigation. The two boys were shot on Wealdstone High Street In a separate attack, a 22-year-old suffered non life-threatening wounds in a shooting in New Cross Road, Lewisham, at about 18:30. There have been no arrests in any of the cases. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the Met could take short-term measures, such as increasing the number of officers on patrol and using stop and search powers, to deter people carrying weapons. However, he said, it would be down to politicians and community leaders to tackle the longer-term issue of violence on the capital's streets. Elsewhere, two men died in stabbings in Liverpool and Luton during the bank holiday weekend. A 20-year-old man, who was stabbed in Liverpool city centre early on Sunday,has been named as Fatah Warsame, from Cardiff. Another victim, also aged 20,was killed in Bishopscote Road in Lutonon Sunday evening. Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: ""Enough. Enough. My heart goes out to families grieving children and teenagers. So many shattered lives, families and communities."" Official statistics released,externalin April showed the number of homicides in London had surged by 44% in the last year. The number rose from 109 to 157 - eight of which were a result of the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. More than 60 people have been killed in the capital this year - of which about half were the result of stabbings. A former Met Police Superintendent, Leroy Logan, said the ""growing crisis"" had seen ""younger and younger people"" being groomed by negative peer groups and gangs. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that education was the key to stopping young people buying into ""the thug life and all the glamorisation of that sort of violent lifestyle"". Criminologist Anthony Gunter, from the University of East London, said the government didn't ""have a real handle or understanding of what's going on and what to do about it"". Former gang member Darryl Laycock, who has been shot on three occasions and stabbed seven times, said he lost more than 30 of his friends to gun crime. His work includes trying to divert young people away from street violence.

Independent watchdog Transport Focus took the views of more than 28,000 people at 56 stations for its ranking. Only 58% of travellers were ""satisfied"" with Queen Street, Scotland's third busiest station. Glasgow Central nearby made the top 10 with a 91% approval. London King's Cross achieved a 96% score and was the most popular station, just above neighbouring St Pancras.

"Jean-Marc Janaillac tendered his resignation after staff at the airline rejected a new pay deal. Shares in Air France fell 14% in early Monday trading, reacting to the latest events at the troubled airline. It was the first chance investors had had to respond to chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac's resignation and comments by France's economy minister. Mr Janaillac's move came after staff at the loss-making airline rejected a new pay deal and continued their industrial action in pursuit of a 5.1% pay rise. And on Sunday, minister Bruno Le Maire warned Air France could ""disappear"". The French government owns 14.3% of the Air France-KLM parent group. Monday's walk-out is the 14th day of action. Despite the strike, the airline insisted that it would be able to maintain 99% of long-haul flights on Monday, 80% of medium-haul services and 87% of short-haul flights. The government's response is seen as a test oflabour reforms launched by French President Emmanuel Macron. There have also been strikes at the state-owned SNCF rail company. Mr Le Maire told French news channel BFM TV: ""I call on everyone to be responsible: crew, ground staff, and pilots who are asking for unjustified pay hikes. ""The survival of Air France is in the balance,"" he said, adding that the state would not serve as a backstop for the airline's debts. ""Air France will disappear if it does not make the necessary efforts to be  competitive,"" he warned. Employees of Air France-KLM's French operations have staged a series of strikes in recent days Air France-KLM reported a net loss of â¬269m (Â£238m) in the first quarter of the year. British Airways and Lufthansa have already undergone heavy cost-cutting in recent years, amid rising competition from low-cost airlines and carriers from the Gulf states. But many analysts say Air France has lagged far behind in restructuring and has failed to address its continued losses. The group has already downgraded expectations of its financial performance for 2018. Air France merged with Dutch carrier KLM in 2004. The joint company flies tens of millions of passengers around the world every year.

"Australia's koala population has been under pressure due to loss of habitat The state of New South Wales in Australia (NSW) is to spend A$45m ($34m; Â£25m) protecting one of its most iconic creatures - the koala. The money will be used to establish forest reserves and build a hospital to care for the sick and injured animals. There will also be adjustments to roadkill hotspots as many koalas are killed by cars. The koala's decline has been blamed on habitat loss, dog attacks and climate change. Almost 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of state forest will become a koala habitat, for the animals to breed freely.

"MPs are calling for the government to enshrine in law the right for grandparents to see their grandchildren after a divorce. They want an amendment to the Children Act, which would include a child's right to have a close relationship with members of their extended family. The change would also cover aunts and uncles seeing nieces and nephews. The Ministry of Justice said it would consider the proposal. The current rules mean relatives have to apply to court to gain access rights to a child and then have a child arrangement order - or CAO - put in place. Are grandparents spoiling kids? Grandparents 'run up debts' to care for grandchildren The issue was debated in parliament last week, with MPs sharing experiences of their constituents. Conservative MP Nigel Huddleston said he knew of grandparents who had been accused of harassment and were visited by police after sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts to their grandchildren. He said: ""Divorce and family breakdown can take an emotional toll on all involved, but the family dynamic that is all too often overlooked is that between grandparents and their grandchildren. ""When access to grandchildren is blocked, some grandparents call it a kind of living bereavement."" Labour's Darren Jones read out a statement from a couple in his Bristol constituency who had not seen their grandchild for 11 years, saying how the experience had been ""heartbreaking"" for them. He told the BBC: ""I had no idea this was a problem before I became an MP as there is just a presumption that grandparents have a right to see their grandchildren. ""It was only when Jane Jackson (who founded the Bristol Grandparents Support Group) walked into my surgery and I heard their story.... the sheer heartbreak of it... that I knew, and joined them in their call for action."" Mr Jones said there was now cross-party support for a change to the law. ""My expectation is there will be change and things have moved forward, but that is down to the work of those campaigners,"" he added. This video can not be played Jane Jackson, of the Bristol Grandparents Support Group, says some  grandparents were suicidal However, Conservative MP Tim Loughton - a former children's minister who has argued for the rights for a number of years - said grandparents ""shouldn't hold their breath"". ""There is unfinished businesses here, with so many control orders themselves being flouted, and no presumption of rights for grandparents,"" he told the BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Why Donald Trump could deserve Nobel Peace Prize UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has appealed to US President Donald Trump on his favourite morning TV show not to tear up the Iran nuclear deal. Appearing on Fox & Friends, Mr Johnson urged the president not to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"". While in Washington, Mr Johnson met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but he did not get to see the president. Mr Trump later said he would announce his decision on the Iran nuclear accord on Tuesday afternoon. He has until 12 May to decide whether to stick with the pact - which he has called ""insane"". Under the international deal, the Islamic Republic has limited its nuclear activities in return for eased economic sanctions. What is the Iran nuclear deal? Is Iran's economy better off since the nuclear deal? Could the deal collapse? Appearing on Fox & Friends on Monday morning, the British foreign secretary said Mr Trump was ""right to see the flaws in the deal"", though he argued they could be fixed. The foreign secretary said without the accord, ""Plan B does not seem, to me, to be particularly well developed at this stage"". This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? He said: ""If you do that you have to answer the question what next? What if the Iranians do rush for a nuclear weapon? ""Are we seriously saying that we are going to bomb those facilities at Fordo and Natanz? ""Is that really a realistic possibility? Or do we work round what we have got and push back on Iran together?"" Mr Johnson added: ""There doesn't seem to me at the moment to be a viable military solution."" In a separate interview during the visit, Mr Johnson raised the prospect of Mr Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize. ""If he can fix North Korea and if he can fix the Iran nuclear deal then I don't see why he is any less of a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama, who got it before he even did anything,"" Mr Johnson told Sky News. Mr Johnsonalso wrote a New York Times op-ed,externalarguing that ""only Iran would gain"" from abandoning nuclear restrictions that ""handcuff"" the Islamic Republic. Shortly before promising a decision on the deal on Tuesday, Mr Trump accused former Secretary of State John Kerry of conducting ""possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy"" on the Iran deal. The suggestion of illegal activity could be a reference to the Logan Act, a more than 200-year-old law aimed at stopping US citizens conducting foreign affairs without the permission of the US government.

"The deliberate killing of one human being by another is a crime that defies easy characterisation. Among the more than 50 tragedies that make up the current spike in homicides in the capital this year are some that may be premeditated or gang-related, but most will be unpredictable acts of violence in moments of mental anguish, involving a victim and a perpetrator who are well known to each other - family disputes or an argument between friends. By far the most likely year of life in which we might be unlawfully killed is not in our teens or early 20s but our first year - babies under one are more than twice as likely to be murdered as a 20-year-old. That is why it is far too simplistic to draw a direct link between the number of killings and the number of Bobbies on the beat. Cuts to police budgets may be less relevant than cuts to mental health provision. In tackling gang activity, there is good evidence that a psychiatric health approach may be more effective than a tough criminal justice response, which can thwart individual acts of violence, but may also infect communities with resentment and distrust - the breeding ground of gangsters. Analysis of a survey of more than 4,600 young men in the UK, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, found those involved with gangs showed ""inordinately high levels of psychiatric morbidity, placing a heavy burden on mental health services"". The authors concluded that ""healthcare professionals may have an important role in promoting desistence from gang activity"". Teenager dies in latest London attack The faces of those killed in London Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? Separate research involving long and detailed interviews with 16 men on death row in the US found all had experienced family violence. Fourteen of the men had been ""severely physically abused as children by a family member"". Three of them had been beaten unconscious. Twelve of the death row inmates had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. The World Health Organization in Europe found a similar link: ""Exposure to violence and mental trauma in childhood is associated with atypical neurodevelopment and subsequent information-processing biases, leading to poor attachment, aggression and violent behaviour. Children who experience neglect and maltreatment from parents are at greater risk for aggressive and antisocial behaviour and violent offending in later life."" Killing can be contagious. The murder of one young person can raise fear levels on the street, making it more likely others will carry weapons to protect themselves. And more likely they will use them. This video can not be played Fact checking murder statistics in London vs New York In the US and increasingly in the UK, in places like Glasgow, agencies are successfully reducing gang violence by treating it in the same way they'd respond to a public health emergency, looking to disrupt the spread of a deadly virus. Karyn McCluskey, a former director of Violence Reduction Unit set up by Strathclyde police, says it is about identifying the people at risk. ""We need to interrupt because some people are very angry and sometimes they'll be on their phone, plotting their revenge,"" she says. ""Often these are people that need to be rehoused, who need drug addiction services, so it's about connecting them to all the other services that are out there and staying with them."" The general murder rate, though, is immune to quick and easy interventions. Declining for centuries, it is a reflection of deeper trends - society's relationship to violence and the mental resilience of a population. Back in the Middle Ages, according to analysis of English coroners' records and 'eyre rolls' (accounts of visits by justice officials), the rate was around 35/100,000. This is equivalent to the homicide level in contemporary Colombia or the Congo. From the middle of the 16th Century, the homicide rate starts to fall steeply, a dramatic reduction in risk that is maintained for 200 years. The development of a statutory justice system is often cited - but it was also a period in which society found alternative ways of dealing with dispute and discontent. For Europe's elite, the duel emerged as a controlled and respectable way of responding to an insult against one's honour. Spontaneous violence became disreputable for gentlemen of standing while personal discipline and restraint were seen as the marks of a civilised individual. Are black knife deaths being ignored? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence The murder rate continued to fall, if less steeply, during the 19th and 20th Centuries as state control and social policies increased. It was also partly a consequence of young men being given a substitute for interpersonal violence to demonstrate their masculinity - organised sport. Boxing, for example, developed from bare-knuckled no-holds-barred brawls to disciplined contests governed by a strict code and overseen by a referee.  The 'Queensbury Rules', introduced into British boxing in 1867, became shorthand for sportsmanship and fair play. Society at all levels increasingly valued the virtue of self-control. Close study of the vital signs of British society reveal a slight rise in the homicide rate over the past 50 years, but in historical terms the figures are still so low that a single appalling occurrence - a terrorist attack or the murderous activity of a serial killer like Dr Harold Shipman - can skew the data. In international terms, the UK is among the less likely spots to be murdered: our homicide rate is broadly in line with other European nations (a little higher than Germany but slightly lower than France) and roughly a quarter of the level in the US. It is right to be alarmed by the spate of tragic murders in London this year, but just as the cause of such killings are complex, the solutions to societal violence are complex too.

"President Donald Trump has ended the United States's participation in a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and begun reimposing sanctions. The 2015 accord - his predecessor Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievement - saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),externalwas agreed by Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany (the P5+1). Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief It sets limits to Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - until 2031 and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium until 2026. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy-water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. The deal was endorsed bySecurity Council resolution 2231,externaland its implementation began on January 2016, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Iran had fulfilled its key commitments. Iran nuclear deal: Key details In a televised address in May,the president denounced the JCPOA as a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"".,external Rather than protecting the US and its allies, it had placed ""very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity and no limits at all on its other malign behaviour, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen and other places all around the world"", he said. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said intelligence documents published by Israel in April had proven that ""at the heart of the Iran deal is a fiction that Iran only desired a peaceful nuclear energy programme"". Iranian officials have consistently insisted their intentions are peaceful. The president added that the accord's so-called ""sunset clauses"" - under which key limits on Iran's nuclear programme will start to expire - were ""totally unacceptable""; that it did not deal with Iran's development of ballistic missiles; and that its mechanism for inspections and verification was not strong enough. Three reasons behind Trump ditching Iran deal The president vowed to ""find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution"" that would ""include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile programme, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East"". ""Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal, they refuse and that's fine,"" he said. ""But the fact is, they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people."" This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? In August, he signed an executive order that reimposed sanctions,externaltargeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be reinstated on Iran's port operators, and the energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors. Also affected are Iran's petroleum-related transactions, and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran. Mr Trump called them ""the most biting sanctions ever imposed"" and warned that ""anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the United States"". Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played US vows 'unprecedented pressure on Iran' US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set out 12 ""requirements"" for a new nuclear accord,externaland the lifting of US sanctions in May. He demanded that Iran: Declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear programme, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity. Stop uranium enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing Provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites End its proliferation of ballistic missiles and stop launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems Release all US citizens detained on spurious charges. End its support to Middle Eastern terrorist groups Respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming and demobilization of Iraqi Shia militias End its military support for the Yemen's rebel Houthi movement Withdraw all forces under Iranian command from Syria End support for the Taleban and other militant groups in Afghanistan, and cease harbouring senior al-Qaeda leaders End the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force's support for terrorists outside Iran End its threatening behaviour against neighbouring countries, including Israel In July, Mr Trump told a news conference that he would ""certainly meet"" his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, to discuss a new deal. He also said there would be ""no preconditions"", but the White House later insisted that the Iranian government would first have to ""change its behaviour in the ways we've identified"". Mr Rouhani insisted there could be no talks as long as the US was reneging on its commitments under the JCPOA. This video can not be played President Rouhani on US decision: 'Iran will wait and see how others react' President Rouhani declared in May that the US had ""officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty"". But he stressed that the deal could survive if other parties continued to honour their commitments,external. If that was not possible, he warned, Iran would step up uranium enrichment and restart other curbed nuclear activities. When the US reinstated the first batch of economic sanctions, Mr Rouhani accused the Trump administration of pursuing ""psychological warfare"" intended to ""sow division among Iranians"". The US will reimpose sanctions on Iran's central bank, intended to target its oil exports The foreign ministers of Germany, the UK and France meanwhile released ajoint statement along with the European Union's foreign policy chief saying the nuclear deal was working,externaland remained ""crucial for the security of Europe, the [Middle East], and the entire world"". They also unveiled a ""blocking statute"",externalintended to mitigate the impact of the US sanctions on European firms doing legitimate business with Iran. However, a senior US official said it was ""not particularly concerned"" by the move. The EU previously insisted that it is ""not in the hands of any single country"" to terminate a deal that has been endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution. IAEA inspectors have certified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related commitments The IAEA has said it has the ""world's most robust verification regime in place in Iran"",external, and itsinspectors have certified 10 times since 2016 that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related commitments,externalunder the JCPOA. However, the watchdog has recorded several technical violations. For instance,Iran has twice exceeded its heavy-water production cap,external. In both cases, Iran shipped the excess out of the country. The IAEA has also said its inspectors were granted access to all locations they needed to visit in 2017. However, they did not seek to enter any military sites, which Iranian officials declared off-limits -a move the US said raised doubts over Iranian compliance,external. The US and European powers also say Iran has carried out ballistic missile tests in violation of resolution 2231. It ""calls upon"" Iran not to ""undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons"". Iran denies that it has tested such missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Iran of violating the JCPOA by failing to declare to the IAEA that it had sought to build a nuclear weapon. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive In April, he presented Iranian files obtained by Israeli intelligence, which he said proved Iran had lied when denying the existence of a secret nuclear weapons programme before 2003,external. Israel itself is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal, though it has neither confirmed nor denied this.

However, it is also important that we are sun safe. She suggests the following: Stay out of the sun when it is at its hottest (between 11:00 and 15:00 BST) Try to cover up as much as possible - wear a hat Apply plenty of sunscreen, particularly with children as their skin is a lot more sensitive. Re-apply sunscreen every one to two hours Drink lots of fluids Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Vet Dr Simon Constable says sun safety is as important for pets, and suggests the following key pointers: Use non-toxic pet sunscreen, particularly on pale-coloured pets, such as horses and dogs Give animals plenty of water to keep them hydrated - check their water is full all the time Consider buying booties to keep pets' paws and feet safe from getting burned on hot sand or hot pavements Let them have a swim if possible If travelling in a car with animals, stop regularly and give them frequent drinks of water Never leave pets in a car You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

"Gina Haspel is a 33-year CIA veteran President Donald Trump has defended his nominee to head the CIA after she offered to withdraw amid concern over her role in harsh interrogation techniques widely seen as torture. Mr Trump said Gina Haspel had ""come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists"". Ms Haspel, who faces a tough Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, has now decided not to withdraw. The tight 51-49 party split in the Senate makes confirmation uncertain. CIA director Gina Haspel's Thailand torture ties Who is Gina Haspel? The post became vacant after Mike Pompeo was appointed secretary of state last month. Ms Haspel would be the first woman to head the CIA if confirmed. The president offered his strong support for Ms Haspel in a tweet on Monday, ending it with: ""Win Gina!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She has been at the CIA for 33 years, almost entirely undercover but most recently as deputy director, and her time at the agency covered the period when techniques that included waterboarding were used in a controversial interrogation programme for terrorist suspects. Ms Haspel herself ran a so-called ""black site"" in Thailand, a secretive overseas prison where such interrogations were carried out. The Washington Post says she was summoned to the White House,externalon Friday by officials worried about her previous support for the techniques. It was at that meeting she apparently indicated her interest in withdrawing, reportedly fearing the Senate questioning could damage her reputation and the CIA's. She also apparently feared repeating the fate of Ronny Jackson,who withdrew his nomination for Veterans Affairs secretary amid questions over alleged past misconduct. Her misgivings prompted senior White House aides, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, to rush later on Friday to meet her at CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia. The Post said it was not until Saturday that Ms Haspel decided to remain the nominee. The Senate confirmation hearing will not be easy and Ms Haspel has been preparing for it with mock questioning at CIA HQ. Democrats will be sure to raise the question of her role in the interrogation programme and some have said she should be disqualified because of her actions at the Thailand site. She has reportedly said she would firmly oppose the reintroduction of any such programme,something Mr Trump has hinted at in the past. Another line of questioning could concern the destruction of videotapes showing al-Qaeda suspects being submitted to the interrogation techniques. Ms Haspel drafted the cable that ordered their destruction in 2005, although her boss, Jose Rodriguez, reportedly sent it without her knowledge or that of then CIA director Porter Goss. She certainly has her supporters. Ms Sanders earlier tweeted: ""There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel."" CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani told the Post that those who had worked with Ms Haspel ""almost uniformly support her"" and would ""finally have a chance to see the true Gina Haspel on Wednesday"". But human rights organisation Reprieve said Ms Haspel was ""not fit"" to run the CIA.

"Parks and green spaces generate health benefits that would cost more than Â£34bn if they did not exist, research by Fields in Trust has suggested. The charity, which protects green spaces, also found that parks save the NHS about Â£111m a year. The report coincides with the launch of a five-year plan to protect parks. Green spaces can improve overall health for all, including ""the young, isolated and the vulnerable"", said parks and green spaces minister Rishi Sunak. In the report, Revaluing Parks and Green Spaces, it is calculated that people would need to spend Â£974 each year to achieve the same level of life satisfaction they get from parks if they were not there. That individual figure was then multiplied by the adult population, and the findings showed that parks generate more than Â£34bn of benefits. Regular users of parks and green spaces are likely to be healthier and less likely to visit their doctor The total cost saved by the NHS is based only on prevented GP appointments and does not include savings from non-referrals for treatments and prescriptions. The research comes at a time when 95% of park professionals say they are concerned about the lack of investment in green spaces, and 16% of people believe their local park is under threat of being built on. How much of your area is built on? Fields in Trust, which protects more than 2,700 spaces in the UK, has also launched a five-year strategy aimed at bringing 75% of the population within a 10-minute walk of a green space by 2022. ""Our parks are precious and I want to improve access to them for everyone,"" said Mr Sunak. ""These findings will play an important role in informing how we achieve this goal.""

"This video can not be played Dr Joyce Tyldesley, of Manchester University, tells Today about the secrets of Tutankhamun's tomb Egyptian authorities have finished their quest to discover a secret chamber in the tomb of Tutankhamun - concluding that it does not exist. Previously, officials said they were ""90% sure"" of a hidden room behind the wall of the boy king's famous 3,000-year-old tomb. One theory suggested it could have been the tomb of Queen Nefertiti - who some think was Tutankhamun's mother. New research, however, has concluded the chamber simply is not there. The search for the hidden tomb began when English archaeologist Nicholas Reeves, examining detailed scans of the chamber, discovered what looked like faint traces, or ""ghosts"", of doors beneath the plaster. His 2015 paper The Burial of Nefertiti, he argued that the relatively small tomb had originally been designed for Queen Nefertiti - and her remains could possibly lie further within the tomb. Nefertiti's remains have never been discovered, but she has been the object of much speculation. A 3,000-year-old sculpture of the queen, immaculately preserved, has made her one of the most recognisable women of ancient Egypt. It is also thought she may have ruled Egypt as pharaoh herself between the death of her husband and the ascension of Tutankhamun. Nefertiti 'buried with King Tut' 'Eight accused' over King Tut's beard 'High chance' of chamber in Tut's tomb This bust of Queen Nefertiti, on display in Berlin, has added to her fame After Mr Reeves' sensational paper, a series of radar scans seemed to support his theory, leadingEgyptian authorities to declare it was ""90% sure"" that a further chamber existed. A second scan also seemed to support the theory, which would have been the most significant discovery of Egyptian antiquities in decades. However, Italian specialists from the University of Turin used new penetrating radar scans to reach their conclusion, saying they were confident in the results. ""It is maybe a little bit disappointing that there is nothing behind the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb, but I think on the other hand that this is good science,"" said Dr Francesco Porcelli, head of the research team. He said they had analysed three different sets of radar data and cross-checked the results, to eliminate ""complexity in the data"" which affected previous scan results. Egypt's Antiquities Minister, Khaled al-Anani, said the authorities in the country accepted the results. 'Eight accused' over King Tut's beard Would you visit a fake tourist attraction?

"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin walks to his limousine for his swearing-in ceremony Vladimir Putin has been sworn in for a fourth term as Russian president and pledged to harness the country's talents to ""achieve breakthroughs"". Some 5,000 guests attended the lavish ceremony in an ornate Kremlin hall. He has been in power for 18 years, as president and prime minister, and opponents have likened his tenure to the reign of a tsar, or emperor. Russian TV showed Mr Putin, 65, leaving his Kremlin office and walking to the ceremony, down long corridors. He then took a short ride in a new, Russian-made limousine, called Cortege, in the Kremlin compound. Previously he and his entourage have used foreign luxury cars. In previous years a bigger motorcade drove the president across Moscow to the ceremony. Young Russians have grown up entirely under Mr Putin's leadership German ex-Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, now in charge of a branch of Russian gas giant Gazprom, was in the front row alongside Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill. Another celebrity friend of Mr Putin, Hollywood star and Russian citizen Steven Seagal, stood near the front row. ""We have revived pride in our fatherland,"" Mr Putin said.,external""As head of state I will do all I can to multiply the strength and prosperity of Russia."" ""We need breakthroughs in all areas of life. I'm deeply convinced that such a leap forward can only be secured with a free society that accepts all that is new and advanced."" He said that in the past Russia had risen again from setbacks, ""like a phoenix"". Russia's action man president Putin basks in election he could not lose Russia country profile On Saturday riot police confronted protesters against his rule in Moscow and other Russian cities. More than 1,000 arrests are said to have been made in 19 cities. The biggest complaint among Russians surveyed bythe Levada Centre, a major sociological research body,external, was that Mr Putin had failed to reduce the wealth gap (the top complaint for 45% of respondents). Another big complaint (for 39%) was the failure to refund Russians who lost savings during market reforms. Mr Putin's most praiseworthy achievement was restoring Russia's world status as a great power (47%), according to the poll. It was conducted last month among 1,600 Russians in 136 towns and cities. Compared with a similar poll in 2015, there was a doubling of complaints that Mr Putin had failed to raise wages, pensions and benefits. This video can not be played Police seized opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a rally in Moscow Nearly half of the reported 1,000 arrests on Saturday were in Moscow. Mr Putin was re-elected president with more than 76% of the vote, his best ever election performance, but widespread irregularities were reported by some international observers. Allegations of ballot-rigging had dogged previous elections too. The country's best-known opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from standing against Mr Putin, on grounds of a conviction for embezzlement which he denies and alleges was politically motivated. Mr Navalny was arrested briefly as he tried to join Saturday's unauthorised protest rally in Moscow under the slogan ""He's not our tsar"". Domestic opponents accuse Mr Putin of undermining democracy in Russia - a policy dubbed ""managed democracy"" - to keep genuine opposition parties out of parliament and ensure that he and his allies retain power indefinitely. Police seize Navalny at Putin protest Putin rival barred from Russian election First elected president in 2000, Mr Putin renewed his four-year term in 2004 before stepping aside in 2008 to serve as prime minister under his protege, Dmitry Medvedev, because by law he could serve only two consecutive terms. Few doubted who was really in charge and in 2012 Mr Putin returned as president, this time for a term of six years. When he reaches the end of his fourth term in 2024, he will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century. That would still fall short of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's 31 years in power or, indeed, the reigns of some Russian tsars such as Alexander II (26 years) and Nicholas I (30 years).

"This video can not be played ""It feels like we're living in Spain"" The UK has enjoyed record-breaking spring sunshine, with a high of 28.7C recorded at RAF Northholt in west London by the Met Office. It marks the hottest day over the Early May Bank Holiday weekend since the holiday was introduced in 1978. South-east England, the Midlands and East Anglia were the warmest spots. The Met Office's Charlie Powell said temperatures in the high 20s were ""the exception rather than the rule"" for the UK as a whole. The Met Office said Scotland and Wales just missed out on breaking their own bank holiday weekend records but still enjoyed their hottest day of the year so far with 23.1C recorded at Charterhall, Berwickshire, and 25.7C at Usk. Parks were a draw on the hottest Early May Bank Holiday Monday The 23.6C record for the Early May Bank Holiday Monday - set in 1999 - was broken when Herstmonceux in East Sussex reached 24.2C.

Temperatures peaked on Sunday at 26C in Northolt. According to Dr Farrah Sheikh, absorbing enough sun is important, as it provides essential Vitamin D. However, it is also important that we are sun safe. She suggests the following: Stay out of the sun when it is at its hottest (between 11:00 and 15:00 BST) Try to cover up as much as possible - wear a hat Apply plenty of sunscreen, particularly with children as their skin is a lot more sensitive. Re-apply sunscreen every one to two hours Drink lots of fluids Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Vet Dr Simon Constable says sun safety is as important for pets, and suggests the following key pointers: Use non-toxic pet sunscreen, particularly on pale-coloured pets, such as horses and dogs Give animals plenty of water to keep them hydrated - check their water is full all the time Consider buying booties to keep pets' paws and feet safe from getting burned on hot sand or hot pavements Let them have a swim if possible If travelling in a car with animals, stop regularly and give them frequent drinks of water Never leave pets in a car You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

Temperatures peaked on Sunday at 26C in Northolt. According to Dr Farrah Sheikh, absorbing enough sun is important, as it provides essential Vitamin D. However, it is also important that we are sun safe. She suggests the following: Stay out of the sun when it is at its hottest (between 11:00 and 15:00 BST) Try to cover up as much as possible - wear a hat Apply plenty of sunscreen, particularly with children as their skin is a lot more sensitive. Re-apply sunscreen every one to two hours Drink lots of fluids Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Vet Dr Simon Constable says sun safety is as important for pets, and suggests the following key pointers: Use non-toxic pet sunscreen, particularly on pale-coloured pets, such as horses and dogs Give animals plenty of water to keep them hydrated - check their water is full all the time Consider buying booties to keep pets' paws and feet safe from getting burned on hot sand or hot pavements Let them have a swim if possible If travelling in a car with animals, stop regularly and give them frequent drinks of water Never leave pets in a car You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

"The price of vanilla has soared over the last two years, sending a chill down the spine of UK ice-cream makers. At around $600 per kilo the sweet ingredient costs more than silver. Snugburys Ice Cream is run by three sisters near Nantwich in Cheshire. The business churns out around five tonnes of ice cream in a busy week from the family farm. Around a third of their 40 flavours contain vanilla in some form and they are paying their supplier 30 times more for the extract than they did in previous years. ""It has really gone up, so last year we decided to buy it forward by a year's-worth,"" said Cleo Sadler, who manages the production side of the business. ""We had to make a decision as to whether we would absorb the costs - which we did in the end."" Buying ahead means the sisters have sufficient stock for the coming summer and can stick to their prices. But at least one other UK ice-cream business has stopped serving vanilla due to the higher costs. Julie Fisher, who founded artisanal ice-cream maker Ruby Violet seven years ago, told the BBC vanilla was off the menu in her London-based outlets ""for the foreseeable future"" because she can't afford the thousands of pounds it would cost. And others are reported to also be reconsidering their use of expensive extract. Snugbury's distributes all over the North West of England, but also runs a popular shop on-site where a steady stream of families drop in on their way across the countryside. This video can not be played Ice-cream makers struggle with soaring vanilla prices Ms Sadler and her sisters, Kitty and Hannah, pride themselves on homemade ingredients, so would not consider synthetic alternatives to vanilla. ""As for the future, well we will have to sit down, crunch the figure, and see how it's going to work out for us for the years to come,"" she said. The vast majority of vanilla  - over 75% - is grown on the tropical island of Madagascar, off the South East coast of the African Continent. ""The main reason for the high price is that there was a cyclone in Madagascar last March which damaged a lot of the plantations,"" said Julian Gale, a commodities analyst for IEG Vu. ""And despite hopes that the price would have eased by now, it's still holding on the high side because demand is so strong."" The BBC's Tim Healy in Madagascar says that in addition to this, market watchers conclude that commodity speculation by a few large buyers is forcing prices upwards. Equally, the use of the vanilla market to launder money from illegal sales of Madagascar rosewood has provoked price spikes and made the product rather eco-unfriendly. It's a difficult spice to cultivate, extracted from the delicate vanilla orchid flower. As a result, vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world, after saffron. ""The other big producers are Papua New Guinea, India and Uganda,"" said Mr Gale. ""It's exported globally, a lot goes to America as it has a big ice cream industry."" It's not just ice cream: vanilla is popular across sweet foods, alcohol, as well as cosmetics and perfumes. Natural vanilla extract comes in potent, sweet scented brown liquor. Food manufacturers also purchase spent vanilla powder, the little black dots sometimes seen in ice cream. The price of that has also increased threefold. Synthetic flavouring called vanillin is extracted from wood and sometimes even petroleum. It is anticipated it will now be more widely used across industries trying to avoid escalating costs.

"Nestle has announced that it will pay Starbucks $7.1bn (Â£5.2bn) to sell the company's coffee products. The Swiss giant, which boasts Nescafe and Nespresso amongst its brands, will have the right to market Starbucks' coffee in retail outlets outside the cafe chain. That part of the business currently generates $2bn in annual sales. The deal means Nespresso machine owners will be able to buy Starbucks coffee branded pods for use at home. Consumers will also find Starbucks coffee beans, ground and instant coffee more readily available as Nestle, the world's largest food and drinks company, uses its vast distribution network to market Starbucks products worldwide. Nestle's name will not appear alongside Starbucks's, but the deal could still help Nestle strengthen its US business, thanks to the powerful High Street coffee brand. Boil it all down and this is a giant licensing arrangement, whereby Nestle is allowed to sell Starbucks products through Nestle distribution channels. That means you'll see a lot more Starbucks branded coffee pods for use in Nespresso or Dolce Gusto devices which are all the rage - thanks in part to those George Clooney adverts. Starbucks will continue to buy the raw (green) coffee beans from farmers but now Nestle will step in and roast and prepare those beans for consumers under strict Starbucks licensing rules. Nestle will not acquire any Starbucks infrastructure nor will any Nestle products appear in Starbucks coffee shops. For that arrangement, Nestle is paying $7bn because it believes Starbucks products will appeal to premium coffee lovers around the world. Despite the price tag, Nestle shareholders appear to like the deal. Nestle shares rose 1.5% today. While Starbucks investors kind of shrugged. Mark Schneider, who in 2016 became the first outsider to run Nestle in almost 100 years, is attempting to boost the company's profit through expansion. Last year, Nestle paid an estimated $425m for a 68% stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, a California-based company that sells coffee to customers online and has a number of shops in the US and Japan. Kona Haque, of the commodities trading company ED&F Man said Nestle was aiming to further strengthen its position in the US market through this latest deal. ""At the moment Nestle is very much known for its instant coffee. This is an opportunity to go into roast and ground which for today's millennials is a big growing trend,"" she said. Mr Schneider described the ""global coffee alliance"" with Starbucks as ""a great day for coffee lovers around the world"". Nestle said 500 Starbucks employees will transfer over to its business but they will continue to be located in Seattle, which has been the group's headquarters for the last 47 years. The companyrecently sold its US sweets and chocolate business, including brands such as Crunch and Butterfinger, to Ferrero Group for 2.7bn Swiss francs (Â£1.9bn).

"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows spread of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano The eruption of the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has destroyed a total of 35 structures - mostly homes - and is threatening hundreds more. Nearly 2,000 people have so far been evacuated. Some residents were allowed home to rescue pets, but authorities said it was not safe to stay. New fissures and vents opened overnight in the Leilani Estates area, where lava leapt up to 230ft (70m) into the air. The island was hit by a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake on Friday. This video can not be played Lava flows are continuing from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii ""When I evacuated on Thursday, I pretty much said goodbye because I have lived here a long time and seen what the lava does,"" local resident Ikaika Marzo told the BBC. ""I think it's just important for everybody just to be realistic."" Brenton Awa, another resident, said: ""Knowing that these pets are still in cages, or in fences, or in chains without food makes my heart sore a little bit. ""That's one of the reasons we went in to feed some of the pets. It is just sad."" Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and has been in constant eruption for 35 years. Authorities say the fire has destroyed 26 homes on the island and is threatening hundreds more Fissures and vents in the Leilani Estates area have spewed lava around homes More than $35,000 (Â£26,000) has been raised for a primary school teacher who has ""lost everything"" in the Leilani Estates lava flow. Amber Makuakane, a single mother-of-two evacuated on Friday carrying rubbish bags full of clothing and important documents, according to the fundraiser set up by her colleagues at Pahoa Elementary School. ""We are asking for donations to help her rebuild. If you know Amber, you know that she has the biggest heart and is always willing to help,"" the page said. ""She is not one who will ask for help, but we feel that she needs our support in this tragic time."" The Hawaii State Teachers Association confirmed her employment, and said a lava fissure opened up directly below her home, where she had lived for nine years. ""I honestly don't know where to begin or what to say, other thanâ¦ MAHALO! MAHALO MAHALO!,"" Ms Makuakane said on GoFundMe, using a Hawaiian word meaning thanks.

"Parks and green spaces generate health benefits that would cost more than Â£34bn if they did not exist, research by Fields in Trust has suggested. The charity, which protects green spaces, also found that parks save the NHS about Â£111m a year. The report coincides with the launch of a five-year plan to protect parks. Green spaces can improve overall health for all, including ""the young, isolated and the vulnerable"", said parks and green spaces minister Rishi Sunak. In the report, Revaluing Parks and Green Spaces, it is calculated that people would need to spend Â£974 each year to achieve the same level of life satisfaction they get from parks if they were not there. That individual figure was then multiplied by the adult population, and the findings showed that parks generate more than Â£34bn of benefits. Regular users of parks and green spaces are likely to be healthier and less likely to visit their doctor The total cost saved by the NHS is based only on prevented GP appointments and does not include savings from non-referrals for treatments and prescriptions. The research comes at a time when 95% of park professionals say they are concerned about the lack of investment in green spaces, and 16% of people believe their local park is under threat of being built on. How much of your area is built on? Fields in Trust, which protects more than 2,700 spaces in the UK, has also launched a five-year strategy aimed at bringing 75% of the population within a 10-minute walk of a green space by 2022. ""Our parks are precious and I want to improve access to them for everyone,"" said Mr Sunak. ""These findings will play an important role in informing how we achieve this goal.""

"The deliberate killing of one human being by another is a crime that defies easy characterisation. Among the more than 50 tragedies that make up the current spike in homicides in the capital this year are some that may be premeditated or gang-related, but most will be unpredictable acts of violence in moments of mental anguish, involving a victim and a perpetrator who are well known to each other - family disputes or an argument between friends. By far the most likely year of life in which we might be unlawfully killed is not in our teens or early 20s but our first year - babies under one are more than twice as likely to be murdered as a 20-year-old. That is why it is far too simplistic to draw a direct link between the number of killings and the number of Bobbies on the beat. Cuts to police budgets may be less relevant than cuts to mental health provision. In tackling gang activity, there is good evidence that a psychiatric health approach may be more effective than a tough criminal justice response, which can thwart individual acts of violence, but may also infect communities with resentment and distrust - the breeding ground of gangsters. Analysis of a survey of more than 4,600 young men in the UK, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, found those involved with gangs showed ""inordinately high levels of psychiatric morbidity, placing a heavy burden on mental health services"". The authors concluded that ""healthcare professionals may have an important role in promoting desistence from gang activity"". Teenager dies in latest London attack The faces of those killed in London Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? Separate research involving long and detailed interviews with 16 men on death row in the US found all had experienced family violence. Fourteen of the men had been ""severely physically abused as children by a family member"". Three of them had been beaten unconscious. Twelve of the death row inmates had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. The World Health Organization in Europe found a similar link: ""Exposure to violence and mental trauma in childhood is associated with atypical neurodevelopment and subsequent information-processing biases, leading to poor attachment, aggression and violent behaviour. Children who experience neglect and maltreatment from parents are at greater risk for aggressive and antisocial behaviour and violent offending in later life."" Killing can be contagious. The murder of one young person can raise fear levels on the street, making it more likely others will carry weapons to protect themselves. And more likely they will use them. This video can not be played Fact checking murder statistics in London vs New York In the US and increasingly in the UK, in places like Glasgow, agencies are successfully reducing gang violence by treating it in the same way they'd respond to a public health emergency, looking to disrupt the spread of a deadly virus. Karyn McCluskey, a former director of Violence Reduction Unit set up by Strathclyde police, says it is about identifying the people at risk. ""We need to interrupt because some people are very angry and sometimes they'll be on their phone, plotting their revenge,"" she says. ""Often these are people that need to be rehoused, who need drug addiction services, so it's about connecting them to all the other services that are out there and staying with them."" The general murder rate, though, is immune to quick and easy interventions. Declining for centuries, it is a reflection of deeper trends - society's relationship to violence and the mental resilience of a population. Back in the Middle Ages, according to analysis of English coroners' records and 'eyre rolls' (accounts of visits by justice officials), the rate was around 35/100,000. This is equivalent to the homicide level in contemporary Colombia or the Congo. From the middle of the 16th Century, the homicide rate starts to fall steeply, a dramatic reduction in risk that is maintained for 200 years. The development of a statutory justice system is often cited - but it was also a period in which society found alternative ways of dealing with dispute and discontent. For Europe's elite, the duel emerged as a controlled and respectable way of responding to an insult against one's honour. Spontaneous violence became disreputable for gentlemen of standing while personal discipline and restraint were seen as the marks of a civilised individual. Are black knife deaths being ignored? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence The murder rate continued to fall, if less steeply, during the 19th and 20th Centuries as state control and social policies increased. It was also partly a consequence of young men being given a substitute for interpersonal violence to demonstrate their masculinity - organised sport. Boxing, for example, developed from bare-knuckled no-holds-barred brawls to disciplined contests governed by a strict code and overseen by a referee.  The 'Queensbury Rules', introduced into British boxing in 1867, became shorthand for sportsmanship and fair play. Society at all levels increasingly valued the virtue of self-control. Close study of the vital signs of British society reveal a slight rise in the homicide rate over the past 50 years, but in historical terms the figures are still so low that a single appalling occurrence - a terrorist attack or the murderous activity of a serial killer like Dr Harold Shipman - can skew the data. In international terms, the UK is among the less likely spots to be murdered: our homicide rate is broadly in line with other European nations (a little higher than Germany but slightly lower than France) and roughly a quarter of the level in the US. It is right to be alarmed by the spate of tragic murders in London this year, but just as the cause of such killings are complex, the solutions to societal violence are complex too.

"Why does Putin smile? Is he dead? Does he like Trump? Vladimir Putin will remain as Russian president until 2024 after winning Sunday's election. And while much is known about the Russian leader, there's still plenty more that people would like to know. As an experiment, we started typing a few questions about Mr Putin into Google to see what searches it would automatically suggest. We decided to answer the (occasionally quite strange) questions for you. ...married? No, not as far as we know. He and his wife of 30 years, Lyudmila, announced their divorce in June 2013. They had rarely been seen together in public in the months before their announcement. There are rumours that Mr Putin has datedformer rhythmic gymnast and politician Alina Kabaeva, but there's been no indication whether the rumours are true. ...left-handed? No, unless something has changed since January, when this picture was taken. ...rich? His official salary is the equivalent of about $112,000 (Â£81,000) a year, according to information filed with the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation before this election. But two years ago, a then-US Treasury official told the BBC that Mr Putin was ""corrupt"" and had been hiding his wealth for ""many, many years"". ""We've seen him enriching his friends, his close allies and marginalising those who he doesn't view as friends using state assets,"" Adam Szubin said. This video can not be played How rich is Vladimir Putin? The Kremlin called the allegations ""pure fiction"". However, a CIA memo in 2007 said his personal wealth at the time was close to $40bn; one analyst and critic of Donald Trump said in 2012 that the figure then could have been as high as $70bn, which would have made him the richest man in the world. ...dead? No - his election victory should be a clue that he's very much alive. Having said that, speculation swirled about his wellbeing in 2015, whenhe was not spotted in public for 10 days. Had he been removed in a coup? Had he died? Become a father again? All sorts of theories emerged, but when the president popped up again, he said only that life ""would be boring without gossip"". ...smile? He's no different from the rest of us: when you're happy, your body creates endorphins, neuronal signals are sent to your facial muscles and they form a smile. As for what particular things make him smile - how about romping with dogs in the snow? Mr Putin with his dogs Buffy (L) and Yume ...want to invade Ukraine? Well he already has - and annexed Crimea in the process. Officially, Russian forces did not subsequently enter other parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014 - Russia has acknowledged ""volunteers"" had helped pro-Russian rebels there - but it is believed by almost everyone but Russia that it was behind the military moves. Russia's manoeuvres began soon after Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych, a key Putin ally, was ousted amid pro-EU protests. A Ukraine that looked more to the EU would have been a Ukraine that was less dependent on its big neighbour to the east. ...support Syria? Syria is strategically very important for Russia, which has two military bases there. Bashar al-Assad's government has been a crucial ally to Russia for some time. When war broke out in Syria in 2011, Russia supported Mr Assad, but it didn't become involved in the conflict until September 2015. Read more: Russia's mission accomplished Russia's involvement served two purposes - it kept Mr Assad in power and allowed Russia to make its mark on the international scene, ensuring the US would struggle to attain all its objectives in the region. ...have a son? No, but it's generally accepted he has two daughters - Katerina, a former dancer who has been working at Moscow State University, and Maria, who is believed to work in endocrinology. Not much is known about them and you won't get any details from Mr Putin, buta Reuters investigation in 2015 found that Katerina and her husband were extremely wealthy,external. ...speak English? Yes. He's been filmed speaking English fluently, and his spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Mr Putin even corrects translators if they don't translate to English correctly. ...like Trump? Well now there's an interesting question. Thirteen Russians, including a former Putin associate, have been charged with trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 US election, in support of Mr Trump and one-time Democratic contender Bernie Sanders. But does Mr Putin actually like Mr Trump? Only the Russian president can answer that. ...steal a Super Bowl ring? This might seem like a weird question, but there's history here. Back in 2005, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots American football team, met the Russian president. During the St Petersburg visit, Mr Kraft handed Mr Putin his Super Bowl ring - a custom-made, 124-carat diamond ring created to commemorate the Patriots' Super Bowl win. At the time, Mr Kraft said he gave it to Mr Putin as a gift. But in 2013, he changed his story - he said Mr Putin simply put it in his pocket and walked away. A week later, Mr Putin said he would commission a new ring ""if it has such great value for Mr Kraft and for the team"". ...ban memes? That's what was reported in 2015 - instead,it was more of a recommendation than an outright ban. But then last year, Russia's ministry of justice announced that it treated the image below, and variations upon it, as ""extremist material"".

"The two boys were shot on Wealdstone High Street Two boys aged 13 and 15 have been shot in north-west London. The 15-year-old was found wounded in Wealdstone High Street at about 13:15 BST. Minutes later paramedics alerted police officers to the 13-year-old, who had also been shot on the same road. They are both in hospital. The shootings come after Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, 17,was shot dead in the street in Southwark on Saturday eveningwhile playing football. His mother Pretana Morgan said he ""had so much potential"" and added that she ""couldn't have asked for a better son"". A jacket lies on the pavement at the junction of Palmerston Road and Wealdstone High Street Palmerston Road, just off Wealdstone High Street, was blocked off with police tape and manned by uniformed officers on Sunday evening. The Met Police said the younger victim had suffered a shotgun pellet wound to the head. The 15-year-old also suffered a head injury but neither was thought to be in a life-threatening condition, the force added. No easy answers to London's killings Looking behind London's murder statistics London killings: Why are they happening? A shopkeeper said the 13-year-old was ""lucky to be alive"" and they believed a bullet had grazed the back of his head. ""He was holding his head down. I could not see his face but could see his white T-shirt was proper covered in blood,"" he added. In a separate attack, a 22-year-old suffered non life-threatening wounds in a shooting in New Cross Road, Lewisham, at about 18:30. There have been no arrests in any of the cases.

"Olaf Breuning's Clouds are offset against the sky Visitor numbers to UK sculpture parks have increased significantly in the past five years, according to The Arts Council England. Statistics from five leading sculpture parks and attractions show a major increase in footfall, as more people become interested in outdoor art and larger pieces of work. Yorkshire Sculpture Park saw its numbers rise from 350,000 to 500,000 in the past five years and Cass in West Sussex has seen its visitor numbers nearly double. Jupiter Artland, a sculpture park near Edinburgh, New Art Centre in Wiltshire and the Folkestone Triennial have all seen their popularity rise too. New Art Centre in Wiltshire has seen visitor numbers increase Clare Lilley, director of programme at Yorkshire Sculpture Park, believes this is down to more people wanting to see and experience art outside the confines of a white-walled gallery. ""A sculpture park is a place where people can access contemporary and modern art incredibly easily. There are no walls or doors so there's nothing stopping you from going into these green spaces and getting close to the sculptures and enjoying them in all seasons. I've seen people embracing sculptures and hugging Henry Moores, it's such a wonderful sensory and physical experience."" Celebrated contemporary artists such as Ai Weiwei are now displaying works in sculpture parks As well as works from master sculptors, the parks attract art from contemporary artists such as Antony Gormley, Ai Weiwei and Anish Kapoor. Phyllida Barlow, who represented Britain at the 2017 Venice Biennale, has created her first permanent outdoor sculpture to celebrate the 10th birthday of Jupiter Artland. Her artwork will be unveiled this week. She said: ""It's been exhilarating and challenging working in the Scottish woodlands in the freezing rain and mud. There's a sense of liberation not having any gallery ceilings and working beyond a frame looking up towards the sky."" ""I hope people who stumble upon this are curious."" Phyllida's sculpture will join a growing number of larger-scale pieces currently being exhibited around the country. Phyllida Barlow worked in the warmth of her studio on the maquette for her new piece Helen Turner, curator of Cass Sculpture Park, believes that as people become more art literate they want to experience bigger and more ambitious sculptures, in which they can become fully immersed. ""Gigantic works can often have a humbling effect on us and make us feel very small in this world which I think is beautifully poetic. It's a bit like looking up at the cosmos; they put you in your place and remind you that life is short and not to take the small things too seriously."" Jake and Dinos Chapman created The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth but not the Mineral Rights For the sculptor Sean Henry, smaller works can also have a big impact. ""A small Giacometti figure can have the same power as the Angel of the North."" ""When you put your work in a park people will immediately voice their opinion and it seems more real and alive. With sculpture we have an emotional response that's more connected when we're outside with it,"" he said. There are 80 identical two-metre tall graphite figures in Yorkshire Sculpture Park Not all sculptures have to be large to have an impact says sculptor Sean Henry While sculpture parks are not a new concept, artist Laura Ford feels they've come a long way since she was a student and are less formal. ""The idea of showing in a sculpture park seemed like the kiss of death. Now there's a different generation of people that have come out of a different way of curating outdoors, it's much more eclectic and interesting to me. I can reach a wider audience."" But she warns ""You need to wax and look after them,"" Bird poo is the worst, but apart from that they're pretty robust. The patina of age and being outdoors can often add to it."" Being outdoors means the sculptures have to be ""waxed and looked after"" says artist Laura Ford There are now more than 30 sculpture parks and trails in the UK including pop-up parks across London. According to Clare Lilley, who launched Regent's Park pop up park sculpture space last summer, outdoor art is here to stay: ""People are putting sculpture parks into deserts, into mountains, there's even an underwater sculpture park in the Caribbean. It's definitely not a passing fad."" She added: ""These are places where people come to seek solace and beauty, where children explore and play and where people have conversations with complete strangers which they wouldn't in a gallery. This is something different"" Lynn Chadwick's Diamond provides sharp relief among the countryside and wildlife Barney Hindle's photographs are copyrighted to Cass Sculpture Foundation and the artist who created the artwork.

He responded directly to the former education minister, Lord Adonis, saying ""you're better than this"". Lord Adonis then apologised to Mr Javid for the ""poor taste"" cartoon. ""Sajid, on reflection I think the cartoon is too personal and in poor taste. I have deleted it. I am sorry,"" Lord Adonis wrote. Mr Javid took over from Amber Rudd,who resigned last Sundayin a row over targets for deporting illegal immigrants. Quoting the original tweet containing the cartoon, Mr Javid said: ""Not like you Andrew Adonis."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Rochelle Barrett plans to put on a pageant for people with disabilities or disfigurements ""so they know they are beautiful too"" A burns survivor is planning a beauty pageant for people with disfigurements. Rochelle Barrett, 29, from Sheffield, suffered third degree burns to 70% of her body when a childminder tripped over her with a boiling kettle when she was eight months old. Doctors did not expect her to survive. The whole of Ms Barrett's left arm was burnt, her left breast is not fully formed, and her right thigh is covered in scars but by some ""miracle"" her face healed.

But after her daughter was born she realised she would have to confront her body image. ""My daughter starts secondary school in September and social media is a really big deal for girls, adjusting your entire image to look what is classed as ""perfect"","" she said.

"This video can not be played I will always be an Arsenal fan - Wenger Arsene Wenger said his farewell to Emirates Stadium with a thrashing of Burnley to leave in the same way it all began for him as Arsenal manager 7,876 days ago - with victory. In a season of discontent and occasional open rebellion, this was a day for a united front to celebrate the career of the manager who has brought so much success and style to Arsenal since starting his reign with that 2-0 win at Ewood Park in 1996. And in a campaign of disappointment that will now be viewed as the end of an era, the last hope of success snuffed out by the Europa League semi-finalloss to Atletico Madrid, Wenger at least got the home send-off he so deserved - with a stylish win over Burnley. The Clarets, who have a wonderful story of their own this season, were outclassed as Arsenal ran out 5-0 winners to give Wenger his 475th win in 826 Premier League games. This was not the time to celebrate a single victory but to reflect on all the triumphs and pleasure Wenger has brought to Arsenal in almost 22 years, and everyone played their parts perfectly on and off the pitch. The differences of this season were set aside as the good and the great of Wenger's reign came into sharp focus. The Emirates was draped in tributes to Wenger, with giant ""Merci Arsene"" banners outside the ground, while red T-shirts bearing the same slogan and the date were placed on each one of the 60,000 seats in the stadium. Wenger, who is clearly departing with reluctance with 12 months still to run on his contract, made his entrance through a guard of honour formed by Arsenal and Burnley players, along with their manager Sean Dyche. As he made his way towards the centre circle, huge applause reverberated around the arena that can stand as a monument to his footballing wisdom and financial expertise in the transfer market. Arsenal have scored 53 home Premier League goals this season - their most since 2004/05 (54) There have been fallow years and subsequent fall-outs with some Arsenal fans, but this was an occasion viewed through the prism of three Premier League titles - including two league and FA Cup doubles in 1997-98 and 2001-2002 - and ""The Invincibles"" season of those 38 unbeaten games in 2003-04. Wenger's seven FA Cup wins have also earned him a place in history and many of the figures central to his achievements were here to pay their own tributes. Martin Keown and the great France midfield man Emmanuel Petit were backstage, and perhaps the most poignant sight of all was the return of David Dein to the Arsenal directors' box for the first time in 11 years. It was a reminder of a once-unstoppable partnership between Wenger and the man who brought him to Arsenal - and perhaps things have never been quite the same since vice-chairman Dein left the board citing ""irreconcilable differences"" in 2007. And looking on from behind dark glasses was Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, who, along with Arsenal's board, must replace the man Dein says is ""an impossible act to follow"". In contrast to so much here this season, this was a day of complete satisfaction on and off the field, the sea of 60,000 red T-shirts watching a comprehensive attacking display that was Wenger's trademark from those glory days. And it was the potent strikeforce Wenger will leave behind that set up this easy win, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette establishing the platform by half-time. Sead Kolasinac, Alex Iwobi and a second from Aubameyang wrapped up sixth place - but this was Wenger's day. His name swept around the stands inside the first two minutes, swiftly followed by that of Patrick Vieira, who has been linked as a potential successor. The other great names who brought glory under Wenger were also recognised in song, from Thierry Henry and Keown to Dennis Bergkamp. Burnley's fans sang their own tribute to Wenger, but were also quick with a cutting comeback to the adulation by singing ""You Wanted Him Sacked"" at Arsenal's fans. Other former Arsenal players, such as Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires, Kanu and Sol Campbell, were there to join in the emotional post-match scenes. Wenger gave his red club tie to one young fan after his post-match presentation No Arsenal fans left their seats once the real celebrations began at the final whistle - although the one note of dissent came when Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick was jeered as he emerged to make presentations to retiring veteran Arsenal backroom man Vic Akers, ladies' captain Alex Scott and Per Mertesacker, who was given a final appearance before becoming the club's academy coach. Arsenal's great statesman and double-winning goalkeeper Bob Wilson, who was goalkeeping coach when the French visionary was appointed, then paid homage to ""the greatest manager we have ever had"". His long-time assistant Pat Rice then presented Wenger with the gold Premier League trophy that was handed to the club after the Invincibles season. It was then Wenger's turn to speak, and the Emirates fell silent for his final words, which started with a touch of typical Wenger class and humanity as he sent his best wishes to his old adversary and latterly friend Sir Alex Ferguson. Wenger was receiving another presentation at Old Trafford just seven days ago, from Sir Alex Ferguson. Listen: Wenger has been a great man for Arsenal - Wright Wenger was presented with the golden trophy given to the club after their 2003-04 unbeaten 'Invincibles' season on the pitch after the match. Wenger, with his own giant image paraded on a floating flag behind him, spoke quietly with genuine emotion, ending with the message: ""I will miss you."" A lap of honour saw Wenger being applauded with huge affection, the fractiousness of the last few months forgotten, especially by one youngster who got his wish after spending most of the afternoon holding up a placard reading: ""Arsene - please can I have your tie?"" Wenger will cut the ties that have bound him to Arsenal at Huddersfield Town next week before this giant club starts to navigate a path away from the Wenger era. With giant letters spelling out the day's main message ""Merci Arsene"" behind him, he waved one final goodbye as he disappeared down the tunnel. Now a new chapter will begin for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger. One of 83 academy graduates to come through the ranks under Wenger, Iwobi had an impressive game, with more touches and passes than any team-mate and his well-taken goal. This was Arsenal Wenger's 606th and final home game in charge of Arsenal (W415 D120 L71), with this the 27th time that his team have won by five or more goals on home soil. Indeed, no manager has taken charge of more Premier League home games than Arsene Wenger (414), winning 286 of those. Only Sir Alex Ferguson has won more in the competition's history (305). Arsenal will finish the season having scored 54 league goals at the Emirates, their joint-highest tally of home goals in a Premier League campaign, along with 2004-05 (54). Sean Dyche suffered his 50th defeat as a manager in the Premier League, however only 11 of those have come this season, compared with 19 in 2014/15 and 20 in 2016-17. This was Burnley's joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League and the third time they've lost by a five-goal margin (also 0-5 v Spurs and 1-6 v Man City in 2009-10). The Clarets have conceded more goals at the Emirates than any other away venue in the Premier League (13 in four games). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has now scored 20+ league goals in each of his last three seasons in the top five European leagues (25 in 2015-16 and 31 in 2016/17, both for Borussia Dortmund). Aubameyang has scored seven league goals at the Emirates this term, the most of any Arsenal player in their first seven home appearances in the Premier League. Alexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in nine goals in his last nine games in all competitions (eight goals and one assist), while also scoring and assisting in the same game for the first time for Arsenal. Among players to have scored 10+ goals in the Premier League this season, the Frenchman has scored the highest percentage of his goals in home games (79% - 11 of 14). Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""It is impossible to feel nothing unless you are completely robotic. ""It is 22 years of total commitment and togetherness. Overall I would like to thank everybody. I had the luxury of doing this job for 22 years at the same club and I am grateful for that. ""It is difficult to analyse this season for what this team has done. At home it has been championship stuff, but away from home it has not been enough. We also went to the League Cup final and Europa League semi-final. ""The fans may be lost at the start next season, but they will have a new manager and they can continue the work as the basics are here."" This video can not be played I will always be an Arsenal fan - Wenger Burnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to MOTD:""I think Arsenal raised their performance considerably. After the results yesterday we suddenly had nothing to play for and that affects players, they need something on the game. ""Today Arsenal really turned up. It will be a different feel at home next weekend - our fans were great today and they know how good a season it has been. ""Arsene Wenger means a lot to the game, the only thing he'll be asking is if they could have done that more often. It's still quite fresh but in 10 years they'll probably be looking back and thinking 'what an era'.""
