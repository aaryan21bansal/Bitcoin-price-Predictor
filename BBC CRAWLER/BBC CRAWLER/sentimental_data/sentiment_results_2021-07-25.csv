"A cafe near Speakers' Corner (file picture) A woman has been slashed with a knife at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park, police have said. The 39-year-old was taken to hospital after the attack on Sunday afternoon at the site, where people gather for public speeches and debates. The Metropolitan Police said she received a minor slash injury to the head, which was not life-threatening. Footage shared on social media shows someone dressed in black approaching a woman wearing a Charlie Hebdo T-shirt. She is later seen clutching her right hand close to her body, with what appears to be blood at her temple, as she is helped into a police van by officers who were nearby. Charlie Hebdo is a French satirical magazine that was targeted in adeadly attack by Islamist extremists in 2015after it published a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed. Twelve people were killed in the attack at the magazine's offices in Paris. A knife was found after the attack in Hyde Park, but no arrests have yet been made. Officers based in Westminster are working with the specialist Met unit which patrols the royal parks to investigate and try to find the person responsible. Speakers' Corner: The home of free speech The Met said officers were called just after 15:30 BST to reports that a woman had been assaulted. A statement said she was treated by the London Ambulance Service before being taken to a central London hospital. Det Supt Alex Bingley, of the Central West Command Unit which covers policing in Westminster, said: ""This was clearly a very distressing incident for the woman involved and officers have spent time with her, whilst she was being treated for her injury, to get an account of what happened. ""We know that this assault was witnessed by a number of people, many of whom captured it on their phones. I would ask them, if they have not already done so, to contact police. ""We remain in the early stages of our investigation and are working hard to trace the person responsible. ""I would ask people not to speculate on the motive for the attack until we have established the full facts.""

"Government efforts to deal with the self-isolation ""pingdemic"" are ""chaotic"" and ""too late"", food supply industry bodies have said. Supply firms are having to fight to keep supermarkets stocked with food, one industry body warned. The government has been trying to ease the effects of workers having to self-isolate if they are ""pinged"" by the NHS Test and Trace app. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily testing will help minimise disruption. The number of people being sent NHS app alerts to self-isolate rapidly rose throughout July as infection rates soared, reaching a record 600,000 in the week to 14 July. Many businesses struggled as staff members self-isolated. Covid: Who has to self-isolate, which workers are exempt and what if I'm fully vaccinated? Daily tests not self-isolation for police, fire, borders, transport and freight staff The governmentchanged its stance last weekand announced that some double-jabbed staff at some critical organisations would be allowed to take tests to keep coming to work, rather than self-isolating. On Sunday, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had now contacted 500 sites that had been identified for daily contact testing. Testing is understood to be rolling-out to key manufacturing, food processing and wholesale sites across the food supply chain, which will be joining large supermarket depots as part of the initial phase of the testing programme. The number of roles that are exempt from isolation is also understood to have been widened to include roles such as forklift drivers and dispatchers. But the government's response has been ""very chaotic"" and ""too late"", said James Bielby, chief executive of the Federation of Wholesale Distribution. He said that a policy for exemptions was announced on Monday, but that there were no further details given until Thursday. Many food businesses were still in the dark as to whether their staff could be included in the scheme, he added, with only 15 supermarket distribution centres with staff on the list on Friday. ""The process for getting on the list is entirely opaque,"" Mr Bielby said, adding that the government seemed to be making up the policy ""on the hoof"" in response to media reports. Putting in place testing instead of self-isolation would have been better three weeks ago, Mr Bielby said, but now it was ""too late"" - especially as self-isolation is supposed to ease in three weeks' time. He added that the ""pingdemic"" had been ""really bad"" for the food supply chain, as entire production lines in factories and entire driver fleets had been ""taken out"". There was already a shortage of lorry drivers because of a combination of factors including Brexit, the Covid pandemic and changes to self-employment taxation, he added. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said the ""pingdemic"" had been a greater challenge for businesses than Covid itself. ""You can deal with problems as long as you have people working,"" Mr Brennan said. ""The problem with the 'pingdemic' is that it takes lots of people out of the workforce."" Supermarkets have been dealing with rolling shortages of some stock as lorry driver numbers remain low There are already rolling shortages of stock in supermarkets, and supply businesses are ""fighting to keep food on the shelves"", he said. However, the application process for getting staff exemptions for self-isolation was ""way too complicated"" and came too late. In addition, government departments did not appear to be working in a unified way. ""It's quite obvious that the government is having an argument with itself [over self-isolation],"" he said. Although the daily number of people testing positive for coronavirus has fallen over the past week to fewer than 32,000 per day, critical businesses have reported struggling with staff absences. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said that there could be disruption to services in the coming weeks. Trains may be delayed, the Rail Delivery Group said ""While train companies are doing everything they can to minimise any disruption, there may be an impact on services so we are asking people to check before they travel using app alerts,"" a spokesperson said. On Saturday, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs Thameslink and Southern trains, said it would introduce a reduced timetable from Monday 26 July. Non-essential businesses, including pubs and restaurants, have also struggled with staff getting pinged. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ""Pubs are closing or greatly reducing their opening hours due to staff shortages caused by app pings - despite staff testing negative on lateral flow tests."" She said 43% of pub staff were aged 18 to 25 and would not have their second jab for months. ""We urge the government to work with us to find a sensible solution to this that still ensures staff and customer safety,"" she added. However, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""As we learn to live with the virus, we must do everything we can to break chains of transmission and stop the spread of the virus. ""Daily contact testing of workers in these critical sectors will help to minimise any disruption caused by rising cases in the coming weeks, while ensuring staff are not put at risk."" A spokesperson said that as a first step, daily contact testing was being rolled out to critical workplaces in the food supply chain and that many sites would be operational from Monday 26 July.

"A capacity crowd of 140,000 attended the British Grand Prix at Silverstone last week Making proof of full vaccination mandatory at Premier League matches could cause ""chaos"" at some clubs, the Football Supporters' Association has warned.

Prime MinisterBoris Johnson announced on Mondaythere was a plan to mandate certification at nightclubs and ""other venues where large crowds gather"". On Thursday, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the House of Commons that ""as a condition of entry"" to spectator sport events ""people will need to show that they are fully vaccinated and proof of a negative test will not be sufficient"".

"Taxpayers will bear the costs of Covid ""for decades"" - and an inquiry will not come soon enough to learn lessons from the pandemic, MPs have said. In two new reports, the Public Accounts Committee said No 10's response to the crisis has exposed UK taxpayers to""significant financial risks"",external. The MPs also attacked government spending on unusable protective kit. The Department of Health said there were ""processes"" to ensure spending gives taxpayers value for money. In the cross-party reports published on Sunday, the PAC said the taxpayer would be exposed to ""significant financial risks for decades to come"" with the estimated cost of the government's measures having already hit Â£372bn in May. UK government debt is now over Â£2.2 trillion, or about 99.7% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. In June alone,debt interest cost Â£8.7bn. In one example of future Covid costs, the PAC says taxpayers could be liable for an estimated Â£26 billion of bad loans, out of a total Â£92 billion of loans guaranteed by the government. The report states: ""While we acknowledge that there was a need to relax the usual rules surrounding major spending decisions... we are concerned that this has created serious risks that may require managing for years."" PAC chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier said: ""With eye-watering sums of money spent on Covid measures so far, the government needs to be clear, now, how this will be managed going forward, and over what period of time."" The MPs also said they are ""concerned that despite spending over Â£10bn on supplies, the [personal protective equipment] stockpile is not fit for purpose"". Out of 32 billion items of PPE ordered by the Department of Health and Social Care, the committee said 11 billion had been distributed, while 12.6 billion are stored in the UK as central stock. But some 8.4 billion items on order from other countries have still not arrived in the UK. The stockpile, MPs added, is costing about Â£6.7m a week to store, with potential waste levels ""unacceptably high"". According to the report, there were 10,000 shipping containers of PPE still to be unpacked as of May this year - but that it had already been determined that 2.1 billion PPE items were unusable in medical settings. The MPs said this equated to more than Â£2bn of taxpayers' money - and was over five times the estimate of PPE found to be unfit for purpose given to MPs by DHSC in January. How much is Covid costing and how will we pay? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged there will be anindependent public inquiry into government's handling of the pandemic- with an expected start date of Spring 2022. The PAC said it was ""clear that government cannot wait for the review before learning important lessons"" and must instead present a Covid recovery plan in the autumn spending review. Dame Meg added: ""If coronavirus is with us for a long time, the financial hangover could leave future generations with a big headache."" A DHSC spokeswoman said: ""There are robust processes in place to ensure that government spending always provides value for money for the taxpayer. ""We have worked tirelessly to source life-saving PPE to protect health and care staff, and we have delivered over 12.7 billion items to the frontline at record speed."" Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear? PPE price rises cost taxpayers Â£10bn, report says Meanwhile, an analysis by the Labour party suggests that the holiday plans of nearly six million Britons could be ruined if Spain and Greece are added to the ""amber plus"" list alongside France. The party said an estimated 5,857,558 people faced last-minute quarantine requirements after booking trips over the ""summer of chaos"". Since 19 July, fully vaccinated adults returning to the UK from amber list countries have not needed need to complete the 10-day quarantine period. Butministers removed the exemption for France amid fears over the Beta Covid variant, creating what critics say is an ""amber plus"" category on government's traffic light system for international travel. Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""Not only have they failed to protect our borders, allowing Covid cases to rocket - they also refuse to be straight with the public and give them the information they need to book travel with confidence."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The travel list allocations have not changed for Spain or Greece."" He added that officials were ""closely monitoring the data"" and would take ""swift action"" should the data reveal a change in risk to England from these countries.

"Queues have become a regular sight on Snowdon as hundreds of thousands of visitors hike up to the top Infrastructure unable to deal with rising visitor numbers could damage Wales' reputation as a tourist destination, an industry expert says.Â As visitors flock to mountains and beaches there have been reports ofpacked trains,traffic jams and parking problems. Tourism lecturer Marcus Hansen, of Wrexham Glyndwr University, said it could have ""negative consequences"".Â The Welsh government said it was providing support to deal with demand. Attractions have spoken of record numbers of visitors asmore people holiday in the UKdue toCovid foreign travel rules. National park wardens said car parks were full from first thing in the morning and campsites fully booked. While businesses welcomed the boom in visitors after months of closures, some said they were unable to cash in on demand due to Covid rules. This video can not be played ""Enormous problems"" are being caused by visitors not respecting Pistyll Rhaeadr, Phil Facey says Mr Hansen, who has a PhD in tourism and events management, said after lockdown people were looking for ""unique"" experiences and, with mountains, beaches and adventure, Wales had a lot to offer. ""We have such natural beauty - people are desperate for those after so many lockdowns, people want to be out in nature, and to feel that natural freedom,"" he said. ""But one worry is that we are very short-sighted at the moment, because it is about survival, it's about bums on seats... that may have negative consequences for tourism and the environment. ""It's a fine balance we are walking at the moment, we are desperate for people to come in and we need them to come in... but you don't want to damage our reputation, we don't want people to think Wales can't handle tourism."" Passengers described overcrowding on a bank holiday service from Barry as ""a disgrace"" With passengers complaining ofpacked and delayed trains, Mr Hansen said infrastructure was already struggling before Covid, and it was clear it could not cope. In Pembrokeshire there have been calls for safety improvements on the A40,over fears an influx in holiday traffic could lead to more deaths. Mr Hansen said there were major issues with parking at many hotspots, and increased traffic was causing tension in communities. ""In north Wales we have attractions that are unique compared to the rest of the world, but we have the A55, which is a three-lane road until you get to Wales, and then its a two-lane road,"" he said. A public inquiry is set to begininto plans to reduce jams by removing roundabouts near Conwy, with the Welsh government hoping to start work later this year. Plans for a new eight-mile dual carriageway inFlintshire have raised concerns about the environmental impact. Disabled access at Wales' tourist spots 'limit freedom' 'Visiting Edinburgh is easier than much of Wales' However, Mr Hansen said changes could not be made in time to deal with the demand, with some areas suffering for years with infrastructure. ""This ruins the experience for the tourists that are coming in, but it also ruins it for the locals, and causes resentment, because access to the natural areas of beauty is really difficult,"" he said. ""We can't just sit back and enjoy the tourism pounds that come in every summer, we have to invest in it."" Wardens fear unauthorised camping is damaging areas like Cwm Idwal in Snowdonia The Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire national park authorities say they are seeing an increase in illegal camping, littering and human waste on paths and car parks as the summer holidays begin. After hundreds of people parked on yellow lines to hike up Snowdon,the park authority introduced bookable parking and increased buses. David Jones, senior warden for the south of the park, said the parking scheme had been a success but other popular spots were ""ridiculously busy"" and in some places problems were getting worse. ""It's to do with the sheer number of people. The car parks are full to the brim,"" he said. Mr Jones said a small minority of people were abusing the landscape and he was concerned parts of the park might not be able to cope if numbers increased. More erosion was being caused to paths, more litter left, and more wardens would be needed to help deal with demand, he added. ""We are facing our busiest summer ever... people have realised they don't need to go abroad to enjoy themselves, and have realised the benefits of the outdoors. ""We want visitors to come, but we need to safeguard the park for the communities who live here, it is their home."" Pembrokeshire crackdown on camping in car parks MP calls for 'urgent review' of packed trains In the Brecon Beacons, the national park authority said it was dealing with a ""huge amount of visitors"" in the waterfall country, with a rise in littering. Lorraine Niederlag has started tuk-tuk picnic tours to help people who cannot find room in a restaurant In Pembrokeshire, after months taking older people to get their vaccines and delivering food to vulnerable people in lockdown, tuk-tuk drivers are back shuttling tourists around Tenby's winding streets, However, they said many visitors were unable to eat out because restaurants were at Covid capacity or closed due to staffing issues. ""People can't get the reservations... my husband picked someone up in Saundersfoot who said they'd had a lovely evening but couldn't get a restaurant, so had to get a sandwich from the supermarket,"" said owner Lorraine Niederlag. Ms Niederlag - who also owns a campsite - said their taxi service was being hit as campers ordered takeaways instead of eating out. ""It's hard to do anything spontaneous... you have to pre-book everything, but they are fully booked, people are queuing up half an hour for fish and chips,"" she said. She said they had started putting on picnic and cocktail tours to help visitors unable to book a meal out. Penrhyn Quarry has seen record numbers of visitors At Zip World in Bethesda, Gwynedd, staff are working flat out to deal with a record number of visitors trying to get a spot every day. ""It's incredible, but tiring - we've got a few more weeks of this, and I expect that September and October are going to be record breaking as well,"" said commercial director Andrew Hudson. He said people had no option but to drive to the site at Penrhyn Quarry, but they encouraged visitors to respect the national park and villages they drove through. ""It is amazing how much you can see in a day,"" he said, ""but you have to drive a car in north Wales - it can take 30 minutes to travel 10 miles. ""We would love to create an eco-friendly system where visitors can move around... an experience in itself, with pointing out the mountain ranges, and the myths and legends, which adds tremendous value to the area."" The Welsh government said it had worked closely with a range of bodies, including the national park authorities, to help plan carefully and safely and put mitigation measures in place. ""Funding is available to them and local authorities to support additional costs of managing increased visitor numbers,"" it said. ""We have also commissioned Transport for Wales to support Snowdonia National Park Authority, working with Gwynedd and Conwy councils, to encourage park and ride, bus and active travel in the national park,"" a spokesman said.

"Jude's family have described him as a ""determined child"" An 11-year-old boy has begun a 200-mile (321km) walk from his home in Yorkshire to Westminster to raise awareness of climate change. Jude, from Hebden Bridge, said he wanted to lobby ministers about the need for a carbon tax when he arrives in London. A petition, urging a parliamentary debate on a carbon tax, was launched in February by the Zero Carbon Campaign. The government said it was committed to cutting emissions by 78% by 2035. Jude was inspired after reading the book Dire Predictions, which he said offered solutions to climate change including a carbon tax. He then read about the Zero Carbon Campaign's petition. ""I am hoping to get this petition to 100,000 signatures so it can get debated in parliament,"" he said. ""It would make businesses think it will cost them more money to use fossil fuels and non-renewable options than to use green or renewable alternatives.""

"Pistyll Rhaeadr in north Powys is a popular tourist destination in Wales People living near a popular waterfall fear the lifting of Covid rules could cause trouble on nearby roads, after a chaotic summer last year. Pistyll Rhaeadr and local village Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, in Powys, were last yearinundated with visitors after the lifting of restrictions. Cars parked on a four-mile (6.4km) single track caused lengthy delays. Powys council said it would use enforcement where necessary, but added tourism was needed in the area. Waterfall village 'can't cope' with 3,000 visitors Police turn 60 cars away from Snowdon before 8am Twm Morris said many people had tried to park on his farm last year Twm Morris lives a mile from the waterfall - he's lived in the valley for 60 years and he said he had never seen anything like last year's gridlock. ""They'd just park, they'd leave the car anywhere. As long as they were out of it, and weren't walking, they'd leave the car anywhere,"" he said. Parking along the road last year made getting to and around the waterfall very difficult, according to residents He added some visitors had tried to leave their cars in his farmyard. ""Some were good, but some would just drive in if they wanted to park. And if you had one there, you had two, three, four - they'd multiply pretty fast. And the language was coming out. I've never heard such language in this valley,"" he said. The police have placed bollards at the entrance to Mr Morris' farm and he said so far this year things were better. This video can not be played ""Enormous problems"" are being caused by visitors not respecting Pistyll Rhaeadr, Phil Facey says Phil Facey runs a cafÃ© beside a carpark at the foot of the waterfall, where those parking are charged Â£5 on weekdays and Â£10 on weekends. Last year, he said the area could not cope with an increase in visitor numbers, from about 1,000 to 3,000 per day. A farmer has opened one of his fields for parking - also for a fee - to try to alleviate the congestion. But residents have said there is still a feeling of anxiety when the summer holidays arrive. Jo Moller said she finds drivers parking on her property ""a bit upsetting"" Jo Moller, owner of Simply Ribbons, who lives and works a mile-and-a-half (2.4km) from the waterfall, said: ""You see the weather forecast and see it's going to be sunny and it's the school holidays and it's almost a bit of a hesitation for us as to how we plan our days. ""Because it's not as easy to get out and to go out and about."" Ms Moller said she also had visitors trying to park in her garden. ""We've got our business here, so we need the access. We've had to barricade the lawn off because we can't always see from our house and, before you know it, people have parked there. Dangerous parking at beauty spots 'risking lives' 'More than 500 cars' parked on Snowdonia roads Campsites reopen - but not as you remember them ""And once one person parks there, they all think they can park there. ""It's a bit upsetting really because it's our property, they wouldn't like it if we parked on their lawn."" Ms Moller thinks a system of monitoring the number of cars that head up the single-track road from the village would help control the traffic. Powys council have introduced e-bikes for officers patrolling the area Powys council has this year introduced a designated clearway and new signs, and council wardens will be on patrol in the valley on e-bikes. Heulwen Hulme, portfolio holder for environment at Powys council, said civil enforcement officers were ""up there on a regular basis"" but they would increase their presence as necessary. The wardens can issue enforcement notices, but Mrs Hulme said none had been handed out so far. ""I'm sure there will be occasions when we will have to enforce, but at the moment, we're working with the tourists. We need tourists coming to our county to give a boost to our economy, which has been so badly hit over the last 18 months.""

"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days.

"BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson tries out go-karting on a track in a former Debenhams beauty hall I'm taking a spin on a go-kart track with a difference.  It's the old beauty hall of the Debenhams store in south-west London. The escalators are the only trace of the former department store which remain. All four floors are now being transformed into a high-tech entertainment venue. As we filmed, shoppers stopped to take photos when the shutters briefly opened giving a glimpse of the flashing lights and builders beavering away inside. ""We're creating a department store of fun,"" says Michael Harrison, the co-founder of Gravity which is due to open on 1 August. ""We have three bars, two restaurants, go-karting, a bowling alley, huge screens to watch sporting events and adventure golf. This is the future of the High Street. It's about experience,"" he says. Michael has no shortage of retail landlords now ringing him up offering him potential new locations. They're grappling with the need to rethink, or repurpose, empty shops. Latest figures suggest one in seven stores, on average, are lying vacant. And in some places the number is far higher. The UK's biggest property company, Landsec, owns the Southside shopping mall where Gravity is based. Its other centres include Bluewater in Kent and Trinity in Leeds. Gravity co-founder Michael Harrison says commercial landlords are keen for him to set up more entertainment venues Landsec boss Mark Allan thinks a quarter of what is currently retail space will need to be turned into something else. ""For me, it's really difficult to think of an example where you have 25% of something that it exists in the UK that is no longer required. And so you're not going to solve that sort of a problem by tinkering around the edges,"" he says. The pain won't be evenly spread either, says Mr Allan: ""Some places are going to be virtually empty and they are not going to survive as retail in any shape or form. ""Some are going to be absolutely fine - rents are lower, sales are lower and they're worth less than they were but fundamentally they've got a role to play longer term and some places are going to be in the middle where they are going to survive but they need some investment."" Some industry experts think the amount of redundant retail space is even higher. So how did we get here? We've seen a huge proliferation of shops over the last 40 years. Retail has just been growing and growing, from out of town retail parks and shopping centres to so called clone towns dominated by chains, who were willing to pay higher rents. That retail property boom is now over. Many of our town centres will have to find a new purpose. Landsec chief executive Mark Allan says people need to come together to reshape their town centres in new ways We've been talking about how to save the High Street for more than a decade but the pandemic has turbo charged the problems now. Mr Allan says it's time to act. ""Covid has been a tipping point. If we don't tackle it over the next couple of years together then there's a real risk some of this redundant retail property sits there for decades empty and that would be a disaster for the communities where that property is located."" And he says there's no single party that can solve the problem: ""This needs people to come together. I think it's a significant moment and a really big opportunity, particularly for those centres and high streets where there is no future for retail, for radical, bold, thinking. I think it could be exciting."" Stockton-on Tees has one of the boldest plans to reshape its entire town centre. It has decided to demolish a large part of its high street. The local council bought Stockton's two shopping centres and plans to knock one of them down, creating a new riverside park to make the town a greener, nicer place. The Â£37m project is largely being funded with money from the Tees Valley Combined Authority and the Government's Future High Streets Fund. The Castlegate mall was built in the 1970s, an era when local authorities were falling over themselves to attract big retail development. This video can not be played Former staff reminisce about life at their town's Debenhams branch ""Retail is still very important, but we now need to consolidate it to meet the demand,"" says councillor Nigel Cooke, cabinet member for regeneration. Businesses who want to stay will eventually move into the other shopping centre further up the street. The scheme is part of a wider masterplan to market Stockton as an events town. The main high street, the widest in the UK, has been spruced up with new paving, lighting and a big water fountain. The council is also paying for the renovation of the town's Grade II-listed art deco Globe Theatre. ""I think it is money well spent and I am convinced it's the right thing to do. We need to get people back onto the high street either to live, to work or to enjoy themselves,"" insists Mr Cooke. ""It would be easy to hide under my desk and say guys, we can't do anything, let's just wait for the good times to come back. But we have to do something.. nothing is risk free, it's about managing the risk."" But Stockton has now got a large, empty Debenhams to contend with, too. Town centre regeneration is often complicated stuff, with a myriad of owners, stakeholders and issues to solve. It's taken Stockton 13 years to get this far and it's only a third of the way through. But given the magnitude of the challenges now, doing nothing is no longer an option.
