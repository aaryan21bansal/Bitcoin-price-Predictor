"Tackling climate change must be woven into the solution to the Covid-19 economic crisis, the UK will tell governments next week. Environment ministers from 30 countries are meeting in a two-day online conference in a bid to make progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The gathering is called the ""Petersberg Climate Dialogue"". It will focus on how to organise a ""green"" economic recovery after the acute phase of the pandemic is over. The other aim is to forge international agreement on ambitious carbon cuts despite the postponement of the key conference COP26 - previously scheduled for Glasgow in November (now without a date). Alok Sharma, the UK Climate Secretary and president of COP26, said: ""I am committed to increasing global climate ambition so that we deliver on the Paris Agreement (to stabilise temperature rise well below 2C). ""The world must work together, as it has to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, to support a green and resilient recovery, which leaves no one behind. ""At the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, we will come together to discuss how we can turn ambition into real action."" 'Gob-smacking' vision for future UK transport Don't bail out airlines, say climate campaigners Virus will transform UK work and travel, says AA The informal conference is co-hosted by the UK and Germany. Developed and developing countries will attend, along with the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, and members of civil society and business.  Last week, Mr Guterres warned that climate change wasa deeper problem than the virus. Campaign groups will be sceptical about the meeting. Since the Paris deal to cut emissions, CO2 has actually been rising - although there's currently a blip in the trend thanks to the Covid recession. The development charity CARE says it's alarmed that public finance provided from rich countries to developing countries to adapt to inevitable climate change actually decreased in 2018. Sven Harmeling from CARE said: ""If governments fail to make their economic stimulus sustainable and equitable, they will drive our planet much deeper into the existential economic, social and ecological turmoil caused by the climate crisis."" The EU is already set on delivering a green stimulus. The Commission's Green Deal chief, Frans Timmermans, said every euro spent on economic recovery measures after the COVID-19 crisis would be linked to the green and digital transitions. ""The European Green Deal is a growth strategy and a winning strategy,"" he tweeted. ""It's not a luxury we drop when we hit another crisis. It is essential for Europe's future. Meanwhile, China appears set on its current carbon-intensive development path, and President Trump says the US will rescue struggling fossil fuel firms. Even in Europe there's a degree of push-back against the idea of a green stimulus . Markus Pieper, an MEP from the centre-right German CDU party, told the magazine FOCUS that the EU's sweeping plan for investment in clean technologies would no longer be possible. He said: ""The Green Deal was a gigantic challenge for an economy in top shape. After the corona bloodletting, it is simply not financially viable."" But the UK climate economist Lord Stern told BBC News: ""The immediate priority is the current Covid crisis â but then we have to build for the future. ""Timmermans is right and Trump is wrong. We should only be bailing out firms that are going to contribute to tackling climate change. ""They donât have be be ostensibly clean tech firms at the moment â but they do have to be committed to cutting their emissions in line with international targets.""

"Some workers could make the permanent move to work from home, which will lead to lower commuter numbers The number of people using public transport in Britain's cities could be 20% lower than normal after the end of the coronavirus lockdown. In London, commuters using buses and tubes could fall by as much as 40% from pre-lockdown levels. Rail use could drop by 27%, a poll for transport consultants SYSTRA has found. The survey results capture people's current attitudes about returning to work, but some changes may be carried on into the long term. The results are bad news for the government, which wants more people touse public transport to cut emissionsthat are fuelling climate heating. It could lead to more people driving to work. It's also challenging for public transport operators, which will face a sharp drop in income until public confidence returns. But the survey offers a glimmer of good news too. It suggests that of those expecting to reduce their use of buses and trains,  24% said they plan to work from home more, which will reduce emissions. They said they wanted to save on the commute time and cost, and to strike a better work-life balance. There's a major boost for video-conferencing, too. As many as 67% of people in the 1,500-strong survey said they believe virtual meetings will replace some or all business trips or meetings. Katie Hall from SYSTRA said: ""Our climate emergency has not been cancelled. There is no doubt that this situation has opened up different ways of working for many, but if people start rejecting public transport over the car for work and leisure trips - that's a massive step backwards. Public transport operators must rise to this challenge."" She said public transport operators must work hard to convince commuters that they'll be safe from the virus. Transport for London has has cut many services since the coronavirus outbreak swept through the capital But she also said transport planners would need to think hard about how travel patterns may change permanently after lockdown. The AA's head Edmund King told BBC News he expected that trafficlevels would fall overall. That has implications for the government's Â£28bn roads programme which is predicated on 1% annual growth in transport demand. There could also be a boom in walking and cycling in a population that may be more interested in health messages. The government recentlycut red tapeon issuing urban road closures to allow councils to exclude cars and create space for walkers and cyclists more easily. Cycle campaigners want cars excluded from major parts of cities on a permanent basis - whichhappened recently in Milan,external.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus test website designed to close and reopen with more slots - Shapps The government website for key workers to apply for coronavirus tests has reopened after ""exceptional demand"". Speaking at Friday's daily briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the site closed after ""the slots for today were taken up"". It came back online on Friday evening, allowing key workers to apply for tests at drive-through centres, before being suspended again. More slots were available on Saturday morning. However, home testing kits were no longer available after less than 15 minutes of the site being reopened. Some 16,000 bookings were made on the website on Friday. The site had toclose to new applicants within hours of launching, after 46,000 people tried to access it, but Mr Shapps said it had not crashed and that further tests would become available. He also stressed the test was only suitable to test if you think you currently have coronavirus, not if you have previously had it. No 10 has said appointments for tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available from 08:00 BST each day, with their release staggered throughout the day. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Mr Shapps said ministers were ""encouraged"" by the initial demand for tests, and suggested that the government was on track to meet its target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. ""It looks like the trajectory to 100,000 tests by the end of April is going to be met in terms of capacity,"" he said. ""I would say, after today, the demand is there, so if those two things come together we will have it being met."" He added that getting ""somewhere near"" the 100,000 tests a day target would be an achievement by international standards. Earlier, the prime minister's spokesman said 5,000 home testing kits had been ordered ""within two minutes"" of the website opening on Friday. Up to 18,000 home testing kits per day will be available by the end of next week. Downing Street said the government is trusting that those applying for tests are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. Under the expanded testing scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday,all essential workers,externalin England and their families are eligible to register for tests on thegovernment's website,external, if they have virus symptoms. Up to 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for testing, with the aim of allowing essential staff to safely return to work. Liz Christie, an education support worker from Slough, Berkshire, successfully applied for a coronavirus test early on Friday. She said was keen to get a test after developing a cough and sore throat, as she wanted to return to work at Slough Children's Services Trust. ""I don't want to infect the children and families I'm working with, plus my own family,"" she told BBC News. Speaking after her test at a drive-through centre in Wembley, north-west London, Ms Christie said the process was ""brilliant"" but added that there were not many other people getting tested at the same time. ""It looks like there's five stations set up,"" she said. ""All the stations were empty except mine, there were two cars in front of me and no-one behind me. ""They've got the infrastructure in place, they just need the people now."" Also speaking at the daily press briefing, the government's deputy chief medical adviser, Dr Jenny Harries, said the increased testing would mean there would be a less positive picture on the number of Covid -19 cases. She stressed that the test on offer to key workers was the ""have you got it now?"" test, and said it would be a ""wasted test"" if it was used by people who did not have symptoms, or people in their households. Friday's figures showed 28,532 tests were carried out, though the government says that capacity has reached more than 50,000 a day. The latest data also showed a further 684 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 19,506. Also at the briefing, Mr Shapps announced the government would subsidise key supply routes to ensure that essential medical supplies and food can be transported during the pandemic. With large sections of the economy frozen, volumes of freight coming in and out of Britain are significantly down. Up to Â£17m has been made available for supply routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and up to Â£10.5m for ferry and freight services to the Isle of Wight and Scilly Isles. Further support is available for critical routes between Britain and the European mainland, including Eurotunnel, Mr Shapps said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The government also pledged to give additional support to several English cities so thatlight rail and tram services can be maintained. Manchester, Sheffield, the West Midlands, Nottingham and Tyne and Wear will receive funding. And Mr Shapps announced the fast-tracking oftrial drone flightsbetween the mainland and St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight to ensure it was equipped to tackle the virus. In other developments: The Guardian reported,externalthat the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been taking part in meetings of the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which has provided advice to ministers throughout the coronavirus outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said ""it is not true"" that Mr Cummings is on or member of Sage, adding that he has attended ""some meetings"" At the briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, dismissedDonald Trump's suggestion that people could inject themselveswith disinfectant to battle coronavirus The death tollin the US has passed 50,000in what is the world's deadliest outbreak Identical twin sistershave died within three days of each otherafter testing positive for the virus Dyson has said themedical ventilator it developed to help treat patientswith Covid-19 is no longer required Two doctors who say they have been exposed to coronavirus patientsare challenging government guidanceon protective equipment Anyone classified as an""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours.

"This video can not be played Katy Davis (left) and her identical twin Emma always believed they would die together, according to their sister, Zoe Twin sisters have died within three days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus. Children's nurse Katy Davis, 37, died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday. Identical twin Emma, herself a former nurse, died at the same hospital early on Friday. Their sister, Zoe, said: ""They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well."" She said the ""amazing"" pair, who lived together, had other health conditions and had been unwell for some time. ""There are no words to describe how special they were,"" she said. The ""amazing"" twins had underlying health conditions, their sister said ""All they ever wanted to do was to help other people. Ever since they were young...they'd pretend they were doctors and nurses caring for their dolls. ""They gave their everything to all the patients they looked after. They were exceptional."" ""It doesn't feel like any of this is real."" Katy, who worked at Southampton Children's Hospital, tested positive for Covid-19 on admission to hospital and died on Tuesday evening. Paula Head, chief executive of University Hospital SouthamptonÂ NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Katy has been described by her colleagues... as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her. ""On behalf of everyone here... including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family."" The Royal College of Nursing said: ""She's been described as a dedicated and selfless nurse who had time for everyone sharing her skills and knowledge to ensure excellent patient care."" The sisters died within three days of each other at the same hospital, Zoe Davis said Emma Davis had worked at the same hospital as her sister in the colorectal surgery unit for nine years until 2013. In a message to staff, chief nursing officer Gail Byrne said: ""She had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19. ""It goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them. ""Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader. ""She was well-liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us.""

"China says calls for an investigation are an unwelcome distraction China has rejected calls for an independent international investigation into the origin of the coronavirus. A top diplomat in the UK, Chen Wen told the BBC the demands were politically motivated and would divert China's attention from fighting the pandemic. Information about the origin of Covid-19 and how it initially spread could help countries tackle the disease. The virus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in the city of Wuhan late last year. Meanwhile an EU report accuses China of spreading disinformation about the crisis. The bloc's External Action Service says Russia, and to a lesser extent China, have ""targeted conspiracy narratives"" in the EU and neighbouring countries. US President Donald Trump has also repeatedly attacked China for its handling of the outbreak, andthe state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government, accusing it of doing little to stop the spread of the virus. Scientists have poured cold water on speculation that the virus could have been engineered in a Wuhan laboratory. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? LEADING THE WAY:How California kept ahead of the curve ON FRONTLINE:The young doctors being asked to play god FACTORY HOTSPOT:The untold story behind America's biggest outbreak REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis Almost from the start of the pandemic, there have been calls for international investigators to be allowed into China to find out how it all started. On Thursday Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that he would push for an investigation at the annual meeting next month of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO). Australia sits on the executive board of the assembly. The body already plans to discuss calls for a ""lessons learned"" review of health emergencies. A dazed city emerges from the harshest of lockdowns China and the virus that threatens everything But Ms Chen told the BBC her country could not agree to any international investigation. ""The independent inquiry is politically motivated,"" she said. ""We are fighting the virus at the moment, we are concentrating all our efforts on fighting against the virus. Why talk about an investigation into this? This will divert not only attention, it will divert resources. ""This is a politically motivated initiative, I think no-one can agree on this... It would serve nobody any good."" Ms Chen said there were lots of rumours about the origins of the virus but such misinformation was dangerous, she claimed, and said it was like a political virus and as  dangerous as coronavirus itself, if not even more so. Governments in Europe have so far been wary of engaging in a diplomatic row with China at a sensitive time. One UK official, who like others declined to speak on the record, said there was a ""nervousness"" about confronting China and that relations were ""delicate"". Countries are dependent on Beijing for deliveries of vital equipment in dealing with the crisis and want to keep the flow of information open to help understand what happened this time and prevent future outbreaks, and experts say the approach needs to be carefully calibrated. ""We need to dial down the rhetoric and the confrontation because we've got something more serious to deal with,"" argues Charles Parton, a former UK diplomat in China and now a senior associate fellow at the RUSI think- tank. In the US by contrast, the issue of China is becoming highly politicised in an election year with competing calls for a tough line on Beijing and pressure to investigate the origins of the virus. Read more from Gordon here. ""Despite their potentially grave impact on public health, official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and - to a lesser extent - China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighbourhood,"" the report says. It claims Chinese officials and state media have been trying to deflect blame for the outbreak, curtailing any mentions of Wuhan as the origin of the virus, with some state-controlled social media channels continuing to spread the theory that the outbreak was linked to visiting US military representatives. The authors also say there is ""significant evidence of covert Chinese operations on social media"", citing reports of networks on Twitter with ties to the Chinese government. The report also singles out Russia for spreading disinformation, saying pro-Kremlin sources and Russian state media were continuing to run a coordinated campaign with the aim of undermining the EU and its crisis response and sowing confusion about the origins and health implications of Coronavirus.

"The lockdown has caused a surge in the number of people contacting the Revenge Porn Helpline, the government-funded service for adults experiencing intimate image abuse. Traffic to the helpline's website nearly doubled in the week beginning Monday 23 March and more cases were opened in the following four weeks than in any previous four-week period. Campaigners are calling for extra funding for the helpline, which has only two full-time members of staff, to help it cope with the rising workload. Intimate image abuse - or the threat of it - is one way an abuser can still impose control even if they are not isolating with their partner or ex-partner. Stress, break-ups and job loss can all aggravate pre-existing abusive behaviour and coercive control, says Clare McGlynn, Professor of Law at Durham University. She attributes the rise in cases of intimate image abuse to ""the increased use of the internet and social media, as well as heightened emotions"" during lockdown. Sophie Mortimer, manager of the Revenge Porn Helpline, told the BBC that over half of the cases since lockdown clearly originated in ""an abusive or controlling relationship"". ""The level of distress caused shouldn't be underestimated. We are frequently hearing from people seeking our help that they are contemplating suicide or self-harm, the impact of the abuse seems so overwhelming,"" she said. When the messages lit up her phone Ava, 21, immediately started to panic. One read, ""Can't even get the same satisfaction from leaking your nudes now you're an actual hoe [whore]."" Surely he was bluffing, she remembers thinking. ""I don't care what happens to me as long as I ruin your life,"" another message read. It quickly became clear that her ex was enraged by the fact that she was isolating with her new boyfriend, and that his threats to post intimate pictures and videos from their two-year-long relationship had to be taken seriously. ""I just cried hysterically, I felt so sick, I was having a full-on panic attack, I couldn't breathe,"" she says. Because Ava and her ex work together, she had to inform her manager. She also told her family. ""It was absolutely heart-breaking,"" she says. Ava thinks the lockdown has given her ex ""more time to be vindictive"". ""I've spent my days going through different porn sites, just in case. I've just been feeling worthless, it's made me feel like I just want to disappear."" The Revenge Porn Helpline opened more than 200 cases in the four weeks from 23 March, and more last week than in any week since 2015, when it came into existence as a consequence of section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act - the law making intimate image abuse a criminal offence for the first time. Charities are worried that one effect of the lockdown will be an increase in ""sexting"" from couples who are not isolating together, which then increases the likelihood of intimate image abuse arising as a result. Where this affects under-18s, the incident falls under the Sexual Offences Act, and offenders may be guilty of the serious charge of sharing an indecent image of a minor. The Internet Watch Foundation, an organisation that removes child sexual abuse imagery online, said: ""We are very worried that the increased number of children online, as well as an increased number of criminals who may be looking to exploit this, could put children in danger."" Tink Palmer, CEO of The Marie Collins Foundation, urged parents and guardians not to ""victim blame"" if their child reveals that they have been the victim of abuse. A week after the UK-wide lockdown was announced, Maya, 25, woke up to an influx of friend requests from men she didn't know. Her stomach sank, it was happening again. For the first time since last summer, nudes taken when she was a teenager had been reposted on a well-known website used for intimate image abuse. Her full name and her school were in the captions. She spotted a message at the top of the website: ""We currently have a 24-hour backlog of memberships due to the sheer volume coming in. Keep up the amazing posting everyoneâ¦ We would like to thank every one of our contributing users for all the effort put in to keep us all a steady stream of fresh porn to view over the lockdowns that are carrying on all over the world."" Maya is worried that her pictures will be shared and seen by more people this time, because of the lockdown. ""Every time they come up, I get so worried about someone seeing them, and how that could actually impact my job as a teacher. Now I feel like I have to keep checking it all the time."" When a website is hosted abroad, police in the UK have little power to help. Instead victims have to go through a complicated process to ask site admins to delete the posts. Maya was shown how to do this by the Revenge Porn Helpline and the images have now been taken down. ""The Revenge Porn Helpline do a fantastic job of assisting victims in getting content off websites and assisting them in emotional support. The helpline itself however deserves much more funding than they currently get - as cases increase funding ought to follow,"" said Kate Isaacs, founder of #NotYourPorn, which campaigns for tighter regulation of pornography websites. The Revenge Porn Helpline said: ""The helpline is busier than it has ever been but the service is very much open to offer help, advice and support."" A Home Office press officer urged any victims of intimate image abuse to report it to the police. Commenting on the call for the helpline to be given extra funding, the press officer said: ""We already provide funding to the National Revenge Porn Helpline and we are in close contact with charities to ensure they bid for the Â£750m in support announced for the charity sector."" But manager Sophie Mortimer said she had not yet heard whether the helpline would be entitled to any of the government's charity support package. Louise's ex-boyfriend posted intimate pictures and videos of her on Snapchat just before the lockdown - a week after they broke up. People then sent the 24-year-old screenshots of her ex threatening to ""pay someone to rape her"" and a voice note in which he vividly described how he would beat her up in the street. ""When it first happened I spiralled hard - I was really suicidal and felt so trapped because I didn't know what to do,"" she says.

"Odd combinations have long been a staple of the entertainment industry. For those old enough to have seen it (still available on YouTube), who can forget Prince Edward's cringe-inducing toe-dip into television production with the culture-clash that was It's A Royal knockout? Not the Queen, that's for sure, who went on to show her youngest son how to play the incongruous card with her winning James Bond spoof at the London Olympics. The Royal Family's infamous day out at Alton Towers was in 1987, 30 years after the comedian Frank Skinner was born, a fact I learnt from listening to his new podcast, which is another example of the light-entertainment-meets-highfalutin genre. Frank Skinner's Poetry Podcast,externalis knowingly tapping into the surprising-juxtaposition game, following the likes of Lenny Henry who has successfully evolved from kids' show clown to serious Shakespearian actor. ""Yes, yes, poetry"" Skinner says in his introduction, acknowledging it might seem an unlikely subject for a man still shaking off a '90s laddish image. The comedian and actor, Frank Skinner says he developed his love of poetry while studying English at Birmingham Polytechnic Actually, it's not in the least bit strange that he should be drawn to poetry or Lenny Henry to Shakespeare. There are two common attributes shared by the majority of successful comedians: the first being an intellectual curiosity, and the second, an understanding and appreciation of language and its use. It is a mark of how the Arts have allowed themselves to become segregated - broadly along class lines - between what is seen as cheap entertainment and classy culture. It is a perception, not a reality. Rock, pop, and rap are as worthy an art form as classical music, and stand-up comedy could justifiably be considered performance art. The division between the different artistic forms of human expression is a nonsense. Frank Skinner shouldn't have to defend his love of poetry, nor the fact that he is approaching it as a fan and not as an academic. Poetry and comedy are natural bedfellows - a fact that Skinner demonstrates in this one-man-no-guests podcast peppered with amusing asides and left-of-field references - from the absurdist dramatist EugÃ¨ne Ionesco to a whippet dog called Frank Skinner. First up on the first episode of the first series (I hope there are plenty more) is the 20th Century British poet and artist Stevie Smith (1902 - 1971) and her 1957 classicNot Waving but Drowning,external, a three-verse meditation on someone with a jolly public persona hiding a desperate soul: Nobody heard him, the dead man, But still he lay moaning: I was much further out than you thought And not waving but drowning. Skinner's approach is to personalise the poems he discusses, arguing, not unreasonably, that his response is a coming together of his viewpoint with that of the poet. It's a familiar argument made particularly well in an essay called the Creative Act, written by Marcel Duchamp in the same year as Smith produced Not Waving but Drowning. Stevie Smith's Not Waving but Drowning was first published in 1957, and was voted Britain's fourth favourite poem in a poll in 1995 It is a very good poem, the title of which has become part of our everyday lexicon. I remember sitting on the beach at Bude in Cornwall, keeping half an eye on my kids bodyboarding while staring out at sea and contemplating what flavour of ice-cream I fancied. I saw a woman waving from her surf board and mentioned the friendly gesture to my wife, who, paraphrasing Smith, said ""she's not waving, she's drowning"". And so she was. Two guys in red swimming trunks, neither of whom looked remotely like David Hasselhoff, surfed out and rescued her. It was very dramatic, but not, Skinner speculates, the real subject of Smith's poem. It is not literally about drowning at sea but a distant character who stands outside the swim of daily life: a man who - to all appearances - is waving enthusiastically when in reality he is drowning in obscurity (""I was much further out than you thought"" the dead man reports). This Skinner can relate to, and tells us the thing he most enjoyed about being famous, was neither the money nor the trappings, but being noticed, being ""heard"": I was much too far out all my life And not waving but drowning. It is not easy to relay the meaning and rhythm of poem while retaining a voice that doesn't sound like a cliche of a worthy 1970s round-table poetry group. Skinner nails the task, bringing the poet's words to life before veering off on an anecdote or explaining that poetry is broken up into lumps known as verses (fancy language is banished, which is why, perhaps, he chose Smith who used simple language to communicate ideas and feelings of great complexity). The show is not perfect, but then it is only one episode old. Having got our attention and established his chatty approach, there's scope for Skinner to go a little deeper into the text. Not Waving but Drowning is a timely poem to study, not just because it speaks to our current anxieties, but also that in 12 short lines Smith introduces three separate voices who tell us the ambiguous story in words chosen specifically for their weaselly slipperiness. Fake news, and all that. There is also room for a bit more biographical detail. Obviously, this is Skinner's informal take on poetry, with the way it touches him a large part of the show's structure, but it could be rebalanced to allow the poet to share some the limelight. We learn very little about Smith, and almost nothing about William Carlos Williams (1883 - 1963), the American modernist poet who wrote Skinner's second choice of the week,Danse Russe,external(1916). The American poet, William Carlos Williams once wrote ""The purpose of an artist, whatever it is, is to take the life, whatever he sees, and to raise it up to an elevated position where it has dignity"" It is another terrific selection. A little longer than Smith's, but not by much. It shares the subject of loneliness, but from the other side of the desolate coin. This time our male protagonist is watching the sun rise as his wife and children sleep. He is enjoying a moment of sensual euphoria, suppressed from full expression perhaps, to keep the genie of his genius in the bottle: ""I am lonely, lonely. I was born to be lonely, I am best so!"" If I admire my arms, my face, my shoulders, flanks, buttocks against the yellow drawn shades,â Who shall say I am not the happy genius of my household? It would have helped to have some biographical detail; to have known that Williams was a paediatrician by day and a poet by night (the genius of the household?): that he was searching for a new American idiom that established a language independent from European influences, and that the poem was indebted to the French Symbolist poet StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©'s L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune (Williams spent time living in France). Claude Debussy then wrote a piece of music in response to MallarmÃ©, which was subsequently turned into a dance for the Ballets Russes (hence the title of Williams's poem) by Vaslav Nijinsky, which Williams saw performed in New York having known it'd caused a furore in Paris years earlier when Nijinsky started writhing in ecstasy, alone on the stage, to howls of derision and gasps of delight. The influence of StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©'s poem L'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune can be seen in William Carlos Williams' Danse Russe Vaslav Nijinsky choreographed and danced in L'AprÃ©s-midi d'un faune for the Ballets Russes in 1912, which William Carlos Williams saw years later Skinner only touches on this back story and isn't entirely accurate on all his factual details (I don't think Williams lived in New York, he was a man of Rutherford, New Jersey). To an extent that's forgivable, our host says he doesn't go much for background info because he wants to have a relationship with the work of art not the person who made it or what might have influenced it. He then humbly adds, ""that might be an error on my part"". I suspect it is. The more you repeat read a poem, which Skinner rightly encourages us to do, the more you want to comprehend, and that usually means going beyond the page to the person holding the pen. That's the way into the rest of the writer's work, and the discovering of little jewels like Williams'sThis is Just to Say,external, which for some reason reminds me of a Cezanne still life: I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox Paul CÃ©zanne's Still Life with Fruit Dish (1879-80) First-episode teething troubles are to be expected and should not detract from a very welcome new addition to the cultural landscape: a simple idea without any fancy production presented by someone who brings insight and enthusiasm to an art form that is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Roll on Monday for the second instalment. I think it's going to get better and better.

"This video can not be played Katy Davis (left) and her identical twin Emma always believed they would die together, according to their sister, Zoe Twin sisters have died within three days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus. Children's nurse Katy Davis, 37, died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday. Identical twin Emma, herself a former nurse, died at the same hospital early on Friday. Their sister, Zoe, said: ""They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well."" She said the ""amazing"" pair, who lived together, had other health conditions and had been unwell for some time. ""There are no words to describe how special they were,"" she said. The ""amazing"" twins had underlying health conditions, their sister said ""All they ever wanted to do was to help other people. Ever since they were young...they'd pretend they were doctors and nurses caring for their dolls. ""They gave their everything to all the patients they looked after. They were exceptional."" ""It doesn't feel like any of this is real."" Katy, who worked at Southampton Children's Hospital, tested positive for Covid-19 on admission to hospital and died on Tuesday evening. Paula Head, chief executive of University Hospital SouthamptonÂ NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Katy has been described by her colleagues... as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her. ""On behalf of everyone here... including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family."" The Royal College of Nursing said: ""She's been described as a dedicated and selfless nurse who had time for everyone sharing her skills and knowledge to ensure excellent patient care."" The sisters died within three days of each other at the same hospital, Zoe Davis said Emma Davis had worked at the same hospital as her sister in the colorectal surgery unit for nine years until 2013. In a message to staff, chief nursing officer Gail Byrne said: ""She had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19. ""It goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them. ""Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader. ""She was well-liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us."" Hospital staff held a ""Clap for Katy"" outside the main entrance on Thursday evening, hours before Emma's death.

"UK companies face a cash flow crisis as many have been forced to close due to the lockdown Payouts to UK firms over coronavirus could cost Â£1.2bn, initial estimates from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) indicate. Close to Â£900m will go to a small number of firms that have infectious disease insurance, the ABI says. Watchdogs are predicting a rise in disputes between companies and insurers over whether their cover includes the financial fallout of Covid-19. The Treasury Select Committee is urging insurers to be fair with claimants. Most of the Â£1.2bn figure is made up of business interruption insurance, but only to those companies which took out specialist policies, such asWimbledon organisersthe All England Club, . The organisers of the Wimbledon Championship cancelled its lucrative sporting fixture, but will be covered by insurance ABI chief executive Huw Evans explained why some claims will not result in a payment to firms. ""Most business interruption insurance policies that most businesses have are very much designed to protect them from fire and floor every day risks that protect their businesses and in the small number of cases it's designed to cover illnesses that come on your premises for a short duration they're not intended and not priced to cover a global pandemic."" However Mr Evans also said there will be claims that have to go to arbitration between insurers and claimants over whether they are covered for the pandemic. If insurers and companies cannot settle a dispute between themselves it goes to the Financial Ombudsman to sort it out. The ABI says its early estimate also includes a record Â£275m paid to customers in cancellation claims on travel insurance, and Â£25m for claims relating to weddings, school trips and events. The initial estimate of Â£1.2bn in payouts does not include claims made through the major insurance market Lloyd's of London. Commenting on the ABI's claims, Commons Treasury Select Committee chair Mel Stride said MPs had heard of many UK businesses struggling to get money from their insurers. ""The ABI has estimated that its members will pay out Â£900m in business interruption claims relating to coronavirus. ""Yet, the Committee continues to receive evidence concerning the difficulties that firms are facing in making a successful claim. ""For example, [Pub and dining firm lobby group] UKHospitality told us that 71% of its members have had claims rejected, with only 1% having any success. Pubs, bars and restaurants have been virtually empty across the UK for more than a month ""There may be many instances where individuals and businesses believe they are covered, but in reality may not be. ""However, we are concerned that the insurance sector goes the extra mile in meeting claims wherever possible. For example, where there may be grey areas within policies."" Last week the Financial Conduct Authority ordered insurance companies to pay out claims to firms ""as soon as possible"" or explain themselves to the watchdog. The British Chambers of Commerce's head of economics, Suren Thiru, said cash flow was an 'urgent concern' for its member businesses ""so it is particularly disappointing that many are facing an uphill struggle to access such a vital lifeline. ""The insurance industry has the opportunity to demonstrate that it is there for our business communities when they need it most - and work together with government to help their customers weather this unprecedented economic crisis.""

"Some workers could make the permanent move to work from home, which will lead to lower commuter numbers The number of people using public transport in Britain's cities could be 20% lower than normal after the end of the coronavirus lockdown. In London, commuters using buses and tubes could fall by as much as 40% from pre-lockdown levels. Rail use could drop by 27%, a poll for transport consultants SYSTRA has found. The survey results capture people's current attitudes about returning to work, but some changes may be carried on into the long term. The results are bad news for the government, which wants more people touse public transport to cut emissionsthat are fuelling climate heating. It could lead to more people driving to work. It's also challenging for public transport operators, which will face a sharp drop in income until public confidence returns. But the survey offers a glimmer of good news too. It suggests that of those expecting to reduce their use of buses and trains,  24% said they plan to work from home more, which will reduce emissions. They said they wanted to save on the commute time and cost, and to strike a better work-life balance. There's a major boost for video-conferencing, too. As many as 67% of people in the 1,500-strong survey said they believe virtual meetings will replace some or all business trips or meetings. Katie Hall from SYSTRA said: ""Our climate emergency has not been cancelled. There is no doubt that this situation has opened up different ways of working for many, but if people start rejecting public transport over the car for work and leisure trips - that's a massive step backwards. Public transport operators must rise to this challenge."" She said public transport operators must work hard to convince commuters that they'll be safe from the virus. Transport for London has has cut many services since the coronavirus outbreak swept through the capital But she also said transport planners would need to think hard about how travel patterns may change permanently after lockdown. The AA's head Edmund King told BBC News he expected that trafficlevels would fall overall. That has implications for the government's Â£28bn roads programme which is predicated on 1% annual growth in transport demand. There could also be a boom in walking and cycling in a population that may be more interested in health messages. The government recentlycut red tapeon issuing urban road closures to allow councils to exclude cars and create space for walkers and cyclists more easily. Cycle campaigners want cars excluded from major parts of cities on a permanent basis - whichhappened recently in Milan,external.

"Wales' official Covid-19 death toll jumps to 751 after a further 110 reported fatalities The increase includes 84 backdated deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area of north Wales due to a delay in the reporting process First Minister Mark Drakeford says the reporting delay will be investigated but claims it did not affect the overall picture Tougher rules from Saturday will make it clear people cannot stay or exercise outside their area But some restrictions in Wales could be eased at the end of the current three-week lockdown period, the first minister says Debenhams warns its biggest stores in Wales could shut permanently unless the Welsh Government agrees to offer business rates relief Rachel Flint and Richard Porter Thank you for following our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. The Saturday team will be bringing you all the latest news from 08:00 tomorrow morning. Have a lovely evening and stay safe. As we draw our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Wales to a close for tonight, here's a recap of the key things we learnt today: A Laura Ashley factory is among businesses manufacturing for the NHS to battle coronavirus. The firm's Texplan factory, in Newtown, are making hospital scrubs while Hay-on-Wye's TS Henderson & Co is making test equipment and oxygen supplies. TS Henderson has previously made parts for Rolls-Royce. Managing director Rob Henderson said: ""At an hour of need, weâre playing our part. ""Our existing and new customers in the supply chain are awesome to work with, but we are all inspired by those in the NHS who are saving lives on the front line.â Cemeteries in Cardiff are set to reopen with strict social distancing measures in place, so people can visit loved ones' graves. The council closed cemetery gates at the start of April after reports of people having picnics, playing football and groups of people gathering in the grounds, despite the coronavirus restrictions. A 73-year-old man, who lost his wife after a short illness six years ago, said it hadbeen heartbreaking not to be able to visit her grave. But from tomorrow four of the city's cemeteries will reopen, with council workers and police monitoring strict social distancing measures for visitors. But they have urged people only to visit cemeteries if they are attending a grave or for a funeral. Councillor Michael Michael said the closure was always a temporary measure which had been kept under review. ""We know this has been a difficult time for those who have been unable to visit the grave of their loved ones, and I would ask people to ensure that, now these important spaces are open, they use them appropriately and maintain a safe distance from others if they do visit,"" he said. A health board failing to publish daily figures for those who have died with coronavirus, ""smacks of incompetence"", a Conservative assembly member has said. Betsi Cadwaladr health board reported 84 deaths in the north Wales area on Thursday. It made it look like Wales had seen the biggest daily jump in confirmed deaths to date - 110 - but it included Betsi Cadwaladr's figures which were for a whole month. The health board said the delay was due to issues with its reporting system. But Tory AM Mark Isherwood said whether the board said they were ""delayed"" or retrospectively published, the 84 deaths had gone ""unreported"". âI am staggered as to how they could have been missed, and I am equally concerned as to how this may have skewed the overall figures and the approach to combating coronavirus. âIt smacks of incompetence of the highest level, and will create further anxiety for people who have experienced the problems of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board â which has been in special measures for nearly five years â as we go through this pandemic.â Should we be more relaxed about government surveillance, if it helps combat the coronavirus? Read more here. More intensive care staff and specialist doctors need to be recruited if Wales is to cope with coronavirus and beyond, a senior doctor says. Bethan Gibson, deputy head of the training programme for intensive care in Wales, saidthe virus highlighted the lack of such staff. ""We need to train more trainees to fill the gaps that were already there. And then we need to train even more trainees to fill the gaps that will be there because of Covid,"" she said. The Welsh Government said its emergency recruitment drive has signed up more than 2,000 people to return to the NHS to help during the crisis, and nearly 900 staff have already completed critical care training. Sir Tom Jones has lost his claim to be the oldest person to have a number one hit record to Captain Tom Moore. The 99-year-old fundraiser was recognised asthe oldest person to top the official UK pop chartsbecause of his appearance with Michael Ball on a cover version of You'll Never Walk Alone. Guinness World Records said the accolade was previously held by Sir Tom, who was 68 when he sang on 2009 charity single Barry Islands in the Stream. The Welsh star was quick to congratulate his successor. ""Capt Moore, from one Tom to another, congratulations on beating my chart record,"" he said. ""If I was going to lose to anybody, it's an honour to have lost to you, with all you have done raising money for the NHS."" As of Friday evening, Capt Moore had raised more than Â£28.6m by walking around the garden at his home in Bedfordshire. Captain Tom and Michael Ball celebrate their number one Wales football captain Sophie Ingle is coping with life in lockdown by doing family quizzes and yoga - not re-watching her wonder goal for Chelsea. ""I've not watched it on lockdown but when I scored I actually did watch it a few times,"" she said. She has also been doing different things away from football ""which really helps"". Danny Egan leaving hospital after being treated for coronavirus A pensioner and an NHS nurse have become the first two ventilated patients to leave a hospital in Wales after having coronavirus. Danny Egan, 73, and charge nurse David Courtney-Williams, 48, were both applauded by staff as they were discharged from Swansea's Morriston Hospital. Both men were ""extremely unwell"" when they were put on ventilators in intensive care. On Tuesday, Mr Courtney-Williams, a nurse at Swansea's Singleton Hospital, gave a thumbs-up as he was clapped. Within an hour, retired service engineer Mr Egan, from Port Talbot, was also applauded following his recovery He told staff the first thing he would do was kiss his wife. Mr Egan had no memory of falling ill. He said: ""We went out, my son's birthday, and the next thing I was waking up in a ward. ""I didn't have any socks on and people were trying to tell me to move my feet, and I thought, 'How can I move my feet? Where am I?'"" Nurse David Courtney-Williams was cheered after his recovery Many businesses may decide not to reopen after lockdown restrictions are lifted, a Welsh MP has warned. Stephen Crabb MP, who chairs the Welsh Affairs committee, said many had already been struggling to survive before having to close due to the social-distancing measures. He told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""They may just make the decision that it's better shutting up shop altogether."" Debenhams has warned its major stores across Wales may never reopen, unless the Welsh Government reverses a decision on business rates relief. In England all retail, leisure and hospitality firms have been granted a business rates holiday, but in Wales this does not include stores with a rateable value of over Â£500,000. The committee has launched an inquiry into the economic consequences of the pandemic and how to revive the nation's fortunes. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP said many areas of Wales such as those relying on farming and tourism were ""vulnerable at the best of times"" and were now ""very, very vulnerable"". A nursing home has seen the ""catastrophic"" death of 15 residents in a month, its manager has said. Fourteen of the elderly residents at Tregwilym Lodge in Rogerstone, Newport, had symptoms of Covid-19, but none of them were tested. General manager Karen Healey said one or two residents would be expected to die in a normal month. The Welsh Government said its policy was now to test all care home residents with coronavirus symptoms. This video can not be played Coronavirus: We've lost so many so quickly, says nursing home manager There are âtentative signs of progress"" in the fight against coronavirus, due to the public adhering to social distancing measures, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. During the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps announced a new package of measures for transport - including freight services, to bring in crucial goods, such as medicines. The transport support unit is being launched by the UK government, which will use 9,000 vehicles to help deliver services during the pandemic, such as distributing packages to vulnerable people. Mr Shapps said there would also be a review looking to see if drones could be used to deliver medical supplies. As transport is devolved in Wales, it would appear the measures only apply in England, with the UK government saying the support announced today was being funded from existing Department for Transport budgets. Reality Check The UK government has said there are five tests the UK must meet before lockdown restrictions can be eased. They include making sure the NHS can cope, and ensuring there is enough testing and personal protective equipment available to meet future demand. So, how close is the UK to meeting those tests? Our explainer sets out how far weâve come: Read more:Are the five tests being met? This video can not be played Actor Richard Mylan has told BBC Radio 5 Live why he and his autistic son, Jaco, are continuing their important daily visits to Cardiff Market, despite being in lockdown. Theyâve previously visited the market hundreds of times as it closes up for the night â now itâs closed indefinitely but itâs still a key feature of their daily walks. People with autism, like 14-year-old Jaco, will now be able to go out more than once a day for exercise under an easing of restrictions by the Welsh Government. Speaking to Rachel Burden, Richard Mylan, who appeared in BBC drama Waterloo Road, said âautistic people can deal with change, as long as itâs gradual and itâs explainedâ. This video can not be played Farmers have overcome lockdown to hold markets again - thanks to internet technology. Stallholders in Haverfordwest, Aberystwyth and Aberaeron have joined forces to launch a click-and-collect service. About 25 food producers have signed up to an online hub where customers can order. It was set up by Alastair Vince, owner of Blaencamel Farm, in Cilcennin, near Lampeter. They supply fruit and vegetables across Wales and were left with no way to sell their produce when lockdown came into force. ""It's taken off really quickly - we've had 68 orders today across 15 producers in Pembrokeshire, and it looks set to continue while we're in lockdown,"" Mr Vince said. More traffic has been seen on UK roads in recent days, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said. During the Downing Street daily briefing, Dr Harries said the data shows a very slight increase in transport use compared to last week. It also shows use of other modes of transport remains down by more than 95% when compared with February. Championship sides Cardiff City and Swansea City have agreed partial wage deferrals with their players. Swansea's first team squad have agreed to take ""a 20% conditional wage deferral for the next three months"". Chairman Trevor Birch, sporting director Leon Britton and manager Steve Cooper had already agreed deferrals. The Bluebirds' deferral with players is also for three months while manager Neil Harris and chief executive Ken Choo had already accepted wage cuts. The moves come with football in the UK suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. A doctor says the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted the need for investment in intensive care in Wales.

The recording of deaths of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus is to be investigated after a Welsh health board failed to report numbers. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was important that ""accurate information"" was reported by health boards so people could ""have confidence"" in what was being published. Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which is responsible for the care of people in north Wales, reported 84 deaths over the course of a month for the first time today citing issues with its reporting system. Public Health Wales (PHW) explained this was the reason for the biggest single daily jump in confirmed deaths of people with coronavirus - 110 - taking the total to 751. Mr Drakeford said: ""The additional deaths reported by Betsi Cadwaladr don't change the overall picture, but I have asked for an assurance this afternoon that this is being thoroughly checked, that the whole system is being investigated, so that we can say confidently on Monday that the figures we are reporting through Public Health Wales genuinely represent an accurate picture in every part of Wales"". PHW has repeatedly warned that the number of deaths could be higher than the figures show, as they only include those who died in hospitals, and some care homes, and whose tests were analysed in a lab.

"The books were put on the shelves in order of size rather than alphabetical or by genre A well-meaning cleaner who took the opportunity to give a locked-down library a thorough clean re-shelved all of its books - in size order. Staff at Newmarket Library, Suffolk, discovered the sloping tomes after the building underwent a deep clean. James Powell, of Suffolk Libraries, said staff ""saw the funny side"" but it would take a ""bit of time"" to correct. ""It looks like libraries will be closed for a while so we'll have plenty of time to sort the books out"", he said. ""The cleaner is lovely and does a great job in the library. It was an honest mistake and just one of those things so we would never want her to feel bad about it,"" he added. Coronavirus: East of England live updates Libraries see surge in e-book borrowing Libraries and museums shut amid coronavirus spread A tweet by Krystal Vittles, head of service delivery at Suffolk Libraries, about the enthusiastic cleaner has been shared more than 5,000 times. In response, one person said it had ""brought laughter"" during lockdown. ""I think people are just pleased to be able to share any light-hearted stories at the moment as it helps to cheer everyone up,"" Mr Powell said. Allow Twitter content?

"Messenger Rooms will let up to 50 people drop in to a call Facebook has added a wave of new video-calling features to WhatsApp, Messenger and its main app, following increased demand for social video calling. New Messenger Rooms will let people start group video chats that can be joined by up to 50 people. The company told the BBC it released the features earlier than planned due to the coronavirus lockdown. Facebook said it had worked with cryptographers to prevent unwanted guests from dropping into chats. While the new features will launch for some users in the UK on Friday, it will take several weeks for the update to reach all Facebook members. Allow Twitter content?

Video-calling services have seen a sharp rise in use during the coronavirus pandemic.  Facebook said video-calling on Messenger had doubled since last year, in areas most affected by coronavirus. Rival app Zoom saw daily active users grow to 300 million in April. And Houseparty, owned by Fortnite-maker Epic Games, was downloaded more than two million times at the beginning of March, as the first major US cities issued stay-at-home orders. Some apps, such as Microsoft Teams, have offered premium features for free during the pandemic. Facebook's new Messenger Rooms feature was introduced in a blog post by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, a move usually reserved for its biggest product launches. Like Houseparty, Messenger Rooms will let people drop in and out of group video chats while the ""room"" is open. John Hegeman, vice president of news feed for Facebook, said the company wanted to recreate the ""serendipity"" that happens in the physical world, something he claimed video-conferencing competitors did not do. ""In the physical world, you have the ability to bump into people... so, we're hopeful that some of that serendipity will be able to occur in this product,"" Mr Hegeman said. People can ""drop in"" to Rooms, like on rival app Houseparty Rooms can be created via Facebook or Messenger, and the company said it planned to add the feature to Instagram, WhatsApp, and its Portal video-calling devices ""soon"". People creating a Messenger Room will be able to keep their room private, block unwanted participants and send invitations to people who are not on Facebook. Participants will be able to use augmented reality filters and change their background in real-time. Publicly discoverable rooms will be listed at the top of the Facebook news feed. The service was tested in Argentina and Poland, where Facebook Messenger is heavily used. During testing, rooms could support 17 to 20 participants at a time, but Facebook said that number would grow to 50 over the coming weeks. Facebook acknowledged that it had learned from competitors when developing its product. Zoom has been working to prevent ""zoombombing"", which is when uninvited guests drop into video calls. Often they shout abuse or share pornography. Stephane Taine, director of product for Messenger, said avoiding this issue was ""top of mind"" for Facebook. The company worked with cryptographers to make the links for the Messenger Rooms difficult for hackers to guess. At launch, the chats will not be end-to-end encrypted. Mr Taine said he hoped to add end-to-end encryption in the future. Facebook stressed it would not listen to or monitor video calls on its platforms. However, the social media giant will still gather data on when users open a Messenger Room. The company said that data would be used to improve the product and the overall Facebook experience. Other features announced today include: the ability to add eight people to a WhatsApp video call - up from four the return of ""Live With"", which lets users host Facebook Live streams with another person, to bring guests or performers on to their show the ability to watch Instagram Live videos on desktop computers Step-by-step guide: How to video call your family 'Zoombombing' targeted with new version of app Facebook asks UK users about Covid-19 symptoms Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' wants to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Mr Trump made the comments at a government briefing on Thursday A leading disinfectant producer has issued a strong warning not to use its products on the human body after Donald Trump suggested they could potentially be used to treat coronavirus. Reckitt Benckiser said ""under no circumstance"" should its products be injected or ingested. On Friday, Mr Trump said his comments during Thursday's coronavirus taskforce briefing had been made ""sarcastically"". Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested. Even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Mr Trump's comments have been heavily criticised by doctors and have generated a huge online response. They have provoked hundreds of thousands of comments and caused well-known cleaning brands to trend on social media. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns brands including Lysol, Dettol, Vanish and Cillit Bang, said its products should not be administered ""through injection, ingestion or any other route"". ""Our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information,""the company said in a statement,external. During Thursday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, an official presented the results of US government research that indicated coronavirus appeared to weaken faster when exposed to sunlight and heat. The study also showed bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids within five minutes, and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly. Mr Trump then hypothesised about the possibility of using a ""tremendous ultraviolet"" or ""just very powerful light"" on or even inside the body as a potential treatment. Trump's claims fact-checked The fake health advice you should ignore Will coronavirus go away in the summer? ""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute,"" he said. ""And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? ""Because you see it gets in the lungs and does a tremendous number on them, so it'd be interesting to check that,"" he said. This video can not be played Doctors dismantle Trump's treatment comments In a statement on Friday morning, the White House press secretary said the president had ""repeatedly"" told Americans to consult doctors about coronavirus treatment. ""Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines,"" Kayleigh McEnany said. However, the White House statement did not make any reference to the comments being sarcasm. On Friday afternoon, Mr Trump told journalists: ""I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen."" The president's comments have dominated social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit since Thursday night. Many compared his idea to a dangerous viral trend in 2018 where people ate Tide laundry detergent pods. The Maryland governor's office said the state's emergency management agency issued an alert warning against injecting or ingesting disinfectants after receiving more than 100 calls to a hotline.

Lysol, which is one of the America's best known cleaning brands, has been named in tweets at least 125,000 times since the White House news conference. Owners Reckitt Benckiser said they issued their statement on Friday ""due to recent speculation and social media activity"". Doctors warned that the president's suggestion could have fatal results. ""These products have corrosive properties that melt or destroy the lining of our innards,"" McGill University thoracic surgeon Dr Jonathan Spicer told the BBC. He said suggesting ingestion of a household cleaning product was ""extremely dangerous"". ""No one should be undergoing any preventative measures, as suggested by the president, without some kind of guidance from a licensed physician with the expertise in managing Covid-19,"" Dr Spicer added. Meanwhile, Dr Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, told the BBC Mr Trump's suggestions of using ultraviolet (UV) light were ""not practical"". ""UV doesn't really penetrate very far,"" she said. ""So even if you were to put it inside or outside, it's not going to even get to the lung... we just get a suntan or sunburn, and it causes DNA damage."" Dr Farber also said any radiation that would penetrate deeply enough "" would cause so much damage that you're better off with coronavirus"". Mr Trump directed his seemingly off-the-cuff suggestions to Dr Deborah Birx, his coronavirus response co-ordinator This is not the first time that Mr Trump's medical advice has generated controversy and criticism. He has previously hyped a malaria medication, hydroxychloroquin, despite a lack of clinical evidence it helps treat Covid-19 and some concerns it can even be detrimental. Analysis by Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter Using a disinfectant can kill viruses on surfaces. It's a very good idea to keep clean the things you touch, using products with anti-microbial properties - for example, substances with a high alcohol content. There is also some evidence that, in general, viruses on surfaces die more quickly when directly exposed to sunlight. But we don't know how much or how long they have to be exposed for UV light to have an effect, so you're far safer just washing your hands and surfaces and trying not to touch your face. Crucially, this is only about infected objects and surfaces - not about what happens once the virus is inside your body. One of the main ways of catching the virus is by breathing in droplets expelled by an infected person, mainly by sneezing and coughing. The virus very quickly begins to multiply and spread, eventually reaching the lungs. Not only does consuming or injecting disinfectant risk poisoning and death, it's not even likely to be effective. Equally, by the time the virus has taken hold inside your body, no amount of UV light on your skin is going to make a difference. And since UV radiation damages the skin, using it to kill the virus could be a case of - to borrow a well-worn phrase - the cure being worse than the disease. Earlier this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to be careful with cleaning products as sales of household disinfectants soar amid the pandemic. ""Calls to poison centres increased sharply at the beginning of March 2020 for exposures to both cleaners and disinfectants,"" theagency's weekly morbidity and mortality report found,external. The US Food and Drug Administration has also warned against ingesting disinfectants,external, citing the sale of bogus miracle cures that contain bleach and purport to treat everything from autism to Aids and hepatitis. Last week, a federal judge secured a temporary injunction against one organisation, known as the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, for marketing one of these products as a potential coronavirus cure.

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says Britain has âfailed to engage substantiallyâ in trade talks with the EU The progress made in post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and EU has been disappointing, Michel Barnier has said. The EU's chief negotiator said ""genuine progress"" and a decision on whether to extend the transition period were both needed by June. The UK said ""limited progress"" had been made and talks needed to ""move forward in a constructive fashion"". The two sides will hold two further rounds of talks before the end of the transition period in December. Mr Barnier said a joint decision would be taken on 30 June about whether to extend the transition period. But the UK government has already said it will refuse to extend it beyond December, even if the EU requested a delay. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? UK-EU trade talks will be tricky from the outset Brexit: A really simple guide Following the talks - which took place using video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic - Mr Barnier said: ""The UK has affirmed once again this week its wish to make tangible progress between now and June and we're on the same wavelength on this and we respect the same timetable. ""That means that we need genuine progress by June if, at the end of this year, we want to strike an agreement which is commensurate to the level of our economic interdependence and geographical proximity."" But he said there were four areas where progress was ""disappointing"", including the level playing field (what kind of access the UK could have to the European single market after Brexit), justice and fisheries. And he warned that the ""clock was ticking"". You can pretty much discard the warm, fluffy comments from EU and UK negotiators that good progress is at least being made on core free trade agreement issues. Why? That was always going to be the easy part. Fishing, competition rules, the form of an eventual deal and what kind of mechanism would be used for disputes between the two sides. Those have been the screaming areas of disagreement between EU and UK negotiators from the start. And if they can't be resolved, the EU insists there will be no trade deal at all. It's quite clear from briefings with EU and UK officials that the two further rounds of talks planned for May and June won't be enough. Those are technical negotiations. You need political engagement to find compromise. But the coronavirus crisis means Downing Street and EU leaders already have their plate pretty full. And if the government doesn't budge from its refusal to extend the transition period to continue negotiations past the end of this year, then as the EU's chief negotiator is so fond of saying: ""The clock is ticking"". Really. Mr Barnier said the UK negotiating team keeps repeating that they are negotiating as ""sovereign equals"", but the ""reality"" was that an agreement was being sought between a massive bloc and a smaller nation. On fisheries, Mr Barnier said the EU would not agree to a deal without a ""balanced, sustainable and long-term agreement"", describing it as an ""inseparable part of the trade agreement, along with the level-playing field"". What is a level playing field? But he said ""no progress"" had been made on fisheries, as the UK has ""not put forward a legal text"". ""The UK did not wish to commit seriously on a number of fundamental points,"" he said. Mr Barnier said the two sides ""need to find solutions on the most difficult topics"". ""The UK cannot refuse to extend transition and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas,"" he added. Mr Barnier reiterated that the UK would have to pay a ""lump-sum"" contribution to the EU budget if the transition period is extended beyond 31 December. And he said any deal agreed by December would have to be ""smart"" to ""cushion the blow"" of Brexit and coronavirus. A UK spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise the suggestion that we have not engaged seriously with the EU in any area. ""We have just had a negotiating round lasting most of a week, including two full days talking about fisheries and three full days discussing so-called level-playing-field issues."" The spokesperson said they were ""ready to keep talking"" but some of the EU's proposals were ""unprecedented"" and did not account for the UK as ""an independent state"". In a statement, the UK government said it had been a ""full and constructive negotiating round"". ""However, limited progress was made in bridging the gaps between us and the EU,"" it said. ""Our assessment is that there was some promising convergence in the core areas of a free trade agreement, for example on goods and services trade, and related issues such as energy, transport, and civil nuclear cooperation."" But it said that the EU's offer on goods trade ""falls well short of recent precedent in FTAs (free trade agreements) it has agreed with other sovereign countries"". ""This considerably reduces the practical value of the zero tariff zero quota aspiration we both share,"" the statement said. The UK government also highlighted ""significant differences of principle"" in areas including the level playing field and fisheries. It said talks needed to ""move forward in a constructive fashion"" and the UK ""remains committed to a deal with a free trade agreement at its core"".

"Debenhams has stores in several locations in Wales including Cardiff Debenhams has warned the Welsh finance minister it will be forced to shut its major shops in Wales unless the government reverses a decision on business rates relief. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has granted a rates holiday to all retail, leisure and hospitality firms for a year. Wales initially said it would match these plans but then changed the threshold for those eligible. It said the change means business rates will be used for grants to small firms. In a letter seen by the BBC, Debenhams' chairman writes that the move threatens the viability of its biggest stores in Wales in Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, Wrexham and Llandudno. Wales decided not to extend relief to properties with a rateable value of Â£500,000 and above. Debenhams' chairman Mark Gifford tells Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans: ""It is deeply regrettable that, by electing to take a different approach to that taken elsewhere in the UK, you have made it economically unviable for us to continue trading the majority of our Welsh business. ""You have failed to understand the situation, where Debenhams Retail Limited is in administration and will cease to pay business rates unless it chooses to reopen its stores in Wales. ""It will be unable to reopen its stores unless you reverse your decision."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We decided to limit the Non-Domestic Rates (NDR) Relief for the hospitality, retail and leisure sector announced to exclude the small proportion of properties with a rateable value of over Â£500,000. ""This affects fewer than 200 properties across Wales but releases more than Â£100 million towards our Economic Resilience Fund - enough to support more than 2,000 businesses with grants of Â£50,000. According to real estate services firm Altus Group, Debenhams has business rates liabilities in Wales of Â£2.35m for the current financial year. The biggest bill is for its Cardiff store at more than Â£1.1m. Meanwhile, it has emerged that four more Debenhams stores will not reopen post-lockdown, after the business failed to agree deals with landlords. The shops are in Southampton, Swindon, Kidderminster and Borehamwood. They are in addition to seven outlets Debenhams already said will remain closed.

"Greater Manchester's mayor had said Metrolink could be ""mothballed"" The government has confirmed it will support England's light rail systems to ""allow essential services to continue"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was working with networks in Greater Manchester, Sheffield, the West Midlands, Nottingham and Tyne and Wear. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham had warned his area's servicecould be ""mothballed"" due to financial losses. The DfT said it was working ""to identify what support is needed"". A spokesman said the amount of government funding was still being calculated, but it would ""enable key routes to remain open for people travelling to hospitals, supermarkets or those who cannot work from home, such as NHS staff"". He added that as light rail was a devolved issue in London, Transport for London would need to ""consider any measures to support the sector"", while Blackpool's tram network, which was taken out of service at the end of March, ""does not support key workers"". On Tuesday, Mr Burnham said Greater Manchester's Metrolink service was ""losing millions of pounds a month"", with passenger numbers down 95% since the outbreak began. Responding to the announcement, he said he was ""pleased this has been recognised by the government and welcome their commitment to... light rail networks around the country"". The funding will support five networks, including Sheffield's Supertram ""However, we urgently need the detail of this funding, as well as the funding itself, so we can ensure these vital services can continue to run during the lockdown period,"" he added. Mr Burnham said he was already ""looking closely at what services will look like once lockdown is lifted,"" adding: ""The road to recovery is going to be a very long one, and we are already stressing to government the financial help that will be needed throughout 2020 and beyond."" A spokesman for Nexus, which runs the Metro service in Tyne and Wear, echoed Mr Burnham's comments and said the firm ""now need to know with some urgency what the details of the financial package are"". He said running the system was ""costing us almost Â£1m a week"" and the firm could only plan for the end of lockdown ""if we know that we have enough money to pay staff wages and carry out maintenance"".

"Key workers trying to book tests were met with this message from the middle of Friday morning The new website for key workers to book coronavirus tests has temporarily closed - hours after being opened by the government. The Department of Health said it was working to ""rapidly increase"" availability, withmore tests due to become available on Saturday.,external Downing Street said 5,000 home testing kits were ordered in the first two minutes of the website going live. About 15,000 tests were booked to take place on Friday at drive-through sites. No 10 said the total amount of home testing kits available on Friday were ordered, adding it hoped to have 18,000 kits available each day for key workers by the ""end of next week"". The website would be back up and running when the next batch of slots become available, the spokesman added. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? First patients injected in UK vaccine trial Trying to get a coronavirus test? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The expanded testing scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday allowsall essential workers,externalin England to register for tests on thegovernment's website,external, if they or a family member have virus symptoms. Up to 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for testing, with the aim of allowing essential staff to safely return to work. Previously, a smaller group of key workers - those whose work is deemed critical to the Covid-19 response - were eligible for testing. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid the new system would also apply there ""very soon"", while Wales and Northern Ireland have both announcedseparate plans to expand testing. Downing Street said the government is trusting that those applying for testing are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. The website opened on Friday but appeared to close by mid-morning with some users met by an ""applications closed"" message. The Department of Health apologised for ""any inconvenience"" caused by the temporary closure of applications. The government remains some way short of its target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day in the UK by the end of this month. Friday's figures showed 28,532 tests were carried out, though Mr Hancock said on Thursday that capacity has reached more than 50,000 a day. The latest data also showed a further 684 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 19,506. In Wales the total number of people confirmed to have died with coronavirus reached 751, an increase of more than 100 for the first time. However, Public Health Wales saidthe 110 deaths reported on Fridayincluded 84 that had been added retrospectively ""due to a delay in the reporting process"". Secondary school teacher Mike Eyre, from Boston in Lincolnshire, was one of the first people to apply for a test but told the BBC he was still waiting for confirmation about where to go 11 hours later. ""It was very easy to log on and register,"" he said. ""It just said that you would then receive a text, which would take a few minutes but it might take a little bit longer if it's busy. ""I've still not had a text yet, so I'm assuming they're very busy."" Liz Christie, an education adviser from Slough in Berkshire, applied at about 06:45 BST and heard back at about midday on Friday. She will make the 30-mile round-trip to a drive-in centre in Wembley, north London, later. She told BBC News that she ""didn't expect it to be completely smooth"" on the first day, and said she was ""pleased that in less than 48 hours I'll have been tested and know if I'm positive or not"". ""We've been able to work from home but they've asked if I can go in next week, so it would be useful to know,"" she said. ""My children are both asthmatic - and getting a test would also mean I could then go and help my mum, who has almost no immune system and is getting no help in the house."" John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, described the announcement as ""long overdue and very welcome"". He added that testing would enable self-isolating officers ""to get back onto the front line to assist their colleagues if the test comes back as negative"". Also among those to qualify for tests are staff at supermarkets, where absences due to coronavirus have been a big issue. Tesco currently has more than 41,000 staff members off work. The British Retail Consortium said the testing of such workers was ""crucial"" to ""maintain good supplies to stores"". Transport for London (TfL) - where a third of employees have been ill or have had to self-isolate since the start of the pandemic - said that while testing would not be mandatory, it was ""encouraging the take-up of testing by all eligible members of staff"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock said the expanding testing scheme was ""part of getting Britain back on her feet"". Mr Hancock said once people entered their details online they would be sent a text or email inviting them to either book an appointment at a drive-through centre or to request a home test kit, though the latter are currently in limited supply. He told BBC Breakfast the home kits would be collected by courier and would initially start in ""small numbers"" before the service grows. A help desk has been established to aid the process, while mobile units run by the Army are travelling around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes. Anyone classified as an""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours. Mr Hancock has said the ""majority"" of people will get their result in 24 hours, but for some it might take a bit longer. The result will be added to a person's medical record so their doctor is informed, he added. Key workers who are unable to access the government's website will still be able to apply for a test, as employers are able to book on behalf of their staff. Until now, hospitals have been carrying out tests, along with a network of about 30 drive-through centres in car parks, airports and sports grounds. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers should have been prepared for the surge in demand for coronavirus tests. There is no doubting the scale and ambition of this project - up to 10 million essential workers and their families invited to go online if they have symptoms to book a virus test. Ensuring the system can smoothly book people their tests at drive in centres and then get results back within 48 hours will be a major technological challenge. Some may complain that the drive-in centres are not accessible but the plan will soon involve home testing kits being sent to people to do their own swabs and send them back for laboratory testing. The home testing kits are currently going out to NHS workers. Then government says this will be extended very soon to the wider group. Mobile pop-up test facilities will go to workplaces. In theory this will make a big difference to key workers self-isolating because a member of their household is unwell - if that individual tests negative then others in the home can get back to work quickly. Or if someone is unsure about their symptoms they can easily check whether they have coronavirus. This is a significant move in the drive to boost testing. The question now is whether the IT and the infrastructure can deliver. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Speaking at Friday's daily briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted the site closed after ""the slots for today were taken up"". It came back online on Friday evening, allowing key workers to apply for tests at drive-through centres, before being suspended again. More slots were available on Saturday morning. However, home testing kits were no longer available after less than 15 minutes of the site being reopened. Some 16,000 bookings were made on the website on Friday. The site had toclose to new applicants within hours of launching, after 46,000 people tried to access it, but Mr Shapps said it had not crashed and that further tests would become available. He also stressed the test was only suitable to test if you think you currently have coronavirus, not if you have previously had it. No 10 has said appointments for tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits will become available from 08:00 BST each day, with their release staggered throughout the day. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Mr Shapps said ministers were ""encouraged"" by the initial demand for tests, and suggested that the government was on track to meet its target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. ""It looks like the trajectory to 100,000 tests by the end of April is going to be met in terms of capacity,"" he said. ""I would say, after today, the demand is there, so if those two things come together we will have it being met."" He added that getting ""somewhere near"" the 100,000 tests a day target would be an achievement by international standards. Earlier, the prime minister's spokesman said 5,000 home testing kits had been ordered ""within two minutes"" of the website opening on Friday.

""I don't want to infect the children and families I'm working with, plus my own family,"" she told BBC News. Speaking after her test at a drive-through centre in Wembley, north-west London, Ms Christie said the process was ""brilliant"" but added that there were not many other people getting tested at the same time. ""It looks like there's five stations set up,"" she said. ""All the stations were empty except mine, there were two cars in front of me and no-one behind me. ""They've got the infrastructure in place, they just need the people now."" Also speaking at the daily press briefing, the government's deputy chief medical adviser, Dr Jenny Harries, said the increased testing would mean there would be a less positive picture on the number of Covid -19 cases. She stressed that the test on offer to key workers was the ""have you got it now?"" test, and said it would be a ""wasted test"" if it was used by people who did not have symptoms, or people in their households. Friday's figures showed 28,532 tests were carried out, though the government says that capacity has reached more than 50,000 a day. The latest data also showed a further 684 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 19,506. Also at the briefing, Mr Shapps announced the government would subsidise key supply routes to ensure that essential medical supplies and food can be transported during the pandemic. With large sections of the economy frozen, volumes of freight coming in and out of Britain are significantly down. Up to Â£17m has been made available for supply routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and up to Â£10.5m for ferry and freight services to the Isle of Wight and Scilly Isles. Further support is available for critical routes between Britain and the European mainland, including Eurotunnel, Mr Shapps said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says Britain has âfailed to engage substantiallyâ in trade talks with the EU The progress made in post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and EU has been disappointing, Michel Barnier has said. The EU's chief negotiator said ""genuine progress"" and a decision on whether to extend the transition period were both needed by June. The UK said ""limited progress"" had been made and talks needed to ""move forward in a constructive fashion"". The two sides will hold two further rounds of talks before the end of the transition period in December. Mr Barnier said a joint decision would be taken on 30 June about whether to extend the transition period. But the UK government has already said it will refuse to extend it beyond December, even if the EU requested a delay. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? UK-EU trade talks will be tricky from the outset Brexit: A really simple guide Following the talks - which took place using video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic - Mr Barnier said: ""The UK has affirmed once again this week its wish to make tangible progress between now and June and we're on the same wavelength on this and we respect the same timetable. ""That means that we need genuine progress by June if, at the end of this year, we want to strike an agreement which is commensurate to the level of our economic interdependence and geographical proximity."" But he said there were four areas where progress was ""disappointing"", including the level playing field (what kind of access the UK could have to the European single market after Brexit), justice and fisheries. And he warned that the ""clock was ticking"". You can pretty much discard the warm, fluffy comments from EU and UK negotiators that good progress is at least being made on core free trade agreement issues. Why? That was always going to be the easy part. Fishing, competition rules, the form of an eventual deal and what kind of mechanism would be used for disputes between the two sides. Those have been the screaming areas of disagreement between EU and UK negotiators from the start. And if they can't be resolved, the EU insists there will be no trade deal at all. It's quite clear from briefings with EU and UK officials that the two further rounds of talks planned for May and June won't be enough. Those are technical negotiations. You need political engagement to find compromise. But the coronavirus crisis means Downing Street and EU leaders already have their plate pretty full. And if the government doesn't budge from its refusal to extend the transition period to continue negotiations past the end of this year, then as the EU's chief negotiator is so fond of saying: ""The clock is ticking"". Really. Mr Barnier said the UK negotiating team keeps repeating that they are negotiating as ""sovereign equals"", but the ""reality"" was that an agreement was being sought between a massive bloc and a smaller nation. On fisheries, Mr Barnier said the EU would not agree to a deal without a ""balanced, sustainable and long-term agreement"", describing it as an ""inseparable part of the trade agreement, along with the level-playing field"". What is a level playing field? But he said ""no progress"" had been made on fisheries, as the UK has ""not put forward a legal text"". ""The UK did not wish to commit seriously on a number of fundamental points,"" he said. Mr Barnier said the two sides ""need to find solutions on the most difficult topics"". ""The UK cannot refuse to extend transition and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas,"" he added. Mr Barnier reiterated that the UK would have to pay a ""lump-sum"" contribution to the EU budget if the transition period is extended beyond 31 December. And he said any deal agreed by December would have to be ""smart"" to ""cushion the blow"" of Brexit and coronavirus. A UK spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise the suggestion that we have not engaged seriously with the EU in any area. ""We have just had a negotiating round lasting most of a week, including two full days talking about fisheries and three full days discussing so-called level-playing-field issues."" The spokesperson said they were ""ready to keep talking"" but some of the EU's proposals were ""unprecedented"" and did not account for the UK as ""an independent state"". In a statement, the UK government said it had been a ""full and constructive negotiating round"". ""However, limited progress was made in bridging the gaps between us and the EU,"" it said. ""Our assessment is that there was some promising convergence in the core areas of a free trade agreement, for example on goods and services trade, and related issues such as energy, transport, and civil nuclear cooperation."" But it said that the EU's offer on goods trade ""falls well short of recent precedent in FTAs (free trade agreements) it has agreed with other sovereign countries"". ""This considerably reduces the practical value of the zero tariff zero quota aspiration we both share,"" the statement said. The UK government also highlighted ""significant differences of principle"" in areas including the level playing field and fisheries. It said talks needed to ""move forward in a constructive fashion"" and the UK ""remains committed to a deal with a free trade agreement at its core"".

"This video can not be played Mr Trump made the comments at a government briefing on Thursday A leading disinfectant producer has issued a strong warning not to use its products on the human body after Donald Trump suggested they could potentially be used to treat coronavirus. Reckitt Benckiser said ""under no circumstance"" should its products be injected or ingested. On Friday, Mr Trump said his comments during Thursday's coronavirus taskforce briefing had been made ""sarcastically"". Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested. Even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Mr Trump's comments have been heavily criticised by doctors and have generated a huge online response. They have provoked hundreds of thousands of comments and caused well-known cleaning brands to trend on social media. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns brands including Lysol, Dettol, Vanish and Cillit Bang, said its products should not be administered ""through injection, ingestion or any other route"". ""Our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information,""the company said in a statement,external. During Thursday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, an official presented the results of US government research that indicated coronavirus appeared to weaken faster when exposed to sunlight and heat. The study also showed bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids within five minutes, and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly. Mr Trump then hypothesised about the possibility of using a ""tremendous ultraviolet"" or ""just very powerful light"" on or even inside the body as a potential treatment. Trump's claims fact-checked The fake health advice you should ignore Will coronavirus go away in the summer? ""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute,"" he said. ""And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? ""Because you see it gets in the lungs and does a tremendous number on them, so it'd be interesting to check that,"" he said. This video can not be played Doctors dismantle Trump's treatment comments In a statement on Friday morning, the White House press secretary said the president had ""repeatedly"" told Americans to consult doctors about coronavirus treatment. ""Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines,"" Kayleigh McEnany said. However, the White House statement did not make any reference to the comments being sarcasm. On Friday afternoon, Mr Trump told journalists: ""I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen."" The president's comments have dominated social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit since Thursday night. Many compared his idea to a dangerous viral trend in 2018 where people ate Tide laundry detergent pods. The Maryland governor's office said the state's emergency management agency issued an alert warning against injecting or ingesting disinfectants after receiving more than 100 calls to a hotline.

Lysol, which is one of the America's best known cleaning brands, has been named in tweets at least 125,000 times since the White House news conference. Owners Reckitt Benckiser said they issued their statement on Friday ""due to recent speculation and social media activity"". Doctors warned that the president's suggestion could have fatal results. ""These products have corrosive properties that melt or destroy the lining of our innards,"" McGill University thoracic surgeon Dr Jonathan Spicer told the BBC. He said suggesting ingestion of a household cleaning product was ""extremely dangerous"". ""No one should be undergoing any preventative measures, as suggested by the president, without some kind of guidance from a licensed physician with the expertise in managing Covid-19,"" Dr Spicer added. Meanwhile, Dr Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, told the BBC Mr Trump's suggestions of using ultraviolet (UV) light were ""not practical"". ""UV doesn't really penetrate very far,"" she said. ""So even if you were to put it inside or outside, it's not going to even get to the lung... we just get a suntan or sunburn, and it causes DNA damage."" Dr Farber also said any radiation that would penetrate deeply enough "" would cause so much damage that you're better off with coronavirus"". Mr Trump directed his seemingly off-the-cuff suggestions to Dr Deborah Birx, his coronavirus response co-ordinator This is not the first time that Mr Trump's medical advice has generated controversy and criticism. He has previously hyped a malaria medication, hydroxychloroquin, despite a lack of clinical evidence it helps treat Covid-19 and some concerns it can even be detrimental. Analysis by Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter Using a disinfectant can kill viruses on surfaces. It's a very good idea to keep clean the things you touch, using products with anti-microbial properties - for example, substances with a high alcohol content. There is also some evidence that, in general, viruses on surfaces die more quickly when directly exposed to sunlight. But we don't know how much or how long they have to be exposed for UV light to have an effect, so you're far safer just washing your hands and surfaces and trying not to touch your face. Crucially, this is only about infected objects and surfaces - not about what happens once the virus is inside your body. One of the main ways of catching the virus is by breathing in droplets expelled by an infected person, mainly by sneezing and coughing. The virus very quickly begins to multiply and spread, eventually reaching the lungs. Not only does consuming or injecting disinfectant risk poisoning and death, it's not even likely to be effective. Equally, by the time the virus has taken hold inside your body, no amount of UV light on your skin is going to make a difference. And since UV radiation damages the skin, using it to kill the virus could be a case of - to borrow a well-worn phrase - the cure being worse than the disease. Earlier this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to be careful with cleaning products as sales of household disinfectants soar amid the pandemic. ""Calls to poison centres increased sharply at the beginning of March 2020 for exposures to both cleaners and disinfectants,"" theagency's weekly morbidity and mortality report found,external. The US Food and Drug Administration has also warned against ingesting disinfectants,external, citing the sale of bogus miracle cures that contain bleach and purport to treat everything from autism to Aids and hepatitis. Last week, a federal judge secured a temporary injunction against one organisation, known as the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, for marketing one of these products as a potential coronavirus cure.

"This video can not be played Katy Davis (left) and her identical twin Emma always believed they would die together, according to their sister, Zoe Twin sisters have died within three days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus. Children's nurse Katy Davis, 37, died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday. Identical twin Emma, herself a former nurse, died at the same hospital early on Friday. Their sister, Zoe, said: ""They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well."" She said the ""amazing"" pair, who lived together, had other health conditions and had been unwell for some time. ""There are no words to describe how special they were,"" she said. The ""amazing"" twins had underlying health conditions, their sister said ""All they ever wanted to do was to help other people. Ever since they were young...they'd pretend they were doctors and nurses caring for their dolls. ""They gave their everything to all the patients they looked after. They were exceptional."" ""It doesn't feel like any of this is real."" Katy, who worked at Southampton Children's Hospital, tested positive for Covid-19 on admission to hospital and died on Tuesday evening. Paula Head, chief executive of University Hospital SouthamptonÂ NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Katy has been described by her colleagues... as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her. ""On behalf of everyone here... including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family."" The Royal College of Nursing said: ""She's been described as a dedicated and selfless nurse who had time for everyone sharing her skills and knowledge to ensure excellent patient care."" The sisters died within three days of each other at the same hospital, Zoe Davis said Emma Davis had worked at the same hospital as her sister in the colorectal surgery unit for nine years until 2013. In a message to staff, chief nursing officer Gail Byrne said: ""She had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19. ""It goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them. ""Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader. ""She was well-liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us.""

"Commuters have been urged not to travel on the Underground unless it is an essential journey Thousands of Transport for London (TfL) staff are to be furloughed amid ""massive financial challenges"". TfL's income has been badly affected during the pandemic, and about 7,000 employees will be put on thegovernment's furlough scheme. London's transport commissioner Mike Brown said fares, which are TfL's main revenue, had plunged by 90%. The Mayor of London warned transport ""will not immediately return to normal"" when lockdown measures are relaxed. Staff will initially be furloughed for three weeks from Monday and TfL said it ""will pay the remainder of salaries of all furloughed employees and continue to pay pension contributions, to ensure people are supported"". Currently a limited service across the capital is in place to allow ""essential travel"" for key workers. Bus passengers are no longer allowed to board using the front door and do not need to tap in with an Oyster card. Transport for London is set to place a quarter of its workforce on the government's furlough scheme Since London entered lockdown on 23 March, Tube journeys have fallen by 95% and bus journeys by 85%. Sadiq Khan said he wanted ""to be honest and upfront"" about the impact on public transport in the capital and its future. ""There will be no quick return to business as usual,"" he said. ""Covid-19 has caused massive financial challenges for TfL and every transport provider across the UK. ""As the only transport authority of any major city in western Europe which doesn't receive a grant for day-to-day operations, the challenge for TfL is very acute."" Coronavirus in London: Latest updates Mr Khan said TfL, which has 28,000 employees, would be in talks with the government and various trade unions about putting staff on to the furlough scheme. ""TfL is urgently working through how it can get Londoners to and from work while social distancing rules remain in place, as is widely expected to be the case,"" he added. Mr Brown said he ""hoped for an urgent agreement"" between TfL and the government. The Department for Transport previously said that ""regular discussions"" were taking place with London's mayor and transport authority about financial problems caused by the lockdown, and they ""will continue to do so"". By BBC London's Transport correspondent Tom Edwards Dozens of London Underground stations have been forced to close It has been called the most serious financial challenge ever faced by the capital's transport agency. Using just simple mathsTfL is in trouble - you can't run a transport agency without fare revenues.Now it has set out what it will do and it involves furloughing a quarter of its staff. Also interesting is how the future of London will look when the lockdown ends. If social distancing is in place buses and the Tube will only be able to carry a sixth of passengers. That means a huge campaign of ""travel management"" to get passengers to phase journeys and shift the rush hour -the like of which we haven't seen since the Olympics. But, big infrastructure projects also now hang in the balance. TfL's future is entirely dependent on a government bailout - which will have to be big. At present it costs Â£600m a month to run the system - or there will be cuts to services. LATEST:Live updates from around the world A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"These meals should have been served at 30,000 ft rather than across Greater Manchester More than a million airline meals are to be given away to disadvantaged people across Greater Manchester. A frozen food mountain had been growing at a storage site near Manchester Airport because of the collapse in air travel during the coronavirus outbreak. But 1.1m meals have now been saved by not-for-profit group Open Kitchen MCR. âItâs essential we find safe ways to get not just enough food, but good food to people who need it,â said the social enterprise's founder Corin Bell. Open Kitchen MCR, which normally intercepts food waste and turns it in to food for events, is now cooking and delivering up to 10,000 meals a week. âBefore the coronavirus hit, there were 400,000 people that were estimated to be in food poverty in Manchester alone,â said Mr Bell. âA lot of the usual routes to access food for people in poverty are not available now that Covid-19 has hit."" Those benefiting from Open Kitchenâs efforts include the street homeless, people temporarily housed in hotel accommodation, those in self-isolation with underlying health conditions, and people living below the poverty line.

"UK retail sales fell a record 5.1% in March as many stores shut up shop in the face of the coronavirus lockdown. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the steepest sales fall since it started collecting the data in 1996. Food and online shopping rose, and alcohol sales also jumped. But clothes sales tumbled by 34%. Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 22%, the ONS said. ""Retailers are in crisis mode as the impact of Covid-19 has obliterated sales to new record-lows,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. Off-licences, which were added to the government's list of essential UK retailers last month, saw sales rise 31.4% in volume terms, although with most drinkers buying from supermarkets, they only contribute less than 1% of alcohol sales. The data comes amid dire estimates for the performance of the UK economy amid the lockdown. Yesterday, one of the Bank of England's top policymakers warned that the UK faces its worst economic shock in several hundred years. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE's interest-rate setting committee, said that ""early indicators"" suggest the UK was ""experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries"". He did, though, say there was ""in principle"" a good chance that the UK would return to its ""pre-virus trajectory once the pandemic is over"". But for many shops, it is too late. In the year to date, Oasis, Warehouse, Debenhams, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston have collapsed, and while some shops will be salvaged, many will be gone for good. Excluding fuel, sales dropped 3.7% compared with February, a record for retail data collection going back to 1988. Food sales rose a record 11% as households stocked up and restaurants closed. For industries like retail, customer behaviour may never be the same. ""We don't expect the pattern of post-lockdown spending to be exactly the same as before, with our latest survey indicating that consumers intend to reward more responsible retailers,""said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at accountants PwC. ""Particularly those who looked after their staff, and shop more on their local high streets and with smaller or independent retailers, giving some more hope to many of the hardest-hit operators.""

"Laura McLellan says she has never felt so humbled as when she and her team of checkout operators were told they were key workers. The Tesco supermarket worker felt so proud that she wanted to go back in time to tell her school headmaster about the important job she was now doing during the coronavirus pandemic.

The 42-year-old said in the early stages, before the safety measures were put in place, some staff had asked to stack shelves rather than work on the checkouts.

"This video can not be played Top US doctor says heat and light are not a treatment for Covid-19 US President Donald Trump has been lambasted by the medical community after suggesting research into whether coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body. He also appeared to propose irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by a doctor at the briefing. Another of his officials had moments earlier said sunlight and disinfectant were known to kill the infection. Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested. Even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. During Thursday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, an official presented the results of US government research that indicated coronavirus appeared to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight and heat. The study also showed bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids within five minutes and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly. Bleach and sunshine were proposed as possible strategies to tackle the coronavirus William Bryan, acting head of the US Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, outlined the findings at the news conference. The fake health advice you should ignore Will coronavirus go away in the summer? Coronavirus: How bad information goes viral Coronavirus job losses and 'the millennial curse' While noting the research should be treated with caution, Mr Trump suggested further research in that area. ""So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous - whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light,"" the president said, turning to Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, ""and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you're going to test it. ""And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting,"" the president continued. This video can not be played Donald Trump criticised Georgiaâs governor for reopening ""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? ""So it'd be interesting to check that."" Pointing to his head, Mr Trump went on: ""I'm not a doctor. But I'm, like, a person that has a good you-know-what."" 'What I fear the most is not being able to survive' The new house rules of my life under lockdown Watch: False claims by politicians debunked He turned again to Dr Birx and asked if she had ever heard of using ""the heat and the light"" to treat coronavirus. ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx said. ""I mean, certainly, fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But I've not seen heat or light."" ""I think it's a great thing to look at,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played Across the United States, some people insist the lockdowns should be lifted and states reopened Analysis by Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter Using a disinfectant can kill viruses on surfaces. It's a very good idea to keep clean the things you touch, using products with anti-microbial properties - for example, substances with a high alcohol content. There is also some evidence that, in general, viruses on surfaces die more quickly when directly exposed to sunlight. But we don't know how much or how long they have to be exposed for UV light to have an effect, so you're far safer just washing your hands and surfaces and trying not to touch your face. Crucially, this is only about infected objects and surfaces - not about what happens once the virus is inside your body. One of the main ways of catching the virus is by breathing in droplets expelled by an infected person, mainly by sneezing and coughing. The virus very quickly begins to multiply and spread, eventually reaching the lungs. Not only does consuming or injecting disinfectant risk poisoning and death, it's not even likely to be effective. Equally, by the time the virus has taken hold inside your body, no amount of UV light on your skin is going to make a difference. And since UV radiation damages the skin, using it to kill the virus could be a case of -  to borrow a well-worn phrase - the cure being worse than the disease. Doctors warned the president's idea could have fatal results. Pulmonologist Dr Vin Guptatold NBC News,external: ""This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible and it's dangerous. ""It's a common method that people utilise when they want to kill themselves."" Kashif Mahmood, a doctor in Charleston, West Virginia,tweeted,external: ""As a physician, I can't recommend injecting disinfectant into the lungs or using UV radiation inside the body to treat Covid-19. ""Don't take medical advice from Trump."" John Balmes, a pulmonologist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, warned that even breathing fumes from bleach could cause severe health problems. He told Bloomberg News,external: ""Inhaling chlorine bleach would be absolutely the worst thing for the lungs. The airway and lungs are not made to be exposed to even an aerosol of disinfectant. ""Not even a low dilution of bleach or isopropyl alcohol is safe. It's a totally ridiculous concept."" Mr Trump has previously hyped a malaria medication, hydroxycloroquine, as a possible treatment for coronavirus, though he has stopped touting that drug recently. This week a study of coronavirus patients in a US government-run hospital for military veterans found more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than those treated with standard care. Reacting to the president's remarks on Thursday evening, Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger in November's White House election, tweeted: ""UV light? Injecting disinfectant? Here's an idea, Mr President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Mr Trump made the comments at a government briefing on Thursday A leading disinfectant producer has issued a strong warning not to use its products on the human body after Donald Trump suggested they could potentially be used to treat coronavirus. Reckitt Benckiser said ""under no circumstance"" should its products be injected or ingested. On Friday, Mr Trump said his comments during Thursday's coronavirus taskforce briefing had been made ""sarcastically"". Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested. Even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Mr Trump's comments have been heavily criticised by doctors and have generated a huge online response. They have provoked hundreds of thousands of comments and caused well-known cleaning brands to trend on social media. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns brands including Lysol, Dettol, Vanish and Cillit Bang, said its products should not be administered ""through injection, ingestion or any other route"". ""Our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information,""the company said in a statement,external. During Thursday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, an official presented the results of US government research that indicated coronavirus appeared to weaken faster when exposed to sunlight and heat. The study also showed bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids within five minutes, and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly.

This video can not be played Doctors dismantle Trump's treatment comments In a statement on Friday morning, the White House press secretary said the president had ""repeatedly"" told Americans to consult doctors about coronavirus treatment. ""Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines,"" Kayleigh McEnany said. However, the White House statement did not make any reference to the comments being sarcasm. On Friday afternoon, Mr Trump told journalists: ""I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen."" The president's comments have dominated social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit since Thursday night. Many compared his idea to a dangerous viral trend in 2018 where people ate Tide laundry detergent pods. The Maryland governor's office said the state's emergency management agency issued an alert warning against injecting or ingesting disinfectants after receiving more than 100 calls to a hotline.

""No one should be undergoing any preventative measures, as suggested by the president, without some kind of guidance from a licensed physician with the expertise in managing Covid-19,"" Dr Spicer added. Meanwhile, Dr Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, told the BBC Mr Trump's suggestions of using ultraviolet (UV) light were ""not practical"". ""UV doesn't really penetrate very far,"" she said. ""So even if you were to put it inside or outside, it's not going to even get to the lung... we just get a suntan or sunburn, and it causes DNA damage."" Dr Farber also said any radiation that would penetrate deeply enough "" would cause so much damage that you're better off with coronavirus"". Mr Trump directed his seemingly off-the-cuff suggestions to Dr Deborah Birx, his coronavirus response co-ordinator This is not the first time that Mr Trump's medical advice has generated controversy and criticism.

"This video can not be played 'We've saved so hard for so long for it, it's beyond belief almost' Brides and grooms say they are being charged thousands of pounds in cancellation and postponement fees for weddings that can't go ahead because of the coronavirus lockdown. While the majority of wedding companies across the UK have been flexible, a growing number of couples across the UK are locked in a battle with venues to get their money back. Adam Gibbs, 36, and Sarah Summerskill, 33, from Woking, were told their dream day in May was off because of social distancing restrictions, but they would still have to pay the venue an 80% cancellation charge. They had been planning their wedding for the last 18 months and were supposed to get married at Cain Manor in Surrey on 9 May - one of five venues part of the Bijou Weddings group. Their wedding package costs total Â£17,000, and the couple has so far paid Â£13,000. However, the venue has now cancelled the event and told them to pay a cancellation fee amounting to 80% of the total cost of the wedding, as listed in their wedding contract. They were advised to claim the money back on insurance and then re-book the wedding. But the couple has had their insurance claim declined on the basis that cancellation of the wedding and closure of the venue arose from a government order, and they feel ""lost and hopeless"". Adam Gibbs and Sarah Summerskill were meant to get married in May ""The venue has still got Â£13,000 of our money and are still demanding additional payments [to fulfil the cancellation charge] in the next week. It's not the kind of money you find down the back of the sofa,"" Mr Gibbs told the BBC. ""It's seems nonsensical to us that a venue can cancel on us and then charge us 80% [of the cost] without delivering a service."" Initially, Bijou Weddings told the couple that they needed to pay the full cancellation charge for the wedding package, which amounts to Â£13,600. Since the couple had paid Â£13,000, this would mean they still owed the wedding company another Â£600. But Bijou Weddings then said it would be willing to rebook their wedding date on another date in 2020 free of charge. Bijou Weddings says that if customers are able to make insurance claims and get the cancellation fees refunded, then it will offer alternative dates later on this year or in 2021 or 2022 for rebooked weddings, and the new wedding would be charged at 2019 package prices. The company said it would also throw in a free bar float of Â£1,000. And for customers who do not have insurance or could not claim on insurance, Bijou Weddings said it will rebook weddings free of charge and on available dates left in 2020, or a Sunday-to-Thursday wedding in 2021 in the same month as their original booking. Some couples are still unhappy with the options given to them by Bijou Weddings though. Jack Trowsdale, 27, and Claudia Dickens, 25, from West Sussex had already paid Â£21,000 for their wedding on 12 June at Botleys Mansion - another Bijou venue - when it was cancelled. ""We'd saved for so long and hard for it and then not only to find the wedding is cancelled, but to be told they think you owe them money for a wedding that didn't even happen. It's beyond belief almost,"" said Mr Trowsdale. The couple have both had their wages and hours reduced at work because of the virus. They told the BBC the excitement of planning their big day has been replaced by the stress of a full legal dispute. They have since been offered an alternative wedding date on a weekday at no extra cost, but are seeking a full refund as ""the ordeal has shattered"" their hopes of a special day. Coronavirus: 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Coronavirus: 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Sam Cutmore-Scott, managing director of Bijou Weddings said: ""In our 25 years delivering weddings, this is the first time our venues have been forced to close. I should point out that Bijou has not voluntarily or arbitrarily cancelled any weddings - it has been forced to close its venues and halt weddings caught in the government's social distancing restrictions. ""We have thus tried to accommodate the needs of couples who are immediately impacted, while still respecting our commitments to clients who have weddings booked in 2021 and beyond."" Couples that have splashed out on dream wedding venues say they are struggling to get new dates booked He added that a majority of couples had successfully re-booked for a later date. But Bijou Weddings defended its decision to keep the cancellation charges: ""Cancellation charges protect us from cancellations in an industry where the average engagement and advance booking period is around 23 months. ""Couples protect themselves from unforeseen circumstances by taking out wedding insurance which, in the normal course of events, covers cancellations that are caused by circumstances beyond the couple's control. ""We sent cancellation charge information to all our impacted couples so that any with insurance could make a claim and make themselves whole again. ""We have not followed up or chased cancellation charges during this crisis period and, for those couples who do not have insurance or whose insurance is shirking their responsibilities, we have offered a broad variety of postponement options with no charge or rearrangement fee."" Due to existing bookings for next year, other wedding venues are finding it increasingly difficult to reschedule cancelled weddings for equivalent weekends in 2021. Jenny Maybury, 39, and Michael Bromwich, 36, both from the Midlands, had their wedding moved from a Sunday in May, to a Wednesday in September. Only 12 of the 75 guests could make the new date in September, so Jenny decided to ask the hotel for a refund of Â£5,355. The venue, Abel's Harp in Shropshire, told the couple no weekends were available, but has refused to compensate them for the difference in price, or for a reduction in the number of guests. Unfortunately the couple do not have insurance for their wedding. ""They've backed us into a corner and taken it out of our control. We feel angry and heartbroken,"" said Ms Maybury. Another couple, Debra Bingham and her fiancÃ© Jamie, who had booked the same venue, told the BBC they were told they'd have to pay Â£1,500 to move the date they had chosen this year to 2021, on top of what they had already paid. Abel's Harp did not respond when approached by the BBC for comment. Jenny Maybury and Michael Bromwich feel they have been forced to hold their wedding on a day most of their guests cannot attend Lorraine Carroll has been in the wedding industry for over 30 years and is currently advising 250 brides and grooms who are in dispute with 15 different venues across the UK. She accuses a small minority of venues acting ""appallingly"", trying to profit through the coronavirus disruption and ""making rules and fees up as they go along"". ""Clients are being treated disgraceful by venues and insurers are finding ways of avoiding paying out. Couples face losing thousands of pounds,"" she said. The Competition and Markets Authority has previously warned the wedding sector that excessive cancellation charges, even when contracts had been signed, are not legally binding. In 2016, the authority, which ensures businesses treat customers fairly, wrote to more than 100 wedding and event venues reminding them of consumer protection laws. The CMA says it is prepared to ""use the tools at its disposal to intervene"". Consumer rights group Which? says it has received complaints from other couples about wedding venue cancellations.

Here's a bit more detail on that. The Department for Transport says it will fast track the launch of a new trial using drones between the mainland and St Maryâs Hospital on the Isle of Wight. It follows Â£28m awarded by the government earlier this year to Southampton and Portsmouth councils to carry out drone trials of this kind as part of a wider future transport zone trial. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News British Airways is increasing the frequency of its cargo flights from China to import more supplies for UK healthcare workers. The airline announced that from next month it will operate 21 flights per week from Shanghai or Beijing to London, up from the current level of 13. These flights from Shanghai and Beijing will be able to carry up to 770 tonnes of cargo for the NHS each week, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators - aircraft will also carry private cargo. British Airways is operating the flights in partnership with its sister company, IAG Cargo, and the Government.

"UK retail sales fell a record 5.1% in March as many stores shut up shop in the face of the coronavirus lockdown. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the steepest sales fall since it started collecting the data in 1996. Food and online shopping rose, and alcohol sales also jumped. But clothes sales tumbled by 34%. Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 22%, the ONS said. ""Retailers are in crisis mode as the impact of Covid-19 has obliterated sales to new record-lows,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. Off-licences, which were added to the government's list of essential UK retailers last month, saw sales rise 31.4% in volume terms, although with most drinkers buying from supermarkets, they only contribute less than 1% of alcohol sales. The data comes amid dire estimates for the performance of the UK economy amid the lockdown. Yesterday, one of the Bank of England's top policymakers warned that the UK faces its worst economic shock in several hundred years. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE's interest-rate setting committee, said that ""early indicators"" suggest the UK was ""experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries"". He did, though, say there was ""in principle"" a good chance that the UK would return to its ""pre-virus trajectory once the pandemic is over"". But for many shops, it is too late. In the year to date, Oasis, Warehouse, Debenhams, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston have collapsed, and while some shops will be salvaged, many will be gone for good. Excluding fuel, sales dropped 3.7% compared with February, a record for retail data collection going back to 1988. Food sales rose a record 11% as households stocked up and restaurants closed. For industries like retail, customer behaviour may never be the same. ""We don't expect the pattern of post-lockdown spending to be exactly the same as before, with our latest survey indicating that consumers intend to reward more responsible retailers,""said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at accountants PwC. ""Particularly those who looked after their staff, and shop more on their local high streets and with smaller or independent retailers, giving some more hope to many of the hardest-hit operators.""

"HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs A submarine crew were filmed having a party during the coronavirus lockdown, prompting a Royal Navy investigation. The captain of HMS Trenchant, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based at Devonport in Plymouth, has been sent home on leave. Video of the crew enjoying a party and barbecue while the submarine was tied up have been shared on social media. It shows sailors dancing and laughing, and a source confirmed some were drinking alcohol. HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs. The crew were required to stay with the submarine in isolation while the repairs were completed. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said it was understood the captain had gone ahead with the entertainment despite being advised it might be inappropriate.

"Not all families have laptops and broadband to help their children keep learning at home ""In our schools, 60% to 70% of children wouldn't have laptops,"" says Wayne Norrie, head of an academy trust with schools in disadvantaged areas. With schools closed and pupils studying online at home, he says, it is important to recognise the social gap in access to technology. ""Coronavirus has revealed the scale of the digital divide,"" he says. The Department for Education in England has promised laptops will be lent to some poorer teenagers. These will be available to disadvantaged Year 10 pupils without access to a computer, and those with social workers. The scheme, announced last Sunday, for un unspecified number of laptops, is expected to soon start taking bids from local authorities and academy trusts. Mr Norrie, chief executive of Greenwood Academies Trust, with 37 schools in the Midlands and east of England, says many families rely on a single mobile phone for an internet connection, which is ""not realistic"" for online learning and streaming video lessons. ""Many don't have broadband contracts,"" he says. Laptops promised for disadvantaged teenagers studying at home Not easy for families with pupils trying to learn at home A fifth of people do not use the internet For instance, he describes a family in Skegness who have a mobile phone shared between parents and three children. The schools have been providing laptops and some families have their own tablet computers - but there are still barriers in terms of parents' IT skills and children having space to study. The Department for Education is promising to lend laptops to some teenagers ""Digital poverty"" is a significant problem, says Matt Morden, co-head teacher of Surrey Square primary school, in south London. In his school, 24% of pupils are effectively offline, in terms of being able to study from home. Their families might have mobile phones with internet connections - but for those in low-paid, insecure jobs, data is expensive. ""If families are struggling, the priority is going to be food, not data,"" he says. As well as missing out on learning, those without online connections miss ""the sense of belonging"" from staying in touch with their friends and teachers, Mr Morden says. The lockdown and the closure of schools has ""brought the digital divide to the forefront"", he says. There are digital haves and have-nots in the coronavirus lockdown There has been anew virtual academy launchedand the BBC has provided educational resources - but those without internet access or usable computer devices are being left behind. Mr Morden's school has been lending laptops - but for families with several school-age children, one might not be enough. Seb Chapleau, director of the Big Education Conversation charity, says it is ""important to understand that this is a deep problem across many schools"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Chris Tomlinson, who chairs the trust, says online lessons are ""no good if the children don't have the necessary hardware to access the internet"". The AET academy trust is providing 9,000 laptops for its 58 schools, one for all pupils on free school meals. The current lockdown has turned technology into an educational necessity rather than a luxury, said the trust's chief executive, Julian Drinkall Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, says too often there are assumptions about access to broadband and up-to-date computers. As an MP, he says he deals with constituents who have to weigh up the cost of data before sending emails or getting information online. He suggests educational programmes could be put on free-to-air television to reach those not online.

"This video can not be played 'We've saved so hard for so long for it, it's beyond belief almost' Brides and grooms say they are being charged thousands of pounds in cancellation and postponement fees for weddings that can't go ahead because of the coronavirus lockdown. While the majority of wedding companies across the UK have been flexible, a growing number of couples across the UK are locked in a battle with venues to get their money back. Adam Gibbs, 36, and Sarah Summerskill, 33, from Woking, were told their dream day in May was off because of social distancing restrictions, but they would still have to pay the venue an 80% cancellation charge. They had been planning their wedding for the last 18 months and were supposed to get married at Cain Manor in Surrey on 9 May - one of five venues part of the Bijou Weddings group. Their wedding package costs total Â£17,000, and the couple has so far paid Â£13,000. However, the venue has now cancelled the event and told them to pay a cancellation fee amounting to 80% of the total cost of the wedding, as listed in their wedding contract. They were advised to claim the money back on insurance and then re-book the wedding. But the couple has had their insurance claim declined on the basis that cancellation of the wedding and closure of the venue arose from a government order, and they feel ""lost and hopeless"". Adam Gibbs and Sarah Summerskill were meant to get married in May ""The venue has still got Â£13,000 of our money and are still demanding additional payments [to fulfil the cancellation charge] in the next week. It's not the kind of money you find down the back of the sofa,"" Mr Gibbs told the BBC. ""It's seems nonsensical to us that a venue can cancel on us and then charge us 80% [of the cost] without delivering a service."" Initially, Bijou Weddings told the couple that they needed to pay the full cancellation charge for the wedding package, which amounts to Â£13,600. Since the couple had paid Â£13,000, this would mean they still owed the wedding company another Â£600. But Bijou Weddings then said it would be willing to rebook their wedding date on another date in 2020 free of charge. Bijou Weddings says that if customers are able to make insurance claims and get the cancellation fees refunded, then it will offer alternative dates later on this year or in 2021 or 2022 for rebooked weddings, and the new wedding would be charged at 2019 package prices. The company said it would also throw in a free bar float of Â£1,000. And for customers who do not have insurance or could not claim on insurance, Bijou Weddings said it will rebook weddings free of charge and on available dates left in 2020, or a Sunday-to-Thursday wedding in 2021 in the same month as their original booking. Some couples are still unhappy with the options given to them by Bijou Weddings though. Jack Trowsdale, 27, and Claudia Dickens, 25, from West Sussex had already paid Â£21,000 for their wedding on 12 June at Botleys Mansion - another Bijou venue - when it was cancelled. ""We'd saved for so long and hard for it and then not only to find the wedding is cancelled, but to be told they think you owe them money for a wedding that didn't even happen. It's beyond belief almost,"" said Mr Trowsdale. The couple have both had their wages and hours reduced at work because of the virus. They told the BBC the excitement of planning their big day has been replaced by the stress of a full legal dispute. They have since been offered an alternative wedding date on a weekday at no extra cost, but are seeking a full refund as ""the ordeal has shattered"" their hopes of a special day. Coronavirus: 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Coronavirus: 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Sam Cutmore-Scott, managing director of Bijou Weddings said: ""In our 25 years delivering weddings, this is the first time our venues have been forced to close. I should point out that Bijou has not voluntarily or arbitrarily cancelled any weddings - it has been forced to close its venues and halt weddings caught in the government's social distancing restrictions. ""We have thus tried to accommodate the needs of couples who are immediately impacted, while still respecting our commitments to clients who have weddings booked in 2021 and beyond."" Couples that have splashed out on dream wedding venues say they are struggling to get new dates booked He added that a majority of couples had successfully re-booked for a later date. But Bijou Weddings defended its decision to keep the cancellation charges: ""Cancellation charges protect us from cancellations in an industry where the average engagement and advance booking period is around 23 months. ""Couples protect themselves from unforeseen circumstances by taking out wedding insurance which, in the normal course of events, covers cancellations that are caused by circumstances beyond the couple's control. ""We sent cancellation charge information to all our impacted couples so that any with insurance could make a claim and make themselves whole again. ""We have not followed up or chased cancellation charges during this crisis period and, for those couples who do not have insurance or whose insurance is shirking their responsibilities, we have offered a broad variety of postponement options with no charge or rearrangement fee."" Due to existing bookings for next year, other wedding venues are finding it increasingly difficult to reschedule cancelled weddings for equivalent weekends in 2021. Jenny Maybury, 39, and Michael Bromwich, 36, both from the Midlands, had their wedding moved from a Sunday in May, to a Wednesday in September. Only 12 of the 75 guests could make the new date in September, so Jenny decided to ask the hotel for a refund of Â£5,355. The venue, Abel's Harp in Shropshire, told the couple no weekends were available, but has refused to compensate them for the difference in price, or for a reduction in the number of guests. Unfortunately the couple do not have insurance for their wedding. ""They've backed us into a corner and taken it out of our control. We feel angry and heartbroken,"" said Ms Maybury. Another couple, Debra Bingham and her fiancÃ© Jamie, who had booked the same venue, told the BBC they were told they'd have to pay Â£1,500 to move the date they had chosen this year to 2021, on top of what they had already paid. Abel's Harp did not respond when approached by the BBC for comment. Jenny Maybury and Michael Bromwich feel they have been forced to hold their wedding on a day most of their guests cannot attend Lorraine Carroll has been in the wedding industry for over 30 years and is currently advising 250 brides and grooms who are in dispute with 15 different venues across the UK. She accuses a small minority of venues acting ""appallingly"", trying to profit through the coronavirus disruption and ""making rules and fees up as they go along"". ""Clients are being treated disgraceful by venues and insurers are finding ways of avoiding paying out. Couples face losing thousands of pounds,"" she said. The Competition and Markets Authority has previously warned the wedding sector that excessive cancellation charges, even when contracts had been signed, are not legally binding. In 2016, the authority, which ensures businesses treat customers fairly, wrote to more than 100 wedding and event venues reminding them of consumer protection laws. The CMA says it is prepared to ""use the tools at its disposal to intervene"". Consumer rights group Which? says it has received complaints from other couples about wedding venue cancellations. ""It is unacceptable that some venues are refusing to provide any refund of couples' significant upfront deposits or charging customers extortionate fees, particularly when it is not the couples' decision to cancel,"" said Adam French, Consumer Rights Editor at Which?. ""While many businesses will be struggling during this difficult time, it does not seem fair for customers to be charged fees or left thousands of pounds out of pocket for a service the venue can't deliver."" He added that businesses should take a ""compassionate and flexible approach"". âWe're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chaletâ 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' wants to plead guilty.

"Wales' official Covid-19 death toll jumps to 751 after a further 110 reported fatalities The increase includes 84 backdated deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area of north Wales due to a delay in the reporting process First Minister Mark Drakeford says the reporting delay will be investigated but claims it did not affect the overall picture Tougher rules from Saturday will make it clear people cannot stay or exercise outside their area But some restrictions in Wales could be eased at the end of the current three-week lockdown period, the first minister says Debenhams warns its biggest stores in Wales could shut permanently unless the Welsh Government agrees to offer business rates relief Rachel Flint and Richard Porter Thank you for following our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. The Saturday team will be bringing you all the latest news from 08:00 tomorrow morning. Have a lovely evening and stay safe. As we draw our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Wales to a close for tonight, here's a recap of the key things we learnt today: A Laura Ashley factory is among businesses manufacturing for the NHS to battle coronavirus. The firm's Texplan factory, in Newtown, are making hospital scrubs while Hay-on-Wye's TS Henderson & Co is making test equipment and oxygen supplies. TS Henderson has previously made parts for Rolls-Royce. Managing director Rob Henderson said: ""At an hour of need, weâre playing our part. ""Our existing and new customers in the supply chain are awesome to work with, but we are all inspired by those in the NHS who are saving lives on the front line.â Cemeteries in Cardiff are set to reopen with strict social distancing measures in place, so people can visit loved ones' graves. The council closed cemetery gates at the start of April after reports of people having picnics, playing football and groups of people gathering in the grounds, despite the coronavirus restrictions. A 73-year-old man, who lost his wife after a short illness six years ago, said it hadbeen heartbreaking not to be able to visit her grave. But from tomorrow four of the city's cemeteries will reopen, with council workers and police monitoring strict social distancing measures for visitors. But they have urged people only to visit cemeteries if they are attending a grave or for a funeral. Councillor Michael Michael said the closure was always a temporary measure which had been kept under review. ""We know this has been a difficult time for those who have been unable to visit the grave of their loved ones, and I would ask people to ensure that, now these important spaces are open, they use them appropriately and maintain a safe distance from others if they do visit,"" he said. A health board failing to publish daily figures for those who have died with coronavirus, ""smacks of incompetence"", a Conservative assembly member has said. Betsi Cadwaladr health board reported 84 deaths in the north Wales area on Thursday. It made it look like Wales had seen the biggest daily jump in confirmed deaths to date - 110 - but it included Betsi Cadwaladr's figures which were for a whole month. The health board said the delay was due to issues with its reporting system. But Tory AM Mark Isherwood said whether the board said they were ""delayed"" or retrospectively published, the 84 deaths had gone ""unreported"". âI am staggered as to how they could have been missed, and I am equally concerned as to how this may have skewed the overall figures and the approach to combating coronavirus. âIt smacks of incompetence of the highest level, and will create further anxiety for people who have experienced the problems of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board â which has been in special measures for nearly five years â as we go through this pandemic.â Should we be more relaxed about government surveillance, if it helps combat the coronavirus?

Bethan Gibson, deputy head of the training programme for intensive care in Wales, saidthe virus highlighted the lack of such staff. ""We need to train more trainees to fill the gaps that were already there. And then we need to train even more trainees to fill the gaps that will be there because of Covid,"" she said. The Welsh Government said its emergency recruitment drive has signed up more than 2,000 people to return to the NHS to help during the crisis, and nearly 900 staff have already completed critical care training. Sir Tom Jones has lost his claim to be the oldest person to have a number one hit record to Captain Tom Moore. The 99-year-old fundraiser was recognised asthe oldest person to top the official UK pop chartsbecause of his appearance with Michael Ball on a cover version of You'll Never Walk Alone. Guinness World Records said the accolade was previously held by Sir Tom, who was 68 when he sang on 2009 charity single Barry Islands in the Stream. The Welsh star was quick to congratulate his successor. ""Capt Moore, from one Tom to another, congratulations on beating my chart record,"" he said. ""If I was going to lose to anybody, it's an honour to have lost to you, with all you have done raising money for the NHS."" As of Friday evening, Capt Moore had raised more than Â£28.6m by walking around the garden at his home in Bedfordshire. Captain Tom and Michael Ball celebrate their number one Wales football captain Sophie Ingle is coping with life in lockdown by doing family quizzes and yoga - not re-watching her wonder goal for Chelsea. ""I've not watched it on lockdown but when I scored I actually did watch it a few times,"" she said. She has also been doing different things away from football ""which really helps"". Danny Egan leaving hospital after being treated for coronavirus A pensioner and an NHS nurse have become the first two ventilated patients to leave a hospital in Wales after having coronavirus. Danny Egan, 73, and charge nurse David Courtney-Williams, 48, were both applauded by staff as they were discharged from Swansea's Morriston Hospital. Both men were ""extremely unwell"" when they were put on ventilators in intensive care. On Tuesday, Mr Courtney-Williams, a nurse at Swansea's Singleton Hospital, gave a thumbs-up as he was clapped. Within an hour, retired service engineer Mr Egan, from Port Talbot, was also applauded following his recovery He told staff the first thing he would do was kiss his wife. Mr Egan had no memory of falling ill. He said: ""We went out, my son's birthday, and the next thing I was waking up in a ward. ""I didn't have any socks on and people were trying to tell me to move my feet, and I thought, 'How can I move my feet? Where am I?'"" Nurse David Courtney-Williams was cheered after his recovery Many businesses may decide not to reopen after lockdown restrictions are lifted, a Welsh MP has warned. Stephen Crabb MP, who chairs the Welsh Affairs committee, said many had already been struggling to survive before having to close due to the social-distancing measures. He told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""They may just make the decision that it's better shutting up shop altogether."" Debenhams has warned its major stores across Wales may never reopen, unless the Welsh Government reverses a decision on business rates relief. In England all retail, leisure and hospitality firms have been granted a business rates holiday, but in Wales this does not include stores with a rateable value of over Â£500,000. The committee has launched an inquiry into the economic consequences of the pandemic and how to revive the nation's fortunes. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP said many areas of Wales such as those relying on farming and tourism were ""vulnerable at the best of times"" and were now ""very, very vulnerable"". A nursing home has seen the ""catastrophic"" death of 15 residents in a month, its manager has said. Fourteen of the elderly residents at Tregwilym Lodge in Rogerstone, Newport, had symptoms of Covid-19, but none of them were tested. General manager Karen Healey said one or two residents would be expected to die in a normal month. The Welsh Government said its policy was now to test all care home residents with coronavirus symptoms. This video can not be played Coronavirus: We've lost so many so quickly, says nursing home manager There are âtentative signs of progress"" in the fight against coronavirus, due to the public adhering to social distancing measures, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. During the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps announced a new package of measures for transport - including freight services, to bring in crucial goods, such as medicines. The transport support unit is being launched by the UK government, which will use 9,000 vehicles to help deliver services during the pandemic, such as distributing packages to vulnerable people. Mr Shapps said there would also be a review looking to see if drones could be used to deliver medical supplies. As transport is devolved in Wales, it would appear the measures only apply in England, with the UK government saying the support announced today was being funded from existing Department for Transport budgets. Reality Check The UK government has said there are five tests the UK must meet before lockdown restrictions can be eased. They include making sure the NHS can cope, and ensuring there is enough testing and personal protective equipment available to meet future demand. So, how close is the UK to meeting those tests? Our explainer sets out how far weâve come: Read more:Are the five tests being met? This video can not be played Actor Richard Mylan has told BBC Radio 5 Live why he and his autistic son, Jaco, are continuing their important daily visits to Cardiff Market, despite being in lockdown. Theyâve previously visited the market hundreds of times as it closes up for the night â now itâs closed indefinitely but itâs still a key feature of their daily walks. People with autism, like 14-year-old Jaco, will now be able to go out more than once a day for exercise under an easing of restrictions by the Welsh Government. Speaking to Rachel Burden, Richard Mylan, who appeared in BBC drama Waterloo Road, said âautistic people can deal with change, as long as itâs gradual and itâs explainedâ. This video can not be played Farmers have overcome lockdown to hold markets again - thanks to internet technology. Stallholders in Haverfordwest, Aberystwyth and Aberaeron have joined forces to launch a click-and-collect service. About 25 food producers have signed up to an online hub where customers can order. It was set up by Alastair Vince, owner of Blaencamel Farm, in Cilcennin, near Lampeter. They supply fruit and vegetables across Wales and were left with no way to sell their produce when lockdown came into force. ""It's taken off really quickly - we've had 68 orders today across 15 producers in Pembrokeshire, and it looks set to continue while we're in lockdown,"" Mr Vince said. More traffic has been seen on UK roads in recent days, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said. During the Downing Street daily briefing, Dr Harries said the data shows a very slight increase in transport use compared to last week. It also shows use of other modes of transport remains down by more than 95% when compared with February. Championship sides Cardiff City and Swansea City have agreed partial wage deferrals with their players. Swansea's first team squad have agreed to take ""a 20% conditional wage deferral for the next three months"". Chairman Trevor Birch, sporting director Leon Britton and manager Steve Cooper had already agreed deferrals. The Bluebirds' deferral with players is also for three months while manager Neil Harris and chief executive Ken Choo had already accepted wage cuts. The moves come with football in the UK suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. A doctor says the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted the need for investment in intensive care in Wales.

The recording of deaths of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus is to be investigated after a Welsh health board failed to report numbers. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was important that ""accurate information"" was reported by health boards so people could ""have confidence"" in what was being published. Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which is responsible for the care of people in north Wales, reported 84 deaths over the course of a month for the first time today citing issues with its reporting system. Public Health Wales (PHW) explained this was the reason for the biggest single daily jump in confirmed deaths of people with coronavirus - 110 - taking the total to 751. Mr Drakeford said: ""The additional deaths reported by Betsi Cadwaladr don't change the overall picture, but I have asked for an assurance this afternoon that this is being thoroughly checked, that the whole system is being investigated, so that we can say confidently on Monday that the figures we are reporting through Public Health Wales genuinely represent an accurate picture in every part of Wales"". PHW has repeatedly warned that the number of deaths could be higher than the figures show, as they only include those who died in hospitals, and some care homes, and whose tests were analysed in a lab.

"This video can not be played Top US doctor says heat and light are not a treatment for Covid-19 US President Donald Trump has been lambasted by the medical community after suggesting research into whether coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body. He also appeared to propose irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by a doctor at the briefing. Another of his officials had moments earlier said sunlight and disinfectant were known to kill the infection. Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested. Even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. During Thursday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, an official presented the results of US government research that indicated coronavirus appeared to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight and heat. The study also showed bleach could kill the virus in saliva or respiratory fluids within five minutes and isopropyl alcohol could kill it even more quickly. Bleach and sunshine were proposed as possible strategies to tackle the coronavirus William Bryan, acting head of the US Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, outlined the findings at the news conference. The fake health advice you should ignore Will coronavirus go away in the summer? Coronavirus: How bad information goes viral Coronavirus job losses and 'the millennial curse' While noting the research should be treated with caution, Mr Trump suggested further research in that area. ""So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous - whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light,"" the president said, turning to Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, ""and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you're going to test it. ""And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside of the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting,"" the president continued. This video can not be played Donald Trump criticised Georgiaâs governor for reopening ""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? ""So it'd be interesting to check that."" Pointing to his head, Mr Trump went on: ""I'm not a doctor. But I'm, like, a person that has a good you-know-what."" 'What I fear the most is not being able to survive' The new house rules of my life under lockdown Watch: False claims by politicians debunked He turned again to Dr Birx and asked if she had ever heard of using ""the heat and the light"" to treat coronavirus. ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx said. ""I mean, certainly, fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But I've not seen heat or light."" ""I think it's a great thing to look at,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played Across the United States, some people insist the lockdowns should be lifted and states reopened Analysis by Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter Using a disinfectant can kill viruses on surfaces. It's a very good idea to keep clean the things you touch, using products with anti-microbial properties - for example, substances with a high alcohol content. There is also some evidence that, in general, viruses on surfaces die more quickly when directly exposed to sunlight. But we don't know how much or how long they have to be exposed for UV light to have an effect, so you're far safer just washing your hands and surfaces and trying not to touch your face. Crucially, this is only about infected objects and surfaces - not about what happens once the virus is inside your body. One of the main ways of catching the virus is by breathing in droplets expelled by an infected person, mainly by sneezing and coughing. The virus very quickly begins to multiply and spread, eventually reaching the lungs. Not only does consuming or injecting disinfectant risk poisoning and death, it's not even likely to be effective. Equally, by the time the virus has taken hold inside your body, no amount of UV light on your skin is going to make a difference. And since UV radiation damages the skin, using it to kill the virus could be a case of -  to borrow a well-worn phrase - the cure being worse than the disease. Doctors warned the president's idea could have fatal results. Pulmonologist Dr Vin Guptatold NBC News,external: ""This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible and it's dangerous. ""It's a common method that people utilise when they want to kill themselves."" Kashif Mahmood, a doctor in Charleston, West Virginia,tweeted,external: ""As a physician, I can't recommend injecting disinfectant into the lungs or using UV radiation inside the body to treat Covid-19. ""Don't take medical advice from Trump."" John Balmes, a pulmonologist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, warned that even breathing fumes from bleach could cause severe health problems. He told Bloomberg News,external: ""Inhaling chlorine bleach would be absolutely the worst thing for the lungs. The airway and lungs are not made to be exposed to even an aerosol of disinfectant. ""Not even a low dilution of bleach or isopropyl alcohol is safe. It's a totally ridiculous concept."" Mr Trump has previously hyped a malaria medication, hydroxycloroquine, as a possible treatment for coronavirus, though he has stopped touting that drug recently. This week a study of coronavirus patients in a US government-run hospital for military veterans found more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than those treated with standard care. Reacting to the president's remarks on Thursday evening, Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger in November's White House election, tweeted: ""UV light? Injecting disinfectant? Here's an idea, Mr President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Key workers trying to book tests were met with this message from the middle of Friday morning The new website for key workers to book coronavirus tests has temporarily closed - hours after being opened by the government. The Department of Health said it was working to ""rapidly increase"" availability, withmore tests due to become available on Saturday.,external Downing Street said 5,000 home testing kits were ordered in the first two minutes of the website going live. About 15,000 tests were booked to take place on Friday at drive-through sites. No 10 said the total amount of home testing kits available on Friday were ordered, adding it hoped to have 18,000 kits available each day for key workers by the ""end of next week"".

First patients injected in UK vaccine trial Trying to get a coronavirus test? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The expanded testing scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday allowsall essential workers,externalin England to register for tests on thegovernment's website,external, if they or a family member have virus symptoms. Up to 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for testing, with the aim of allowing essential staff to safely return to work. Previously, a smaller group of key workers - those whose work is deemed critical to the Covid-19 response - were eligible for testing. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid the new system would also apply there ""very soon"", while Wales and Northern Ireland have both announcedseparate plans to expand testing. Downing Street said the government is trusting that those applying for testing are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. The website opened on Friday but appeared to close by mid-morning with some users met by an ""applications closed"" message. The Department of Health apologised for ""any inconvenience"" caused by the temporary closure of applications. The government remains some way short of its target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day in the UK by the end of this month. Friday's figures showed 28,532 tests were carried out, though Mr Hancock said on Thursday that capacity has reached more than 50,000 a day. The latest data also showed a further 684 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 19,506. In Wales the total number of people confirmed to have died with coronavirus reached 751, an increase of more than 100 for the first time. However, Public Health Wales saidthe 110 deaths reported on Fridayincluded 84 that had been added retrospectively ""due to a delay in the reporting process"". Secondary school teacher Mike Eyre, from Boston in Lincolnshire, was one of the first people to apply for a test but told the BBC he was still waiting for confirmation about where to go 11 hours later. ""It was very easy to log on and register,"" he said. ""It just said that you would then receive a text, which would take a few minutes but it might take a little bit longer if it's busy. ""I've still not had a text yet, so I'm assuming they're very busy."" Liz Christie, an education adviser from Slough in Berkshire, applied at about 06:45 BST and heard back at about midday on Friday. She will make the 30-mile round-trip to a drive-in centre in Wembley, north London, later. She told BBC News that she ""didn't expect it to be completely smooth"" on the first day, and said she was ""pleased that in less than 48 hours I'll have been tested and know if I'm positive or not"". ""We've been able to work from home but they've asked if I can go in next week, so it would be useful to know,"" she said. ""My children are both asthmatic - and getting a test would also mean I could then go and help my mum, who has almost no immune system and is getting no help in the house."" John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, described the announcement as ""long overdue and very welcome"". He added that testing would enable self-isolating officers ""to get back onto the front line to assist their colleagues if the test comes back as negative"". Also among those to qualify for tests are staff at supermarkets, where absences due to coronavirus have been a big issue. Tesco currently has more than 41,000 staff members off work. The British Retail Consortium said the testing of such workers was ""crucial"" to ""maintain good supplies to stores"". Transport for London (TfL) - where a third of employees have been ill or have had to self-isolate since the start of the pandemic - said that while testing would not be mandatory, it was ""encouraging the take-up of testing by all eligible members of staff"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock said the expanding testing scheme was ""part of getting Britain back on her feet"". Mr Hancock said once people entered their details online they would be sent a text or email inviting them to either book an appointment at a drive-through centre or to request a home test kit, though the latter are currently in limited supply. He told BBC Breakfast the home kits would be collected by courier and would initially start in ""small numbers"" before the service grows. A help desk has been established to aid the process, while mobile units run by the Army are travelling around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes. Anyone classified as an""essential worker"",externalwho is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours. Mr Hancock has said the ""majority"" of people will get their result in 24 hours, but for some it might take a bit longer. The result will be added to a person's medical record so their doctor is informed, he added. Key workers who are unable to access the government's website will still be able to apply for a test, as employers are able to book on behalf of their staff. Until now, hospitals have been carrying out tests, along with a network of about 30 drive-through centres in car parks, airports and sports grounds. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers should have been prepared for the surge in demand for coronavirus tests. There is no doubting the scale and ambition of this project - up to 10 million essential workers and their families invited to go online if they have symptoms to book a virus test. Ensuring the system can smoothly book people their tests at drive in centres and then get results back within 48 hours will be a major technological challenge. Some may complain that the drive-in centres are not accessible but the plan will soon involve home testing kits being sent to people to do their own swabs and send them back for laboratory testing. The home testing kits are currently going out to NHS workers. Then government says this will be extended very soon to the wider group. Mobile pop-up test facilities will go to workplaces. In theory this will make a big difference to key workers self-isolating because a member of their household is unwell - if that individual tests negative then others in the home can get back to work quickly. Or if someone is unsure about their symptoms they can easily check whether they have coronavirus. This is a significant move in the drive to boost testing. The question now is whether the IT and the infrastructure can deliver. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs A submarine crew were filmed having a party during the coronavirus lockdown, prompting a Royal Navy investigation. The captain of HMS Trenchant, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based at Devonport in Plymouth, has been sent home on leave. Video of the crew enjoying a party and barbecue while the submarine was tied up have been shared on social media. It shows sailors dancing and laughing, and a source confirmed some were drinking alcohol. HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs. The crew were required to stay with the submarine in isolation while the repairs were completed. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said it was understood the captain had gone ahead with the entertainment despite being advised it might be inappropriate. A Royal Navy spokesman said: ""An investigation is under way. It would be inappropriate to comment further."" Nuclear sub breaks ice at North Pole.

Some of the main developments today:  Today's live page was written by our journalists in Australia, Singapore, India, the UK and US: Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Alexandra Fouche, Rebecca Morton, Dulcie Lee, Saj Chowdhury, Michael Emons,  Emlyn Begley, Marie Jackson, Rob Greenall, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, Yaroslav Lukov, Holly Hondereich, Ritu Prasad, Ian Youngs, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The harsh political reality for the president is he faces a re-election contest in just over six months, and the longer the lockdown drags on, the less time the economy will have to recover before voters head to the ballot box. Current polling suggests he is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden nationally and in key battleground states, and while the race is likely to tighten and the president has abundant resources to run a robust campaign, Trump appears destined for an uphill fight. The president also faces a flip-side risk of being seen as supporting re-opening too quickly and shouldering the blame if there is a subsequent spike in cases. That could explain why, just days after calling for states to begin reopening process, he criticised the Republican governor of Georgia for lifting restrictions on places like hair salons, bars and tattoo parlours, where social distancing guidelines would be difficult to follow. It's a difficult line for any politician to walk, and in the days ahead the stakes will be at their highest. Here's Anthony's full piece:Coronavirus pandemic exposes rather than heals America's divisions Trump was also asked how the November presidential election could go ahead amid the coronavirus outbreak. ""I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election,"" Trump says. ""We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to, who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid,"" he says of former Vice-President Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger, whom he often calls ""Sleepy Joe"". ""I watched a couple of interviews, and I say 'Oh I look forward to this,'"" Trump says. ""But they're keeping him sheltered."" Biden cancelled all in-person campaign events beginning in mid-March as social-distancing measures were ordered throughout the US. He has continued to hold interviews and digital fundraisers from his home in Delaware, and launched a podcast last month. In an interview today, Biden said he was ""ready to debate"" Trump. ""Zoom or Skype or Slack or hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants."" The US president also claimed knowledge in the fields of medicine and economics during the news conference. ""I'm not a doctor but I'm a person who has a good you-know-what,"" he said at one point, apparently gesturing to his brain. At another point: ""I know a lot about economists and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good of an idea as anybody."" Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old British Army veteran who has raised Â£28.5m ($35m) for the NHS, could be number one in the UK music charts this weekend - but he's in a tight race with a Canadian pop star. A version of You'll Never Walk Alone featuring the voice of Captain Tom was thought to be on course to be number one, but earlier on Thursday, The Weeknd's Blinding Lights overtook him. However, in a late twist, The Weeknd has now thrown his weight behind Captain Tom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number one will be revealed just before 18:00 BST on Friday. The briefing is now over but to recap, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on his ally, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, over his aggressive reopening plan for his state. ""I want the states to open, more than he does, much more than he does,"" Trump says of Kemp. ""But I didn't like to see spas [reopening] at this early stage, nor did the doctors."" Kemp said hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and nail salons would be allowed to reopen on Friday, with restaurants following suit on Monday. ""I didn't like to see a lot of things happening, and I wasn't happy with it, and I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp,"" Trump says. ""I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I'm saying, 'Let the governors do it.'"" The BBC's Jon Sopel asks Trump how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was when he spoke to him this week. ""He called me a few days ago, I will tell you he sounded incredible. I was actually surprisedâ¦ he was ready to go, Iâm very surprised to tell you this, itâs like, the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" He adds: ""Because he called me almost pretty close to when he got out of the hospital, I think heâs doing great, he was so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible, heâs an incredible guy, heâs a friend of ours and a friend of mine, he loves our country, he loves his country a lotâ¦ and theyâre lucky to have him over there."" Trump is asked about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, particularly given that countries with hot weather, like Singapore, have also been hit by the outbreak. ""I hope people enjoy the sun,"" Trump says. ""And if it has an impact that's great.... maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor"" He then asks Dr Deborah Birx, a co-ordinator of the White House virus response whether heat can help kill the virus. ""Deborah have you ever heard of that? The heat, and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but to this virus?"" ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx says. ""I mean, certainly, fever, is a good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond."" But she does not believe it works as a treatment, she repeats. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Very
aware of the negative headlines of late, depicting EU leader v EU leader; the
rich and frugal North v the suffering, spendthrift South, there was a
determination at Thursdayâs EU summit to avoid the verbal fisticuffs. There was no
walkout by ""Angry Italy"". No fuming about Eurobonds by the Dutch. Instead EU
leaders signed off, as expected, on a pre-agreed â¬500bn ($540bn; Â£435bn) emergency
financial package and on guidelines for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. Heated
discussion about a recovery plan for European economies after the health
crisis was left for another day - the buck passed to the European Commission
which now has the unenviable task of conjuring up a proposal  acceptable
to divided EU opinion. Today at least, EU leaders were keen to present a united
front. Their underlying intended message: âYes, we argue but EU solidarity
exists. We muddle our way through in the end.â Trump is asked why he has stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine, a malaria and lupus medication, as a possible treatment for coronavirus. âI havenât at all... weâll see what happens,â he says. The president's public remarks hyping the drug have decreased substantially over the past week or so. He says today he hasnât seen a recent study that said coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates. That research followed 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. The 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The BBC's Jon Sopel asks a question about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity. ""At the moment the advice is stay at home, by the summer could we be flipping that, and saying you'll be much better off being outside?"" Sopel asks. ""I would not go contrary to the guidance that has been issued right now,"" Bryan says. He adds: ""If I'm having an event with my family, I'm doing it in the driveway or the backyard, not inside the house."" ""In fact I'm thinking about moving outside to the rose garden,"" Trump jokes. William Bryan, the under secretary for science and technology at the US Department of Homeland Security, says the coronavirus may be killed faster under increased temperature, humidity and sunlight. ""We identified that heat and humidity is a weakness"" of the virus' ability to spread, Bryan says, showing data suggesting that the virus could survive for 90 seconds under direct sunlight, and for 90 minutes without any solar contact. The findings are an ""emerging"" result of their work, Bryan says. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC More than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past five weeks - over 15% of the US workforce. One American who has lost her job recently is Rachel Sterner, who worked as a stage manager for the Broadway production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. She says: ""I loved my job - it was my responsibility to maintain the artistic integrity of the show, and it's a challenging and beautiful show. ""Working in theatre means being laid off is not a foreign concept - but normally, if you lose a job, you can get on another project. This is different - there won't be work for a long time. ""Even if we do a show at half-capacity, who knows how long it'll be till tourists come back, and people have disposable income for the theatre?"" You can read more of the human stories behind the unemployment figureshere. Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives has voted 388-5 to pass a $484bn (Â£390bn) emergency aid bill meant to replenish depleted relief programs for small businesses. The bill, passed by the Senate earlier this week, will also provide funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing. It will not provide money to state governments. Lawmakers donned face masks and maintained social distancing as they assembled in the Capitol today. To vote, members were divided alphabetically into groups of roughly 60 people and were asked to stay in their offices until their group was called. Vice-President Mike Pence says that 4.93 million coronavirus tests have been completed across the US, adding that commercial labs surpassed 100,000 tests yesterday. Pence says that he is ""encouraged"" by states' ""phased approach"" to reopening their economies. ""We're slowing the spread, we're protecting the most vulnerable, we're saving lives and every single day we are one day closer to opening up America again,"" Pence says. Taking the stage after Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence says the data continues to show ""promising signs of progress"" in the US fight against coronavirus. Major virus hotspots including the New York Metro Area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans ""all appear to be past their peak"", Pence says. ""Our only conclusion is that we're getting there, America,"" he adds. ""If we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead... we do believe by early summer we could be in a much better place as a nation, with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us."" He says 16 states have released formal reopening plans so far. An Ohio family has cancelled plans to livestream the funeral of
father-of-two John McDaniel, who died on 15 April after testing positive for
Covid-19, after a deluge of backlash against his social media posts criticising
stay-home orders. In
a statement, McDaniel's wife of more than 30 years, Lisa McDaniel, wrote that
the livestream would be cancelled as ""John's story, along with early
assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook had turned into national
news"". ""This
news has opened flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and
unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know."" McDaniel's
posts disparaged stay home mandates ordered by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and
called the virus response ""madness"". ""As
each day passes, we are all learning more about this 'invisible enemy,'""
Lisa wrote. ""We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge
the national crisis we are in, abide by the stay-at-home-order, and encourage
family and friends to do the same."" In his obituary, McDaniel is described as an
""outdoorsman"", a loving father and husband, and an ""ornery
son-of-a-gun"". Donald Trump says ""we are very close to a vaccine"", after noting vaccine trials taking place in the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and China. ""We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this,"" he says. ""Unfortunately we're not very close to testing because when testing starts it takes a period of time, but we'll get it done."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, has previously said that a vaccine will likely take 12-18 months to be approved for widespread use. Most health experts also agree that it would take at least 12-18 months before a vaccine is ready. The first human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine has begun in the UK US President Donald Trump has taken the podium for his daily White House coronavirus briefing. He is joined by Vice-President Mike Pence and Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. Gilead Sciences is headquartered in the US state of California A closely-watched Gilead Sciences Inc experimental antiviral drug failed to help patients with severe Covid-19 in a clinical trial conducted in China, Reuters reports. But the US company said in a statement that the study's results were ""inconclusive"" because it was terminated early due to ""low enrolment"".   Allow Twitter content?

The company's shares fell more than 4% after the data was inadvertently released and first reported by the Financial Times, Reuters says. It comes days after another report detailed rapid recovery in fever and respiratory symptoms in some patients with Covid-19 who were treated with experimental drug remdesivir at the University of Chicago Medicine hospital. Interest in Gilead's remdesivir has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for Covid-19. Â© 2025 BBC.
