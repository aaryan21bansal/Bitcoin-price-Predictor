"Water companies have been illegally dumping untreated sewage into rivers in England and Wales, an investigation by BBC Panorama has found. Data analysed by the programme showed some companies have regularly breached the conditions in their permits. Treatment works are only allowed to put sewage into waterways after wet weather and when they are close to capacity. The water industry says it will invest more than a billion pounds over five years to reduce discharges into rivers. Treatment works are allowed to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather, such as torrential rain, and when they are operating close to full capacity. This protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes. The untreated sewage is normally screened and passed through storage tanks before it is dumped. Discharge permits issued by the Environment Agency specify the level of sewage each works has to treat before it can dump untreated sewage. But Panorama's investigation found one water company was discharging sewage without a permit and evidence that another company had given the Environment Agency incorrect information about the sewage it was dumping in the river. Recent figures published by the Environment Agency reveal untreated sewage, including human waste, wet wipes and condoms,was released into waterways for more than three million hours last year. Sewage discharged into rivers 400,000 times Hundreds of sewage leaks detected thanks to AI Thames sewage spill data to be shared Panorama gathered detailed data from 10 water companies in England and Wales through environmental information requests. They were each asked for information on a handful of sewage works. The data suggests seven of the 10 companies had treatment works that were breaching their permits by dumping sewage before they were treating the specified volumes. One of the worst offenders was the not-for-profit company, Welsh Water. The data shows three of its treatment works were in breach of their permits. Its Aberbaiden plant illegally dumped untreated sewage into the River Usk on 12 consecutive days in December. The Usk is supposed to be a protected river, as it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. Welsh Water's Aberbaiden plant illegally dumped untreated sewage into the River Usk on 12 consecutive days last December Angela Jones, who swims in the river every day, was shocked by the programme's findings: ""I know so many people who swim up that area, you know. It's just appalling, absolutely appalling. ""We can see clearly that they are releasing sewage into the water when they're not allowed to."" Open water swimmers, kayakers, paddlers and dog walkers have been asked to avoid contact with the water during and after sewage spills. The Rivers Trust, an organisation which campaigns to protect rivers in England and Wales, has compiled a map of wherewater companies release treated sewage and overflows of untreated sewage into rivers.,external It advises people not to enter the water immediately downstream of where treated sewage is released, and to avoid the overflow areas, especially after wet weather. This video can not be played Swim England urges anyone wanting to take up the practice to follow safety guidelines Panorama also discovered Welsh Water has been using a sewage overflow pipe on the River Usk that doesn't have a permit. The company has been illegally dumping untreated sewage through the pipe, sometimes on several occasions a day. Welsh Water told the programme it hoped to have a permit for the overflow pipe by July and it doesn't accept its sites are operating illegally. The company said it works closely with regulators and works hard to comply with all environmental regulations. ""We continue to invest significantly in our network so that we minimise the impact of our activities on the environment. However, these solutions and processes can sometimes take many years to resolve in order to fully investigate, design solutions, and secure funding."" Additional data about an eleventh water company, Thames Water, was shared with the programme by the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution. It showed the company's giant Mogden treatment works in south-west London has been illegally dumping billions of litres of untreated sewage. The data revealed Mogden - which deals with waste from more than two million people in the city - breached its permit on 43 days last year. Another Thames Water site, Stanton Harcourt in Oxfordshire, dumped sewage almost continuously for three consecutive months at the start of last year. Thames Water said the sewage is partially treated because it is screened and settled in storage tanks. It said a small number of its sewage works have struggled following periods of heavy rainfall and it is investing heavily to improve the sites. ""Putting untreated sewage into rivers is unacceptable to us, to our customers and to the environment, even when legally permitted,"" the company said. ""We absolutely want to go further, invest more, and play our part in helping the environment to thrive."" Yorkshire Water failed to report sewage spills into the River Wharfe to the Environment Agency, Panorama found Panorama also investigated the Wetherby treatment works run by Yorkshire Water. Footage shot by local campaigner Mark Barrow shows the works dumped untreated sewage into the River Wharfe on several occasions last year. But the programme found Yorkshire Water failed to report any of these spills to the Environment Agency. Its annual filing showed no sewage dumping at all at Wetherby. Yorkshire Water said: ""We have not misled the Environment Agency, this is a single data anomaly within a very large set of data and we will certainly investigate what has happened here. There is a process for correcting submitted data with the Environment Agency and if it is found that there has been an unreported discharge we will report this in due course.""

"The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. In separate statements, Prince William described him as an ""extraordinary man"", while Prince Harry said he was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". ""I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,"" Prince William added. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99. It comes as parliaments across the UKwere recalled to remember the duke. Prince Philip: What are the plans for his funeral? How Prince Harry can attend the funeral ""My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,"" Prince William said in a statement. ""I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days. ""I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. ""I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!"" He added that he and his wife, Catherine, would ""continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead"". Kensington Palace shared a photograph of Prince George with his great-grandfather Philip, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, alongside the message from William Paying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: ""He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next. ""He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. ""But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."" By Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent He walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love. Harry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort. William writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together. Both men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. Once more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out. Prince Harry described Prince Philip as ""a rock"" for the Queen ""with unparalleled devotion"". ""While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'"" he said. ""So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself."" Prince Harry signed off his message with the words ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", meaning ""By Sea, By Land"" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General. Philip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US. Prince Harry and Prince Philip were both Captain General of the Royal Marines Meanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had ""touched the lives of millions"", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes. ""By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life ""shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a ""true partnership"". In the Welsh Senedd,First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a ""remarkable"" lifeand had championed a ""broad diversity"" of causes in Wales. And in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a ""true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" by the Royal Family to ""assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland"", which should be recognised. In the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a ""gigantic contribution"" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood. This video can not be played ""A huge void in her life"": Prince Andrew describes the Queen's feelings of loss A ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April. His children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. It will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to facesince the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. On Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the ""shared grief"" over the death of Prince Philipis an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family. Over the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as ""having left a huge void in her life"". by Duncan Kennedy, BBC News Windsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown. At the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse. Scaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world. Police have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance. The paper plans of countless committees across endless decades are coming to a melancholy fruition, to give His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, a fitting send-off.

"Baroness Williams, pictured here in 2016, was a former education secretary Veteran politician and Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Shirley Williams has died at the age of 90, the party has announced. She was hailed as a ""Liberal lion and a true trailblazer"" by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey. Originally a Labour MP, she was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party to found the Social Democratic Party. She was a leading member of the 1970s Labour government and one of the first women cabinet ministers. She later went on to support the SDP's merger with the Liberal Party, which led to the creation of the Liberal Democrats in the late 1980s. Obituary: Shirley Williams Who were the Social Democratic Party? Her career in politics spanned more than 50 years, after she first entered Parliament as the Labour MP for Hitchin in 1964. She retired from political life in 2016, after leading the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords. This video can not be played The late Shirley Williams is described as a âliberal lionâ by the current Lib Dem leader. The Lib Dems said she died peacefully in the early hours of Monday. Sir Ed said she had been an ""inspiration to millions,"" and news of her death was ""heartbreaking for me and for our whole Liberal Democrat family"". ""Political life will be poorer without her intellect, her wisdom and her generosity,"" he added. ""Shirley had a limitless empathy only too rare in politics today; she connected with people, cared about their lives and saw politics as a crucial tool to change lives for the better."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson described her as ""a kind and thoughtful member of the once radical centre left"". ""Even when we disagreed - as we often did - she had the gift of sounding so completely reasonable at all times. ""I spent many happy hours sparring with her on Question Time. She will be much missed."" Baroness Williams quit Labour in 1981, after becoming dismayed at its drift to the left Baroness Williams served in several ministerial roles under the premiership of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, before landing her first cabinet job in 1974 as the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection. When Wilson resigned as Labour leader in 1976 his successor, Jim Callaghan, made her Secretary of State for Education and Science. She lost her seat in the 1979 election when Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher came to power following the so-called Winter of Discontent. After this, she found herself increasingly out of step with the Labour Party on issues including defence and her support for the UK's membership of the European Union. She later quit the party in 1981 - and with leading Labour lights Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen formed the ""Gang of Four"" which founded the Social Democratic Party. Shirley Williams with the ""Gang of Four"" in 1981 With growing support, the SDP went on to secure 25% of the vote at the 1983 general election, as part of an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party. This only delivered 23 MPs for the fledgling alliance, but then-Labour leader Michael Foot blamed it for reducing his party's share of the vote and giving Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives another term in government. The Alliance fought the 1987 election, but failed to boost its representation in the Commons - with almost 23% of the vote amounting to just 22 MPs. Lord Steel, who led the Liberal Party during the Alliance, said Baroness Williams was a ""key figure"" in helping it come close to breaking the two-party mould in British politics. ""She was a very, very popular person - much more popular than any of the rest of us,"" he told BBC News. He added that she was a ""tremendous public inspirer and communicator, and a real humanitarian"". It was decided in 1988 that the SDP and the Liberal Party should merge, leading to the formation of the Liberal Democrats in October 1989. Baroness Williams in 2013 with then-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg Sir Nick Clegg, who stood down as Lib Dem leader after the 2015 election, said he would ""forever be grateful for the support, candid advice and generosity"" Baroness Williams showed him during his time in charge of the party. ""Her warmth, commitment to progressive ideals and, above all, her wisdom were a constant inspiration down the years to so many,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Baroness Williams had been ""widely respected across politics and was a tireless champion for the causes she believed in"". Who were the Social Democratic Party?

Shoppers flocked to the High Street, with long queues seen outside some retailers. Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to ""behave responsibly"". Northern Ireland's ""stay-at-home"" order is endingand some rules are being easedin ScotlandandWales. The PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday.

This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. Scott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said thepub had received 5,000 bookings over the next monthfor his new outside eating and drinking area. Mr Westlake said: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least.""

""I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,"" he said. Meanwhile, a town inLincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade. Several hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day. Lewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: ""We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant."" Several hospitality businesses in Louth are taking part in the scheme The prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. However, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have ahaircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons. The PM had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers Marika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday. Kelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic ""first cut"" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks.

In Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays. After a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. Non-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed.

So will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. But this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. Will customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? Only two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. The government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish. Hospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. Demand may vary by sector. Hairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. It is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. In a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are ""a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom"". ""I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,"" he added. ""I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."" Ultimate Fitness Gym in Wallsend, north-east England, was among the businesses to have reopened early on Monday Synchronised swimmers are able to return to indoor pools, which can reopen, such as this one at Clissold Leisure Centre, north London The rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January.

"Pubs are not expected to reopen in Scotland until 26 April Hospitality and tourism leaders have criticised the Covid restrictions which prevent the sectors' reopening. They were speaking asEngland's lockdown rules eased further, with pub gardens and restaurants among the places able to reopen. Waiting two weeks before reopening will come at a cost to Scotland's economy of Â£20 million, they warned. Representatives of the sectors agreed that public health had to be a priority but insisted they were safe to reopen. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has linked the decision to ""significantly"" ease restrictions to the rollout of the Covid vaccine. With everyone in all nine priority groups expected to have received their first jab by mid-April, she said the government would have ""confidence"" to begin opening up hospitality from 26 April. Be responsible, says PM as rules ease across UK Pupils begin full time return to secondary schools One publican in Dumfries and Galloway said he expected people would travel to England to visit hospitality venues there. It is currently against the law to travel across the border except foressential reasons.,external Stephen Montgomery, who owns the Townhead Hotel in Lockerbie and is a spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said he would ""love to be opening up at the same time as our colleagues down south"". ""We're going to be seeing people jump the border... for that long awaited pint of cold beer while we still remain closed,"" he toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""Scotland's always been behind in the way we've been operating for the last year. So it's going to be no different this time. ""We are at a disadvantage."" Beer gardens have reopened south of the border He also said the rules were not being made clear far enough in advance. On the next review date of 20 April, it will be decided if hospitality venues are allowed to open up inside from 26 April, and what the restrictions will be. ""We haven't got the regulations and we're less than two weeks to opening here,"" Mr Montgomery said. ""We've had this all year where our guidance has been last minute, and that cannot go on. ""Business operators and suppliers... need advance warning."" Mr Montgomery runs The Townhead Hotel in Lockerbie Fiona Campbell, the chief executive of the Association of Scotland's Self Caterers, said she was concerned that uncertainty about the rules would lead to prospective customers taking their business elsewhere. ""It's really difficult to deal with... seeing people literally across the border opening up. Our colleagues down south have been able to but we're not able to,"" she said. She added that research commissioned by the sector last year suggested that opening two weeks late represented a Â£20m loss to the Scottish economy. Ms Campbell acknowledged that public health had to be protected, but said some businesses - including self-catering accommodation - could safely reopen. She added that a lack of clarity over when certain restrictions - like how many households could share self-catering accommodation - were difficult to explain to prospective customers. Scotland's lockdown is expected to ease further from 26 April, with the Scottish government expected to give more details on how this will happen in the weeks ahead. This will bring a return to the ""levels"" system of local restrictions, with the whole country in level three ""if the data allows"". What Covid rules are changing, and when? Cafes, pubs and restaurants are expected to be allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (although no alcohol will be permitted) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Shops and gyms are also due to open, and more people will be allowed to meet up outdoors. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"This video can not be played Stores in Wales reopen to queues of eager shoppers Shoppers have been eagerly queuing in Wales' high streets as the next phase of easing the coronavirus lockdown begins. Covid rules have been relaxed to allownon-essential retail and close-contact services to resume and travel to other parts of the UK. School pupils and post-16 students are returning to classes and university students will see a mix of face-to-face and online lessons. Driving lessonsare also resuming. Queues formed outside fashion stores TK Maxx and Primark in Cardiff city centre and elsewhere, from 07:00 BST. Retail consultants Springboard said that while thousands hit high streets across Wales, footfall was 16% lower than on the same date in 2019, before the pandemic hit. Queues formed early with many shops in Wales reopening for the first time since December Covid case rateshave fallen substantially in Wales since January and now stand at 17.6 per 100,000 people. And49% of the population has been vaccinated with a first jab, according to data published by Public Health Wales on Sunday. Queue of shoppers outside TK Maxx in Cardiff on Monday morning ""We haven't been able to do any shopping for the kids since actually December,"" said one man, queuing outside St David's shopping centre in Cardiff. Another said it was ""good to see everyone out supporting the local shops"". ""We got some things to take back from Christmas,"" she added. A third said she was ""absolutely thrilled"" that all shops could reopen and she was looking for ""bargains"". ""It's getting back to normality and, hopefully, people getting back to what they used to do,"" she said. James Waugh, director at St David's, said: ""We're following government guidelines, we hope people are going to be kind, maintain social distancing, we've got capacity management, so there may be occasions where we have to ask people to queue outside, but we're expecting steady progress and people to come back."" With the lockdown easing for many businesses for the first time since December, shoppers have been asked to stay safe and respect staff,after a rise in reports of abuse. Hannah Burson, who owns a shop in Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said the past year had been ""awful"", having to close and reopen the business and furlough most of her 10 staff. ""We did have a busy summer, which was great but it was short-lived,"" she said. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? She branched out into online sales, but added ""it isn't exactly keeping the business going"". ""It's kept people noticing us and remembering that we're here and that we will be reopening. But in terms of sales, nothing like when we're open. This video can not be played Non-essential shops in Wales are opening for the first time since December With bills mounting and a government loan to repay, she is hoping to capitalise on tourism from England. ""I really hope we'll have a mad rush, it'll be great. We really need to sell some stock so we're hoping it will be busy yet safe,"" she said. Many retailers with bricks and mortar stores have been in crisis since before the pandemic. Increased online shopping, high costs of rent and rates and rising wage bills have put pressure on those companies that have a heavy presence on high streets. Covid-19 has added to their woes with stores being closed for months at a time often during traditionally peak trading periods. Some of the biggest names in the industry have faced serious challenges, including John Lewis, Topshop, House of Fraser and Peacocks. Debenhams is reopening - but only for a closing down sale, bringing an end to more than 200 years of trading on the high street. The brand will continue online. The latest British Retail Consortium figures show Wales had the sharpest decline in footfall of any UK nation or region compared with 2019. Before the pandemic, 23,000 jobs were lost in Welsh retail and wholesale between 2009 and 2019. The restrictions put in place due to Covid have magnified the challenges ahead for an industry that was already facing significant transformation. Aneeka Hearn says customers are really keen to get back through the doors Aneeka Hearn, sales manager at a jewellers in Swansea, said: ""People are getting married still, engaged, people are still having birthdays and special occasions and a lot of people haven't been able to go on their cruises and holidays, so they want to spend their money on something nice to treat themselves and have something to look forward to."" There is some concern there could be a reluctance in shoppers to return to Wales' high streets, after a year of buying things online. In the Vale of Glamorgan, the Shop Local Penarth campaign is encouraging residents to support their local traders, who have faced tough times. A new virtual marketplace for the town's independent shops and businesses has been launched to give shoppers the opportunity to buy from their favourite local traders online in one place. Angelina Hall says consumer habits changed ""rapidly"" in the past year Chair of the Penarth Business Group, Angelina Hall, said: ""The increase of online shopping has accelerated, and our high streets need to understand that a new blended way of shopping is now being demanded."" Anna Knight, who owns a lifestyle and homeware shop in Cardiff, said that after a ""really difficult three months"" she was confident that shoppers would come back. ""Our shop has always been about the experience... you want to browse around,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Joy"" as beauty salons reopen after lockdown Sarah Bruton, who runs Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly, said it was an ""emotional day"" being able to see clients for beauty treatments for the first time in months. ""Every stage has been a battle in terms of the local lockdown, we couldn't bring our clients from outside the local area - that had a huge impact, and campaigning for funding for the beauty industry, which hasn't always been in place,"" she said. ""So it's really just being here today is such a huge relief."" Nicole Gooding, salon manager at Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty, Cardiff, said changes had been made to adhere to Covid rules and ""make sure everyone is as safe as possible"". ""I'm just so excited to catch up with everyone... just to see all our lovely clients' faces again,"" she said. Shoppers queue outside Debenhams in Cardiff for its closing down sale Nick Ireland, divisional officer of shop workers' union Usdaw, said those who have been furloughed are looking forward to being back at work and ""to get a sense of normality and certainty in their lives"". But he reminded customers: ""We're still in a pandemic. It's about shopping safely, keep that 2m distance, wear a face covering, make sure you wash your hands, pay with a card if you can. ""Be polite to shop workers. You're in somebody's workplace, treat them as you would expect to be treated in your own workplace and be patient."" A canal hire company on the Wales-England border said the next few months would be very demanding With people allowed to travel over the border into England, many will be able to see friends of family outside after months of being unable to see them. Carl Cowlinshaw, who runs a narrowboat hire company which has about 120 boats in England and Wales, said it had been a ""very busy day"". Mr Cowlinshaw said many people wanted to travel to enjoy ""some of the Welsh wonders"" from the Llangollen canal, but people were still being cautious. ""They'll be zipping all over the place from today,"" he said. ""Schools are about keeping pupils safe,"" said head teacher Huw Powell Monday sees a full return to schools and further education and university campuses will be able to provided blended face-to-face and online learning for students, according to Welsh governmentCovid regulations,external. Huw Powell, headteacher of Mary Immaculate High School in Cardiff, said the plan was to ""maintain some kind of normality"". ""Schools are about keeping pupils safe,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""Education is at the heart of what we do, and that has got to continue, and that social opportunities come under that umbrella of mental health - this is something that we have focused on quite strongly."" The Welsh Conservatives have previously accused the Welsh government of a U-turn over the reopening of non-essential shops. Their leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said a decision to allow shops to open on the same day as England could have been made earlier. He said this had caused ""frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has described a ""lack of a level playing field for small non-essential retail"" during the pandemic. He accused the Welsh government of ""badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them"". Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, had accused the Welsh government of ""throwing many small shops and high streets under a bus"". ""The Welsh Labour government has treated the High Street with complete contempt,"" she said. The Welsh government defended its plan for reopening retail, saying: ""We recognise everyone wants certainty to be able to plan for the future and that businesses want to be open and trading. That's why the first minister has set out a plan to bring Wales out of alert level four lockdown. ""We cannot move directly and fully into alert level three in one step,"" a spokesperson said.

"The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. In separate statements, Prince William described him as an ""extraordinary man"", while Prince Harry said he was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". ""I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,"" Prince William added. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99. It comes as parliaments across the UKwere recalled to remember the duke. Prince Philip: What are the plans for his funeral? How Prince Harry can attend the funeral ""My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,"" Prince William said in a statement. ""I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days. ""I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. ""I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!"" He added that he and his wife, Catherine, would ""continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead"". Kensington Palace shared a photograph of Prince George with his great-grandfather Philip, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, alongside the message from William Paying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: ""He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next. ""He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. ""But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."" By Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent He walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love. Harry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort. William writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together. Both men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. Once more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out. Prince Harry described Prince Philip as ""a rock"" for the Queen ""with unparalleled devotion"". ""While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'"" he said. ""So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself."" Prince Harry signed off his message with the words ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", meaning ""By Sea, By Land"" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General. Philip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US. Prince Harry and Prince Philip were both Captain General of the Royal Marines Meanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had ""touched the lives of millions"", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes. ""By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life ""shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a ""true partnership"". In the Welsh Senedd,First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a ""remarkable"" lifeand had championed a ""broad diversity"" of causes in Wales. And in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a ""true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" by the Royal Family to ""assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland"", which should be recognised. In the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a ""gigantic contribution"" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood. This video can not be played ""A huge void in her life"": Prince Andrew describes the Queen's feelings of loss A ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April. His children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. It will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to facesince the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. On Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the ""shared grief"" over the death of Prince Philipis an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family. Over the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as ""having left a huge void in her life"". by Duncan Kennedy, BBC News Windsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown. At the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse. Scaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world. Police have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance. The paper plans of countless committees across endless decades are coming to a melancholy fruition, to give His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, a fitting send-off.

"A cheap drug, commonly used to treat asthma, can help people at home recover more quickly from Covid-19, a UK trial has found. Two puffs of budesonide twice a day could benefit many over-50s with early symptoms around the world, said the University of Oxford research team. There are also early signs the drug could reduce hospital admissions. The NHS says it can nowbe prescribed by GPs to treat Covid on a case-by-case basis,external. At present, there are few options for treating people with Covid who are not in hospital, apart from paracetamol. This widely-available asthma drug works in the lungs, where coronavirus can do serious damage, and could improve the recovery of at-risk patients who are unwell with Covid at home. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he was ""delighted"" by the trial results so far and added that GPs could prescribe it after ""a shared decision conversation"" with patients. Prof Mona Bafadhel, a respiratory doctor who was involved in the Oxford-led Principle trial, said the results were ""something we should be excited about"". ""We are helping the patient as much as possible, as early as possible - in the community,"" she said. Early in the pandemic, asthma patients were under-represented in severely-ill hospital patients with Covid - and the drugs they took to treat their condition were thought to be the reason. The trial,externalinvolved more than 1,700 people at high risk of becoming severely ill with Covid-19 - all aged over 50, either with an underlying health condition or aged over 65 with no health problems. An inhaler similar to the one used in the budesonide trial to treat Covid in at-risk patients at home During the first two weeks of experiencing symptoms at home, 751 were given an inhaler containing budesonide to use twice a day. This group recovered from Covid on average three days sooner than another group given normal care, which is advice to rest and take paracetamol, the trial data showed. And a third of those taking inhaled budesonide recovered within the first 14 days of using it, compared to less than a quarter of those in the other group. Covid blood protein offers clues for treatments Two more life-saving Covid drugs discovered What are the other ways we could treat coronavirus? There were also early signs that slightly fewer people on the drug were admitted to hospital with Covid (8.5% compared to 10.3%) - but more data is needed before this, or any reduction in deaths from Covid, can be confirmed, the researchers said. These are interim results from the trial up to the end of March, which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Final results from the trial, which are likely to include more data, are expected at the end of April. Budesonide, like other coricosteroids which are breathed into the lungs using an inhaler, ""work at the site of the virus where it is likely to be causing the biggest effect and is widely known to reduce inflammation"", Prof Bafadhel said. Lab tests suggest the drug also reduces viral replication of the virus. Associate Prof Gail Hayward, a GP and investigator on the trial, said patients at higher risk could be offered the inhaler as part of their treatment on the NHS. One inhaler is thought to cost about Â£14. ""We now have the evidence to treat my patients at home,"" she said. A smaller, earlier-stage trial on the drug in February also reported promising results. The Oxford-led Principle trial is the latest UK trial to release positive results in the search for Covid treatments. Last year,a steroid called dexamethasone was found to save livesamong the most seriously-ill patients in hospital anda number of other drugs and treatments have also shown promise.

Shoppers have been out in force as High Street stores reopened in England and Wales. Pub gardens and marquees have been filled with friends and family raising a glass to their new-found freedom while snow fell and sun shined across a chilly England. There have been haircuts, nail extensions, gym sessions, swims and car washes along with rollercoaster rides and trips to the zoo. These updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Martha Buckley, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus news, have a good evening. Surge testing is being rolled out in parts of Wandsworth and Lambeth in South London, after cases of the South Africa variant were found. All identified cases are
     isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been
     traced and asked to isolate. Everyone aged 11 and over who lives or works in, or travels through the two London boroughs is being ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 PCR test, whether they are
showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms
should book a free test online or by phone so they can get tested at a testing
site or have a testing kit sent to them at home. Those without symptoms should
visit their local authority website for more information. NHS Test and Trace said it was the largest
     surge testing operation to date. As we move into the evening on the first night that pubs have been open in England for months, police say they have extra patrols to make sure everyone sticks to coronavirus restrictions. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metâs lead for Covid-19 response, says:âThe Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyoneâs safety and to disrupt any criminal activity. She says the overwhelming majority of people will act responsibly but ""where we need to take action against those who dangerously flout the rules we will do"". âBusinesses have been hit hard by this pandemic but it is important everyone plays their part in driving down the infection rate further. ""Our joint patrols with councils will continue and if we see unnecessary risks being taken, we will engage, explain the regulations and if needed take action.â Queues formed outside shops across England on the first day they opened their doors in more than three months.

As many return to their local pub for the first time in months, one landlord says he's had 5,000 bookings for his outdoor seating area.

""People are fed up with lockdown and keen to get back to normal,"" she says. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lockdown easing is 'lifting everyone's spirits' Some shops in England and Wales will be keeping their doors open later than usual tonight, to allow for more people to visit safely. Rules introduced by the government for the easing of lockdown measures let them open until 22:00 six days a week. They can also open from 07:00. The idea is that businesses can start to recover and customers have more time to shop and can avoid peak times. Those staying open late tonight include shopping centres such as Westfield in Stratford, London, and Sheffield's Meadowhall complex. Oxford Street store Selfridges is also open late as are chain stores like Primark. And pubs and restaurants offering outdoor seating no longer have a 22:00 curfew, meaning customers can stay for longer - no doubt there will be a few sore heads come Tuesday morning. Shoppers returned to London's Oxford Street UK High Street footfall was down 24.2% today against a comparable day in April 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures show. The data is from the retail consultancy Springboard up to 17:00 BST after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Stores remain shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data showed visits to retail parks were up 1.7%, while shopping centres were down 16.7%. For all shopping destinations in the UK footfall was down 16.2%.And there was regional variation, with Central London down 55%, coastal towns down 16% and market towns down 3.5%. The South East and South West of England saw declines of 4.8% and 7.8% respectively. While the East Midlands saw an 8% decline. Here's our report from High Streets around England and Wales as shops opened for the first time in more than three months. Thanks for joining us today, on the day lockdown restrictions have eased further in England and Wales. Here are some of the main headlines of the day. A holiday home that hosted stays during lockdown has been forced to close and its owner and guests have been fined. Castle House in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, has flouted Covid-19 laws by staying open since the start of January, police say. Owner Scott Richardson was fined Â£7,000 and 62 visitors also were given fixed penalty notices. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court ordered Mr Richardson to close the let until 20 June. Insp Dave Parker, from Derbyshire Police, says: ""The nearly 100 complaints received by the force over a relatively short period of time shows just how disruptive, as well as dangerous, this holiday let has been."" Read more on this storyhereand the rules on holidays in the UK arehere. We've been answering your questions as lockdown eases in England and Wales. Now that outdoor hospitality has reopened, Michael from Chichester in West Sussex wanted to know: ""Can Covid-19 be transmitted through someone's exhaled cigarette smoke/vaping?"" It is possible to become infected by breathing in somebody elseâs second-hand smoke or exhaled vapour - both of which can transport coronavirus particles on microscopic droplets of water vapour exhaled from the lungs. In fact, the risk could even be heightened â with some scientists believing the virus might travel considerably further this way than when exhaled in normal breath. However, a study found that the increased risk of virus transmission for the majority of vapers was much less than the increased risk from talking or coughing. Government guidance for smokers,externalsays it's difficult to gauge the risk to individuals - and, in the absence of specific evidence, recommends that vapers err on the side of caution and avoid breathing out clouds of vapour in the presence of others.

One of Britain's leading imams has urged Muslim households to resist the urge to mix as the month of Ramadan begins and insists that getting a vaccine would not break the fast. Qari Asim is senior imam of the Makkah Masjid, in Leeds, and chairman of Mosques & Imams National Advisory Board (Minab). He says: ""The message from Muslim religious leadership is that one should not miss the opportunity to take the vaccine when they are invited to do so."" Imam Asim told the PA news agency ""the tide has turned"" for vaccine hesitancy. He said: ""More and more people from black and Asian ethnic minorities, including Muslims, are now taking up the vaccine.

The number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France has increased by 78 to a new 2021 record of 5,916. The French health ministry also reported 385 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. There had been 176 on Sunday. France has recorded 8,536 new cases, taking the total to 5,067,216. A nightclub in Omsk, Russia, in February Confusion and complacency in addressing Covid-19 means it is ""a long way"" from over, says the head of the World Health Organization. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said on Monday, in comments reported by Reuters news agency, that the situation can be brought under control in months if proven public health measures are adopted. ""We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,"" Tedros says. ""But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying â and it's totally avoidable. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."" He adds transmission is being driven by ""confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures"". In some countries, restaurants and nightclubs are full, with few people taking precautions, he says. ""Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19,"" Tedros says. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO team leader on Covid-19, adds it is a ""critical point in the pandemic"", with the trajectory ""growing for the seventh week in a row"". By Oliver Smith, BBC News Newquay Zoo is opening its doors for the first time in five months. The keepers have been wearing different coloured jackets around the zoo to get
the animals used to seeing lots of different people again. Throughout lockdown, theyâve had to take care of the animals and
staff, with no money coming in at the gates. They canât wait to get people
through the doors. Part of a group of three zoos, its sister site in Torquay
closed down last year, and Newquay came close to it too.  Dave Folland says it's a hugely important day for Newquay Zoo ""Itâs a hugely important day for us,"" says Dave Folland, the zooâs operations manager. ""All the way through, weâve had people in, weâve had the animals to look after, and weâve had no income to do that, so having our guests back in today and having them here enjoying the zoo, as well as bringing in an income so that we can move forward again as a business, is fantastic."" Before... The prime minister has wasted no time in getting his sometimes unruly hair under control as hairdressers reopen in England. Boris Johnson is famous for his shock of blond hair but the wind played havoc with his overgrown locks on a trip to Truro last week. But, as he emerged from Downing Street earlier his hair looked noticeably shorter. Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had his hair trimmed this morning before joining MPs in Parliament to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Johnson had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers but he postponed his plans for a pint in the wake of Prince Philip's death on Friday. After... Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst More than 167 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have now been delivered in China, making it the country with the second largest number of vaccinations in the world - behind the US on 187 million. China's total would equate to about 12% of its population but last week the official Peopleâs Daily signalled that the majority of vaccine recipients had also received second doses, and that statistically, the percentage of the population fully vaccinatedwas still in the single digits,external. China says it needs 70-80% of its population vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity and has ambitious plans to vaccinate 40% of the population by the end of June. But it is struggling to see uptake. On average, some three to four million vaccine doses are being administered per day, even though national newspaper Global Times says China hascapability to administer 10 million shots daily,external. This is partly due to China being slow to include the elderly in its vaccination programme. A significant proportion of Chinaâs population are over 60, owing to decades of birth controls under the now-abolished one-child policy. Over-60s have only just begun receiving vaccines, and there is still caution over widespread rolloutdue to there being insufficient data on how this demographic will respond in clinical trials,external. But there are also more general, human nature concerns about vaccine safety. Last week, official broadcaster CCTV tried to dispel fears about getting vaccinated, noting there wereconcerns among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs vaccines,external. It also noted there was a general resistance to getting vaccinated due to China having its Covid-19 situation largely under control andmany not feeling it was ""necessary"",external. The latest coronavirus statistics have been published and they show a further 3,568 positive cases recorded in the UK. There have also been another 13 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. There have been another 69,223 first doses of coronavirus vaccine given and 189,665 further second doses.  Publicans have welcomed being able to reopen under today's stage of lockdown easing but are warning the industry is on its knees. Pubs in England can serve outdoors but need to fully open without restrictions as soon as possible, they say. ""No pub is expecting to profit from reopening outdoors, and many will make a loss,"" says Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. Some 2,500 pubs are estimated to have closed for good in 2020. ""Pubs are the heart of our communities and we've all missed them. If they are to survive the long-term it's imperative they fully recover,"" says McClarkin. Pubs are expecting to sell about 15 million pints in the first week of reopening - about a quarter of what they would normally sell in an April week. Just two out of five pubs are reopening on Monday, the association says. Wales has taken another step out of lockdown, with travel restrictions further relaxed from today. But what does this mean? Well, one main change is that the border between England and Wales has reopened, with people allowed to travel in either direction. The rules actually state you are allowed to leave Wales to travel to ""other parts of the UK and the Common Travel Area"" (which covers the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands). But currently only essential travel is allowed into Scotland and Northern Ireland - so you can only go to those countries if you have a valid reason such as work, education or childcare.

Lewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: ""We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant."" Several hospitality businesses in Louth are taking part in the scheme The prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. However, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have ahaircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons. The PM had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers Marika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday. Kelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic ""first cut"" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks. Shoppers rushed back to the High Street,as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours. 'Very excited' customers queue for reopened shops 'Everyone's raring to get back to the gym' In pictures: Shoppers and gym-goers enjoy lockdown easing Another business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton. Co-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had ""been such a long time coming"", saying: ""Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy."" This video can not be played Long queues were not going to put shoppers off from visiting their favourite High Street retailers The rule changes in England from Monday include: All shops can reopen Hairdressers, beauty salons and other close-contact services can open Restaurants and pubs are allowed to serve food and alcohol to customers sitting outdoors Gyms, spas, zoos, theme parks, libraries and community centres can all open Members of the same household can take a holiday in England in self-contained accommodation Non-essential journeys between England and Wales are allowed Up to 15 people can attend weddings and 30 can attend funerals Children can attend any indoor children's activity Care home visitors will increase to two per resident Driving lessons can resume, with tests restarting on 22 April But the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% oflicensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service. People flocked to salons after months without a haircut Thrillseekers have been enjoying the rides at Thorpe Park in Surrey In Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. Thestay-at-home message has been liftedand up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden. Queues at Primark as stores to stay open to 10pm What are the rules when I go to the pub or a restaurant? In Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays. After a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. Non-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed. This video can not be played Shopper in Liverpool: ""It means life has come back to normal again"" Families descended on London Zoo, which has also been closed for months Shoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. So will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. But this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. Will customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? Only two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. The government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish. Hospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. Demand may vary by sector. Hairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. It is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. In a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are ""a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom"". ""I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,"" he added. ""I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."" Ultimate Fitness Gym in Wallsend, north-east England, was among the businesses to have reopened early on Monday Synchronised swimmers are able to return to indoor pools, which can reopen, such as this one at Clissold Leisure Centre, north London The rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January. There is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. Shoppers told 'stay safe' as Welsh stores reopen Pupils begin full time return to secondary schools NI's 'stay home' order lifted as restrictions ease The next significant date is 17 May, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors.

"A cheap drug, commonly used to treat asthma, can help people at home recover more quickly from Covid-19, a UK trial has found. Two puffs of budesonide twice a day could benefit many over-50s with early symptoms around the world, said the University of Oxford research team. There are also early signs the drug could reduce hospital admissions. The NHS says it can nowbe prescribed by GPs to treat Covid on a case-by-case basis,external. At present, there are few options for treating people with Covid who are not in hospital, apart from paracetamol. This widely-available asthma drug works in the lungs, where coronavirus can do serious damage, and could improve the recovery of at-risk patients who are unwell with Covid at home. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he was ""delighted"" by the trial results so far and added that GPs could prescribe it after ""a shared decision conversation"" with patients. Prof Mona Bafadhel, a respiratory doctor who was involved in the Oxford-led Principle trial, said the results were ""something we should be excited about"". ""We are helping the patient as much as possible, as early as possible - in the community,"" she said. Early in the pandemic, asthma patients were under-represented in severely-ill hospital patients with Covid - and the drugs they took to treat their condition were thought to be the reason. The trial,externalinvolved more than 1,700 people at high risk of becoming severely ill with Covid-19 - all aged over 50, either with an underlying health condition or aged over 65 with no health problems. An inhaler similar to the one used in the budesonide trial to treat Covid in at-risk patients at home During the first two weeks of experiencing symptoms at home, 751 were given an inhaler containing budesonide to use twice a day. This group recovered from Covid on average three days sooner than another group given normal care, which is advice to rest and take paracetamol, the trial data showed. And a third of those taking inhaled budesonide recovered within the first 14 days of using it, compared to less than a quarter of those in the other group. Covid blood protein offers clues for treatments Two more life-saving Covid drugs discovered What are the other ways we could treat coronavirus? There were also early signs that slightly fewer people on the drug were admitted to hospital with Covid (8.5% compared to 10.3%) - but more data is needed before this, or any reduction in deaths from Covid, can be confirmed, the researchers said. These are interim results from the trial up to the end of March, which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Final results from the trial, which are likely to include more data, are expected at the end of April. Budesonide, like other coricosteroids which are breathed into the lungs using an inhaler, ""work at the site of the virus where it is likely to be causing the biggest effect and is widely known to reduce inflammation"", Prof Bafadhel said. Lab tests suggest the drug also reduces viral replication of the virus. Associate Prof Gail Hayward, a GP and investigator on the trial, said patients at higher risk could be offered the inhaler as part of their treatment on the NHS. One inhaler is thought to cost about Â£14. ""We now have the evidence to treat my patients at home,"" she said. A smaller, earlier-stage trial on the drug in February also reported promising results. The Oxford-led Principle trial is the latest UK trial to release positive results in the search for Covid treatments. Last year,a steroid called dexamethasone was found to save livesamong the most seriously-ill patients in hospital anda number of other drugs and treatments have also shown promise. Two more life-saving Covid drugs discovered Which treatments work best against Covid?

"Makers of the NHS Covid-19 app had planned to ask infected users to share their check-in histories An update to England and Wales's contact tracing app has been blocked for breaking the terms of an agreement made with Apple and Google. The plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others. The update had beentimed to coincide with the relaxation of lockdown rules. But the two firms had explicitly banned such a function from the start. Under the terms that all health authorities signed up to in order to use Apple and Google's privacy-centric contact-tracing tech, they had to agree not to collect any location data via the software. As a result, Apple and Google refused to make the update available for download from their app stores last week, and have instead kept the old version live. When questioned, the Department of Health declined to discuss how this misstep had occurred. Scotland has avoided this pitfall because it released a separate product - Check In Scotland - to share venue histories, rather than trying to build the functionality into its Protect Scotland contact-tracing app. The Check In Scotland app was launched on 18 December NHS Covid-19's users have long been able to scan a QR code when entering a shop, restaurant or other venue to log within the app the fact that they had visited. But this data has never been accessible to others. Instead, it has only come into use if local authorities have identified a location as being a virus hotspot by other means, and flagged the fact to a central database. Since each phone regularly checks the database for a match, it can alert the owner if they need to take action as a consequence, without sharing the information with others. However, this facility has rarely been used, in part because prior to the most recent lockdown, many local authorities were confused about what they were supposed to do. Before shops reopened in England and Wales on Monday, along with outdoor hospitality venues in England, the intention had been to automate the process. Pubs, restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating have been allowed to reopen This would have involved users who had tested positive being asked if they were willing to upload their logs. Depending on the thresholds set - for example, how many infected users registered having visited the same place on the same day - other app users would then have  been told to either monitor their symptoms or immediately get a test, whether they felt ill or not. TheDepartment of Health had described,externalthis as being a ""privacy-protecting"" approach. But despite being opt-in, it was still a clear breach of the terms that health chiefs had agreed to when they switched to adopting Apple and Google's contact tracing API (application programming interface) in June 2020. This was after theiroriginal effort was found to miss too many potential cases of contagion. Thetech firms' Exposure Notifications System FAQ,externalstates that apps involved must ""not share location data from the user's device with the public health authority, Apple, or Google"". England and Wales's QR barcode posters have been tweaked to have a simpler design And a separate document covering the terms and conditions in more detail says that ""a contact tracing app may not use location-based APIs... and may not collect any device information to identify the precise location of users"". Had Apple and Google made an exception for England and Wales in this case, it could have set a precedent for other countries to have sought changes of their own. The team behind the app was told not to disclose why the update had failed to be released on schedule. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told the BBC: ""The deployment of the functionality of the NHS Covid-19 app to enable users to upload their venue history has been delayed. ""This does not impact the functionality of the app and we remain in discussions with our partners to provide beneficial updates to the app which protect the public."" A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said it had nothing to add. Apple has indicated it wants to work out a solution. Just a week ago, the Department of Health seemed to think this update to the app would go through without problems. It's hard to understand why. After all, the rules for using the Apple-Google Exposure Notification System were clear -  collecting any location data was a no-no. The app team knew that when they switched to it last summer, having discovered that going it alone with their own system was just not practical. But they may have assumed that, because the sharing of locations by users was optional, the tech giants might show some flexibility. Instead, Apple and Google have insisted that rules are rules. What this underlines is that governments around the world have been forced to frame part of their response to the global pandemic according to rules set down by giant unelected corporations. At a time when the power of the tech giants is under the microscope as never before, that will leave many people feeling uncomfortable.

"Nicola Charles (pictured in 1998) was a model and actress and is now an author Former Neighbours actress Nicola Charles has claimed two of her cast mates once tried to get her deported back to the UK. Charles, who played Sarah Beaumont in the soap for two stints in the 1990s and 2010s, alleges she was targeted for ""taking a job from an Australian"". Her character was best known for having an affair with Dr Karl Kennedy. Charles made the claim in her forthcoming memoir, Soap Star, which has been previewed inThe Herald Sun,external. Fremantle Media, which produces the long-running Australian soap, has been contacted by the BBC for a comment. In her book, Charles alleges that she found a handwritten letter sent to the immigration department shortly after her six-month probation period on Neighbours ended in 1996, just as her contract was about to be extended. Charles (right) was part of a love triangle on the soap She does not name the two cast members in question. ""I did know who they were, the individuals who did it, but I thought - who goes to that length, and what have I done to be disliked that much?"" she wrote, in an excerpt publishedin Australia,externalon Monday. ""That experience coloured my relationships with everyone on the cast and crew, because I kind of felt nervous about trusting anyone after that."" She added: ""Then my immigration lawyer told me the letter complained that a British actor had been given a full-time role on the show, thus taking a job away from an Australian. ""But the show employed me as a British actor. I was written into the show,"" she explained. Charles was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. She moved to London as a teenager and then to Australia. Her autobiography is published on Friday. She also had a fictional novel published last year, titled The Witches of Toorak. Last week,two Aboriginal-Australian TV stars alleged they witnessed racist incidentswhile working on the set of Neighbours. Shareena Clanton alleged ""multiple racist traumas"" during her time on the show in an Instagram post. A day later, former Neighbours actor Meyne Wyatt said he too had experienced racism on set in a tweet. In response to Ms Clanton's allegations, Fremantle Media said it would do more to promote inclusion. ""Neighbours strives to be a platform for diversity and inclusion on-screen and off-screen,"" a spokesperson for Fremantle Media told the BBC.

"DJ Tiiny had hosted a weekly show on Capital Xtra since 2018 Radio station Capital Xtra will not face any penalties after one of its DJs was found to be asking for payments of Â£200 to play songs on his show. DJ Tiiny, who tours with Stormzy, broke the UK broadcasting code by asking for money in return for exposure on his weekly Friday night show. He was dropped by the radio stationas soon as the situation came to light. It triggered an investigation by media regulator Ofcom, which now says it ""considers the matter resolved"". The story became public in January, when the record producer J Beatz Music posted a screenshot of an email, purportedly written by DJ Tiiny. ""If you wish for [your] track to be premiered on my Friday night radio show, there would be a charge of Â£200 for one track,"" the email said.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed during a conference on rehabilitating offenders near London Bridge The mother of a Cambridge graduate killed in a terror attack in central London in 2019 has told an inquest that her son's death ""was a tragedy, but his life was a triumph"". Convicted terrorist Usman Khan stabbed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at a prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall on 29 November. He injured two others before he was shot dead by police on London Bridge. The inquest at London's Guildhall is due to last nine weeks. After a jury was sworn in, Anne Merritt said her 25-year-old son was a ""force for good in the world"" and had a ""strong moral compass"". Friends from Cambridge University, where he worked for the criminal justice charity Learning Together, said he was ""absorbingly intelligent"" and ""fiercely loyal"". Fishmongers' Hall, below London Bridge She told jurors: ""Jack Merritt was a good person. Jack was a force for good in the world, someone who made other people's lives better for knowing him. ""We are hugely proud of who Jack was and what he stood for. His death was a tragedy but his life was a triumph."" She read tributes from friends and family, who described him as a ""true visionary"", a ""very cool brother"" and a ""fiercely loyal"" friend who ""championed the underdog"". Messages of condolences were left at London Bridge after the attack Friends from Manchester University, where Mr Merritt studied, said: ""It was clear that Jack was intelligent, but when we started to study miscarriages of justice in further detail, it became clear how strongly Jack felt about criminal justice."" The family of Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, described her as someone with a ""private nature"". In a statement read by Henry Pitchers QC, the family said they chose not to provide a full portrait of the 23-year-old at the inquest. ""They believe that she would wish the focus of the coroner and the jury to be on the facts and evidence before them and for the emphasis to be on a thorough investigation as to how she came to lose her life,"" the statement continued. ""It would be her hope that no other family is devastated and heartbroken again in similar circumstances. ""It is very important to the family that Saskia's legacy should not solely be based on her work with Learning Together as she was about so much more than just that. ""She should be defined as someone who battled to improve the lives of others in several spheres and was driven to make real changes in the world."" The family statement said Ms Jones did ""incredible research in the field of sexual violence and Rape Crisis"". ""Her passion in this area enabled her to finally find her career path with the hope of becoming a detective in victim support within a police force,"" the family added. ""The grief and loss that the family and friends of Saskia continue to endure is personal to them and it is their wish that it remains so."" Usman Khan was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange As the inquest got under way Det Ch Insp Dan Brown chronicled the attack in a series of photographs and videos. Footage from shortly before midday showed 28-year-old Khan talking ""animatedly"" with Ms Jones at a table, even though they had not known each other. A 13:56 GMT he launched his attack in the men's toilets at Fishmongers' Hall, strapping two knives on to his hands, leaving a bag containing a third blade in a cubicle and dropping a prayer book on the floor. Jurors were told that Mr Merritt had had some professional dealings with Khan before the Learning Together event at the hall He came across Mr Merritt, stabbing him multiple times, causing 12 injuries including a fatal wound to the chest, the court heard. Khan made his way to the cloakroom area, where he gestured to a member of staff ""as if to be quiet"",  Det Ch Insp Brown said. Ms Jones was stabbed once in the neck and staggered up a few steps before she collapsed, jurors heard. Jurors heard that one of Khan's knives had a crudely etched Arabic symbol for Allah on it Khan went on to injure Stephanie Szczotko and Isobel Rowbotham before he was confronted by a number of attendees with makeshift weapons, including an ornamental pike taken from the wall. The attacker approached a member of staff, held a knife to his chest and asked him to open the door, which he did, the court was told. Khan was pursued on to London Bridge by John Crilly, Steven Gallant and Darryn Frost at 14:01, jurors were told. Mr Crilly sprayed a fire extinguisher at him and Mr Frost jabbed at him with a narwhal tusk before they all tackled Khan to the ground with other members of the public. Police had been called at 13:58 and armed City of London Police officers arrived at 14:02. Det Ch Insp Brown said Khan appeared to be wearing an improvised explosive device (IED) strapped around his midriff and people were told stand clear. Khan was then shot and Tasered by police but still appeared to present a threat as he writhed on the floor wearing the suspected IED, Mr Brown said. By 14:12 Khan was dead. An examination of the device later revealed it was not genuine, the court heard. The hearing is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan.

"Iran's foreign ministry said a number of uranium centrifuges were damaged in the incident The Iranian foreign minister has said his country will ""take revenge"" for an attack on an underground nuclear site, for which it has blamed Israel. Iranian officials said the Natanz uranium enrichment plant was the target of ""nuclear terrorism"" on Sunday, after initially reporting a power failure. New advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium had just been activated there. Israel has not commented, but public radio cited intelligence sources as saying it was a Mossad cyber operation. They said it had caused more extensive damage than Iran had reported. US intelligence officials told the New York Times thata large explosion had completely destroyed the independent internal power system,externalthat supplied the centrifuges inside the underground facility. They estimated it could take at least nine months to resume enrichment there. Iran's Nour News agency, which is affiliated to the Supreme National Security Council, cited an intelligence ministry source as saying the ""main perpetrator"" had been identified and an operation was under way to arrest them. This video can not be played Iran's nuclear programme: What's been happening at its key nuclear sites? Israel has recently stepped up its warnings about its arch-foe's nuclear programme amid efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that was abandoned by former US President Donald Trump. His successor, Joe Biden, has said he wants to return to the landmark accord. But Iran and the five other world powers still party to it - China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK - need to find a way for him to lift US sanctions and for Iran to return to the agreed limits on its nuclear programme. How was the attack carried out? Why Iran's nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran's nuclear crisis in 300 words US and Iranian officials are holding indirect talks in the Austrian capital, Vienna, to try to break the impasse, with European officials acting as intermediaries. The European Union said it still needed to clarify the facts about the Natanz incident, but that it rejected ""any attempts to undermine or weaken diplomatic efforts on the nuclear agreement"". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is visiting Israel, said he was aware of the reports about Natanz and that the Biden administration's diplomatic efforts to re-engage with Iran diplomatically would continue. World powers don't trust Iran:Some countries believe Iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this. So a deal was struck:In 2015, Iran and six other countries reached a major agreement. Iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, hurting its economy. What is the problem now?Iran re-started banned nuclear work after former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move. ""The Zionists want to take revenge because of our progress in the way to lift sanctions,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted by state media as saying on Monday. ""They have publicly said that they will not allow this. But we will take our revenge from the Zionists."" Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and often refers to it as the ""Zionist state"". Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh later told a news conference in the capital, Tehran, that Israel was ""of course"" behind the attack on Natanz. ""This incident, fortunately, did not cause any damage to human lives or the environment. However, it could have been a catastrophe. This is a crime against humanity and carrying out such actions is in line with the essence of the Zionist regime,"" he said. Mr Khatibzadeh said only the least efficient ""IR-1"" centrifuges were damaged in the incident, and that they would be replaced with advanced ones. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention the incident at a later joint news conference with the US defence secretary. But he stated: ""My policy... is clear: I will never allow Iran to obtain the nuclear capability to carry out its genocidal goal of eliminating Israel. And Israel will continue to defend itself against Iran's aggression and terrorism."" The undeclared ""near war"" between Iran and Israel is heating up. The latest damage done to Iran's nuclear programme, for which Iran has vowed to take revenge, follows a series of tit-for-tat actions around the Middle East. There have been mysterious explosions on ships' hulls, blamed variously on both countries, and most significantly last November, there wasthe assassination in broad daylight near Tehran of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the man suspected of leading Iran's military nuclear programme. The Israeli air force has also carried out numerous air strikes against missile bases in Syria and other sites where Iranian advisers have been providing assistance to units of Hezbollah, the Shia Islamist militant group. Israel sees Iran's nuclear programme as a potential threat to its existence and is determined to delay or stop it. It does not see any point in current efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal, believing it to be ineffective. The attack on Natanz is likely to strengthen the hand of Iran's hardliners and complicate any future negotiations. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. The nuclear deal only allows Iran to use IR-1 centrifuges to produce limited quantities of uranium enriched up to 3.67% concentration, which can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Uranium that is enriched to 90% or more can be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran, which insists it does not want nuclear weapons, has retaliated against the sanctions reinstated by the Trump administration by rolling back key commitments under the accord. These have included operating advanced centrifuges, resuming enrichment to 20% concentration, and building a stockpile of that material. On Saturday, when Iran marked National Nuclear Technology Day, President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated a cascade (or cluster) of 164 advanced IR-6 centrifuges at Natanz. He also launched tests on new IR-9 centrifuges, which officials said could enrich uranium 50 times faster than the IR-1. This is not the first time that Natanz has been the target of sabotage. Last July,an above-ground centrifuge assembly plant was badly damagedby what Iranian officials said was a fire. In response, Iran began building a new structure underneath nearby mountains. Enrichment at the plant was previously disrupted by the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been created by the US and Israel. The virus, which was discovered in 2010, changed the speeds at which the centrifuges spun and reportedly ruined almost 1,000 of them. Iran also accused Israel of being behind the assassination of its top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, last November. Israel neither confirmed nor denied any involvement. And in recent months the countries have accused each other of being behind explosions that have damaged Israeli and Iranian commercial vessels. 11 April :Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant reportedly seriously damaged in sabotage attack; Iran blames Israel 6 April:Iranian cargo ship Saviz, allegedly used for spying, damaged by blast in Red Sea off coast of Eritrea; New York Times says Israel informed US that it carried out attack 25 March:Israeli cargo ship Lori hit by missile in Arabian Sea; Israeli security officials say Iran suspected 10 March:Iranian cargo ship Shahr-e Kord hit by blast in Mediterranean Sea; Iranian media say Israel to blame 26 February:Israeli vehicle carrier MV Helios Ray hit by explosion in Gulf of Oman; Israel blames Iran 27 November 2020:Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh assassinated, reportedly by satellite-controlled machine gun, outside Tehran; Iran accuses Israel 2 July 2020:Natanz centrifuge assembly plant hit by blasts, reportedly causing extensive damage; Iran blames sabotage June-July 2020:Series of mysterious fires and explosions hit industrial, power, medical and nuclear sites across Iran; Western intelligence sources say Israel suspected of involvement 9 May 2020:Israel reportedly behind cyber-attack on Shahid Rajaee port in Iran 24 April 2020:Israel accuses Iran of cyber-attack on water pumping station US joins talks aimed at reviving Iran nuclear deal Iran in biggest breach of nuclear deal to date Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Zoe Stacey is unhappy about being summoned for jury service whilst breastfeeding her two-month-old son A mother has been told she must attend court for jury service despite wanting to breastfeed her baby. Zoe Stacey, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, has been told her jury service in May at Winchester Crown Court can be deferred within a 12-month period. But she said she wanted to breastfeed her son William for longer than a year, and has appealed against the decision. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it was ""investigating the facts of the case"". Mother-of-two Mrs Stacey, who had her request to be excused from service rejected by the Jury Central Summoning Bureau, said she breastfed her older son, Thomas, for longer than a year. She added she had initially found it difficult to breastfeed William, who is two months old, as he had a tongue-tie - where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the bottom of their mouth is shorter than usual. Mrs Stacey said: ""I do feel strongly about being able to breastfeed for as long as possible, and not wanting to leave him for the next year... I think they need to show more compassion to new parents. ""It's very tiring having a new child. I wouldn't want to have someone sat on the jury who was exhausted or couldn't pay full attention. ""If anyone's on parental leave they should be exempt from it. It's precious time and should be protected, and the court should recognise that."" Her appeal is due to be considered by a judge at Winchester Crown Court. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: ""Crown court practice is to defer new mums that are breastfeeding.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"".

"Baroness Williams, pictured here in 2016, was a former education secretary Veteran politician and Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Shirley Williams has died at the age of 90, the party has announced. She was hailed as a ""Liberal lion and a true trailblazer"" by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey. Originally a Labour MP, she was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party to found the Social Democratic Party. She was a leading member of the 1970s Labour government and one of the first women cabinet ministers. She later went on to support the SDP's merger with the Liberal Party, which led to the creation of the Liberal Democrats in the late 1980s. Obituary: Shirley Williams Who were the Social Democratic Party? Her career in politics spanned more than 50 years, after she first entered Parliament as the Labour MP for Hitchin in 1964. She retired from political life in 2016, after leading the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords. This video can not be played The late Shirley Williams is described as a âliberal lionâ by the current Lib Dem leader. The Lib Dems said she died peacefully in the early hours of Monday. Sir Ed said she had been an ""inspiration to millions,"" and news of her death was ""heartbreaking for me and for our whole Liberal Democrat family"". ""Political life will be poorer without her intellect, her wisdom and her generosity,"" he added. ""Shirley had a limitless empathy only too rare in politics today; she connected with people, cared about their lives and saw politics as a crucial tool to change lives for the better."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson described her as ""a kind and thoughtful member of the once radical centre left"". ""Even when we disagreed - as we often did - she had the gift of sounding so completely reasonable at all times. ""I spent many happy hours sparring with her on Question Time. She will be much missed."" Baroness Williams quit Labour in 1981, after becoming dismayed at its drift to the left Baroness Williams served in several ministerial roles under the premiership of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, before landing her first cabinet job in 1974 as the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection. When Wilson resigned as Labour leader in 1976 his successor, Jim Callaghan, made her Secretary of State for Education and Science. She lost her seat in the 1979 election when Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher came to power following the so-called Winter of Discontent. After this, she found herself increasingly out of step with the Labour Party on issues including defence and her support for the UK's membership of the European Union. She later quit the party in 1981 - and with leading Labour lights Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen formed the ""Gang of Four"" which founded the Social Democratic Party. Shirley Williams with the ""Gang of Four"" in 1981 With growing support, the SDP went on to secure 25% of the vote at the 1983 general election, as part of an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party. This only delivered 23 MPs for the fledgling alliance, but then-Labour leader Michael Foot blamed it for reducing his party's share of the vote and giving Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives another term in government. The Alliance fought the 1987 election, but failed to boost its representation in the Commons - with almost 23% of the vote amounting to just 22 MPs. Lord Steel, who led the Liberal Party during the Alliance, said Baroness Williams was a ""key figure"" in helping it come close to breaking the two-party mould in British politics. ""She was a very, very popular person - much more popular than any of the rest of us,"" he told BBC News. He added that she was a ""tremendous public inspirer and communicator, and a real humanitarian"". It was decided in 1988 that the SDP and the Liberal Party should merge, leading to the formation of the Liberal Democrats in October 1989. Baroness Williams in 2013 with then-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg Sir Nick Clegg, who stood down as Lib Dem leader after the 2015 election, said he would ""forever be grateful for the support, candid advice and generosity"" Baroness Williams showed him during his time in charge of the party. ""Her warmth, commitment to progressive ideals and, above all, her wisdom were a constant inspiration down the years to so many,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Baroness Williams had been ""widely respected across politics and was a tireless champion for the causes she believed in"". Who were the Social Democratic Party?

"This video can not be played Lockdown lifting in Liverpool: 'Light at the end of the tunnel' For the first time in months, pub gardens, shops and hairdressers have reopened in England, as rules were also eased in the rest of the UK. Shoppers flocked to the High Street, with long queues seen outside some retailers. Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to ""behave responsibly"". Northern Ireland's ""stay-at-home"" order is endingand some rules are being easedin ScotlandandWales. The PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? Live updates: Shops, gyms and pub gardens open in England 'I'm very happy to have my hairdresser back' Snow showers and chilly temperatures in parts of southern England appeared to do little to dampen enthusiasm for outdoor pints. This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. Scott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said thepub had received 5,000 bookings over the next monthfor his new outside eating and drinking area. Mr Westlake said: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least."" Groups of people sat at tables outside bars in the Northern Quarter of central Manchester Drinkers at the Still & West pub in Portsmouth came prepared for all weather Two friends enjoy a celebratory drink at the Skylight roof top bar in London Nicholas Hair, landlord and owner of the Kentish Belle pub in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said there was a ""sense of celebration"" in the early hours of Monday as it opened to midnight customers. ""I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,"" he said. Meanwhile, a town inLincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade. Several hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day. Lewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: ""We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant."" Several hospitality businesses in Louth are taking part in the scheme The prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. However, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have ahaircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons. The PM had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers Marika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday. Kelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic ""first cut"" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks. Shoppers rushed back to the High Street,as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours. 'Very excited' customers queue for reopened shops 'Everyone's raring to get back to the gym' In pictures: Shoppers and gym-goers enjoy lockdown easing Another business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton. Co-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had ""been such a long time coming"", saying: ""Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy."" This video can not be played Long queues were not going to put shoppers off from visiting their favourite High Street retailers The rule changes in England from Monday include: All shops can reopen Hairdressers, beauty salons and other close-contact services can open Restaurants and pubs are allowed to serve food and alcohol to customers sitting outdoors Gyms, spas, zoos, theme parks, libraries and community centres can all open Members of the same household can take a holiday in England in self-contained accommodation Non-essential journeys between England and Wales are allowed Up to 15 people can attend weddings and 30 can attend funerals Children can attend any indoor children's activity Care home visitors will increase to two per resident Driving lessons can resume, with tests restarting on 22 April But the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% oflicensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service. People flocked to salons after months without a haircut Thrillseekers have been enjoying the rides at Thorpe Park in Surrey In Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. Thestay-at-home message has been liftedand up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden. Queues at Primark as stores to stay open to 10pm What are the rules when I go to the pub or a restaurant? In Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays. After a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. Non-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed. This video can not be played Shopper in Liverpool: ""It means life has come back to normal again"" Families descended on London Zoo, which has also been closed for months Shoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. So will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. But this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. Will customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? Only two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. The government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish. Hospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. Demand may vary by sector. Hairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. It is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. In a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are ""a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom"". ""I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,"" he added.

"Shoppers queuing outside the Primark in Stoke-on-Trent Shoppers rushed back to the High Street on Monday as non-essential retailers in England and Wales reopened after more than three months. As of 5pm, High Street footfall had nearly doubled from a week earlier, as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours. Beauty salons, barbers and pub gardens also reported a surge in bookings. But it is unclear if the demand will last as shops try to recoup lost sales. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Shoppers began queuing at 7am at Primark shops in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham as the fashion retailer reopened 161 stores across the country. Like others it is extending its open hours from 7am to 10pm to help prevent crowding in stores. Primark boss Paul Marchant said: ""We have been working really hard to get our stores ready to open safely; we are fully stocked with everything our customers have been waiting for. ""We ask our customers to continue supporting us and be mindful of our in-store measures, in particular if queuing outside and in-store."" Allow Twitter content?

Julian Metcalf, chief executive of sushi chain Itsu, said he was hopeful demand would pick up as people returned to the High Street but said he felt ""a bit nervous"". ""It's scary,"" he told the BBC. ""But there's a lot to be grateful for; the vaccination programme in our country is little short of remarkable, so there's no reason that we can't come back with real strength and positivity."" John Edgar, the boss of department store chain Fenwicks, warned cold weather in some parts of England and Wales could affect demand on Monday. He also said some shoppers would remain wary of heading back to the High Street for health reasons. ""It remains to be seen how many people choose to stay away in the short-term because of nervousness, but we believe that most retailers are offering a very safe environment to go shopping,"" he told the BBC. The British Retail Consortium says businesses have spent hundreds of millions of pounds to make shops Covid-secure. Some, including John Lewis, will have ""customer service hosts"" to manage customer numbers, while Ikea has planned a staggered entry system and more frequent cleaning routines. According to the latest figures from analyst Springboard, by 5pm footfall across all UK shopping destinations was up 146% from a week ago, and 481% higher compared with last year. However, footfall was still 16.2% lower than the level seen on the comparable day in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Gordon Fletcher, retail expert from the University of Salford, said: ""When the shoppers return to the High Street there will invariably be a surge of foot traffic as the built up tensions of lockdown need to vented. ""The biggest risk for the old and new independent High Street retailers is that any surge will only be temporary as many shoppers quickly return to their increasingly refined ecommerce habits built up over the past 12 months.""

"The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. In separate statements, Prince William described him as an ""extraordinary man"", while Prince Harry said he was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". ""I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,"" Prince William added. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99. It comes as parliaments across the UKwere recalled to remember the duke. Prince Philip: What are the plans for his funeral? How Prince Harry can attend the funeral ""My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,"" Prince William said in a statement. ""I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days. ""I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. ""I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!"" He added that he and his wife, Catherine, would ""continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead"". Kensington Palace shared a photograph of Prince George with his great-grandfather Philip, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, alongside the message from William Paying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: ""He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next. ""He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. ""But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."" By Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent He walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love. Harry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort. William writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together. Both men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. Once more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out. Prince Harry described Prince Philip as ""a rock"" for the Queen ""with unparalleled devotion"". ""While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'"" he said. ""So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself."" Prince Harry signed off his message with the words ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", meaning ""By Sea, By Land"" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General. Philip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US. Prince Harry and Prince Philip were both Captain General of the Royal Marines Meanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had ""touched the lives of millions"", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes. ""By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life ""shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a ""true partnership"". In the Welsh Senedd,First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a ""remarkable"" lifeand had championed a ""broad diversity"" of causes in Wales. And in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a ""true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" by the Royal Family to ""assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland"", which should be recognised. In the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a ""gigantic contribution"" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood. This video can not be played ""A huge void in her life"": Prince Andrew describes the Queen's feelings of loss A ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April. His children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. It will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to facesince the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. On Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the ""shared grief"" over the death of Prince Philipis an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family. Over the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as ""having left a huge void in her life"". by Duncan Kennedy, BBC News Windsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown. At the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse. Scaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world. Police have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance. The paper plans of countless committees across endless decades are coming to a melancholy fruition, to give His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, a fitting send-off.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

As many return to their local pub for the first time in months, one landlord says he's had 5,000 bookings for his outdoor seating area. Scott Westlake, who runs the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, says: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited.

People in the north west of England are making the most of the easing of lockdown restrictions. In Chester, one woman told the BBC being able to socialise ""lifts everyone's spirits"". ""People are fed up with lockdown and keen to get back to normal,"" she says. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lockdown easing is 'lifting everyone's spirits' Some shops in England and Wales will be keeping their doors open later than usual tonight, to allow for more people to visit safely. Rules introduced by the government for the easing of lockdown measures let them open until 22:00 six days a week. They can also open from 07:00. The idea is that businesses can start to recover and customers have more time to shop and can avoid peak times. Those staying open late tonight include shopping centres such as Westfield in Stratford, London, and Sheffield's Meadowhall complex. Oxford Street store Selfridges is also open late as are chain stores like Primark. And pubs and restaurants offering outdoor seating no longer have a 22:00 curfew, meaning customers can stay for longer - no doubt there will be a few sore heads come Tuesday morning. Shoppers returned to London's Oxford Street UK High Street footfall was down 24.2% today against a comparable day in April 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures show. The data is from the retail consultancy Springboard up to 17:00 BST after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Stores remain shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data showed visits to retail parks were up 1.7%, while shopping centres were down 16.7%. For all shopping destinations in the UK footfall was down 16.2%.And there was regional variation, with Central London down 55%, coastal towns down 16% and market towns down 3.5%. The South East and South West of England saw declines of 4.8% and 7.8% respectively. While the East Midlands saw an 8% decline. Here's our report from High Streets around England and Wales as shops opened for the first time in more than three months. Thanks for joining us today, on the day lockdown restrictions have eased further in England and Wales. Here are some of the main headlines of the day. A holiday home that hosted stays during lockdown has been forced to close and its owner and guests have been fined. Castle House in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, has flouted Covid-19 laws by staying open since the start of January, police say. Owner Scott Richardson was fined Â£7,000 and 62 visitors also were given fixed penalty notices. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court ordered Mr Richardson to close the let until 20 June. Insp Dave Parker, from Derbyshire Police, says: ""The nearly 100 complaints received by the force over a relatively short period of time shows just how disruptive, as well as dangerous, this holiday let has been.""

Now that outdoor hospitality has reopened, Michael from Chichester in West Sussex wanted to know: ""Can Covid-19 be transmitted through someone's exhaled cigarette smoke/vaping?"" It is possible to become infected by breathing in somebody elseâs second-hand smoke or exhaled vapour - both of which can transport coronavirus particles on microscopic droplets of water vapour exhaled from the lungs. In fact, the risk could even be heightened â with some scientists believing the virus might travel considerably further this way than when exhaled in normal breath. However, a study found that the increased risk of virus transmission for the majority of vapers was much less than the increased risk from talking or coughing. Government guidance for smokers,externalsays it's difficult to gauge the risk to individuals - and, in the absence of specific evidence, recommends that vapers err on the side of caution and avoid breathing out clouds of vapour in the presence of others.

One of Britain's leading imams has urged Muslim households to resist the urge to mix as the month of Ramadan begins and insists that getting a vaccine would not break the fast. Qari Asim is senior imam of the Makkah Masjid, in Leeds, and chairman of Mosques & Imams National Advisory Board (Minab). He says: ""The message from Muslim religious leadership is that one should not miss the opportunity to take the vaccine when they are invited to do so."" Imam Asim told the PA news agency ""the tide has turned"" for vaccine hesitancy. He said: ""More and more people from black and Asian ethnic minorities, including Muslims, are now taking up the vaccine.

The number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France has increased by 78 to a new 2021 record of 5,916. The French health ministry also reported 385 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. There had been 176 on Sunday. France has recorded 8,536 new cases, taking the total to 5,067,216. A nightclub in Omsk, Russia, in February Confusion and complacency in addressing Covid-19 means it is ""a long way"" from over, says the head of the World Health Organization. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said on Monday, in comments reported by Reuters news agency, that the situation can be brought under control in months if proven public health measures are adopted. ""We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,"" Tedros says. ""But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying â and it's totally avoidable. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."" He adds transmission is being driven by ""confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures"". In some countries, restaurants and nightclubs are full, with few people taking precautions, he says. ""Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19,"" Tedros says. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO team leader on Covid-19, adds it is a ""critical point in the pandemic"", with the trajectory ""growing for the seventh week in a row"". By Oliver Smith, BBC News Newquay Zoo is opening its doors for the first time in five months. The keepers have been wearing different coloured jackets around the zoo to get
the animals used to seeing lots of different people again. Throughout lockdown, theyâve had to take care of the animals and
staff, with no money coming in at the gates. They canât wait to get people
through the doors. Part of a group of three zoos, its sister site in Torquay
closed down last year, and Newquay came close to it too.  Dave Folland says it's a hugely important day for Newquay Zoo ""Itâs a hugely important day for us,"" says Dave Folland, the zooâs operations manager. ""All the way through, weâve had people in, weâve had the animals to look after, and weâve had no income to do that, so having our guests back in today and having them here enjoying the zoo, as well as bringing in an income so that we can move forward again as a business, is fantastic."" Before... The prime minister has wasted no time in getting his sometimes unruly hair under control as hairdressers reopen in England. Boris Johnson is famous for his shock of blond hair but the wind played havoc with his overgrown locks on a trip to Truro last week. But, as he emerged from Downing Street earlier his hair looked noticeably shorter. Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had his hair trimmed this morning before joining MPs in Parliament to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Johnson had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers but he postponed his plans for a pint in the wake of Prince Philip's death on Friday. After... Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst More than 167 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have now been delivered in China, making it the country with the second largest number of vaccinations in the world - behind the US on 187 million. China's total would equate to about 12% of its population but last week the official Peopleâs Daily signalled that the majority of vaccine recipients had also received second doses, and that statistically, the percentage of the population fully vaccinatedwas still in the single digits,external. China says it needs 70-80% of its population vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity and has ambitious plans to vaccinate 40% of the population by the end of June. But it is struggling to see uptake. On average, some three to four million vaccine doses are being administered per day, even though national newspaper Global Times says China hascapability to administer 10 million shots daily,external. This is partly due to China being slow to include the elderly in its vaccination programme. A significant proportion of Chinaâs population are over 60, owing to decades of birth controls under the now-abolished one-child policy. Over-60s have only just begun receiving vaccines, and there is still caution over widespread rolloutdue to there being insufficient data on how this demographic will respond in clinical trials,external. But there are also more general, human nature concerns about vaccine safety. Last week, official broadcaster CCTV tried to dispel fears about getting vaccinated, noting there wereconcerns among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs vaccines,external. It also noted there was a general resistance to getting vaccinated due to China having its Covid-19 situation largely under control andmany not feeling it was ""necessary"",external. The latest coronavirus statistics have been published and they show a further 3,568 positive cases recorded in the UK. There have also been another 13 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. There have been another 69,223 first doses of coronavirus vaccine given and 189,665 further second doses.  Publicans have welcomed being able to reopen under today's stage of lockdown easing but are warning the industry is on its knees. Pubs in England can serve outdoors but need to fully open without restrictions as soon as possible, they say. ""No pub is expecting to profit from reopening outdoors, and many will make a loss,"" says Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. Some 2,500 pubs are estimated to have closed for good in 2020. ""Pubs are the heart of our communities and we've all missed them. If they are to survive the long-term it's imperative they fully recover,"" says McClarkin. Pubs are expecting to sell about 15 million pints in the first week of reopening - about a quarter of what they would normally sell in an April week. Just two out of five pubs are reopening on Monday, the association says. Wales has taken another step out of lockdown, with travel restrictions further relaxed from today. But what does this mean? Well, one main change is that the border between England and Wales has reopened, with people allowed to travel in either direction. The rules actually state you are allowed to leave Wales to travel to ""other parts of the UK and the Common Travel Area"" (which covers the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands). But currently only essential travel is allowed into Scotland and Northern Ireland - so you can only go to those countries if you have a valid reason such as work, education or childcare.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. In separate statements, Prince William described him as an ""extraordinary man"", while Prince Harry said he was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". ""I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,"" Prince William added. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99. It comes as parliaments across the UKwere recalled to remember the duke. Prince Philip: What are the plans for his funeral? How Prince Harry can attend the funeral ""My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,"" Prince William said in a statement. ""I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days. ""I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. ""I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!"" He added that he and his wife, Catherine, would ""continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead"". Kensington Palace shared a photograph of Prince George with his great-grandfather Philip, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, alongside the message from William Paying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: ""He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next. ""He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. ""But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."" By Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent He walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love. Harry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort. William writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together. Both men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. Once more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out. Prince Harry described Prince Philip as ""a rock"" for the Queen ""with unparalleled devotion"". ""While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'"" he said. ""So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself."" Prince Harry signed off his message with the words ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", meaning ""By Sea, By Land"" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General. Philip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US. Prince Harry and Prince Philip were both Captain General of the Royal Marines Meanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had ""touched the lives of millions"", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes. ""By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life ""shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a ""true partnership"". In the Welsh Senedd,First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a ""remarkable"" lifeand had championed a ""broad diversity"" of causes in Wales. And in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a ""true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" by the Royal Family to ""assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland"", which should be recognised. In the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a ""gigantic contribution"" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood. This video can not be played ""A huge void in her life"": Prince Andrew describes the Queen's feelings of loss A ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April. His children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. It will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to facesince the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. On Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the ""shared grief"" over the death of Prince Philipis an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family. Over the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as ""having left a huge void in her life"". by Duncan Kennedy, BBC News Windsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown. At the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse. Scaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world. Police have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance.

Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. In separate statements, Prince William described him as an ""extraordinary man"", while Prince Harry said he was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". ""I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,"" Prince William added. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99. It comes as parliaments across the UKwere recalled to remember the duke. Prince Philip: What are the plans for his funeral? How Prince Harry can attend the funeral ""My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,"" Prince William said in a statement. ""I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days. ""I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. ""I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!"" He added that he and his wife, Catherine, would ""continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead"". Kensington Palace shared a photograph of Prince George with his great-grandfather Philip, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, alongside the message from William Paying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: ""He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next. ""He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. ""But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."" By Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent He walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love. Harry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort. William writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together. Both men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. Once more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out. Prince Harry described Prince Philip as ""a rock"" for the Queen ""with unparalleled devotion"". ""While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'"" he said. ""So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself."" Prince Harry signed off his message with the words ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", meaning ""By Sea, By Land"" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General. Philip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US. Prince Harry and Prince Philip were both Captain General of the Royal Marines Meanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life.

""By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life ""shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a ""true partnership"". In the Welsh Senedd,First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a ""remarkable"" lifeand had championed a ""broad diversity"" of causes in Wales. And in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a ""true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" by the Royal Family to ""assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland"", which should be recognised.

Queues at Primark as stores to stay open to 10pm What are the rules when I go to the pub or a restaurant? In Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays. After a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. Non-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed.

So will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. But this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. Will customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? Only two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. The government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish. Hospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. Demand may vary by sector. Hairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. It is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. In a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are ""a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom"". ""I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,"" he added. ""I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."" Ultimate Fitness Gym in Wallsend, north-east England, was among the businesses to have reopened early on Monday Synchronised swimmers are able to return to indoor pools, which can reopen, such as this one at Clissold Leisure Centre, north London The rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January. There is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.

Shoppers have been out in force as High Street stores reopened in England and Wales. Pub gardens and marquees have been filled with friends and family raising a glass to their new-found freedom while snow fell and sun shined across a chilly England. There have been haircuts, nail extensions, gym sessions, swims and car washes along with rollercoaster rides and trips to the zoo. These updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Martha Buckley, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus news, have a good evening. Surge testing is being rolled out in parts of Wandsworth and Lambeth in South London, after cases of the South Africa variant were found. All identified cases are
     isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been
     traced and asked to isolate. Everyone aged 11 and over who lives or works in, or travels through the two London boroughs is being ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 PCR test, whether they are
showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms
should book a free test online or by phone so they can get tested at a testing
site or have a testing kit sent to them at home. Those without symptoms should
visit their local authority website for more information. NHS Test and Trace said it was the largest
     surge testing operation to date. As we move into the evening on the first night that pubs have been open in England for months, police say they have extra patrols to make sure everyone sticks to coronavirus restrictions. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metâs lead for Covid-19 response, says:âThe Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyoneâs safety and to disrupt any criminal activity. She says the overwhelming majority of people will act responsibly but ""where we need to take action against those who dangerously flout the rules we will do"". âBusinesses have been hit hard by this pandemic but it is important everyone plays their part in driving down the infection rate further. ""Our joint patrols with councils will continue and if we see unnecessary risks being taken, we will engage, explain the regulations and if needed take action.â Queues formed outside shops across England on the first day they opened their doors in more than three months.

As many return to their local pub for the first time in months, one landlord says he's had 5,000 bookings for his outdoor seating area. Scott Westlake, who runs the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, says: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything."" This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. People in the north west of England are making the most of the easing of lockdown restrictions. In Chester, one woman told the BBC being able to socialise ""lifts everyone's spirits"". ""People are fed up with lockdown and keen to get back to normal,"" she says. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lockdown easing is 'lifting everyone's spirits' Some shops in England and Wales will be keeping their doors open later than usual tonight, to allow for more people to visit safely. Rules introduced by the government for the easing of lockdown measures let them open until 22:00 six days a week. They can also open from 07:00. The idea is that businesses can start to recover and customers have more time to shop and can avoid peak times. Those staying open late tonight include shopping centres such as Westfield in Stratford, London, and Sheffield's Meadowhall complex. Oxford Street store Selfridges is also open late as are chain stores like Primark. And pubs and restaurants offering outdoor seating no longer have a 22:00 curfew, meaning customers can stay for longer - no doubt there will be a few sore heads come Tuesday morning. Shoppers returned to London's Oxford Street UK High Street footfall was down 24.2% today against a comparable day in April 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures show. The data is from the retail consultancy Springboard up to 17:00 BST after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Stores remain shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data showed visits to retail parks were up 1.7%, while shopping centres were down 16.7%. For all shopping destinations in the UK footfall was down 16.2%.And there was regional variation, with Central London down 55%, coastal towns down 16% and market towns down 3.5%. The South East and South West of England saw declines of 4.8% and 7.8% respectively. While the East Midlands saw an 8% decline. Here's our report from High Streets around England and Wales as shops opened for the first time in more than three months. Thanks for joining us today, on the day lockdown restrictions have eased further in England and Wales. Here are some of the main headlines of the day. A holiday home that hosted stays during lockdown has been forced to close and its owner and guests have been fined. Castle House in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, has flouted Covid-19 laws by staying open since the start of January, police say. Owner Scott Richardson was fined Â£7,000 and 62 visitors also were given fixed penalty notices. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court ordered Mr Richardson to close the let until 20 June. Insp Dave Parker, from Derbyshire Police, says: ""The nearly 100 complaints received by the force over a relatively short period of time shows just how disruptive, as well as dangerous, this holiday let has been.""

Now that outdoor hospitality has reopened, Michael from Chichester in West Sussex wanted to know: ""Can Covid-19 be transmitted through someone's exhaled cigarette smoke/vaping?"" It is possible to become infected by breathing in somebody elseâs second-hand smoke or exhaled vapour - both of which can transport coronavirus particles on microscopic droplets of water vapour exhaled from the lungs. In fact, the risk could even be heightened â with some scientists believing the virus might travel considerably further this way than when exhaled in normal breath. However, a study found that the increased risk of virus transmission for the majority of vapers was much less than the increased risk from talking or coughing. Government guidance for smokers,externalsays it's difficult to gauge the risk to individuals - and, in the absence of specific evidence, recommends that vapers err on the side of caution and avoid breathing out clouds of vapour in the presence of others.

One of Britain's leading imams has urged Muslim households to resist the urge to mix as the month of Ramadan begins and insists that getting a vaccine would not break the fast. Qari Asim is senior imam of the Makkah Masjid, in Leeds, and chairman of Mosques & Imams National Advisory Board (Minab). He says: ""The message from Muslim religious leadership is that one should not miss the opportunity to take the vaccine when they are invited to do so."" Imam Asim told the PA news agency ""the tide has turned"" for vaccine hesitancy. He said: ""More and more people from black and Asian ethnic minorities, including Muslims, are now taking up the vaccine.

The number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France has increased by 78 to a new 2021 record of 5,916. The French health ministry also reported 385 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. There had been 176 on Sunday. France has recorded 8,536 new cases, taking the total to 5,067,216. A nightclub in Omsk, Russia, in February Confusion and complacency in addressing Covid-19 means it is ""a long way"" from over, says the head of the World Health Organization. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said on Monday, in comments reported by Reuters news agency, that the situation can be brought under control in months if proven public health measures are adopted. ""We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,"" Tedros says. ""But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying â and it's totally avoidable. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."" He adds transmission is being driven by ""confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures"". In some countries, restaurants and nightclubs are full, with few people taking precautions, he says. ""Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19,"" Tedros says. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO team leader on Covid-19, adds it is a ""critical point in the pandemic"", with the trajectory ""growing for the seventh week in a row"". By Oliver Smith, BBC News Newquay Zoo is opening its doors for the first time in five months. The keepers have been wearing different coloured jackets around the zoo to get
the animals used to seeing lots of different people again. Throughout lockdown, theyâve had to take care of the animals and
staff, with no money coming in at the gates. They canât wait to get people
through the doors. Part of a group of three zoos, its sister site in Torquay
closed down last year, and Newquay came close to it too.  Dave Folland says it's a hugely important day for Newquay Zoo ""Itâs a hugely important day for us,"" says Dave Folland, the zooâs operations manager. ""All the way through, weâve had people in, weâve had the animals to look after, and weâve had no income to do that, so having our guests back in today and having them here enjoying the zoo, as well as bringing in an income so that we can move forward again as a business, is fantastic."" Before... The prime minister has wasted no time in getting his sometimes unruly hair under control as hairdressers reopen in England. Boris Johnson is famous for his shock of blond hair but the wind played havoc with his overgrown locks on a trip to Truro last week. But, as he emerged from Downing Street earlier his hair looked noticeably shorter. Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had his hair trimmed this morning before joining MPs in Parliament to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Johnson had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers but he postponed his plans for a pint in the wake of Prince Philip's death on Friday. After... Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst More than 167 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have now been delivered in China, making it the country with the second largest number of vaccinations in the world - behind the US on 187 million. China's total would equate to about 12% of its population but last week the official Peopleâs Daily signalled that the majority of vaccine recipients had also received second doses, and that statistically, the percentage of the population fully vaccinatedwas still in the single digits,external. China says it needs 70-80% of its population vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity and has ambitious plans to vaccinate 40% of the population by the end of June. But it is struggling to see uptake. On average, some three to four million vaccine doses are being administered per day, even though national newspaper Global Times says China hascapability to administer 10 million shots daily,external. This is partly due to China being slow to include the elderly in its vaccination programme. A significant proportion of Chinaâs population are over 60, owing to decades of birth controls under the now-abolished one-child policy. Over-60s have only just begun receiving vaccines, and there is still caution over widespread rolloutdue to there being insufficient data on how this demographic will respond in clinical trials,external. But there are also more general, human nature concerns about vaccine safety. Last week, official broadcaster CCTV tried to dispel fears about getting vaccinated, noting there wereconcerns among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs vaccines,external. It also noted there was a general resistance to getting vaccinated due to China having its Covid-19 situation largely under control andmany not feeling it was ""necessary"",external. The latest coronavirus statistics have been published and they show a further 3,568 positive cases recorded in the UK. There have also been another 13 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. There have been another 69,223 first doses of coronavirus vaccine given and 189,665 further second doses.  Publicans have welcomed being able to reopen under today's stage of lockdown easing but are warning the industry is on its knees. Pubs in England can serve outdoors but need to fully open without restrictions as soon as possible, they say. ""No pub is expecting to profit from reopening outdoors, and many will make a loss,"" says Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. Some 2,500 pubs are estimated to have closed for good in 2020. ""Pubs are the heart of our communities and we've all missed them. If they are to survive the long-term it's imperative they fully recover,"" says McClarkin. Pubs are expecting to sell about 15 million pints in the first week of reopening - about a quarter of what they would normally sell in an April week. Just two out of five pubs are reopening on Monday, the association says. Wales has taken another step out of lockdown, with travel restrictions further relaxed from today. But what does this mean? Well, one main change is that the border between England and Wales has reopened, with people allowed to travel in either direction. The rules actually state you are allowed to leave Wales to travel to ""other parts of the UK and the Common Travel Area"" (which covers the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands). But currently only essential travel is allowed into Scotland and Northern Ireland - so you can only go to those countries if you have a valid reason such as work, education or childcare.

"MSPs observed a minute's silence before paying tribute to Prince Philip Scotland's political leaders have paid tribute to Prince Philip after Holyrood was recalled in a special session. MSPs held a minute's silence in remembrance of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died on Friday aged 99. Campaigning for the Holyrood election on 6 May was suspended, but will resume in full on Tuesday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the duke had ""led a life of distinction"", offering the ""deepest sympathies"" of the parliament to the Queen. Flags outside Holyrood have been flying at half-mast as a mark of respect, while a special session to pay tribute is also being held in the House of Commons. Scotland's tributes to 'remarkable' Prince Philip Prince Philip: A close association with Scotland Scotland's parties were approaching the end of the second full week of campaigning ahead of the election, with several scheduled to launch their manifestos. However, after campaigns were put on hold, Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh decided to recall MSPs to pay tribute to the duke. This was possible because the parliament was not dissolved for the election as usual, but put into recess so that members could be recalled in the event of any Covid-19 emergency. Flags have been at half-mast at the Scottish Parliament building Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that she had witnesses the strength of the ""true partnership"" between the Queen and Prince Philip while visiting them at Balmoral, and said she ""always enjoyed"" her conversations with the duke. She said: ""I was struck by how different he was in private to the way he was sometimes characterised in public. ""He was a thoughtful man, deeply interesting and fiercely intelligent. He was also a serious bookworm, which I am too, so talking about the books we were reading was often for me a real highlight of our conversations."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson added: ""It was clear that not only was he a man of huge practical ability - a decorated and talented naval officer, a qualified pilot, a natural sailor and horseman - he also  had interests and passions that he wanted to use his position to drive forward. ""He focused on engineering, research, youth, the outdoors and conservation. ""In a life that could so easily have been one shallow wave, a ribbon cut, a couple of public remarks before on to the next engagement, he demonstrated huge commitment to the organisations that he championed."" Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh said Prince Philip had attended every royal occasion at Holyrood before retiring This is the sixth time Holyrood has been recalled in its short history but the first occasion MSPs have been brought back during an election campaign. That is only possible because of special pandemic arrangements that mean parliament has not been formally stood down in the usual way and MSPs continue in their roles until 5 May. There were similar tributes from Scottish party leaders when the Queen Mother died in 2002. The Duke of Edinburgh was a regular visitor to Holyrood, attending the royal openings of each session with the Queen whose royal palace is next door to parliament. Election campaigning has been suspended since Friday ahead of an important week in which postal voting begins. Labour has put back its manifesto launch by a week. There was a more prolonged interruption to campaigning in the devolution referendum that set up the Scottish Parliament in 1997 following the death of Princess Diana. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Prince Philip was an ""extraordinary public servant"", paying particular tribute to the impact of the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. He added: ""This is hard for anyone, no matter how many years have been shared - the Queen has lost her beloved husband after spending more than 70 years together. ""I can't even begin to imagine how that must feel, and my thoughts and prayers are with her majesty."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said his party had considered whether to take part in the event, given they want to replace the monarchy with an elected head of state. However, he said ""respect and compassion"" were due in times of loss, offering his ""sincere condolences"" to the duke's family. And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Prince Philip had ""left lasting impressions with so many"", with many ""fun and memorable"" memories. He added: ""For so many he has been part of a family that has provided comfort and stability in what can be a turbulent and intimidating world.""

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions.

He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions.

"Zoe Stacey is unhappy about being summoned for jury service whilst breastfeeding her two-month-old son A mother has been told she must attend court for jury service despite wanting to breastfeed her baby. Zoe Stacey, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, has been told her jury service in May at Winchester Crown Court can be deferred within a 12-month period. But she said she wanted to breastfeed her son William for longer than a year, and has appealed against the decision. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it was ""investigating the facts of the case"". Mother-of-two Mrs Stacey, who had her request to be excused from service rejected by the Jury Central Summoning Bureau, said she breastfed her older son, Thomas, for longer than a year. She added she had initially found it difficult to breastfeed William, who is two months old, as he had a tongue-tie - where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the bottom of their mouth is shorter than usual. Mrs Stacey said: ""I do feel strongly about being able to breastfeed for as long as possible, and not wanting to leave him for the next year... I think they need to show more compassion to new parents. ""It's very tiring having a new child. I wouldn't want to have someone sat on the jury who was exhausted or couldn't pay full attention. ""If anyone's on parental leave they should be exempt from it. It's precious time and should be protected, and the court should recognise that."" Her appeal is due to be considered by a judge at Winchester Crown Court. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: ""Crown court practice is to defer new mums that are breastfeeding.

"The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. In separate statements, Prince William described him as an ""extraordinary man"", while Prince Harry said he was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". ""I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,"" Prince William added. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99. It comes as parliaments across the UKwere recalled to remember the duke. Prince Philip: What are the plans for his funeral? How Prince Harry can attend the funeral ""My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,"" Prince William said in a statement. ""I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days. ""I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. ""I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!"" He added that he and his wife, Catherine, would ""continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead"". Kensington Palace shared a photograph of Prince George with his great-grandfather Philip, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, alongside the message from William Paying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: ""He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next. ""He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. ""But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end."" By Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent He walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love. Harry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort. William writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together. Both men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. Once more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out. Prince Harry described Prince Philip as ""a rock"" for the Queen ""with unparalleled devotion"". ""While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'"" he said. ""So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself."" Prince Harry signed off his message with the words ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", meaning ""By Sea, By Land"" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General. Philip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US. Prince Harry and Prince Philip were both Captain General of the Royal Marines Meanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had ""touched the lives of millions"", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes. ""By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life ""shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a ""true partnership"". In the Welsh Senedd,First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a ""remarkable"" lifeand had championed a ""broad diversity"" of causes in Wales. And in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a ""true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" by the Royal Family to ""assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland"", which should be recognised. In the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a ""gigantic contribution"" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood. This video can not be played ""A huge void in her life"": Prince Andrew describes the Queen's feelings of loss A ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April. His children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. It will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to facesince the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. On Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the ""shared grief"" over the death of Prince Philipis an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family. Over the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as ""having left a huge void in her life"". by Duncan Kennedy, BBC News Windsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown. At the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse. Scaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world. Police have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

"If you want a visa to China, it'll be easier with a Chinese jab China's top disease control official has said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines is low, in a rare admission of weakness. In a press conference, Gao Fu added that China was considering mixing vaccines as a way of boosting efficacy. China has developed four different vaccines approved for public use, though some trials abroad had suggested efficacy as low as 50%. Mr Gao later said his comments had been misinterpreted. More than 100 million people in China have received at least one shot of the vaccine. Beijing has insisted the jabs are effective and said in March that obtaining visas would be easier for foreigners who have received a Chinese vaccine. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday said at a conference the current vaccines ""don't have very high rates of protection"". He suggested that the China was considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines, as a way of boosting efficacy. Mr Gao explained that steps to ""optimise"" the vaccine process could include changing the number of doses and the length of time. He also suggested combining different vaccines for the immunisation process. But he later appeared to backtrack on his comments, telling state media Global Times that ""protection rates of all vaccines in the world are sometimes high, and sometimes low"". ""How to improve their efficacy is a question that needs to be considered by scientists around the world,"" he told the paper. He added that his earlier admission that Chinese vaccines had a low protection rate were a ""complete misunderstanding"". What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? Covid-19: The disinformation tactics used by China Coronavirus - what's gone wrong in Brazil? Mr Gao's original and later comments have been largely unreported by Chinese media. His original comments however, attracted some criticism on social media site Weibo, with commenters suggesting that he should ""stop talking"". With little data released internationally, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain. Brazilian trials of the Sinovac vaccine CoronaVac for instance,showed an efficacy rate of around 50.4%, which is barely over the 50% threshold needed for regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO). China has vaccinated millions of its people with the local jabs Interim results from late-stage trials in Turkey and Indonesia however, had suggested the efficacy rate of the Sinovac shot to be between 91% and 65%. Western vaccines like the ones by BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna have an efficacy rate of around 90% or higher while the UK's AstraZeneca jab is thought to be around 76%. So far, Sinovac's CoronaVac jab has only been fully authorised for use by China. But Beijing is also offering its vaccines around the world and has already shipped millions of doses to a number of countries. In Asia, the biggest takers are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan, while in the Americas, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador have also ordered millions of shot. In Europe, Turkey and Ukraine have signed large contracts for CoronaVac. The vaccine is thought to be particularly important for African countries where so far Zimbabwe, Somalia, Djibouti, Benin and Tunisia have received vaccines from China. This video can not be played What do we know about the Chinese vaccines? China's vaccines though differ significantly from some vaccines, especially those developed by Pfizer and Moderna. Developed in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. By comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond. The UK's AstraZeneca vaccine is yet another type of vaccine where a version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees is modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the real virus. One significant advantage of the Chinese vaccines is that they can be stored in standard refrigerators at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at -20C and Pfizer's vaccine at -70C. The AstraZeneca vaccine though can also be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.

"MSPs observed a minute's silence before paying tribute to Prince Philip Scotland's political leaders have paid tribute to Prince Philip after Holyrood was recalled in a special session. MSPs held a minute's silence in remembrance of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died on Friday aged 99. Campaigning for the Holyrood election on 6 May was suspended, but will resume in full on Tuesday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the duke had ""led a life of distinction"", offering the ""deepest sympathies"" of the parliament to the Queen. Flags outside Holyrood have been flying at half-mast as a mark of respect, while a special session to pay tribute is also being held in the House of Commons. Scotland's tributes to 'remarkable' Prince Philip Prince Philip: A close association with Scotland Scotland's parties were approaching the end of the second full week of campaigning ahead of the election, with several scheduled to launch their manifestos. However, after campaigns were put on hold, Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh decided to recall MSPs to pay tribute to the duke. This was possible because the parliament was not dissolved for the election as usual, but put into recess so that members could be recalled in the event of any Covid-19 emergency. Flags have been at half-mast at the Scottish Parliament building Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that she had witnesses the strength of the ""true partnership"" between the Queen and Prince Philip while visiting them at Balmoral, and said she ""always enjoyed"" her conversations with the duke. She said: ""I was struck by how different he was in private to the way he was sometimes characterised in public. ""He was a thoughtful man, deeply interesting and fiercely intelligent. He was also a serious bookworm, which I am too, so talking about the books we were reading was often for me a real highlight of our conversations."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson added: ""It was clear that not only was he a man of huge practical ability - a decorated and talented naval officer, a qualified pilot, a natural sailor and horseman - he also  had interests and passions that he wanted to use his position to drive forward. ""He focused on engineering, research, youth, the outdoors and conservation. ""In a life that could so easily have been one shallow wave, a ribbon cut, a couple of public remarks before on to the next engagement, he demonstrated huge commitment to the organisations that he championed."" Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh said Prince Philip had attended every royal occasion at Holyrood before retiring This is the sixth time Holyrood has been recalled in its short history but the first occasion MSPs have been brought back during an election campaign. That is only possible because of special pandemic arrangements that mean parliament has not been formally stood down in the usual way and MSPs continue in their roles until 5 May. There were similar tributes from Scottish party leaders when the Queen Mother died in 2002. The Duke of Edinburgh was a regular visitor to Holyrood, attending the royal openings of each session with the Queen whose royal palace is next door to parliament. Election campaigning has been suspended since Friday ahead of an important week in which postal voting begins. Labour has put back its manifesto launch by a week. There was a more prolonged interruption to campaigning in the devolution referendum that set up the Scottish Parliament in 1997 following the death of Princess Diana. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Prince Philip was an ""extraordinary public servant"", paying particular tribute to the impact of the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. He added: ""This is hard for anyone, no matter how many years have been shared - the Queen has lost her beloved husband after spending more than 70 years together. ""I can't even begin to imagine how that must feel, and my thoughts and prayers are with her majesty."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said his party had considered whether to take part in the event, given they want to replace the monarchy with an elected head of state. However, he said ""respect and compassion"" were due in times of loss, offering his ""sincere condolences"" to the duke's family. And Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Prince Philip had ""left lasting impressions with so many"", with many ""fun and memorable"" memories. He added: ""For so many he has been part of a family that has provided comfort and stability in what can be a turbulent and intimidating world.""

"David Cameron replaced Gordon Brown as prime minister after the 2010 general election Labour's Gordon Brown says former prime ministers ""must never"" lobby government for commercial purposes, amid a row over the conduct of his successor. David Cameron has been criticised for contacting ministers via text on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital. The Tory former prime minister broke his silence on the controversy on Sunday, saying he should have contacted ministers through ""formal"" channels. But he said he had not broken codes of conduct or rules on lobbying. Undercurrent guidelines,external, former ministers and senior civil servants are banned from lobbying for two years after they leave government, a rule Mr Cameron followed. Lessons to be learnt over lobbying role - Cameron In full: David Cameron's Greensill statement Sunak texts to Cameron released in lobbying row David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? But Mr Brown - who was prime minister from 2007 to 2010 - said: ""Former prime ministers must never be lobbying for commercial purposes. Current ministers should not be entertaining such lobbying."" ""It simply brings public service into disrepute,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He suggested that if the existing rules cannot be made to work, new laws should be passed to stop former ministers lobbying for five years after leaving office. Labour has said ""many serious questions remain unanswered"" after Mr Cameron's statement and he should be quizzed in Parliament. It follows a series of newspaper reports over Mr Cameron's lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital, where he began working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left No 10. The firm was founded by Australian financier Lex Greensill, who worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron's government. The reports revealed that Mr Cameron had texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers over access to government-backed emergency loans during the Covid pandemic. Mr Cameron said he had been trying to involve Greensill Capital in the government's CCFF (Covid Corporate Financing Facility) initiative, launched at the start of the crisis. Mr Cameron rejected calls to comment on the affair until Sunday, when he released a statement to the media. In it, Mr Cameron said he believed it had been ""right"" for him to contact government on behalf of Greensill Capital, as it was ""involved in financing a large number of UK firms"" at a time of ""crisis for the UK economy"". But he said he understood the ""concern"" caused by how he had chosen to make contact with government figures. ""There are important lessons to be learnt,"" he added. ""As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation."" For three weeks the headlines kept coming. For three weeks David Cameron said nothing. And now this - the former prime minister admits he made a dud judgement call. Forget the rules; this is about the sniff test. Does it smell bad? Does it feel right? Plenty had been saying no it doesn't, and now David Cameron appears to agree. It's a lengthy statement from him, worthy of detailed examination. But it boils down to this: he acknowledges texting and ringing the chancellor and going for a private drink with the health secretary, as part of his paid work for a private company, was a bad idea. There's another point worth making too: journalism matters. The work of the Financial Times and the Sunday Times, ferreting out awkward truths, is what has prompted this. In his statement, Mr Cameron added: ""In my representations to government, I was breaking no codes of conduct and no government rules."" He said that his suggestions about Greensill and the CCFF scheme were ultimately ""not taken up"". He also said he had had ""very little to do"" with Lex Greensill during the financier's time working as a government adviser. He added that Mr Greensill had been brought in as a government adviser by then-Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, in 2011. ""As I recall, I met him twice at most in the entirety of my time as prime minister,"" he added. ""The idea of my working for Greensill was never raised, or considered by me, until well after I left office,"" he added. Lex Greensill was an unpaid government adviser The company recently collapsed, with the loss of 440 jobs. Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs Parliament's Liaison Committee, said the lobbying row had revealed a ""very casual"" culture in the relationship between those at the top of government and business. ""This is pretty devastating, this is pretty corrosive,"" he told the Today programme. He added: ""I am not going to pass judgment on David Cameron, I think in some respects it's a distraction. ""What is more important is not who is lobbying, and even if you have a five-year ban as suggested by Gordon Brown, is it OK for an ex-prime minister to start lobbying after six years? ""You can't make laws stretch far into the future to bind people to previous employment, it just doesn't work."" Labour's Rachel Reeves said: ""The events unfolding over the last few weeks stretch across government and affect thousands of people. ""Transparency and accountability are crucial and that requires the utmost openness from government to establish the full facts behind this scandal.""

He adds: ""His impact on my family has been great. ""His impact on millions of others has been utterly outstanding."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie recalled how Prince Philip once ""bounced up"" to him at a reception and demanded to know what the badge on his lapel - in the shape of a blue man - was for. He told the Duke it was to show support for the prostate cancer campaign. Mr Rennie says: ""He looked at me closely and said: 'Have you got it or are you against it?' ""Then he bounced off again. ""The engagement was only 30 seconds long but it has stayed with me, and was to be retold numerous times over the years. ""It seems that he left lasting impressions with so many other too."" Mr Harvie goes on to say: ""This has been a year of terrible loss for the world. Including up to 150,000 Covid deaths across the UK. ""Most of them announced without ceremony as daily statistics. ""The toll has been heaviest on those with least."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie offers his condolences to Prince Philip's family and friends after the Duke's death. Mr Harvie says his party (as republicans) considered whether or not to take part in today's tributes. However, he says ""respect and compassion"" are due in times of loss. The Duke of Edinburgh attended a reception for The Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holders at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in  2017 Mr Sarwar says there will be countless other young lives who have been saved by the Duke's award scheme, which was launched in 1956. At the time Prince Philip said if you could get a young person to success in any one area then that feeling of success would spread over into many others. Following the difficult year experience by so many young people with their lives and their learning disrupted by Covid, Prince Philip's words from 65 years ago are just as relevant today and a reminder of the collective national mission we face in the years ahead to make sure ever child fulfils their potential. Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar tells MSPs: ""On Friday we lost an extraordinary public servant who dedicated his long life to our country as well as transforming lives for young people across the word and promoting the issue of global conservation that we all now recognise as so important."" He says he cannot imagine the pressures of being monarch but adds everyone can empathise with the pain of losing a loved one. Mr Sarwar adds he never had the pleasure of meeting Prince Philip. But he recalls the experiences of a man who was jailed at the age of 17 but who found a  ""new direction"" in life through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Scheme. Ms Davidson tells the chamber Prince Philip served: Ruth Davidson begins: ""Grief is the price we pay for love."" The Scottish Conservative's Holyrood leader says this in recognition of the huge sense of loss the Queen must be feeling right now. Ms Davidson goes on to say the duke was a moderniser in life as well as work. Nicola Sturgeon says she ""always enjoyed"" her conversations  with the Duke and describes him as a ""thoughtful man, deeply interesting and fiercely intelligent."" The first minister adds: ""He was also a serious bookworm, which I am too, so talking about the books we were reading was often for me a real highlight of out conversation."" She praises his passion for conservation, contribution to charity and hailed the success of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Ms Sturgeon adds it provides ""opportunity, hope and inspiration"" in more than 100 countries across the world. The duke led an ""extraordinary life"", the first minister added.

But she adds the Second World War was just the beginning of his life of public service - as he went on to become the longest-serving consort in British history. Ms Sturgeon says that his role ""can't have been an easy one, particularly for one who is spirited and energetic by temperament"". She also points out that he was the husband of a powerful woman at a time when it was ""even more of an exception than it is today."" Ms Sturgeon adds: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was devoted to supporting the Queen. ""They were a true partnership."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the tributes paid to the Prince Philip show the affection he was in held in in Scotland, the UK and around the world.

Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh gets proceedings under way by calling for MSPs to observe a minute's silence, as a mark of respect to Prince Philip. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor This is the sixth time Holyrood has been recalled in its
short history but the first occasion MSPs have been brought back during an
election campaign. That is only possible because of special pandemic
arrangements that mean parliament has not been formally stood down in the usual
way and MSPs continue in their roles until 5 May. There were similar tributes from Scottish party leaders when
the Queen Mother died in 2002. The Duke of Edinburgh was a regular visitor to Holyrood,
attending the royal openings of each session with the Queen whose royal palace
is next door to parliament. Election campaigning has been suspended since Friday ahead
of an important week in which postal voting begins. Labour has put back its
manifesto launch by a week. There was a more prolonged interruption to campaigning in
the devolution referendum that set up the Scottish Parliament in 1997 following
the death of Princess Diana. Prince Philip in costume for a production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun in July 1935 Prince Philip's close association with Scotland started in his school days and lasted more than 80 years. According to his headmaster's report, the prince was universally trusted and liked at Gordonstoun school in the north east of Scotland. The future Duke of Edinburgh attended the boarding school in Moray until 1939. In the early 1930s, Prince Philip of Greece, as he then was, had attended Salem School in Germany. It was founded by Dr Kurt Hahn, a German Jew who was a famous educational innovator. The school focused on military discipline and physical education, as well as academia. However, Dr Hahn fled Germany after he was arrested for speaking out against Hitler. He established Gordonstoun as the British version of Salem - and Prince Philip followed him there two terms later.

"Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday that it accepted a record penalty imposed by the country's anti-monopoly regulator. Regulators slapped a $2.8bn fine after a probe determined that it had abused its market position for years. The fine amounts to about 4% of the company's 2019 domestic revenue. Alibaba Group's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai indicated that regulators have taken an interest in platforms like Alibaba as they grow in importance. ""We're happy to get the matter behind us, but the tendency is that regulators will be keen to look at some of the areas where you might have unfair competition,"" he told an investor call on Monday. The company added that it was not aware of any further anti-monopoly investigations by Chinese regulators, though it signalled that Alibaba and its competitors would remain under review in China over mergers and acquisitions. Chinese regulator slaps huge fine on tech giant Chinaâs tech giants face new anti-monopoly rules The race to create the world's next super-app The main issue for regulators was that Alibaba restricted merchants from doing business or running promotions on rival platforms. The company said it would introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs faced by merchants on e-commerce platforms. ""With this penalty decision we've received good guidance on some of the specific issues under the anti-monopoly law,"" Mr Tsai said. The group does not expect any material impact on its business from the change of exclusivity arrangements imposed by regulators. The message from Alibaba today in its investor call was: we may be the biggest and the first Chinese tech firm to attract regulators' attention - but we are by no means the last. Alibaba executives sought to reassure investors that they are playing ball with the regulators. They're going to make it cheaper for businesses to sell on their platform, and not force them to pick and choose between platforms - a practice seen by some in the industry as a case of ""it's my way or the highway"". So far, Alibaba says, the discussions with regulators have been amicable, and the statement from the firm on accepting the penalty is markedly contrite. It may also be heaving a sigh of relief. The 4% of 2019 revenue penalty is a record fine, but for Alibaba, which has a huge war chest, it's a drop in the ocean. But there will be more oversight and scrutiny of it and other firms. The e-commerce giant indicated that while for now Alibaba is in the clear in terms of future investigations, the same could not be said for other firms in this sector. Chinese tech firms are a powerful force in the country, and Beijing is keen to regulate them. Alibaba's experience is a sign of more of the same to come. The penalty is the latest in a chain of events targeting the company that kicked off last October, after its co-founder Jack Ma criticised regulators, suggesting they were stifling innovation. Shortly after the speech, Chinese regulators scuppered the share market launch of Ant Group, which is Alibaba's sister company and China's biggest electronic payments provider. However, some commentators noted thatregulators had legitimate concerns aboutAnt Group's consumer finance arm. Ant Group was expected to be last year's biggest share market launch on the Hong Kong exchange. But Alibaba isn't the only Chinese company to come under scrutiny by China's increasingly assertive regulators. Last month, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it had fined 12 companies over 10 deals that violated anti-monopoly rules. The companies included Tencent, Baidu and Didi Chuxing - which are among China's largest tech companies.

"Stormont's Executive Office has formally pledged to pay for a Troubles pension scheme, a court has been told. The Department of Finance will make the necessary funding available to ensure eligible victims and survivors receive compensation. The move was expected after agreement was reached earlier this month on this coming year's budget. The estimated outlay for the scheme, over the next 20 years, could be up to Â£1.2bn. Belfast High Court had been hearing a case brought by Brian Turley, one ofthose known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early 1970s. He brought the case seeking a judgement to ensure a financial package was put in place. In correspondence to the High Court, the Department of Finance has guaranteed payments will be made. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives A letter sent on behalf of the Executive Office stated that ""the payment is an entitlement as indicated by the court, and regardless of whether it comes from Westminster or from our block grant, it will be paid when it is due"". It added that First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy ""undertake on behalf of their respective departments that payments will be made to successful applicants"". When the Department of Justice requests funding, the Executive Office is to be provided with the required money by the Department of Finance ""without delay"". ""The Executive Office will then, on receipt of such funding, make the necessary grants to the Department of Justice in response to its requests for funding,"" the letter stated. Discussions between Stormont and the Northern Ireland Office are continuing over whether there will be any additional funding from London to help foot costs. The letter added: ""Ministers will continue to progress financial discussions with the Northern Ireland Office on the basis that it remains their shared view that the scheme should be funded by the Westminster government as an addition to the block grant, and in a manner consistent with the Statement of Funding Policy."" Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan agreed that a ""satisfactory"" undertaking had been received by the court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former NI secretary Julian Smith described the move as ""very good news"" and said the executive ""ultimately took the right decision"". The court undertaking provides certainty to the thousands who will apply for a pension. There was inevitability about what has just happened becauseearlier this year the court ruled that Stormont was liable for the scheme, Political agreement of the 2021-22 Stormont budget also paved the way for Monday's undertaking. But it does not settle a behind-the-scenes dispute between Belfast and London. Some NI ministers have questioned the pension's affordability without extra cash coming from the British government. Negotiations continue over Stormont's request for additional cash outside the block grant to help foot the bill. Thousands of people who were physically or mentally injured on a permanent basis will apply for sums of up to Â£10,000 a year. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated another 40,000 people were injured. The Troubles explained,external The pensions scheme was drawn up in 2019 by the UK government, when the Stormont assembly was not functioning. The scheme aims to provide pension-like payments to victims of the Troubles, every year for the rest of their lives, with payments ranging from Â£2,000 to Â£10,000. Upon their death, a spouse or carer will get the payments for a further 10 years. Victims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010 Victims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010, the date that responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to Stormont. That can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example. The scheme will also be open to those injured in incidents that took place outside Northern Ireland. The pensions will be backdated to 2014 - the date when they were first agreed, in principle, by the Stormont parties under the Fresh Start Agreement. Older victims, over the age of 60, may opt to receive a lump sum rather than annual payments. A judge-led board will decide who qualifies for the scheme, with the government insisting it would only apply to people who were injured ""through no fault of their own"". Alan McBride of the Wave Trauma Centre, whose wife Sharon was killed in the 1993 IRA Shankill bomb, said the campaign for the pension started 13 years ago. ""The uncertainty that surrounded this pension was increasing the trauma for people that have been campaigning for this,"" he said. ""We've lost about four or five members in that time through ill health and old age, so to have this over the line is a really, really good news story."" First Minister Arlene Foster said it was a ""very welcome day"" for those set to benefit from the pension, adding that ""the uncertainty for victims is now over"". ""It has been a deeply frustrating journey towards this point, but I welcome that we have finally achieved agreement to confirm that the pension will be paid when it falls due to recipients,"" she said. Ulster Unionist Doug Beattie said the negotiations for extra cash may continue but ""injured victims should not be punished any longer"". ""The executive must move immediately to provide certainty around application and payment dates, as well as how those who have waited longest might be prioritised within the scheme,"" he said. SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly welcomed the news but said that there would be many victims and survivors who ""will be wary of accepting the words of politicians"". ""People who have suffered severe physical and mental injury over the course of conflict here have waited for far too long for recognition and redress,"" she said, adding that the first and deputy first ministers must now set out what will happen next.

"David Cameron replaced Gordon Brown as prime minister after the 2010 general election Labour's Gordon Brown says former prime ministers ""must never"" lobby government for commercial purposes, amid a row over the conduct of his successor. David Cameron has been criticised for contacting ministers via text on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital. The Tory former prime minister broke his silence on the controversy on Sunday, saying he should have contacted ministers through ""formal"" channels. But he said he had not broken codes of conduct or rules on lobbying. Undercurrent guidelines,external, former ministers and senior civil servants are banned from lobbying for two years after they leave government, a rule Mr Cameron followed. Lessons to be learnt over lobbying role - Cameron In full: David Cameron's Greensill statement Sunak texts to Cameron released in lobbying row David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? But Mr Brown - who was prime minister from 2007 to 2010 - said: ""Former prime ministers must never be lobbying for commercial purposes. Current ministers should not be entertaining such lobbying."" ""It simply brings public service into disrepute,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He suggested that if the existing rules cannot be made to work, new laws should be passed to stop former ministers lobbying for five years after leaving office. Labour has said ""many serious questions remain unanswered"" after Mr Cameron's statement and he should be quizzed in Parliament. It follows a series of newspaper reports over Mr Cameron's lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital, where he began working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left No 10. The firm was founded by Australian financier Lex Greensill, who worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron's government. The reports revealed that Mr Cameron had texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers over access to government-backed emergency loans during the Covid pandemic. Mr Cameron said he had been trying to involve Greensill Capital in the government's CCFF (Covid Corporate Financing Facility) initiative, launched at the start of the crisis. Mr Cameron rejected calls to comment on the affair until Sunday, when he released a statement to the media. In it, Mr Cameron said he believed it had been ""right"" for him to contact government on behalf of Greensill Capital, as it was ""involved in financing a large number of UK firms"" at a time of ""crisis for the UK economy"". But he said he understood the ""concern"" caused by how he had chosen to make contact with government figures. ""There are important lessons to be learnt,"" he added. ""As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation."" For three weeks the headlines kept coming. For three weeks David Cameron said nothing. And now this - the former prime minister admits he made a dud judgement call. Forget the rules; this is about the sniff test. Does it smell bad? Does it feel right? Plenty had been saying no it doesn't, and now David Cameron appears to agree. It's a lengthy statement from him, worthy of detailed examination. But it boils down to this: he acknowledges texting and ringing the chancellor and going for a private drink with the health secretary, as part of his paid work for a private company, was a bad idea. There's another point worth making too: journalism matters. The work of the Financial Times and the Sunday Times, ferreting out awkward truths, is what has prompted this. In his statement, Mr Cameron added: ""In my representations to government, I was breaking no codes of conduct and no government rules."" He said that his suggestions about Greensill and the CCFF scheme were ultimately ""not taken up"". He also said he had had ""very little to do"" with Lex Greensill during the financier's time working as a government adviser. He added that Mr Greensill had been brought in as a government adviser by then-Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, in 2011. ""As I recall, I met him twice at most in the entirety of my time as prime minister,"" he added. ""The idea of my working for Greensill was never raised, or considered by me, until well after I left office,"" he added. Lex Greensill was an unpaid government adviser The company recently collapsed, with the loss of 440 jobs. Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs Parliament's Liaison Committee, said the lobbying row had revealed a ""very casual"" culture in the relationship between those at the top of government and business. ""This is pretty devastating, this is pretty corrosive,"" he told the Today programme. He added: ""I am not going to pass judgment on David Cameron, I think in some respects it's a distraction. ""What is more important is not who is lobbying, and even if you have a five-year ban as suggested by Gordon Brown, is it OK for an ex-prime minister to start lobbying after six years? ""You can't make laws stretch far into the future to bind people to previous employment, it just doesn't work."" Labour's Rachel Reeves said: ""The events unfolding over the last few weeks stretch across government and affect thousands of people. ""Transparency and accountability are crucial and that requires the utmost openness from government to establish the full facts behind this scandal.""

But he recalls the experiences of a man who was jailed at the age of 17 but who found a  ""new direction"" in life through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Scheme. Ms Davidson tells the chamber Prince Philip served: Ruth Davidson begins: ""Grief is the price we pay for love."" The Scottish Conservative's Holyrood leader says this in recognition of the huge sense of loss the Queen must be feeling right now. Ms Davidson goes on to say the duke was a moderniser in life as well as work. Nicola Sturgeon says she ""always enjoyed"" her conversations  with the Duke and describes him as a ""thoughtful man, deeply interesting and fiercely intelligent."" The first minister adds: ""He was also a serious bookworm, which I am too, so talking about the books we were reading was often for me a real highlight of out conversation."" She praises his passion for conservation, contribution to charity and hailed the success of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Ms Sturgeon adds it provides ""opportunity, hope and inspiration"" in more than 100 countries across the world. The duke led an ""extraordinary life"", the first minister added.

The first minister highlights Prince Philip's distinguished military career for which, alone, ""he is owed a significant debt of gratitude"". But she adds the Second World War was just the beginning of his life of public service - as he went on to become the longest-serving consort in British history. Ms Sturgeon says that his role ""can't have been an easy one, particularly for one who is spirited and energetic by temperament"". She also points out that he was the husband of a powerful woman at a time when it was ""even more of an exception than it is today."" Ms Sturgeon adds: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was devoted to supporting the Queen. ""They were a true partnership."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the tributes paid to the Prince Philip show the affection he was in held in in Scotland, the UK and around the world. Ms Sturgeon expressed her deepest sympathy to the Queen, her children and the wider royal family. She said he had ""already led a life of distinction"" before he became a public figure.

Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh gets proceedings under way by calling for MSPs to observe a minute's silence, as a mark of respect to Prince Philip. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor This is the sixth time Holyrood has been recalled in its
short history but the first occasion MSPs have been brought back during an
election campaign. That is only possible because of special pandemic
arrangements that mean parliament has not been formally stood down in the usual
way and MSPs continue in their roles until 5 May. There were similar tributes from Scottish party leaders when
the Queen Mother died in 2002. The Duke of Edinburgh was a regular visitor to Holyrood,
attending the royal openings of each session with the Queen whose royal palace
is next door to parliament. Election campaigning has been suspended since Friday ahead
of an important week in which postal voting begins. Labour has put back its
manifesto launch by a week. There was a more prolonged interruption to campaigning in
the devolution referendum that set up the Scottish Parliament in 1997 following
the death of Princess Diana. Prince Philip in costume for a production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun in July 1935 Prince Philip's close association with Scotland started in his school days and lasted more than 80 years. According to his headmaster's report, the prince was universally trusted and liked at Gordonstoun school in the north east of Scotland. The future Duke of Edinburgh attended the boarding school in Moray until 1939. In the early 1930s, Prince Philip of Greece, as he then was, had attended Salem School in Germany. It was founded by Dr Kurt Hahn, a German Jew who was a famous educational innovator. The school focused on military discipline and physical education, as well as academia. However, Dr Hahn fled Germany after he was arrested for speaking out against Hitler. He established Gordonstoun as the British version of Salem - and Prince Philip followed him there two terms later. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburghâs enduring connection with Scotland Tributes have been paid in Scotland to the Duke of Edinburgh following his death at the age of 99. Political leaders have expressed their condolences and parties havesuspended their Holyrood election campaigns. Flags have been lowered at the Scottish Parliament, which will be recalled shortly so MSPs can pay tribute to Prince Philip. The organisers of the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme described him as ""a remarkable man"". The Scottish Parliament is being recalled at 11:00 to allow MSPs to pay tribute to Prince Philip. Scotland's political partiessuspended campaigning on Fridayfor the Holyrood election on 6 May following the Duke of Edinburgh's death. Campaigning is due to resume on Tuesday. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh said it was only fitting that MSPs should be able to pay their respects when parliament is recalled.

"Parliaments across the UK were recalled early to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip died on Friday, aged 99 The House of Lords reflected on the duke as a ""modernising monarch"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised his ""commitment to young people"", with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calling him a ""rock"" for the Queen Memories were also shared in Holyrood, Stormont and the Senedd Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Lucy Webster and Sinead Wilson Prince William says the duke was ""extraordinary"" while Prince Harry says he was the ""legend of banter"". MPs, peers and politicians returned to parliaments across the UK today to pay tribute to Prince Philip, who died on Friday at the age of 99. Many had their own personal memories of the duke, but some themes recurred again and again:  We are bringing today's live page to a close, but you cancontinue to watch the tributes from the House of Commons on BBC Parliament. Thank you for joining us. Deputy Commons Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing says she will not share the advice Prince Philip gave her when she was president of the Student Union at Edinburgh University. She says she has never shared what he told her, but she has ""never forgotten"" it. He was ""kind, charming and absolutely inspiring"", she adds. ""As many people have said [Prince Philip] has made such a difference to the lives of so many young people. I was one of them."" Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she met the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions when she was leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council. She recalls a lunch at Windsor Castle when she sat next to the prince and chatted about his role in its restoration after it was damaged in a fire. She says the conversation led to a discussion of the planned restoration of the House of Commons and, ""in his rather peppery way"", he expressed doubt that MPs would ""settle themselves down and  find a way forward"". She says these roles gave her a ""bird's eye view"" of the Queen and Prince Philip's ""extraordinary commitment to duty"". The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, says the duke's death is a key moment for the life of the country. But, she adds, it is first and foremost a deeply personal moment for the Queen. The last year has highlighted the importance of family like never before, she says, and the prince's death will resonate with ""many more families up and down the country who are also mourning the loss of loved ones"". Ms Lucas says the duke was a champion of the environmental movement ""long before it was fashionable"" and he acknowledged what he called ""a moral duty to protect those other species"". She says she appreciated his impatience for change. Conservative Sir Bill Cash tells MPs that when he heard of the death of Prince Philip, he walked to his local church and tolled the bell 99 times. He describes the prince as ""a polymath, a pathfinder with a purpose and a sharp wit"" who ""did not do political correctness"". He recalls watching the Queen and Prince Philip's wedding on television in 1947  and says ""it was a golden moment after six years of war and austerity."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent As Duke of Edinburgh,
Prince Philip was a member of the House of Lords, and although he didn't speak in debates, there were plenty of
peers with personal experiences to relate and stories to tell, from decades of
royal events. Among the tributes, Archbishop Justin Welby
recalled theological cross-examination over Sunday lunch, after preaching a
sermon at Sandringham. A long list of peers who had taken part in the Duke of Edinburghâs Awards Scheme
described the self-confidence it had given them. Lady Grey-Thompson the Paralympian
and Chairman of the UK Awards, said the prince had been delighted to see the positive impact on  young offenders. There was also deep sympathy for the Queen. Labourâs leader, Baroness Smith, said all public figures needed the support of their partner and he had
provided that  for decades. The former Presiding Officer of the Northern
Ireland Assembly said the duke had even been on hand when the Queen shook hands with
the former IRA leader Martin McGuinness, a key figure in an organisation which had
murdered Lord Mountbatten, who had been a second father to him. Lord Janvrin, a former private secretary to the Queen spoke
of his key role behind the scenes in the Royal Family âadvising, cajoling,
reconciling.â History, he said, would judge him kindly. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrating their silver anniversary in 1972 at Balmoral Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says the prince had ""a life-long love for Scotland"" developed during his education at Gordonstoun and strengthened through visits to Balmoral. He tells MPs that while at the school, the future prince was ""universally liked, trusted and respected"". He says the Duke of Edinburgh will be remembered ""above all as the  Queen's enduring, loyal and supportive consort"". ""As a nation, we mourn the loss of a great public service,"" he concludes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, says the nation ""owes a great debt"" to Prince Philip for his military and royal service. She tells MPs that she met the duke when he visited Northern Ireland during her tenure, when he was ""well into his 90s"" but still energetic. On one visit, they were at a market that had seen repeated violence, yet he was content to get lost in the crowd. The duke suffered ""deep personal loss"" at the hands of the IRA, who killed his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, she said. Yet he played a part in reconciliation in Northern Ireland, meeting Martin McGuiness and later welcoming him at Windsor. ""For that we should all express our sincere gratitude,"" says Ms Villiers. ""The Duke of Edinburgh was famous for his plain-speaking,"" says Labour's Hilary Benn. The Labour MP says when the prince discovered that the parliament of Ghana only had 200 members, he quipped: ""That's about the right number, we have 650 and most of them are a complete bloody waste of time."" He notes that Prince Philip had been making public comments for over 70 years. ""Which one of us would be able to do that for seven decades without saying something we would come to regret,"" he asks. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says Prince Philip's death resonates with many people in Wales at ""this time of great loss"". She says the duke had a strong connection with Wales and was stationed as an instructor at a naval base there during the Second World War. She notes the navy camp became one of Billy Butlins' holiday camps after the war and the Queen and the duke toured it in an open top Land Rover during a later visit. She praises the prince's contribution to the promotion of outdoor education for young people and says the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme has  enriched the lives of millions. This video can not be played Prince Charles has said his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, ""would have been amazed by... the touching things that have been said about him."" He was speaking from Highgrove House on Saturday, the day after Prince Philip died, aged 99, at Windsor Castle. Labour's Yvette Cooper says, in his early life, Prince Philip had gone ""from royal to refugee to royal once more"". She praises his ability to keep on working into his 90s and recalls the duke's visit to her own constituency. He described himself as ""the world's most experience plaque opener"", she tells MPs. She also recalls her own experience of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, saying: ""Our sleeping bags were soggy and it poured all night. ""But in the morning, the sun shone and we loved it."" Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent Peers have been paying their respects to Prince
Phillip today in the House of Lords. Here are some of the highlights from their memories of him: The DUP's Westminster leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says Prince Philip took ""real pride"" in the fact that young people from ""all kinds of backgrounds in Northern Ireland"" took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award programme. He says that many young lives were ""shaped and influence by that scheme"". Mr Donaldson also expresses the hope that the Queen will be able to ""draw on her faith"" as she grieves. Of the prince, he says, ""as a nation we will miss him, in Northern Ireland we salute his memory"". This video can not be played Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams gave her last speech in the House of Lords in 2016 While listening to the tributes to Prince Philip in the Commons, we have just learned of thedeath of  the veteran politician and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Shirley Williams, at the age of 90. Originally a Labour MP, the former cabinet minister was part of the ""Gang of Four"" who quit the party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She was seen as a groundbreaking figure at a time when few women sat in Parliament. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, says the Duke of Edinburgh brought  much distinction to everything that he did. He notes that Prince Philip did not shy from speaking his mind, even if this  included telling business leaders ""to pull their fingers out"" and do the right thing. He says he didn't expect quite the level of ""outpourings of fondness"" there had been over the last few days - particularly from the younger generation. And he said the duke represents ""the passing of the greatest generation that was prepared to sacrifice everything so the rest of us could live in peace and prosperity"". Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, tells MPs about meeting the prince when, as a teenager, he completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The prince asked him what skill he had learnt when doing the award. ""I told him proudly I had learnt to drive and the duke asked 'with four or six horses?' ""He pretended to be surprised when I said, no sir, a car."" Sir Ed concludes by telling MPs that the prince was ""far more than a companion"" and someone who should be celebrated for his ""courage, insight and determination to show real leadership on the environment"". Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent Dressed in black, MPs began by standing with their heads bowed for a minute's silence in memory of Prince Phillip. But their tributes to him are not at all sombre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a man who loves words (and has sometimes got into trouble for them) - recalled the Duke admitting to ""dontopedalogy"" or the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, who was wearing Highland dress, remembered the Duke's love of Balmoral - and his loathing of over-long speeches. And the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, recounted taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme when he was 14 - wandering around Dartmoor as part of a small team, trying desperately to find his way. ""If that doesn't prepare you for politics,"" he said, ""nothing will."" Well over 100 MPs want to speak in this debate, so it is likely to last well into the evening. The Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, says in many ways, Prince Philip was ""ahead of his time"" - urging people more than five decades ago to recognise the importance of protecting the environment. Ms Harman says the duke was also ahead of his time as a husband and in his relationship with the Queen, saying he ""sought never to eclipse her, only to support her"" at a time  when the expectation was that the man would play the leading role. Supporting the Queen ""took him into uncharted territory and left him exposed"", she adds. But he was an example of an ""even more remarkable man"" who choose to support a woman leader, rather than take the main role himself. Â© 2025 BBC.

Shoppers have been out in force as High Street stores reopened in England and Wales. Pub gardens and marquees have been filled with friends and family raising a glass to their new-found freedom while snow fell and sun shined across a chilly England. There have been haircuts, nail extensions, gym sessions, swims and car washes along with rollercoaster rides and trips to the zoo.

Surge testing is being rolled out in parts of Wandsworth and Lambeth in South London, after cases of the South Africa variant were found. All identified cases are
     isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been
     traced and asked to isolate. Everyone aged 11 and over who lives or works in, or travels through the two London boroughs is being ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 PCR test, whether they are
showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms
should book a free test online or by phone so they can get tested at a testing
site or have a testing kit sent to them at home. Those without symptoms should
visit their local authority website for more information. NHS Test and Trace said it was the largest
     surge testing operation to date. As we move into the evening on the first night that pubs have been open in England for months, police say they have extra patrols to make sure everyone sticks to coronavirus restrictions. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metâs lead for Covid-19 response, says:âThe Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyoneâs safety and to disrupt any criminal activity.

As many return to their local pub for the first time in months, one landlord says he's had 5,000 bookings for his outdoor seating area. Scott Westlake, who runs the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, says: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything."" This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. People in the north west of England are making the most of the easing of lockdown restrictions. In Chester, one woman told the BBC being able to socialise ""lifts everyone's spirits"". ""People are fed up with lockdown and keen to get back to normal,"" she says. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lockdown easing is 'lifting everyone's spirits' Some shops in England and Wales will be keeping their doors open later than usual tonight, to allow for more people to visit safely. Rules introduced by the government for the easing of lockdown measures let them open until 22:00 six days a week. They can also open from 07:00. The idea is that businesses can start to recover and customers have more time to shop and can avoid peak times. Those staying open late tonight include shopping centres such as Westfield in Stratford, London, and Sheffield's Meadowhall complex. Oxford Street store Selfridges is also open late as are chain stores like Primark. And pubs and restaurants offering outdoor seating no longer have a 22:00 curfew, meaning customers can stay for longer - no doubt there will be a few sore heads come Tuesday morning. Shoppers returned to London's Oxford Street UK High Street footfall was down 24.2% today against a comparable day in April 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures show. The data is from the retail consultancy Springboard up to 17:00 BST after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Stores remain shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data showed visits to retail parks were up 1.7%, while shopping centres were down 16.7%. For all shopping destinations in the UK footfall was down 16.2%.And there was regional variation, with Central London down 55%, coastal towns down 16% and market towns down 3.5%. The South East and South West of England saw declines of 4.8% and 7.8% respectively. While the East Midlands saw an 8% decline. Here's our report from High Streets around England and Wales as shops opened for the first time in more than three months. Thanks for joining us today, on the day lockdown restrictions have eased further in England and Wales. Here are some of the main headlines of the day. A holiday home that hosted stays during lockdown has been forced to close and its owner and guests have been fined. Castle House in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, has flouted Covid-19 laws by staying open since the start of January, police say. Owner Scott Richardson was fined Â£7,000 and 62 visitors also were given fixed penalty notices. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court ordered Mr Richardson to close the let until 20 June. Insp Dave Parker, from Derbyshire Police, says: ""The nearly 100 complaints received by the force over a relatively short period of time shows just how disruptive, as well as dangerous, this holiday let has been.""

Now that outdoor hospitality has reopened, Michael from Chichester in West Sussex wanted to know: ""Can Covid-19 be transmitted through someone's exhaled cigarette smoke/vaping?"" It is possible to become infected by breathing in somebody elseâs second-hand smoke or exhaled vapour - both of which can transport coronavirus particles on microscopic droplets of water vapour exhaled from the lungs. In fact, the risk could even be heightened â with some scientists believing the virus might travel considerably further this way than when exhaled in normal breath. However, a study found that the increased risk of virus transmission for the majority of vapers was much less than the increased risk from talking or coughing. Government guidance for smokers,externalsays it's difficult to gauge the risk to individuals - and, in the absence of specific evidence, recommends that vapers err on the side of caution and avoid breathing out clouds of vapour in the presence of others.

One of Britain's leading imams has urged Muslim households to resist the urge to mix as the month of Ramadan begins and insists that getting a vaccine would not break the fast. Qari Asim is senior imam of the Makkah Masjid, in Leeds, and chairman of Mosques & Imams National Advisory Board (Minab). He says: ""The message from Muslim religious leadership is that one should not miss the opportunity to take the vaccine when they are invited to do so."" Imam Asim told the PA news agency ""the tide has turned"" for vaccine hesitancy.

The number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France has increased by 78 to a new 2021 record of 5,916. The French health ministry also reported 385 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. There had been 176 on Sunday. France has recorded 8,536 new cases, taking the total to 5,067,216. A nightclub in Omsk, Russia, in February Confusion and complacency in addressing Covid-19 means it is ""a long way"" from over, says the head of the World Health Organization. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said on Monday, in comments reported by Reuters news agency, that the situation can be brought under control in months if proven public health measures are adopted. ""We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,"" Tedros says. ""But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying â and it's totally avoidable. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."" He adds transmission is being driven by ""confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures"". In some countries, restaurants and nightclubs are full, with few people taking precautions, he says. ""Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19,"" Tedros says. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO team leader on Covid-19, adds it is a ""critical point in the pandemic"", with the trajectory ""growing for the seventh week in a row"". By Oliver Smith, BBC News Newquay Zoo is opening its doors for the first time in five months. The keepers have been wearing different coloured jackets around the zoo to get
the animals used to seeing lots of different people again. Throughout lockdown, theyâve had to take care of the animals and
staff, with no money coming in at the gates. They canât wait to get people
through the doors. Part of a group of three zoos, its sister site in Torquay
closed down last year, and Newquay came close to it too.  Dave Folland says it's a hugely important day for Newquay Zoo ""Itâs a hugely important day for us,"" says Dave Folland, the zooâs operations manager. ""All the way through, weâve had people in, weâve had the animals to look after, and weâve had no income to do that, so having our guests back in today and having them here enjoying the zoo, as well as bringing in an income so that we can move forward again as a business, is fantastic."" Before... The prime minister has wasted no time in getting his sometimes unruly hair under control as hairdressers reopen in England. Boris Johnson is famous for his shock of blond hair but the wind played havoc with his overgrown locks on a trip to Truro last week. But, as he emerged from Downing Street earlier his hair looked noticeably shorter. Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had his hair trimmed this morning before joining MPs in Parliament to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Johnson had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers but he postponed his plans for a pint in the wake of Prince Philip's death on Friday. After... Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst More than 167 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have now been delivered in China, making it the country with the second largest number of vaccinations in the world - behind the US on 187 million. China's total would equate to about 12% of its population but last week the official Peopleâs Daily signalled that the majority of vaccine recipients had also received second doses, and that statistically, the percentage of the population fully vaccinatedwas still in the single digits,external. China says it needs 70-80% of its population vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity and has ambitious plans to vaccinate 40% of the population by the end of June. But it is struggling to see uptake. On average, some three to four million vaccine doses are being administered per day, even though national newspaper Global Times says China hascapability to administer 10 million shots daily,external. This is partly due to China being slow to include the elderly in its vaccination programme. A significant proportion of Chinaâs population are over 60, owing to decades of birth controls under the now-abolished one-child policy. Over-60s have only just begun receiving vaccines, and there is still caution over widespread rolloutdue to there being insufficient data on how this demographic will respond in clinical trials,external. But there are also more general, human nature concerns about vaccine safety. Last week, official broadcaster CCTV tried to dispel fears about getting vaccinated, noting there wereconcerns among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs vaccines,external. It also noted there was a general resistance to getting vaccinated due to China having its Covid-19 situation largely under control andmany not feeling it was ""necessary"",external. The latest coronavirus statistics have been published and they show a further 3,568 positive cases recorded in the UK. There have also been another 13 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. There have been another 69,223 first doses of coronavirus vaccine given and 189,665 further second doses.  Publicans have welcomed being able to reopen under today's stage of lockdown easing but are warning the industry is on its knees. Pubs in England can serve outdoors but need to fully open without restrictions as soon as possible, they say. ""No pub is expecting to profit from reopening outdoors, and many will make a loss,"" says Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. Some 2,500 pubs are estimated to have closed for good in 2020. ""Pubs are the heart of our communities and we've all missed them. If they are to survive the long-term it's imperative they fully recover,"" says McClarkin. Pubs are expecting to sell about 15 million pints in the first week of reopening - about a quarter of what they would normally sell in an April week. Just two out of five pubs are reopening on Monday, the association says. Wales has taken another step out of lockdown, with travel restrictions further relaxed from today. But what does this mean? Well, one main change is that the border between England and Wales has reopened, with people allowed to travel in either direction. The rules actually state you are allowed to leave Wales to travel to ""other parts of the UK and the Common Travel Area"" (which covers the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands). But currently only essential travel is allowed into Scotland and Northern Ireland - so you can only go to those countries if you have a valid reason such as work, education or childcare.

Queue of shoppers outside TK Maxx in Cardiff on Monday morning ""We haven't been able to do any shopping for the kids since actually December,"" said one man, queuing outside St David's shopping centre in Cardiff. Another said it was ""good to see everyone out supporting the local shops"". ""We got some things to take back from Christmas,"" she added. A third said she was ""absolutely thrilled"" that all shops could reopen and she was looking for ""bargains"". ""It's getting back to normality and, hopefully, people getting back to what they used to do,"" she said. James Waugh, director at St David's, said: ""We're following government guidelines, we hope people are going to be kind, maintain social distancing, we've got capacity management, so there may be occasions where we have to ask people to queue outside, but we're expecting steady progress and people to come back."" With the lockdown easing for many businesses for the first time since December, shoppers have been asked to stay safe and respect staff,after a rise in reports of abuse. Hannah Burson, who owns a shop in Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said the past year had been ""awful"", having to close and reopen the business and furlough most of her 10 staff. ""We did have a busy summer, which was great but it was short-lived,"" she said. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? She branched out into online sales, but added ""it isn't exactly keeping the business going"". ""It's kept people noticing us and remembering that we're here and that we will be reopening. But in terms of sales, nothing like when we're open. This video can not be played Non-essential shops in Wales are opening for the first time since December With bills mounting and a government loan to repay, she is hoping to capitalise on tourism from England. ""I really hope we'll have a mad rush, it'll be great. We really need to sell some stock so we're hoping it will be busy yet safe,"" she said. Many retailers with bricks and mortar stores have been in crisis since before the pandemic. Increased online shopping, high costs of rent and rates and rising wage bills have put pressure on those companies that have a heavy presence on high streets. Covid-19 has added to their woes with stores being closed for months at a time often during traditionally peak trading periods. Some of the biggest names in the industry have faced serious challenges, including John Lewis, Topshop, House of Fraser and Peacocks. Debenhams is reopening - but only for a closing down sale, bringing an end to more than 200 years of trading on the high street. The brand will continue online. The latest British Retail Consortium figures show Wales had the sharpest decline in footfall of any UK nation or region compared with 2019. Before the pandemic, 23,000 jobs were lost in Welsh retail and wholesale between 2009 and 2019. The restrictions put in place due to Covid have magnified the challenges ahead for an industry that was already facing significant transformation. Aneeka Hearn says customers are really keen to get back through the doors Aneeka Hearn, sales manager at a jewellers in Swansea, said: ""People are getting married still, engaged, people are still having birthdays and special occasions and a lot of people haven't been able to go on their cruises and holidays, so they want to spend their money on something nice to treat themselves and have something to look forward to."" There is some concern there could be a reluctance in shoppers to return to Wales' high streets, after a year of buying things online. In the Vale of Glamorgan, the Shop Local Penarth campaign is encouraging residents to support their local traders, who have faced tough times. A new virtual marketplace for the town's independent shops and businesses has been launched to give shoppers the opportunity to buy from their favourite local traders online in one place. Angelina Hall says consumer habits changed ""rapidly"" in the past year Chair of the Penarth Business Group, Angelina Hall, said: ""The increase of online shopping has accelerated, and our high streets need to understand that a new blended way of shopping is now being demanded."" Anna Knight, who owns a lifestyle and homeware shop in Cardiff, said that after a ""really difficult three months"" she was confident that shoppers would come back. ""Our shop has always been about the experience... you want to browse around,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Joy"" as beauty salons reopen after lockdown Sarah Bruton, who runs Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly, said it was an ""emotional day"" being able to see clients for beauty treatments for the first time in months. ""Every stage has been a battle in terms of the local lockdown, we couldn't bring our clients from outside the local area - that had a huge impact, and campaigning for funding for the beauty industry, which hasn't always been in place,"" she said. ""So it's really just being here today is such a huge relief."" Nicole Gooding, salon manager at Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty, Cardiff, said changes had been made to adhere to Covid rules and ""make sure everyone is as safe as possible"". ""I'm just so excited to catch up with everyone... just to see all our lovely clients' faces again,"" she said. Shoppers queue outside Debenhams in Cardiff for its closing down sale Nick Ireland, divisional officer of shop workers' union Usdaw, said those who have been furloughed are looking forward to being back at work and ""to get a sense of normality and certainty in their lives"". But he reminded customers: ""We're still in a pandemic. It's about shopping safely, keep that 2m distance, wear a face covering, make sure you wash your hands, pay with a card if you can. ""Be polite to shop workers. You're in somebody's workplace, treat them as you would expect to be treated in your own workplace and be patient."" A canal hire company on the Wales-England border said the next few months would be very demanding With people allowed to travel over the border into England, many will be able to see friends of family outside after months of being unable to see them. Carl Cowlinshaw, who runs a narrowboat hire company which has about 120 boats in England and Wales, said it had been a ""very busy day"". Mr Cowlinshaw said many people wanted to travel to enjoy ""some of the Welsh wonders"" from the Llangollen canal, but people were still being cautious. ""They'll be zipping all over the place from today,"" he said. ""Schools are about keeping pupils safe,"" said head teacher Huw Powell Monday sees a full return to schools and further education and university campuses will be able to provided blended face-to-face and online learning for students, according to Welsh governmentCovid regulations,external. Huw Powell, headteacher of Mary Immaculate High School in Cardiff, said the plan was to ""maintain some kind of normality"". ""Schools are about keeping pupils safe,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""Education is at the heart of what we do, and that has got to continue, and that social opportunities come under that umbrella of mental health - this is something that we have focused on quite strongly."" The Welsh Conservatives have previously accused the Welsh government of a U-turn over the reopening of non-essential shops. Their leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said a decision to allow shops to open on the same day as England could have been made earlier. He said this had caused ""frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has described a ""lack of a level playing field for small non-essential retail"" during the pandemic. He accused the Welsh government of ""badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them"". Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, had accused the Welsh government of ""throwing many small shops and high streets under a bus"". ""The Welsh Labour government has treated the High Street with complete contempt,"" she said. The Welsh government defended its plan for reopening retail, saying: ""We recognise everyone wants certainty to be able to plan for the future and that businesses want to be open and trading. That's why the first minister has set out a plan to bring Wales out of alert level four lockdown. ""We cannot move directly and fully into alert level three in one step,"" a spokesperson said.

"Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday that it accepted a record penalty imposed by the country's anti-monopoly regulator. Regulators slapped a $2.8bn fine after a probe determined that it had abused its market position for years. The fine amounts to about 4% of the company's 2019 domestic revenue. Alibaba Group's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai indicated that regulators have taken an interest in platforms like Alibaba as they grow in importance. ""We're happy to get the matter behind us, but the tendency is that regulators will be keen to look at some of the areas where you might have unfair competition,"" he told an investor call on Monday. The company added that it was not aware of any further anti-monopoly investigations by Chinese regulators, though it signalled that Alibaba and its competitors would remain under review in China over mergers and acquisitions. Chinese regulator slaps huge fine on tech giant Chinaâs tech giants face new anti-monopoly rules The race to create the world's next super-app The main issue for regulators was that Alibaba restricted merchants from doing business or running promotions on rival platforms. The company said it would introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs faced by merchants on e-commerce platforms. ""With this penalty decision we've received good guidance on some of the specific issues under the anti-monopoly law,"" Mr Tsai said. The group does not expect any material impact on its business from the change of exclusivity arrangements imposed by regulators. The message from Alibaba today in its investor call was: we may be the biggest and the first Chinese tech firm to attract regulators' attention - but we are by no means the last. Alibaba executives sought to reassure investors that they are playing ball with the regulators. They're going to make it cheaper for businesses to sell on their platform, and not force them to pick and choose between platforms - a practice seen by some in the industry as a case of ""it's my way or the highway"". So far, Alibaba says, the discussions with regulators have been amicable, and the statement from the firm on accepting the penalty is markedly contrite. It may also be heaving a sigh of relief. The 4% of 2019 revenue penalty is a record fine, but for Alibaba, which has a huge war chest, it's a drop in the ocean. But there will be more oversight and scrutiny of it and other firms. The e-commerce giant indicated that while for now Alibaba is in the clear in terms of future investigations, the same could not be said for other firms in this sector. Chinese tech firms are a powerful force in the country, and Beijing is keen to regulate them. Alibaba's experience is a sign of more of the same to come. The penalty is the latest in a chain of events targeting the company that kicked off last October, after its co-founder Jack Ma criticised regulators, suggesting they were stifling innovation. Shortly after the speech, Chinese regulators scuppered the share market launch of Ant Group, which is Alibaba's sister company and China's biggest electronic payments provider. However, some commentators noted thatregulators had legitimate concerns aboutAnt Group's consumer finance arm. Ant Group was expected to be last year's biggest share market launch on the Hong Kong exchange. But Alibaba isn't the only Chinese company to come under scrutiny by China's increasingly assertive regulators. Last month, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it had fined 12 companies over 10 deals that violated anti-monopoly rules. The companies included Tencent, Baidu and Didi Chuxing - which are among China's largest tech companies.

"Natanz is an uranium enrichment facility about 250km south of the Iranian capital Tehran A nuclear facility in Iran was hit by ""sabotage"" a day after it unveiled new uranium enrichment equipment, the country's top nuclear official says. Ali Akbar Salehi did not say who was to blame for the ""terrorist act"", which caused a power failure at the Natanz complex south of Tehran on Sunday. Israeli public media, however, cited intelligence sources who said it was the result of an Israeli cyber-attack. Israel has not commented on the incident directly. But in recent days it has ramped up its warnings about Iran's nuclear programme. The latest incident comes as diplomatic efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal - abandoned by the US under the Trump administration in 2018 - have resumed. Why Iran's nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran's nuclear crisis in 300 words On Saturday, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated new centrifuges at the Natanz site in a ceremony that was broadcast live on television. Centrifuges are devices needed to produce enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel as well as nuclear weapons. It represented another breach of the country's undertakings in the 2015 deal, which only permits Iran to produce and store limited quantities of enriched uranium to be used to produce fuel for commercial power plants. On Sunday, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI), Behrouz Kamalvandi, said an ""incident"" had occurred in the morning involving the nuclear facility's power network. Mr Kamalvandi did not provide further details but told Iran's Fars news agency there there had been ""no casualties or leaks"". Later state TV read out a statement by AEOI head Ali Akbar Salehi, in which he described the incident as ""sabotage"" and ""nuclear terrorism"". ""Condemning this despicable move, the Islamic Republic of Iran emphasises the need for the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to deal with this nuclear terrorism,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Iran reserves the right to take action against the perpetrators,"" he added. The IAEA said it was aware of the reports of an incident but would not comment. Last July,sabotage was blamed for a fire at the Natanz sitewhich hit a central centrifuge assembly workshop. World powers don't trust Iran:Some countries believe Iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this. So a deal was struck:In 2015, Iran and six other countries reached a major agreement. Iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, hurting its economy. What is the problem now?Iran re-started banned nuclear work after former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move. Israeli public broadcaster Kan, citing unnamed intelligence sources, said the apparent power cut at the facility was caused by an Israeli cyber operation. The Haaretz newspaper also said the incident could be assumed to be an Israeli cyber-attack. Ron Ben-Yishai, a defence analyst at the Ynet news website, said that with Iran progressing towards nuclear weapons capability it was ""reasonable to assume that the problem... might not have been caused by an accident, but by deliberate sabotage intended to slow the nuclear race accelerated by the negotiations with the US on removing sanctions"". Later on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission"". ""The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow,"" he added, without referencing the Iran incident directly. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? The Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been in intensive care since Donald Trump pulled the US out of it. Under the Biden administration diplomatic efforts have been redoubled to revive it. But Mr Netanyahu has warned against a return to the deal, and declared last week that Israel would not be bound by a new agreement with Tehran. The nuclear deal only allows Iran to produce and store limited quantities of uranium enriched up to 3.67% concentration. Uranium enriched to 90% or more can be used to make nuclear weapons. Mr Trump said the accord was based on ""a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy programme"" and reinstated crippling economic sanctions in an attempt to compel Iran to negotiate a replacement. Iran, which insists it does not want nuclear weapons, refused to do so and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments under the accord. It has since accelerated the breaches in an attempt to increase pressure on the US. They have included operating advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, resuming enrichment to 20% concentration of the most fissile U-235 isotope, and building a stockpile of that material.

"The Duke of Edinburgh on a visit to Harland and Wolff in July 1977 Tributes have been paid to Prince Philip during a special sitting of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Assembly members met at midday and put on record their condolences to the Royal Family. The union flag is flying at half mast from Parliament Buildings until the end of this week. Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband,died on Friday, aged 99, and his funeralwill take place on Saturday. Speaker Alex Maskey, of Sinn FÃ©in, opened tributes by saying Prince Philip had a record of public service to which few could compare. He also paid tribute to him for establishing the Duke of Edinburgh Awards. ""His priority was on opening the door for young people to participate, whatever their background,"" he said. He also paid tribute to the ""reconciliation efforts"" over the years. Prince Philip's 73-year association with NI Northern Ireland pays tribute to Prince Philip In Pictures: Prince Philip in Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said Prince Philip's service had been carried out with ""dedication, humanity and humour"". ""A sometimes blunt humour, which we got to appreciate here, on his many occasions when he visited Northern Ireland,"" she said. A gun salute took place at Hillsborough Castle in County Down marking Prince Philip's death Mrs Foster said he ""redefined the role of a royal"" and his work with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was ""literally decades ahead of its time"". She said more than two million people had secured a Duke of Edinburgh Award, and more people from Northern Ireland had participated in the scheme than any other part of the UK. ""A true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment,"" Mrs Foster said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" over the past two decades by the Royal Family to assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland. ""I acknowledge that the Queen and Prince Philip and their family were directly impacted by the conflict and regrettably endured sorrow and pain as a result of their personal loss and their bereavement,"" she said. Michelle O'Neill acknowledges the impact of Northern Ireland's conflict on the Royal Family ""Yet having endured such personal loss, the Royal Family set about working towards advancing peace and reconciliation."" The IRA murdered the Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, in the Republic of Ireland in 1979. Infrastructure Minister and SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon said the prince had a part to play in ""sustaining the new bond of shared endeavour across these islands"". ""We should also reflect on the role that he played alongside Queen Elizabeth in building relationships, setting aside enmity and promoting reconciliation, most visibly during their recent visit to Ireland,"" she said. The Queen and Prince Philip met Martin McGuinness, the then deputy first minister, in Belfast in 2012 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said Prince Philip had ""garnered so much respect and affection"" and he ""was a great friend to Northern Ireland"" who was ""greatly saddened by the horrors of the Troubles"". He also paid tribute to Ms O'Neill and the SDLP for their remarks regarding the duke's death. ""While we may disagree on much, those are welcome sentiments,"" he said. ""I appreciate your sympathy and reaching out to those of us who hold the union and monarchy dear."" Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said Prince Philip demonstrated what it ""means to be a supportive husband to a powerful woman"". ""He was a reformer and moderniser of the Royal Household as he encouraged more informality and less protocol and engagements, and also promoted the use of new technology, particularly television,"" she said. ""His work spanned his patronage of many charities at home and abroad."" The Green Party's Rachael Woods said he would be dearly missed by his grandchildren. ""The duke's passing reminds us to appreciate and treasure our grandparents and families when we can."" Prince Philip at Hillsborough Castle during his last official visit to Northern Ireland in 2017 Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said there would now be ""difficult, tough days for the Queen"". ""I do pray that she finds the strength to carry on in the remarkable era that has been her rule over us,"" he said. The Duke of Edinburgh was the longest-serving royal consort in British history. On Saturday,a 41-gun salute echoed across County Down from Hillsborough Castle, the Queen's official residence in Northern Ireland. Politicians around UK to pay tribute to Philip In Scotland, political parties suspended their campaigning on Friday for the Scottish Parliament election following the announcement of Prince Philip's death. The main political parties in Wales also said they would suspend campaigning for the 6 May Senedd election. Tributes to the duke are to be paid in the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments on Monday. The House of Commons, which was supposed to be on its Easter break until Tuesday, is being recalled a day early, with MPs giving their tributes to the duke from 14:30 BST. A period of national mourning will end after 17 April, when Prince Philip's funeral will take place at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. A national minute's silence will be held to coincide with the start of the funeral at 15:00 BST.

"This video can not be played Ash fell like snow on Saint Vincent following the eruptions The Caribbean island of St Vincent is likely to see further volcanic eruptions and ash fall over the coming days, experts have warned. The La SoufriÃ¨re volcano first erupted on Friday, blanketing the island in a layer of ash and forcing more than 16,000 people to evacuate their homes. Smaller explosions continued over the weekend, causing power cuts and disrupting water supplies. Emergency officials have described the landscape as a ""battle zone"". ""The volcano continues to erupt explosively with the production of copious amounts of ash,"" the University of the West Indies' Seismic Research Center said. ""Explosions and accompanying ash fall, of similar or larger magnitude, are likely to continue to occur over the next few days impacting St Vincent and neighbouring islands,"" it warned. June Shipley, who is visiting her family on the island, told the BBC there were widespread fears a larger eruption could be imminent. ""We do hear the rumblings of the volcano and we do see the smoke,"" she said. A thick layer of ash has hardened on roads and the air is polluted by dust and debris White-coloured dust has covered buildings and roads around the island, including in its capital Kingstown. The warning to expect further activity at La SoufriÃ¨re followed what officials described as an ""explosive event"" on Sunday. The emergency management organisation Nemo tweeted: ""Massive power outage following another explosive event at La Soufriere Volcano. Lightning, thunder and rumblings."" It later spoke of ""possible destruction and devastation of communities close to the volcano"", andcompared the eruption to that of 1902, the worst in St Vincent's history,externalwhen more than 1,000 people were killed. Rhiannon West, who is originally from England, lives in the south-east of St Vincent with her partner and six-month-old baby. She told the BBC about her experience: We stood outside our home on Saturday and watched as the volcano erupted and a huge billowing cloud of ash was sent into the air. It was incredible but also terrifying. Since then we've been sheltering indoors with everything closed. It's scary thinking about what we can do to protect the baby from the ash. We've put sheets around the bottom of the doors to make sure none of it gets in. We keep losing electricity, and we've had no running water since Thursday. Our local shop has run out of bottled water, and it's very scary to think we could run out ourselves. This could go on for weeks and neither of us can work because of the power supply issues. The atmosphere is just very eerie. Everything is grey with a thick layer of ash and people are scared that these eruptions could get worse. More people fled their homes on Sunday amid fears of further volcanic activity and ash fall. More than 3,000 people have been staying at government-run shelters around the island. Cruise ships have also been readied to take evacuees to nearby islands. St Lucia, Antigua and Grenada have all offered to open their borders to evacuees. A group of 130 people have already been taken to St Lucia. The volcano had been dormant since 1979 Meanwhile, Nemo urged those remaining on the island to ""be careful on the roads, which have become treacherous as a result of the ash flow"". Ash has hardened on the ground after rain showers and many homes are without water and electricity, emergency officials said early on Sunday. Some residents said power had been restored later in the day, but several areas are still in the dark. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said water supplies to most of the island had been cut off and its airspace closed because of the smoke and thick plumes of volcanic ash moving through the atmosphere. He earlier said that a lot of volcanic ash had fallen over the sea. ""We don't know how much more is going to come out... so far, we have done well in that nobody got injured, nobody is dead."" The Barbados Defence Force has been deployed to provide humanitarian assistance, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency said. Allow Twitter content?

The ash has also spread beyond St Vincent, reaching as far as Barbados which is 120 miles (190 km) to the east. People there have been urged to stay indoors and told to avoid breathing in the ash. ""This is to protect yourselves and your family,"" said Chief Medical Officer Kenneth George. People on the island of St Lucia, which is around 47 miles north of St Vincent, have been warned to expect air quality to be affected, with harmful gases potentially making it harder to breathe for people with conditions such as asthma. A satellite image of the moments following an eruption of the La SoufriÃ¨re volcano on Friday One resident of St Lucia, Olivia, told the BBC that she was worried about a possible change in wind direction and ash being carried northwards. ""I am terrified of all the effects that are unknown at this point, ash in the middle of a pandemic - no-one is prepared for that,"" she said. ""Victoria Hospital has been transformed to become the Respiratory Hospital, and is treating Covid patients"" she said, adding: ""So technically, persons suffering from the effects of ash inhalation would be on the wards with Covid patients."" The volcano had been dormant since 1979, but in late 2020 it started spewing steam and smoke and making rumbling noises. The first sign that an eruption was imminent came on Thursday evening, when a lava dome became visible on La SoufriÃ¨re. Just before 09:00 on Friday (13:00 GMT), seismologists from the University of the West Indies confirmed that an ""explosive eruption"" was under way.

"The G7 group of wealthy nations must lead a ""Herculean mobilisation"" to push for global mass vaccination against Covid, former PM Gordon Brown has said. Writing in the Guardian, Mr Brown said Â£22bn was needed to ensure yearly vaccinations for lower income countries until Covid no longer claims lives. The next G7 summit is due to take place in the UK in June. The UK government said millions of doses had been sent to developing countries under the Covax scheme. The Covax programme, run by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international groups, aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. The scheme is expected to provide enough jabs to cover more than a quarter of the developing world by the end of this year, but less than 1% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa has been immunised so far, Mr Brown said. ""Immunising the west but only a fraction of the developing world is already fuelling allegations of 'vaccine apartheid', and will leave Covid-19 spreading, mutating and threatening the lives and livelihoods of us all for years to come,"" he wrote. The G7 is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the European Union. The scheme to share vaccines with other countries G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine scheme UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nations Mr Brown said there was an urgent need for greater action and warned against ""unpredictable funding"" and ""erratic patterns of giving"". ""We need to spend now to save lives, and we need to spend tomorrow to carry on vaccinating each year until the disease no longer claims lives,"" the former Labour leader said. Deliveries of vaccine supplies under the Covax programme started in February, but there have been criticisms that it has not moved quickly enough. So far, more than 38 million doses have been delivered to around 100 countries under the scheme. The WHO hascriticised the ""shocking imbalance""in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines between wealthier and poorer nations. This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? Mr Brown said if G7 members commit to funding 60% of the vaccination fund, other wealthy countries will likely follow. The money needed is a ""fraction of the trillions"" the pandemic is costing, Mr Brown added. He said that if wealthy nations could mobilise the same moral force and urgency that inspired Live Aid in the 1980s and Make Poverty History in 2005, ""we can end our reliance on the begging bowl"" and establish global systems to deal with the pandemic. However, international aid commitments have been cut in the last year as economies struggle to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The UK government has come under fire for its decision to reduce foreign aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% -a move that would save about Â£4bn a year. This video can not be played The threat of vaccine nationalism A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise this is a global crisis requiring global solutions, which is why the UK has been a leading donor to the Covax procurement pool for vaccines. ""Millions of doses have been sent to developing countries through the Covax scheme already. With our G7 partners, we will intensify our cooperation on the health response to Covid-19, including the acceleration of global vaccine development and deployment.""

"Shoppers have been rushing back to the High Street as the latest stage of lockdown easing in England and Wales sees stores reopen Hairdressers, barbers and beauticians have been able to treat customers for the first time since 6 January Northern Ireland's stay-at-home order has been lifted after being in place for more than three months But coronavirus is ""a long way from over"", warns World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Another 13 deaths of people who have tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days are recorded in the UK A group of 187 Dutch nationals head to the Greek island of Rhodes for an experimental holiday The trip is designed to help policy-makers assess whether foreign holidays are feasible during a pandemic Edited by James Clarke and Martha Buckley Naomi Wright with dog, Otto Bear Wright, Val Pallister and Sam Jeffs enjoy a drink at Dexter and Jones gin bar in Knutsford, Cheshire Thank you for joining us on what has been a busy and eventful day. Shoppers have been out in force as High Street stores reopened in England and Wales. Pub gardens and marquees have been filled with friends and family raising a glass to their new-found freedom while snow fell and sun shined across a chilly England. There have been haircuts, nail extensions, gym sessions, swims and car washes along with rollercoaster rides and trips to the zoo. These updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Martha Buckley, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus news, have a good evening. Surge testing is being rolled out in parts of Wandsworth and Lambeth in South London, after cases of the South Africa variant were found. All identified cases are
     isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been
     traced and asked to isolate. Everyone aged 11 and over who lives or works in, or travels through the two London boroughs is being ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 PCR test, whether they are
showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms
should book a free test online or by phone so they can get tested at a testing
site or have a testing kit sent to them at home. Those without symptoms should
visit their local authority website for more information. NHS Test and Trace said it was the largest
     surge testing operation to date. As we move into the evening on the first night that pubs have been open in England for months, police say they have extra patrols to make sure everyone sticks to coronavirus restrictions. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metâs lead for Covid-19 response, says:âThe Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyoneâs safety and to disrupt any criminal activity. She says the overwhelming majority of people will act responsibly but ""where we need to take action against those who dangerously flout the rules we will do"". âBusinesses have been hit hard by this pandemic but it is important everyone plays their part in driving down the infection rate further. ""Our joint patrols with councils will continue and if we see unnecessary risks being taken, we will engage, explain the regulations and if needed take action.â Queues formed outside shops across England on the first day they opened their doors in more than three months. And Greater Manchester Police tweeted this tongue-in-cheek reminder to stick to social distancing rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As many return to their local pub for the first time in months, one landlord says he's had 5,000 bookings for his outdoor seating area. Scott Westlake, who runs the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, says: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything."" This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. People in the north west of England are making the most of the easing of lockdown restrictions. In Chester, one woman told the BBC being able to socialise ""lifts everyone's spirits"". ""People are fed up with lockdown and keen to get back to normal,"" she says. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lockdown easing is 'lifting everyone's spirits' Some shops in England and Wales will be keeping their doors open later than usual tonight, to allow for more people to visit safely. Rules introduced by the government for the easing of lockdown measures let them open until 22:00 six days a week. They can also open from 07:00. The idea is that businesses can start to recover and customers have more time to shop and can avoid peak times. Those staying open late tonight include shopping centres such as Westfield in Stratford, London, and Sheffield's Meadowhall complex. Oxford Street store Selfridges is also open late as are chain stores like Primark. And pubs and restaurants offering outdoor seating no longer have a 22:00 curfew, meaning customers can stay for longer - no doubt there will be a few sore heads come Tuesday morning. Shoppers returned to London's Oxford Street UK High Street footfall was down 24.2% today against a comparable day in April 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures show. The data is from the retail consultancy Springboard up to 17:00 BST after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Stores remain shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data showed visits to retail parks were up 1.7%, while shopping centres were down 16.7%. For all shopping destinations in the UK footfall was down 16.2%.And there was regional variation, with Central London down 55%, coastal towns down 16% and market towns down 3.5%. The South East and South West of England saw declines of 4.8% and 7.8% respectively. While the East Midlands saw an 8% decline. Here's our report from High Streets around England and Wales as shops opened for the first time in more than three months. Thanks for joining us today, on the day lockdown restrictions have eased further in England and Wales. Here are some of the main headlines of the day. A holiday home that hosted stays during lockdown has been forced to close and its owner and guests have been fined. Castle House in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, has flouted Covid-19 laws by staying open since the start of January, police say. Owner Scott Richardson was fined Â£7,000 and 62 visitors also were given fixed penalty notices. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court ordered Mr Richardson to close the let until 20 June. Insp Dave Parker, from Derbyshire Police, says: ""The nearly 100 complaints received by the force over a relatively short period of time shows just how disruptive, as well as dangerous, this holiday let has been.""

Now that outdoor hospitality has reopened, Michael from Chichester in West Sussex wanted to know: ""Can Covid-19 be transmitted through someone's exhaled cigarette smoke/vaping?"" It is possible to become infected by breathing in somebody elseâs second-hand smoke or exhaled vapour - both of which can transport coronavirus particles on microscopic droplets of water vapour exhaled from the lungs. In fact, the risk could even be heightened â with some scientists believing the virus might travel considerably further this way than when exhaled in normal breath. However, a study found that the increased risk of virus transmission for the majority of vapers was much less than the increased risk from talking or coughing. Government guidance for smokers,externalsays it's difficult to gauge the risk to individuals - and, in the absence of specific evidence, recommends that vapers err on the side of caution and avoid breathing out clouds of vapour in the presence of others.

One of Britain's leading imams has urged Muslim households to resist the urge to mix as the month of Ramadan begins and insists that getting a vaccine would not break the fast. Qari Asim is senior imam of the Makkah Masjid, in Leeds, and chairman of Mosques & Imams National Advisory Board (Minab). He says: ""The message from Muslim religious leadership is that one should not miss the opportunity to take the vaccine when they are invited to do so."" Imam Asim told the PA news agency ""the tide has turned"" for vaccine hesitancy. He said: ""More and more people from black and Asian ethnic minorities, including Muslims, are now taking up the vaccine. ""The credit goes to the community champions, religious leadership, and NHS workers."" Read more on Ramadan and vaccineshere.

The number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France has increased by 78 to a new 2021 record of 5,916. The French health ministry also reported 385 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. There had been 176 on Sunday. France has recorded 8,536 new cases, taking the total to 5,067,216. A nightclub in Omsk, Russia, in February Confusion and complacency in addressing Covid-19 means it is ""a long way"" from over, says the head of the World Health Organization. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said on Monday, in comments reported by Reuters news agency, that the situation can be brought under control in months if proven public health measures are adopted. ""We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,"" Tedros says. ""But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying â and it's totally avoidable. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."" He adds transmission is being driven by ""confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures"". In some countries, restaurants and nightclubs are full, with few people taking precautions, he says. ""Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19,"" Tedros says. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO team leader on Covid-19, adds it is a ""critical point in the pandemic"", with the trajectory ""growing for the seventh week in a row"". By Oliver Smith, BBC News Newquay Zoo is opening its doors for the first time in five months. The keepers have been wearing different coloured jackets around the zoo to get
the animals used to seeing lots of different people again. Throughout lockdown, theyâve had to take care of the animals and
staff, with no money coming in at the gates. They canât wait to get people
through the doors. Part of a group of three zoos, its sister site in Torquay
closed down last year, and Newquay came close to it too.  Dave Folland says it's a hugely important day for Newquay Zoo ""Itâs a hugely important day for us,"" says Dave Folland, the zooâs operations manager. ""All the way through, weâve had people in, weâve had the animals to look after, and weâve had no income to do that, so having our guests back in today and having them here enjoying the zoo, as well as bringing in an income so that we can move forward again as a business, is fantastic."" Before... The prime minister has wasted no time in getting his sometimes unruly hair under control as hairdressers reopen in England. Boris Johnson is famous for his shock of blond hair but the wind played havoc with his overgrown locks on a trip to Truro last week. But, as he emerged from Downing Street earlier his hair looked noticeably shorter. Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had his hair trimmed this morning before joining MPs in Parliament to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Johnson had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers but he postponed his plans for a pint in the wake of Prince Philip's death on Friday. After... Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst More than 167 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have now been delivered in China, making it the country with the second largest number of vaccinations in the world - behind the US on 187 million. China's total would equate to about 12% of its population but last week the official Peopleâs Daily signalled that the majority of vaccine recipients had also received second doses, and that statistically, the percentage of the population fully vaccinatedwas still in the single digits,external. China says it needs 70-80% of its population vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity and has ambitious plans to vaccinate 40% of the population by the end of June. But it is struggling to see uptake. On average, some three to four million vaccine doses are being administered per day, even though national newspaper Global Times says China hascapability to administer 10 million shots daily,external. This is partly due to China being slow to include the elderly in its vaccination programme. A significant proportion of Chinaâs population are over 60, owing to decades of birth controls under the now-abolished one-child policy. Over-60s have only just begun receiving vaccines, and there is still caution over widespread rolloutdue to there being insufficient data on how this demographic will respond in clinical trials,external. But there are also more general, human nature concerns about vaccine safety. Last week, official broadcaster CCTV tried to dispel fears about getting vaccinated, noting there wereconcerns among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs vaccines,external. It also noted there was a general resistance to getting vaccinated due to China having its Covid-19 situation largely under control andmany not feeling it was ""necessary"",external. The latest coronavirus statistics have been published and they show a further 3,568 positive cases recorded in the UK. There have also been another 13 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. There have been another 69,223 first doses of coronavirus vaccine given and 189,665 further second doses.  Publicans have welcomed being able to reopen under today's stage of lockdown easing but are warning the industry is on its knees. Pubs in England can serve outdoors but need to fully open without restrictions as soon as possible, they say. ""No pub is expecting to profit from reopening outdoors, and many will make a loss,"" says Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. Some 2,500 pubs are estimated to have closed for good in 2020. ""Pubs are the heart of our communities and we've all missed them. If they are to survive the long-term it's imperative they fully recover,"" says McClarkin. Pubs are expecting to sell about 15 million pints in the first week of reopening - about a quarter of what they would normally sell in an April week. Just two out of five pubs are reopening on Monday, the association says. Wales has taken another step out of lockdown, with travel restrictions further relaxed from today. But what does this mean? Well, one main change is that the border between England and Wales has reopened, with people allowed to travel in either direction. The rules actually state you are allowed to leave Wales to travel to ""other parts of the UK and the Common Travel Area"" (which covers the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands). But currently only essential travel is allowed into Scotland and Northern Ireland - so you can only go to those countries if you have a valid reason such as work, education or childcare.

"This video can not be played Lockdown lifting in Liverpool: 'Light at the end of the tunnel' For the first time in months, pub gardens, shops and hairdressers have reopened in England, as rules were also eased in the rest of the UK. Shoppers flocked to the High Street, with long queues seen outside some retailers. Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to ""behave responsibly"". Northern Ireland's ""stay-at-home"" order is endingand some rules are being easedin ScotlandandWales. The PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? Live updates: Shops, gyms and pub gardens open in England 'I'm very happy to have my hairdresser back' Snow showers and chilly temperatures in parts of southern England appeared to do little to dampen enthusiasm for outdoor pints. This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. Scott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said thepub had received 5,000 bookings over the next monthfor his new outside eating and drinking area. Mr Westlake said: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least."" Groups of people sat at tables outside bars in the Northern Quarter of central Manchester Drinkers at the Still & West pub in Portsmouth came prepared for all weather Two friends enjoy a celebratory drink at the Skylight roof top bar in London Nicholas Hair, landlord and owner of the Kentish Belle pub in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said there was a ""sense of celebration"" in the early hours of Monday as it opened to midnight customers. ""I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,"" he said. Meanwhile, a town inLincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade. Several hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day. Lewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: ""We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant."" Several hospitality businesses in Louth are taking part in the scheme The prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. However, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have ahaircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons. The PM had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers Marika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday. Kelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic ""first cut"" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks. Shoppers rushed back to the High Street,as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours. 'Very excited' customers queue for reopened shops 'Everyone's raring to get back to the gym' In pictures: Shoppers and gym-goers enjoy lockdown easing Another business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton. Co-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had ""been such a long time coming"", saying: ""Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy."" This video can not be played Long queues were not going to put shoppers off from visiting their favourite High Street retailers The rule changes in England from Monday include: All shops can reopen Hairdressers, beauty salons and other close-contact services can open Restaurants and pubs are allowed to serve food and alcohol to customers sitting outdoors Gyms, spas, zoos, theme parks, libraries and community centres can all open Members of the same household can take a holiday in England in self-contained accommodation Non-essential journeys between England and Wales are allowed Up to 15 people can attend weddings and 30 can attend funerals Children can attend any indoor children's activity Care home visitors will increase to two per resident Driving lessons can resume, with tests restarting on 22 April But the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% oflicensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service. People flocked to salons after months without a haircut Thrillseekers have been enjoying the rides at Thorpe Park in Surrey In Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. Thestay-at-home message has been liftedand up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden. Queues at Primark as stores to stay open to 10pm What are the rules when I go to the pub or a restaurant? In Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays. After a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. Non-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed. This video can not be played Shopper in Liverpool: ""It means life has come back to normal again"" Families descended on London Zoo, which has also been closed for months Shoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. So will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. But this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. Will customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? Only two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. The government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish. Hospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. Demand may vary by sector. Hairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. It is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. In a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are ""a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom"". ""I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,"" he added. ""I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."" Ultimate Fitness Gym in Wallsend, north-east England, was among the businesses to have reopened early on Monday Synchronised swimmers are able to return to indoor pools, which can reopen, such as this one at Clissold Leisure Centre, north London The rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January. There is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's ""roadmap"" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. Shoppers told 'stay safe' as Welsh stores reopen Pupils begin full time return to secondary schools NI's 'stay home' order lifted as restrictions ease The next significant date is 17 May, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors. More than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.6m have had their second dose, according to thelatest government data.,external Meanwhile, 189,665 second doses were administered on Sunday - along with 69,223 first doses. Saturday marked arecord totalfor second doses, with 475,230 given, while 111,109 were first doses. A further 13 people are reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 3,568 new infections. There can be a lag in reporting coronavirus statistics during weekends. Meanwhile, surge coronavirustesting is being rolled out in areas of Wandsworth and Lambeth in south London, where cases of the South Africa variant were found.

Shoppers have been out in force as High Street stores reopened in England and Wales. Pub gardens and marquees have been filled with friends and family raising a glass to their new-found freedom while snow fell and sun shined across a chilly England. There have been haircuts, nail extensions, gym sessions, swims and car washes along with rollercoaster rides and trips to the zoo. These updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Martha Buckley, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner. Join us tomorrow for more coronavirus news, have a good evening. Surge testing is being rolled out in parts of Wandsworth and Lambeth in South London, after cases of the South Africa variant were found. All identified cases are
     isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been
     traced and asked to isolate. Everyone aged 11 and over who lives or works in, or travels through the two London boroughs is being ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 PCR test, whether they are
showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms
should book a free test online or by phone so they can get tested at a testing
site or have a testing kit sent to them at home. Those without symptoms should
visit their local authority website for more information. NHS Test and Trace said it was the largest
     surge testing operation to date. As we move into the evening on the first night that pubs have been open in England for months, police say they have extra patrols to make sure everyone sticks to coronavirus restrictions. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metâs lead for Covid-19 response, says:âThe Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyoneâs safety and to disrupt any criminal activity. She says the overwhelming majority of people will act responsibly but ""where we need to take action against those who dangerously flout the rules we will do"". âBusinesses have been hit hard by this pandemic but it is important everyone plays their part in driving down the infection rate further. ""Our joint patrols with councils will continue and if we see unnecessary risks being taken, we will engage, explain the regulations and if needed take action.â Queues formed outside shops across England on the first day they opened their doors in more than three months. And Greater Manchester Police tweeted this tongue-in-cheek reminder to stick to social distancing rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As many return to their local pub for the first time in months, one landlord says he's had 5,000 bookings for his outdoor seating area. Scott Westlake, who runs the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, says: ""If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited. ""Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything."" This video can not be played A Leeds landlord says his pub has had thousands of bookings for their outside area. People in the north west of England are making the most of the easing of lockdown restrictions. In Chester, one woman told the BBC being able to socialise ""lifts everyone's spirits"". ""People are fed up with lockdown and keen to get back to normal,"" she says. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lockdown easing is 'lifting everyone's spirits' Some shops in England and Wales will be keeping their doors open later than usual tonight, to allow for more people to visit safely. Rules introduced by the government for the easing of lockdown measures let them open until 22:00 six days a week. They can also open from 07:00. The idea is that businesses can start to recover and customers have more time to shop and can avoid peak times. Those staying open late tonight include shopping centres such as Westfield in Stratford, London, and Sheffield's Meadowhall complex. Oxford Street store Selfridges is also open late as are chain stores like Primark. And pubs and restaurants offering outdoor seating no longer have a 22:00 curfew, meaning customers can stay for longer - no doubt there will be a few sore heads come Tuesday morning. Shoppers returned to London's Oxford Street UK High Street footfall was down 24.2% today against a comparable day in April 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, latest figures show. The data is from the retail consultancy Springboard up to 17:00 BST after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Stores remain shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data showed visits to retail parks were up 1.7%, while shopping centres were down 16.7%. For all shopping destinations in the UK footfall was down 16.2%.And there was regional variation, with Central London down 55%, coastal towns down 16% and market towns down 3.5%. The South East and South West of England saw declines of 4.8% and 7.8% respectively. While the East Midlands saw an 8% decline. Here's our report from High Streets around England and Wales as shops opened for the first time in more than three months. Thanks for joining us today, on the day lockdown restrictions have eased further in England and Wales. Here are some of the main headlines of the day. A holiday home that hosted stays during lockdown has been forced to close and its owner and guests have been fined. Castle House in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, has flouted Covid-19 laws by staying open since the start of January, police say. Owner Scott Richardson was fined Â£7,000 and 62 visitors also were given fixed penalty notices. Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court ordered Mr Richardson to close the let until 20 June. Insp Dave Parker, from Derbyshire Police, says: ""The nearly 100 complaints received by the force over a relatively short period of time shows just how disruptive, as well as dangerous, this holiday let has been.""

Now that outdoor hospitality has reopened, Michael from Chichester in West Sussex wanted to know: ""Can Covid-19 be transmitted through someone's exhaled cigarette smoke/vaping?"" It is possible to become infected by breathing in somebody elseâs second-hand smoke or exhaled vapour - both of which can transport coronavirus particles on microscopic droplets of water vapour exhaled from the lungs. In fact, the risk could even be heightened â with some scientists believing the virus might travel considerably further this way than when exhaled in normal breath. However, a study found that the increased risk of virus transmission for the majority of vapers was much less than the increased risk from talking or coughing. Government guidance for smokers,externalsays it's difficult to gauge the risk to individuals - and, in the absence of specific evidence, recommends that vapers err on the side of caution and avoid breathing out clouds of vapour in the presence of others.

One of Britain's leading imams has urged Muslim households to resist the urge to mix as the month of Ramadan begins and insists that getting a vaccine would not break the fast. Qari Asim is senior imam of the Makkah Masjid, in Leeds, and chairman of Mosques & Imams National Advisory Board (Minab). He says: ""The message from Muslim religious leadership is that one should not miss the opportunity to take the vaccine when they are invited to do so."" Imam Asim told the PA news agency ""the tide has turned"" for vaccine hesitancy. He said: ""More and more people from black and Asian ethnic minorities, including Muslims, are now taking up the vaccine. ""The credit goes to the community champions, religious leadership, and NHS workers."" Read more on Ramadan and vaccineshere.

The number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France has increased by 78 to a new 2021 record of 5,916. The French health ministry also reported 385 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. There had been 176 on Sunday. France has recorded 8,536 new cases, taking the total to 5,067,216. A nightclub in Omsk, Russia, in February Confusion and complacency in addressing Covid-19 means it is ""a long way"" from over, says the head of the World Health Organization. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said on Monday, in comments reported by Reuters news agency, that the situation can be brought under control in months if proven public health measures are adopted. ""We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,"" Tedros says. ""But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying â and it's totally avoidable. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped."" He adds transmission is being driven by ""confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures"". In some countries, restaurants and nightclubs are full, with few people taking precautions, he says. ""Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they're relatively young, it doesn't matter if they get Covid-19,"" Tedros says. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO team leader on Covid-19, adds it is a ""critical point in the pandemic"", with the trajectory ""growing for the seventh week in a row"". By Oliver Smith, BBC News Newquay Zoo is opening its doors for the first time in five months. The keepers have been wearing different coloured jackets around the zoo to get
the animals used to seeing lots of different people again. Throughout lockdown, theyâve had to take care of the animals and
staff, with no money coming in at the gates. They canât wait to get people
through the doors. Part of a group of three zoos, its sister site in Torquay
closed down last year, and Newquay came close to it too.  Dave Folland says it's a hugely important day for Newquay Zoo ""Itâs a hugely important day for us,"" says Dave Folland, the zooâs operations manager. ""All the way through, weâve had people in, weâve had the animals to look after, and weâve had no income to do that, so having our guests back in today and having them here enjoying the zoo, as well as bringing in an income so that we can move forward again as a business, is fantastic.""

Boris Johnson is famous for his shock of blond hair but the wind played havoc with his overgrown locks on a trip to Truro last week. But, as he emerged from Downing Street earlier his hair looked noticeably shorter. Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had his hair trimmed this morning before joining MPs in Parliament to pay tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Johnson had previously suggested he would prioritise a visit to the pub over a trip to the hairdressers but he postponed his plans for a pint in the wake of Prince Philip's death on Friday. After...

China's total would equate to about 12% of its population but last week the official Peopleâs Daily signalled that the majority of vaccine recipients had also received second doses, and that statistically, the percentage of the population fully vaccinatedwas still in the single digits,external. China says it needs 70-80% of its population vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity and has ambitious plans to vaccinate 40% of the population by the end of June. But it is struggling to see uptake. On average, some three to four million vaccine doses are being administered per day, even though national newspaper Global Times says China hascapability to administer 10 million shots daily,external. This is partly due to China being slow to include the elderly in its vaccination programme. A significant proportion of Chinaâs population are over 60, owing to decades of birth controls under the now-abolished one-child policy. Over-60s have only just begun receiving vaccines, and there is still caution over widespread rolloutdue to there being insufficient data on how this demographic will respond in clinical trials,external. But there are also more general, human nature concerns about vaccine safety. Last week, official broadcaster CCTV tried to dispel fears about getting vaccinated, noting there wereconcerns among the public over adverse reactions and the safety and efficacy of Chinaâs vaccines,external. It also noted there was a general resistance to getting vaccinated due to China having its Covid-19 situation largely under control andmany not feeling it was ""necessary"",external. The latest coronavirus statistics have been published and they show a further 3,568 positive cases recorded in the UK. There have also been another 13 deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. There have been another 69,223 first doses of coronavirus vaccine given and 189,665 further second doses.  Publicans have welcomed being able to reopen under today's stage of lockdown easing but are warning the industry is on its knees. Pubs in England can serve outdoors but need to fully open without restrictions as soon as possible, they say. ""No pub is expecting to profit from reopening outdoors, and many will make a loss,"" says Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. Some 2,500 pubs are estimated to have closed for good in 2020. ""Pubs are the heart of our communities and we've all missed them. If they are to survive the long-term it's imperative they fully recover,"" says McClarkin. Pubs are expecting to sell about 15 million pints in the first week of reopening - about a quarter of what they would normally sell in an April week. Just two out of five pubs are reopening on Monday, the association says. Wales has taken another step out of lockdown, with travel restrictions further relaxed from today. But what does this mean? Well, one main change is that the border between England and Wales has reopened, with people allowed to travel in either direction. The rules actually state you are allowed to leave Wales to travel to ""other parts of the UK and the Common Travel Area"" (which covers the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands). But currently only essential travel is allowed into Scotland and Northern Ireland - so you can only go to those countries if you have a valid reason such as work, education or childcare.

"Nomadland star Frances McDormand (left) and director Chloe Zhao Nomadland, a drama about a woman who lives in a van in the American West after the financial crash, has taken top honours at the Bafta Film Awards. It scooped four prizes including best film, best actress for its star Frances McDormand and best director. That made Chloe Zhao only the second woman to win best director in the 53 years of the category's history. Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father, 27 years after his last competitive Bafta win. Olivia Colman stars with Sir Anthony Hopkins in The Father The 83-year-old, who won for playing a man losing his grip on reality, is the oldest ever winner of the award. But he was not watching Sunday's ceremony and later said he only found out he'd won when he heard cheering from the next room. ""I was sitting here painting, and I heard this cheer go off next door,"" he said after the ceremony. ""I thought, what the hell's happened? I thought they were watching a football match. And they came in and said I'd won."" Best film - Nomadland Best British film - Promising Young Woman Best actress - Frances McDormand, Nomadland Best actor - Sir Anthony Hopkins, The Father Best supporting actress - Yuh-Jung Youn, Minari Best supporting actor - Daniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah Best director - Chloe Zhao, Nomadland The winners and nominees in full Five takeaways from this year's Baftas Red carpet in pictures Most winners were watching live and delivered acceptance speeches remotely, with none of the nominees at the Royal Albert Hall in person. Zhao, who was born in China and is based in the US, referred to her education in the UK when she told the ceremony: ""I think I just made my teacher at Brighton College very proud."" Her win comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, and Zhao's victory means she is the first woman of colour to pick up the prize. Nomadland will be released in the UK on Disney+ on 30 April. South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn won best supporting actress British star Daniel Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. The supporting actress trophy went to South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn for playing a grandmother in Korean-American drama Minari. Giving her speech in broken English, the 73-year-old said the award meant a lot because Brits were ""snobbish"" people. ""Every award is meaningful, but this one especially recognised by British people, known as very snobbish people, and they approved me as a good actor so I'm very, very privileged,"" she said. Emerald Fennell said the reception for Promising Young Woman had been ""completely incredible"" The prize for best British film went to Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller about a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, who pretends to be blind drunk when men pick her up in bars and clubs. Its writer and director Emerald Fennell also won best original screenplay. She joked that everyone involved in the film had made it for ""a packet of crisps"", and said the experience was ""the greatest thing in my life"". Fennell is best known to viewers for her acting as Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Other Bafta winners included Bukky Bakray. The 18-year-old was named rising star following her first ever acting role in Rocks, in which she played a teenage schoolgirl abandoned by her mother. The low-budget film, set in east London, was the joint highest nominee along with Nomadland, with seven nominations each. Rocks also won the casting award for finding its group of largely novice young stars. Many of the young stars of Rocks, which won best casting, had not acted before Other films to win two prizes included Disney/Pixar's animated hit Soul; Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, adapted from August Wilson's play about a 1920s blues band; and Sound of Metal, which stars Riz Ahmed as a rock drummer who loses his hearing. This year's shortlists includeda diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time 16 of the 24 acting contenders came from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 21 were first-time nominees.

Co-host Edith Bowman said Prince Philip ""occupies a very special place in Bafta's history, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family"". Edith Bowman and Dermot O'Leary hosted Sunday's ceremony The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Academy Awards. Unlike the Baftas, Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders.

"Guillermo Lasso has vowed to attract foreign investment and break away from leftist policies A conservative former banker, Guillermo Lasso, has won Ecuador's presidential election following a run-off vote. His opponent, the left-wing economist AndrÃ©s Arauz, conceded defeat hours after polls closed on Sunday. With almost all the ballots counted, Mr Lasso had won 52.4% of the vote compared to Mr Arauz's 47.6%. Mr Lasso, a 65-year-old three-time presidential candidate, told supporters he accepted the ""challenge of changing our country's destiny"". ""It's a day on which all Ecuadoreans have decided their future,"" he said. ""They have used their vote to express the need for change and the desire for better days."" Ecuador country profile Ecuador timeline Mr Lasso's rival, AndrÃ©s Arauz, congratulated the winner: ""I will show him our democratic convictions,"" he said at a rally. AndrÃ©s Arauz conceded defeat even though he seemed headed to victory The 36-year-old had won the first round on 7 February by a 10-percentage-point margin and until recently had been the favourite to become president. But polls suggested Mr Lasso started to catch up with him late on in the campaign. Mr Arauz called the result ""an electoral stumble, but not a political or moral defeat"". He said it was now time to ""move on, build bridges and create consensus"". Mr Arauz's mentor, ex-President Rafael Correa, wished Mr Lasso ""lots of luck"". Mr Correa, who defeated Mr Lasso in the 2013 election, could not run for office this time afterhe was sentenced in absentia last year for corruption. Mr Lasso, who finished second in the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections, will assume office on 24 May. Supporters of Mr Lasso celebrated after his victory was announced The former banker has vowed to break away from the leftist policies of past administrations that he says have dragged Ecuador down. ""Ecuadoreans used their right to vote to choose a new course, very different to that of the past 14 years,"" he said. ""On 24 May, we will face the challenge of changing our homeland's destiny with responsibility to achieve an Ecuador which offers the opportunities and prosperity we all crave."" Mr Lasso has pledged to attract increased foreign investment, create two million new jobs and increase oil production. He has also proposed to raise the minimum monthly wage as well as introduce tax cuts for small businesses and to create a fund to stimulate entrepreneurship. While Mr Lasso is seen as representing the country's business sector, in his victory speech he tried to appeal to wider sectors of society and said he wanted his administration to listen to ""all Ecuadoreans"". He said he would ""work non-stop"" to defend the rights of women, including single mothers and pregnant teenagers, and that he would aim to end discrimination against LGBT people. ""Let's build a fairer and more prosperous country for all,"" he said. Mr Lasso will be taking over the presidency from LenÃ­n Moreno, who saw his popularity drop from 77% shortly after he was elected in 2017 to 7% in February 2020. The new president will have to deal with the twin challenges of tackling Ecuador's economic and health crises. According to Ecuador's central bank, the economy shrunk by 7.8% in 2020, and data from the National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC) showed that some half a million people remained unemployed as of January 2021. In addition to the economic turmoil, corruption accusations inside the health ministry led to an almost two-month delay in designing a national Covid-19 vaccination plan. The country is on its sixth health minister in four years after the fifth one was sacked last week. Mauro Falconi was dismissed after delays in vaccine distribution saw elderly people queuing for hours despite having been given appointments. Mr Lasso has vowed to vaccinate nine million Ecuadoreans in the first 100 days of his administration, and promised to lead ""better"" direct negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies producing the jabs. The new president will also have to woo voters who are disillusioned with Ecuadorean politics. Voting is compulsory in Ecuador, but 16.3% spoiled their ballot while another 1.6% left them blank. Indigenous leader Yaku PÃ©rez came third in the first round of the presidential election One of those who spoiled their ballot was indigenous leader Yaku PÃ©rez, who had narrowly lost out on a place in the run-off election. Mr PÃ©rez had refused to back either Mr Lasso or Mr Arauz in the second round. Mr PÃ©rez's Pachakutik indigenous movement and the UNES coalition, led by former President Rafael Correa who backed Mr Arauz, are expected to act as a powerful counterweight in the National Assembly to Mr Lasso's executive.

"This video can not be played Stores in Wales reopen to queues of eager shoppers Shoppers have been eagerly queuing in Wales' high streets as the next phase of easing the coronavirus lockdown begins. Covid rules have been relaxed to allownon-essential retail and close-contact services to resume and travel to other parts of the UK. School pupils and post-16 students are returning to classes and university students will see a mix of face-to-face and online lessons. Driving lessonsare also resuming. Queues formed outside fashion stores TK Maxx and Primark in Cardiff city centre and elsewhere, from 07:00 BST. Retail consultants Springboard said that while thousands hit high streets across Wales, footfall was 16% lower than on the same date in 2019, before the pandemic hit. Queues formed early with many shops in Wales reopening for the first time since December Covid case rateshave fallen substantially in Wales since January and now stand at 17.6 per 100,000 people. And49% of the population has been vaccinated with a first jab, according to data published by Public Health Wales on Sunday. Queue of shoppers outside TK Maxx in Cardiff on Monday morning ""We haven't been able to do any shopping for the kids since actually December,"" said one man, queuing outside St David's shopping centre in Cardiff. Another said it was ""good to see everyone out supporting the local shops"". ""We got some things to take back from Christmas,"" she added. A third said she was ""absolutely thrilled"" that all shops could reopen and she was looking for ""bargains"". ""It's getting back to normality and, hopefully, people getting back to what they used to do,"" she said. James Waugh, director at St David's, said: ""We're following government guidelines, we hope people are going to be kind, maintain social distancing, we've got capacity management, so there may be occasions where we have to ask people to queue outside, but we're expecting steady progress and people to come back."" With the lockdown easing for many businesses for the first time since December, shoppers have been asked to stay safe and respect staff,after a rise in reports of abuse. Hannah Burson, who owns a shop in Hay-on-Wye, Powys, said the past year had been ""awful"", having to close and reopen the business and furlough most of her 10 staff. ""We did have a busy summer, which was great but it was short-lived,"" she said. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Shop owners 'treated like children' over reopening What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? She branched out into online sales, but added ""it isn't exactly keeping the business going"". ""It's kept people noticing us and remembering that we're here and that we will be reopening. But in terms of sales, nothing like when we're open. This video can not be played Non-essential shops in Wales are opening for the first time since December With bills mounting and a government loan to repay, she is hoping to capitalise on tourism from England. ""I really hope we'll have a mad rush, it'll be great. We really need to sell some stock so we're hoping it will be busy yet safe,"" she said. Many retailers with bricks and mortar stores have been in crisis since before the pandemic. Increased online shopping, high costs of rent and rates and rising wage bills have put pressure on those companies that have a heavy presence on high streets. Covid-19 has added to their woes with stores being closed for months at a time often during traditionally peak trading periods. Some of the biggest names in the industry have faced serious challenges, including John Lewis, Topshop, House of Fraser and Peacocks. Debenhams is reopening - but only for a closing down sale, bringing an end to more than 200 years of trading on the high street. The brand will continue online. The latest British Retail Consortium figures show Wales had the sharpest decline in footfall of any UK nation or region compared with 2019. Before the pandemic, 23,000 jobs were lost in Welsh retail and wholesale between 2009 and 2019. The restrictions put in place due to Covid have magnified the challenges ahead for an industry that was already facing significant transformation. Aneeka Hearn says customers are really keen to get back through the doors Aneeka Hearn, sales manager at a jewellers in Swansea, said: ""People are getting married still, engaged, people are still having birthdays and special occasions and a lot of people haven't been able to go on their cruises and holidays, so they want to spend their money on something nice to treat themselves and have something to look forward to."" There is some concern there could be a reluctance in shoppers to return to Wales' high streets, after a year of buying things online. In the Vale of Glamorgan, the Shop Local Penarth campaign is encouraging residents to support their local traders, who have faced tough times. A new virtual marketplace for the town's independent shops and businesses has been launched to give shoppers the opportunity to buy from their favourite local traders online in one place. Angelina Hall says consumer habits changed ""rapidly"" in the past year Chair of the Penarth Business Group, Angelina Hall, said: ""The increase of online shopping has accelerated, and our high streets need to understand that a new blended way of shopping is now being demanded."" Anna Knight, who owns a lifestyle and homeware shop in Cardiff, said that after a ""really difficult three months"" she was confident that shoppers would come back. ""Our shop has always been about the experience... you want to browse around,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Joy"" as beauty salons reopen after lockdown Sarah Bruton, who runs Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly, said it was an ""emotional day"" being able to see clients for beauty treatments for the first time in months. ""Every stage has been a battle in terms of the local lockdown, we couldn't bring our clients from outside the local area - that had a huge impact, and campaigning for funding for the beauty industry, which hasn't always been in place,"" she said. ""So it's really just being here today is such a huge relief."" Nicole Gooding, salon manager at Lemon Tree Nails and Beauty, Cardiff, said changes had been made to adhere to Covid rules and ""make sure everyone is as safe as possible"". ""I'm just so excited to catch up with everyone... just to see all our lovely clients' faces again,"" she said. Shoppers queue outside Debenhams in Cardiff for its closing down sale Nick Ireland, divisional officer of shop workers' union Usdaw, said those who have been furloughed are looking forward to being back at work and ""to get a sense of normality and certainty in their lives"". But he reminded customers: ""We're still in a pandemic. It's about shopping safely, keep that 2m distance, wear a face covering, make sure you wash your hands, pay with a card if you can. ""Be polite to shop workers. You're in somebody's workplace, treat them as you would expect to be treated in your own workplace and be patient."" A canal hire company on the Wales-England border said the next few months would be very demanding With people allowed to travel over the border into England, many will be able to see friends of family outside after months of being unable to see them. Carl Cowlinshaw, who runs a narrowboat hire company which has about 120 boats in England and Wales, said it had been a ""very busy day"". Mr Cowlinshaw said many people wanted to travel to enjoy ""some of the Welsh wonders"" from the Llangollen canal, but people were still being cautious. ""They'll be zipping all over the place from today,"" he said. ""Schools are about keeping pupils safe,"" said head teacher Huw Powell Monday sees a full return to schools and further education and university campuses will be able to provided blended face-to-face and online learning for students, according to Welsh governmentCovid regulations,external. Huw Powell, headteacher of Mary Immaculate High School in Cardiff, said the plan was to ""maintain some kind of normality"". ""Schools are about keeping pupils safe,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""Education is at the heart of what we do, and that has got to continue, and that social opportunities come under that umbrella of mental health - this is something that we have focused on quite strongly."" The Welsh Conservatives have previously accused the Welsh government of a U-turn over the reopening of non-essential shops. Their leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said a decision to allow shops to open on the same day as England could have been made earlier. He said this had caused ""frustration in the sectors worst hit by the pandemic and will put more Welsh jobs at risk"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has described a ""lack of a level playing field for small non-essential retail"" during the pandemic. He accused the Welsh government of ""badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them"". Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, had accused the Welsh government of ""throwing many small shops and high streets under a bus"". ""The Welsh Labour government has treated the High Street with complete contempt,"" she said. The Welsh government defended its plan for reopening retail, saying: ""We recognise everyone wants certainty to be able to plan for the future and that businesses want to be open and trading. That's why the first minister has set out a plan to bring Wales out of alert level four lockdown. ""We cannot move directly and fully into alert level three in one step,"" a spokesperson said.

"If you want a visa to China, it'll be easier with a Chinese jab China's top disease control official has said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines is low, in a rare admission of weakness. In a press conference, Gao Fu added that China was considering mixing vaccines as a way of boosting efficacy. China has developed four different vaccines approved for public use, though some trials abroad had suggested efficacy as low as 50%. Mr Gao later said his comments had been misinterpreted. More than 100 million people in China have received at least one shot of the vaccine. Beijing has insisted the jabs are effective and said in March that obtaining visas would be easier for foreigners who have received a Chinese vaccine. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday said at a conference the current vaccines ""don't have very high rates of protection"". He suggested that the China was considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines, as a way of boosting efficacy. Mr Gao explained that steps to ""optimise"" the vaccine process could include changing the number of doses and the length of time. He also suggested combining different vaccines for the immunisation process. But he later appeared to backtrack on his comments, telling state media Global Times that ""protection rates of all vaccines in the world are sometimes high, and sometimes low"". ""How to improve their efficacy is a question that needs to be considered by scientists around the world,"" he told the paper. He added that his earlier admission that Chinese vaccines had a low protection rate were a ""complete misunderstanding"". What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? Covid-19: The disinformation tactics used by China Coronavirus - what's gone wrong in Brazil? Mr Gao's original and later comments have been largely unreported by Chinese media. His original comments however, attracted some criticism on social media site Weibo, with commenters suggesting that he should ""stop talking"". With little data released internationally, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain. Brazilian trials of the Sinovac vaccine CoronaVac for instance,showed an efficacy rate of around 50.4%, which is barely over the 50% threshold needed for regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO). China has vaccinated millions of its people with the local jabs Interim results from late-stage trials in Turkey and Indonesia however, had suggested the efficacy rate of the Sinovac shot to be between 91% and 65%. Western vaccines like the ones by BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna have an efficacy rate of around 90% or higher while the UK's AstraZeneca jab is thought to be around 76%. So far, Sinovac's CoronaVac jab has only been fully authorised for use by China. But Beijing is also offering its vaccines around the world and has already shipped millions of doses to a number of countries. In Asia, the biggest takers are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan, while in the Americas, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador have also ordered millions of shot. In Europe, Turkey and Ukraine have signed large contracts for CoronaVac. The vaccine is thought to be particularly important for African countries where so far Zimbabwe, Somalia, Djibouti, Benin and Tunisia have received vaccines from China. This video can not be played What do we know about the Chinese vaccines? China's vaccines though differ significantly from some vaccines, especially those developed by Pfizer and Moderna. Developed in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. By comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond. The UK's AstraZeneca vaccine is yet another type of vaccine where a version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees is modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the real virus. One significant advantage of the Chinese vaccines is that they can be stored in standard refrigerators at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at -20C and Pfizer's vaccine at -70C. The AstraZeneca vaccine though can also be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.
