"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt calls the seizure of the Stena Impero âstate piracy"" The foreign secretary has repeated his call for the release of a British-flagged ship and its crew detained in the Gulf by the Iranian military. The Iranian Revolutionary Guardcaptured the Stena Imperoand its 23 crew members in the Gulf on Friday. Jeremy Hunt told MPs it was an act of ""state piracy"". Mr Hunt said the UK would develop a maritime protection mission with other European nations to allow ships to pass through the area safely. The foreign secretary secured support for the initiative from both French and German foreign ministers on the phone on Sunday evening, the BBC has been told. Addressing the Commons after a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee, Mr Hunt said he spoke with a ""heavy heart"" but if Iran continued to act as it had, it would have to accept a ""larger Western military presence"" along its coastline. The seizure of the Stena Impero in the key shipping route of the Strait of Hormuz came after Tehran said the vessel violated international maritime rules. Crew members on the British-flagged vessel are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino Iran's state-run news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. Mr Hunt said the ship was illegally seized in Omani waters and forced to sail into Bandar Abbas port in Iran, where it remains. Although the crew and owners are not British, the Stena Impero carries the British flag so the UK owes protection to the vessel, maritime analysts said. Gulf crisis uniquely difficult moment for UK Iran releases images of tanker captives Iran-UK radio exchanges over tanker emerge The seizure was the latest in a string of acts leading to escalating tensions between Iran and the UK and US. Earlier this month Royal Marines helped toseize tanker Grace 1 off Gibraltar, because of evidence it was carrying Iranian oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Royal Marines helped to detain a ship suspected of carrying Iranian oil to Syria in early July Mr Hunt said that vessel was detained legally, but Iran said it was ""piracy"" andthreatened to seize a British oil tankerin retaliation. In a statement to MPs in the Commons, Mr Hunt said the UK would seek to create a European-led mission to ensure safe passage of international vessels in the Gulf. ""Freedom of navigation is a vital interest of every nation,"" he said. US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. But the UK's protection mission would not include the US because, Mr Hunt insisted, Britain was not part of President Trump's policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards US-Iran relations: A brief history The initiative would build on existing structures in the region such as the US Navy-led Combined Task Force 150, the BBC has learned. Instead of focusing on tackling terrorism and the illegal drugs trade like the Combined Task Force 150, the new scheme would have a mandate to ensure freedom of navigation of international ships, the Foreign Office explained. The mission would be implemented ""as quickly as possible"" but in the meantime the destroyer HMS Duncan has been sent to help keep British ships and crews safe in the region, Mr Hunt told the Commons. Iran's seizure of a British-flagged tanker followed the detention of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar Mr Hunt said the UK had sought to de-escalate the situation but there would be ""no compromise"" on freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz. Bob Sanguinetti, CEO of the UK Chamber of Shipping, welcomed the announcement of the mission but said it was ""imperative"" the government protected British-flagged ships in the Gulf in the meantime. Mr Hunt encouraged commercial shipping companies in the region to follow advice issued by the Department for Transport to help reduce ""risks of piracy"", because it was ""not possible for the Royal Navy to provide escorts for every single ship"". Britain needs help in the Gulf if it is to ensure the safety of its merchant shipping. A concerted effort with other countries doesn't just bring extra warships, it also dilutes the sense of bilateral confrontation between London and Tehran. And in fairness, given the wider tensions in the region, there is a more general threat to merchant vessels plying the Strait of Hormuz. The proposed European maritime force also has the benefit of not being organised by the US. The Trump administration has been touting its own plans for a maritime protection force for several weeks with few takers. Countries do not want to be seen as joining what might appear to be a US coalition against Iran. However, as the foreign secretary notes, there will be a need to see how this European effort might complement US proposals. Washington has intelligence and surveillance capabilities that might prove essential. This though remains an idea rather than a fully-fledged plan of action.

"England's only NHS youth gender clinic lowered the age at which it offers children puberty blockers, partly based on a study now being investigated. The study's full findings have not been published - but early data showed some taking the drugs reported an increase in thoughts of suicide and self-harm. The clinic said data was from a ""small sample"" and so no ""meaningful conclusion"" could be drawn from it. Children as young as 11 are now being offered these hormone-blocking drugs. Experts on clinical trials have criticised the design of the study, which they say makes it hard to tell if the reported effects were due to the puberty blockers or something else. But experts said they warranted further investigation. The Health Research Authority - which ensures medical studies are ethical and transparent - is now investigating claims brought to them by the BBC's Newsnight programme about the early findings from the study - and the information that is understood to have been shared with patients and parents about the possible effects of puberty blocking drugs. Transgender kids 'need help from all sides' Transgender teen care 'needs regulation' NHS child gender reassignment 'too quick' When a child in the UK is questioning their gender, they can be referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London and Leeds. One treatment on offer is puberty blockers. They work on the brain to stop the eventual release of oestrogen or testosterone - the sex hormones that increase during puberty. This prevents the development of sex characteristics such as periods, breasts or voice-breaking. Before 2011, Gids would give puberty blockers to children only once they had turned 16. But as gender clinics around the world began providing blockers to those who had just begun puberty, reports grew of UK children going overseas to buy the drugs. And in 2011, a medical study was approved through which younger children could access these drugs. Acknowledging the weak evidence for the drugs, the research team, made up of Gids and University College Hospitals staff, set out to ""evaluate the psychological, social and physical effects"" of the blockers on a carefully selected group of young people. Details about risks - such as potential adverse effects on bone strength, the development of sexual organs, body shape or final adult height - were provided in a patient information sheet. But Newsnight found certain information had not been included. Previous research had suggested,externalall young people who took the blockers went on to take cross-sex hormones - the next stage towards fully transitioning to the opposite gender. But patients and parents were not told this in the information sheet. ""I don't see that the parents and their children could really have given informed consent given the lack of information that was provided,"" said Michael Biggs, associate professor of sociology at Oxford University. Prof Biggs, who has attracted criticism from some in the transgender community for his views, added: ""They were not given the information they needed in order to take this momentous life-changing step."" He gave Newsnight a series of documents relating to the research study he had obtained via freedom of information requests, which were independently looked at. Gids, together with lead investigator Prof Russell Viner, said: ""We are confident that informed consent was obtained."" He said the ""possibility that blocking puberty may crystallise gender identity"" had been raised with the patients and parents. Preliminary data for 30 of the 44 young people on the study was made available to the Tavistock's board in 2015.It showed,externalthat after a year on puberty blockers, there was a significant increase found in those answering the statement ""I deliberately try to hurt or kill myself"". Prof Susan Bewley, who chairs Healthwatch, a charity for science and integrity in healthcare, is one of a number of doctors raising concerns about the lack of evidence in this area of medicine. She said seeing any change around suicidal thoughts ""is very worrying"". ""Good medical practice would normally be very reflective about an increase in harms,"" she added. Because of flaws in how the study was set up, it is not possible to infer cause and effect or even to say whether rates of suicidal thoughts are higher or lower in this group than in children with gender dysphoria who don't take puberty blockers. The study had no control group, of children not taking the drugs, to compare results with. In addition, the outcomes it was measuring were unclear. Nevertheless, experts say these observations should have given Gids pause for thought. Gids told Newsnight: ""All patients were seen regularly by mental health professionals. They concluded that there was no evidence of harms that could be directly attributed to the treatment and that continuation of the study was appropriate."" This early data was not shared with the Health Research Authority, despite its demands for updates on the study over a period of three years. In response to Newsnight sharing this preliminary data and other concerns about the study, Teresa Allen, chief executive of the HRA, said: ""The information that Newsnight has brought to our attention has not been raised with us before. ""We will therefore investigate further, which may include a review of the original ethics opinion."" The HRA told Newsnight they do not currently have all the information they need. They have reviewed minutes from the ethics committee that approved the study and these have not raised a specific concern. Hannah Phillips, 19, started taking puberty blockers when she was 16. She said the doctors had been clear about how little was known about the treatment and explained that it was ""in testing"". ""I don't think there could have been anything that the doctors could have said to stop me from wanting to go on to hormone blockers,"" the Youtuber told Newsnight. While acknowledging the need for more research, Ms Phillips said there shouldn't be a halt to the current rules that allowed young people access to puberty blockers. Receiving treatment ""feels as if someone's just finally listening to you"", she said. Newsnight's investigation comes amid growing concern over the way Gids is operating. Inan open letter,externallast week, former Gids clinician Dr Kirsty Entwistle raised concerns over the way puberty blockers were being presented to children as ""fully reversible"", when their long-term impact was unknown. She also said staff were unable to raise concerns without risking being branded transphobic. Tavistock and Portman Trust chief executive Paul Jenkins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Puberty blockers are reversible."" He said Gids was looking at processes to make it easier for clinicians to focus on their work, ""rather than being swayed or influenced by the very heated debate"", but concerns over staff being falsely accused of transphobia had not been raised in the organisation. However, a former Gids member of staff told Newsnight: ""Myself and countless colleagues raised concerns in all the forums available to us."" And ina statement last year,external, the trust said concerns that staff were facing allegations of transphobia revealed ""a negative attitude to... gender identity"". In 2014, despite the patchwork of information about the study - which was still running - a change in Gids' policy was approved by NHS England: children with gender dysphoria, who were just beginning puberty, could now be eligible for blockers. Gids' data suggests that between 2012 and 2018, 267 people under the age of 15 started using the blockers. The service told Newsnight the use of hormone blockers at this earlier age ""remains only available to a carefully selected group"". NHS England says the policy change followed an evaluation of the study. Newsnight has asked for a copy of this evaluation - but none was provided. An NHS England official said its ""2016 service specification for gender identity services was based on international evidence and developed with clinical experts and publicly consulted on"". ""The specification will be reviewed,"" they added, which would include ""a review of the most up-to-date research... and advice from clinical and academic experts"".

"A decision on whether controversial Chinese firm Huawei should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile phone networks in the UK has been postponed. Culture secretary Jeremy Wright said the government is ""not yet in a position"" to decide what involvement Huawei should have in the 5G network. Mr Wright said the implication ofthe recent US ban on its companiesfrom dealing with Huawei was not clear. Until it was, he said the government would be ""wrong"" to make a decision. ""We will do so as soon as possible,"" he told the House of Commons. The US banned companies from selling components and technology to Huawei and 68 related companies on 15 May, citing national security concerns. It later issued a temporary licence that enabled some companies to continue supporting existing Huawei networks and devices. Mr Wright said the US decision ""could have a potential impact on the future availability and reliability of Huawei's products, together with other market impacts, and so are relevant considerations in determining Huawei's involvement in the network"". Huawei: US ban will harm billions of users UK warned over sending 'bad signal' to China Last week, MPs said the government needed to make a decision on Huawei as ""a matter of urgency"", warning continued delays were damaging international relations. Huawei has repeatedly denied claims the use of its products presents security risks, and has said it is independent from the Chinese government. Huawei, vice president Victor Zhang said it was confident ""that we can continue to work with network operators to rollout 5G across the UK."" ""After 18 years of operating in the UK, we remain committed to supporting BT, EE, Vodafone and other partners build secure, reliable networks."" ""The evidence shows excluding Huawei would cost the UK economy Â£7bn and result in more expensive 5G networks, raising prices for anyone with a mobile device,"" he added. So yet again the key question about the UK's 5G future has been delayed. The government says it is still not clear what the Trump administration's blacklisting of Huawei really means. If there is going to be an all-out ban on US firms working with the Chinese company then that could make its products - which use some American components - unreliable in the longer term. Meanwhile UK mobile operators are getting on with the rollout of 5G - all of them using Huawei equipment. In doing so they are taking a risk because a government ban would mean they had to rip out equipment and start again at great cost. So the operators are increasingly impatient for some certainty - although it looks as though that could be some time coming unless the new Prime Minister decides that it is right at the top of his in-tray. Britain's National Security Council, chaired by outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May, met to discuss Huawei in April and a decision was made to block the firm from all critical parts of the 5G network over security concerns, but still allow it restricted access to less sensitive parts. The final decision on Huawei was then supposed to have been made public in the review of the telecoms supply chain led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which was published on Monday. The decision on 5G equipment vendors will now be made by the next prime minister. Shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport Tom Watson said the government's handling of Huawei's involvement in the future of the UK's 5G network had been defined by ""confusion"". ""Whether the government needs to ban Huawei for security reasons or not, the government has a rollout target to meet, 5G for the majority of the country by 2027. So we need clarity one way or another and government should have a plan B for meeting this target if necessary,"" he added. Mark Newman, analyst at tech research firm ConnectivityX, said so far only Vodafone and EE had switched on their 5G networks and both had used Huawei to supply their radio access networks. ""Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of telecoms equipment and leads the race in the development of 5G networks.  5G services could be impacted with the continued uncertainty over the future of Huawei in the UK,"" he said. Last month,China's ambassador to the UK warnedthat excluding Huawei from Britain's 5G network ""sends a very bad signal"". Speaking to BBC's Newsnight, Liu Xiaoming said Chinese businesses planning to invest in Britain may be put off dealing with the UK if Huawei's equipment is not used for the network.

"With the UK about to get a new prime minister, the prospect of an early election is not far-fetched. But should one be held, neither the Conservatives nor Labour could feel confident about winning an overall majority. The face of party politics in the UK has undergone a dramatic change. The deadlock over Brexit has been followed by a dramatic decline in support for both the Conservatives and Labour. As a result, the two parties' traditional dominance of the electoral landscape is facing an unprecedented challenge. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories and Labour punished in European elections for Brexit contortions When, on 15 November last year, Theresa May unveiled the deal she'd negotiated with the European Union, that dominance was still in evidence. Both parties were averaging 39% in the opinion polls. Their combined tally of 78% was only a little down on the 84% share of the vote they had jointly secured in the 2017 election, the highest proportion since 1970. Neither the Liberal Democrats nor the Greens were showing much sign of advancing on the 8% and 2% that they respectively won in 2017. At 5%, UKIP's tally was only up by three points on its poor performance at the same election. Nine months later, the picture could not be more different. True, the Conservatives and Labour are still more or less neck-and-neck - but now they each enjoy the support of just a quarter or so. UKIP's role as the principal voice of Euroscepticism has been wrested from its grasp by a new party, the Brexit Party. Its current average poll rating of 18% is as high as anything UKIP ever achieved. The Liberal Democrats also stand on 18%, their strongest position since they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Their performance seems to have snuffed out an attempt by a group of Labour and Conservative rebels to form a new ""centre"" party, Change UK. The Green Party, too, is enjoying something of a revival; its 6% support puts the party in its strongest position since the 2015 general election. The only party to have experienced little change in its fortunes is the SNP in Scotland. Five Scottish polls since the beginning of April have put the party on an average of 40% of the vote north of the border. That is just a couple of points above where the party stood in the autumn, and three points above its tally in 2017. In contrast, both the Conservatives and Labour have seen their Scottish support slip, leaving the SNP well ahead of all of its rivals. That means that not only are there as many as four parties recording substantial levels of support across Britain as a whole, but also a fifth which has a stranglehold on Westminster voting intentions in Scotland. The first signs of a crack in Conservative-Labour dominance were already in evidence when the UK failed to meet the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Support for the Conservatives fell on average by three points between mid-November and the end of March. It immediately fell by a further six points as soon as the Brexit deadline was not met. Theresa May was unable to take the UK out of the EU by the 29 March deadline Support for Labour also eased by five points during this period. Conversely, support for UKIP and the newly formed Brexit Party was beginning to rise, reaching 11% immediately after the failure to leave the EU in March. These were clear warning signs that a continuation of the Brexit impasse could well do neither the government - nor the opposition - much good. However, the pivotal moment was the European Parliament elections that had to be held in May because the UK was still in the EU. That helped put the issue of Brexit at the forefront of voters' minds. The Brexit Party, which was advocating leaving the EU without a deal, stormed into first place. Former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe was one of 29 Brexit Party MEPs elected in the European elections The Liberal Democrats, in favour of another referendum, came second. And although some of their respective supporters would not have voted the same way in a general election, many would have done so. By polling day, as many as one in five were indicating that they would vote in a general election for the Brexit Party or - in much smaller numbers - for UKIP. At the same time, support for the Liberal Democrats was now also firmly in the mid-teens. Both Labour and, especially, the Conservatives were now struggling to retain as much as a quarter of the vote. The battle for Westminster suddenly looked like a four-party rather than a two-party one. And - so far - that more or less remains the position, even though the European elections, but perhaps not Brexit, are beginning to fade in voters' memories. Support for the Liberal Democrats remains exactly where it was at the end of May, while the Brexit Party's vote has only slipped a little - by four points. Both parties hold an uncompromising position on Brexit, and their support comes almost exclusively from those on one side or other of the Brexit debate. Nearly all of the Brexit Party's support is from those who voted Leave, among whom it is the single most popular party. Support for the Liberal Democrats is predominantly from those who voted Remain, for whose support the party is evidently in close competition with Labour. The Conservatives are more popular among Leave supporters than their Remain counterparts - and the opposite is true for Labour. But both parties still secure a substantial proportion of their support from a minority who hold the opposing view. Now that many voters seem to want to use their ballot paper to express their view about Brexit, it is difficult for the Conservatives and Labour to maintain their cross-Brexit support. The apparent inability of the House of Commons to make any decision about Brexit is a problem for the new prime minister. Some suggest he will eventually find it necessary to hold a general election, to try to change the Parliamentary arithmetic. Boris Johnson says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"" However, at the moment at least, the advent of four-party politics, or - given the position in Scotland - five-party politics, does not make this an attractive prospect. Quite how the current numbers in the polls would translate into seats in Parliament is highly uncertain. Support for both the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party could be scattered so evenly across the country that they would end up winning few seats. But even bearing this possibility in mind, it is still highly unlikely that either the Conservatives or Labour would be able to win an overall majority, or even come close to one. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? A new government could find itself in much the same position as the one in which Theresa May has found herself - reliant on minority parties to remain in office and constantly at risk of Parliamentary defeat, including on Brexit. That said, all eyes will be on what happens to the polls when the new prime minister is installed. No fewer than one in four of those who voted Conservative in 2017 is currently saying they would vote for the Brexit Party. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, at least, is popular with many Brexit Party supporters. Maybe the Tories will soon be enjoying a lead in the polls thanks to a squeeze on the Brexit Party vote. That could make an early election a more attractive prospect to them. But equally, perhaps, the new prime minister will discover that Brexit Party voters are reluctant to return to the Tory fold until Brexit has actually been delivered.

"British Airways pilots have voted in favour of strike action in a dispute over pay, threatening a walkout over the key summer holiday period. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said 93% of its members had voted in favour of industrial action. A strike would be likely to cause severe disruption, as Balpa represents about 90% of the airline's pilots. BA said it was ""very disappointed"" with the decision, and is seeking an injunction to halt potential strikes. The union said it did not yet have any dates for a potential strike, adding it still hoped that the dispute could be resolved. British Airways said it remained open to working with the union to reach an agreement and continued to ""pursue every avenue to find a solution to protect our customers' travel plans and avoid industrial action"". Pilots have rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which the airline says is ""fair and generous"". However, Balpa argues that its members deserve a better offer, as BA has been making healthy profits. The vote in favour of action comes after three days of negotiations between the airline and pilots' union with conciliation service Acas. Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said the strong result in favour of action showed ""the resolve of BA pilots"" and said BA ""must table a sensible improved offer if a strike is to be averted"". ""We do not wish to inconvenience our customers, which is why we have tried to resolve this matter through negotiation starting last November. It is BA who has regrettably chosen to drag this out into the summer months,"" he added. British Airways is seeking an injunction on Tuesday in the High Court to halt any potential strike action. The union would have to give British Airways a minimum of two weeks' notice of any action, meaning the earliest any action could could take place is 6 August. Balpa said the High Court hearing meant any further negotiations ""are on hold while we prepare to defend our right to take this action"". The union argues that the the cost to BA to settle the dispute in full is ""significantly less than the cost would be of even a single day's strike action"". ""We currently do not have dates for any potential strike action and will issue an update on this in due course. We remain hopeful that this dispute can be resolved before strike action, but we remain committed to action if necessary,"" added Mr Strutton. British Airways is part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia. Last year, it reported a pre-tax profit of â¬3bn, up almost 9.8% on the previous year. British Airways contributed Â£1.96bn to that, up 8.7% on 2017. It also rewarded investors with a total dividend payout of â¬1.3bn.

The 24-year-old clocked 57.14 seconds to comfortably beat compatriot James Wilby, with China's Yan Zibei in third. Peaty is unbeaten in five years over the distance in major competitions, and will compete in the 50m on Tuesday. The semi-final saw himbreak his own world record, becoming the first man to swim the event in under 57 seconds. He aimed to beat Sunday's record-breaking time, but said he was still ""over the moon"" with 57.14. ""I had to be a better version of myself. Unfortunately I made a tiny little mistake on that first length, trying to force the speed a bit too much,"" he said. ""But the most important lesson is I'm still learning. It's not like I've gone 56 and never have to learn again. ""I'm always learning, always trying to improve and that's the most important thing we can have going into the Olympics next year."" The Briton has set the 15 best times in the 100m breaststroke, and has become the first male swimmer to achieve a trio of world titles in the event. Peaty previously shared the record of two 100m world titles with American Brendan Hansen and Hungary's Norbert Rozsa. Monday's performance means he has also become the first man to win five world championship medals in breaststroke events. He recently revealedhe practises ""active meditation"" to aid his mental health after suffering a dip following his gold-medal winning performance in the 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016 and has since backed mental health campaigns. Wilby, who qualified in third place behind Zibei, achieved his first world medal, clocking 58.46. Peaty broke his first 100m world record in 2015 at the British Championships, with his time of 57.92, making him the first man to swim the distance in under 58 seconds. Elsewhere, Britain's Luke Greenbank knocked two-tenths of a second off his personal best with a 53.75 swim in the 100m backstroke semi-final. Molly Renshaw also smashed her personal best for the second time on Monday with a time of 1.06.73 effort to qualify for the women's 100m breaststroke final. Duncan Scott is into the 200m freestyle final on Tuesday, but compatriot James Guy missed out on a place in the same event. Britain's Ben Proud failed to defend his world title, finishing seventh in the 50m butterfly final. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor finished seventh in the women's 200m individual medley - which was won by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu - and Georgia Davies missed out on a place in the women's 100m backstroke final after a 12th-place finish in the semi-final. Meanwhile, Australian swimmer Mack Horton publiclyreignited his feudwith Chinese rival Sun Yang, years after accusing him of being a ""drug cheat"". Sun pipped Olympic champion Horton to claim gold in the 400m freestyle on Sunday. Horton later refused to share the medal podium with Sun - who has faced fresh claims of violating doping protocols.

"This video can not be played A large group of masked men in white T-shirts stormed Yuen Long station Hong Kong has been left in shock after a night of violence on Sunday, which saw dozens of masked men storm a train station. The men - dressed in white shirts and suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by in the Yuen Long area. This is the first time this kind of violence has been seen in the ongoing anti-extradition demonstrations. Several lawmakers questioned why police were slow to arrive at the scene. Footage posted on social media showed dozens of men attacking people with wooden rods and metal sticks inside the station. Forty-five people were injured, with one person in critical condition.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters the gang attacks were ""shocking"". She also condemned protesters for defacing China's main representative office in the city earlier on Sunday. Pro-democracy protesters were set upon as they travelled back from a rally in the centre of Hong Kong, where riot police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. The masked men stormed Yuen Long MTR station at about 22:30 local time (14:30 GMT). Local media said they were targeting people dressed in black - the colour most protesters were wearing. Were triads involved in Hong Kong violence? What are the protests about? Profile: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam In a statement, the government said: ""This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law. The SAR [Special Administrative Region] Government strongly condemns any violence and will seriously take enforcement actions.""

The Hong Kong Journalist Association said some reporters on the scene had equipment seized. One witness - Galileo Cheng, 34 - told the BBC he had suffered several blows to his back and arms when he stepped in to try to help Ms Ho. He said he saw another woman with a baby being assaulted too. It is not known who organised the attack. Opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting suggested the mob had ties to organised crime syndicates. ""Is Hong Kong now allowing triads to do what they want, beating up people on the street with weapons?"" he asked reporters. Another pro-democracy lawmaker, Ray Chan, tweeted a complaint about the police response. ""Hong Kong has one of the world's highest cop to population ratio ... Where were [they?]"" Video footage also surfaced of pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, shaking hands with men in white and giving them the thumbs-up signal. On Facebook, he denied a connection with the men and said he was just responding to their greetings when they recognised him on the street after he left a restaurant. His office was later ransacked. Police on Monday said they had not made any arrests but were still carrying out investigations. Some of the assailants did not seem too concerned about masking their identity, posting selfies online, before during and after the attack, reported the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong Yuen Long is a centuries-old farming and trading town, which has hugely expanded in recent decades. Most of its village leaders and their clans are pro-China. On Sunday evening, people began to share photos online that showed coach loads of men in white shirts congregating in the area. Later - after the train station attacks - many of these men were seen running back to the surrounding villages, intensifying speculation that they were backed by the locals, if not hired by them. Pro-democracy demonstrators have now announced that they want to move a pre-planned rally to Yuen Long next Sunday as a reaction to the outburst of violence. Until now all rallies have been held more centrally. One villager told me that local clans are concerned by the shift, as it feels like people are ""messing around on their doorstep"". He said they consider the protesters to be thugs who need to be taught a lesson. Mass protests have been held for weeks, initially over an extradition deal with mainland China, which the Hong Kong government has since suspended. The unrest has now spread to cover broader demands for democratic reform and reflect concerns that freedoms are being eroded. This video can not be played Tear gas was fired at the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest on Sunday In a rare act, protesters defaced the liaison office, China's central government building, on Sunday. One of the graffiti slogans read: ""You taught us peaceful marches are useless."" Ms Lam strongly condemned the vandalism by ""radical demonstrators"", saying they had acted ""maliciously"" and ""challenged the nation's sovereignty"". A national emblem was splashed with paint outside the Chinese Liaison Office on Sunday Some protesters also covered CCTV cameras outside a police station with spray paint. Organisers of the protest say more than 430,000 people took part in the rally, but police put the figure at 138,000. On Saturday a counter-rally, in support of the police and against protest violence, drew 300,000 people according to organisers and 103,000 people according to police. This video can not be played ""You are fake news"" - BBC correspondent heckled live on air during Saturday's rally They were sparked by the proposed extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial. Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong's judicial independence and could be used to target those who spoke out against the Chinese government.

"The UK's telecom regulator has said Three is the only major UK mobile network to have ""refused"" to automatically cut its customers' monthly charge at the end of their contract's lock-in period. As a result, Ofcom said,the firm's subscribers would ""overpay"",externalunless they took action to change to another deal. The watchdog said it had challenged the industry to treat users more fairly. But Three said that an automatic fee change could backfire. ""We do not believe Ofcom's proposal will encourage engagement amongst consumers,"" said a spokesman for the Maidenhead, Berkshire-based network. ""Instead, it risks creating a stagnant market whereby consumers are not encouraged to shop around for the best deal at the end of their minimum term."" By contrast, Ofcom said that the other major mobile companies had given it the following commitments regarding out-of-contract customers: O2 and Virgin Mobile - will cut the monthly charge to the equivalent of a 30-day Sim-only deal Vodafone and EE - will automatically reduce prices three months after the subscribers' lock-in period expires, but have yet to say by what amount Tesco Mobile - will reduce the monthly charge to the best available airtime tariff In all cases, changes to monthly bills will only be made if they result in a lower charge. This addresses a concern that some customers might actually face higher fees by being switched to a Sim-only deal. The pledges are set to come into effect by February 2020. The regulator said it hoped the moves would help address a situation in which the industry was overcharging the public by a total of about Â£182m. According to Ofcom's estimates, 1.4 million out-of-contract mobile phone users are currently spending an average of nearly Â£11 more per month than they would if they had been switched to a comparable Sim-only deal. This situation had arisen, it explained, because initial deals typically covered both the cost of a handset and its usage. ""We're introducing a range of measures to increase fairness for mobile customers, while ensuring we don't leave existing customers worse off,"" said Ofcom's consumer group director, Lindsey Fussell, in a statement. ""All the major mobile companies - except Three - will also be reducing bills for millions of customers who are past their initial contract period."" The charity network Citizens Advice - which has long campaigned against what it has described as being a ""loyalty penalty"" - welcomed the development. ""Most mobile phone providers have now realised the game is up,"" said it chief executive Gillian Guy. ""Three needs to step up and if it doesn't, then stronger action is needed to make these changes compulsory. If Ofcom is unable to do this, then government needs to intervene."" Ofcom's announcement follows anearlier decision to force mobile phone operators - among others - to text, email or send a letterto alert subscribers when their contracts are about to expire and to inform them of alternative deals. In addition, the watchdog has said it plans to make companies tell customers what it would cost to buy a phone and its airtime separately, to help them judge whether a bundle truly offers better value. It has also proposed a new rule that would prevent firms offering split contracts - in which fees for the phone and airtime are separated - where the handset element lasts longer than 24 months.

"With the UK about to get a new prime minister, the prospect of an early election is not far-fetched. But should one be held, neither the Conservatives nor Labour could feel confident about winning an overall majority. The face of party politics in the UK has undergone a dramatic change. The deadlock over Brexit has been followed by a dramatic decline in support for both the Conservatives and Labour. As a result, the two parties' traditional dominance of the electoral landscape is facing an unprecedented challenge. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories and Labour punished in European elections for Brexit contortions When, on 15 November last year, Theresa May unveiled the deal she'd negotiated with the European Union, that dominance was still in evidence. Both parties were averaging 39% in the opinion polls. Their combined tally of 78% was only a little down on the 84% share of the vote they had jointly secured in the 2017 election, the highest proportion since 1970. Neither the Liberal Democrats nor the Greens were showing much sign of advancing on the 8% and 2% that they respectively won in 2017. At 5%, UKIP's tally was only up by three points on its poor performance at the same election. Nine months later, the picture could not be more different. True, the Conservatives and Labour are still more or less neck-and-neck - but now they each enjoy the support of just a quarter or so. UKIP's role as the principal voice of Euroscepticism has been wrested from its grasp by a new party, the Brexit Party. Its current average poll rating of 18% is as high as anything UKIP ever achieved. The Liberal Democrats also stand on 18%, their strongest position since they entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Their performance seems to have snuffed out an attempt by a group of Labour and Conservative rebels to form a new ""centre"" party, Change UK. The Green Party, too, is enjoying something of a revival; its 6% support puts the party in its strongest position since the 2015 general election. The only party to have experienced little change in its fortunes is the SNP in Scotland. Five Scottish polls since the beginning of April have put the party on an average of 40% of the vote north of the border. That is just a couple of points above where the party stood in the autumn, and three points above its tally in 2017. In contrast, both the Conservatives and Labour have seen their Scottish support slip, leaving the SNP well ahead of all of its rivals. That means that not only are there as many as four parties recording substantial levels of support across Britain as a whole, but also a fifth which has a stranglehold on Westminster voting intentions in Scotland. The first signs of a crack in Conservative-Labour dominance were already in evidence when the UK failed to meet the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Support for the Conservatives fell on average by three points between mid-November and the end of March. It immediately fell by a further six points as soon as the Brexit deadline was not met. Theresa May was unable to take the UK out of the EU by the 29 March deadline Support for Labour also eased by five points during this period. Conversely, support for UKIP and the newly formed Brexit Party was beginning to rise, reaching 11% immediately after the failure to leave the EU in March. These were clear warning signs that a continuation of the Brexit impasse could well do neither the government - nor the opposition - much good. However, the pivotal moment was the European Parliament elections that had to be held in May because the UK was still in the EU. That helped put the issue of Brexit at the forefront of voters' minds. The Brexit Party, which was advocating leaving the EU without a deal, stormed into first place. Former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe was one of 29 Brexit Party MEPs elected in the European elections The Liberal Democrats, in favour of another referendum, came second. And although some of their respective supporters would not have voted the same way in a general election, many would have done so. By polling day, as many as one in five were indicating that they would vote in a general election for the Brexit Party or - in much smaller numbers - for UKIP. At the same time, support for the Liberal Democrats was now also firmly in the mid-teens. Both Labour and, especially, the Conservatives were now struggling to retain as much as a quarter of the vote. The battle for Westminster suddenly looked like a four-party rather than a two-party one. And - so far - that more or less remains the position, even though the European elections, but perhaps not Brexit, are beginning to fade in voters' memories. Support for the Liberal Democrats remains exactly where it was at the end of May, while the Brexit Party's vote has only slipped a little - by four points. Both parties hold an uncompromising position on Brexit, and their support comes almost exclusively from those on one side or other of the Brexit debate. Nearly all of the Brexit Party's support is from those who voted Leave, among whom it is the single most popular party. Support for the Liberal Democrats is predominantly from those who voted Remain, for whose support the party is evidently in close competition with Labour. The Conservatives are more popular among Leave supporters than their Remain counterparts - and the opposite is true for Labour. But both parties still secure a substantial proportion of their support from a minority who hold the opposing view. Now that many voters seem to want to use their ballot paper to express their view about Brexit, it is difficult for the Conservatives and Labour to maintain their cross-Brexit support. The apparent inability of the House of Commons to make any decision about Brexit is a problem for the new prime minister. Some suggest he will eventually find it necessary to hold a general election, to try to change the Parliamentary arithmetic. Boris Johnson says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"" However, at the moment at least, the advent of four-party politics, or - given the position in Scotland - five-party politics, does not make this an attractive prospect. Quite how the current numbers in the polls would translate into seats in Parliament is highly uncertain. Support for both the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party could be scattered so evenly across the country that they would end up winning few seats. But even bearing this possibility in mind, it is still highly unlikely that either the Conservatives or Labour would be able to win an overall majority, or even come close to one. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? A new government could find itself in much the same position as the one in which Theresa May has found herself - reliant on minority parties to remain in office and constantly at risk of Parliamentary defeat, including on Brexit. That said, all eyes will be on what happens to the polls when the new prime minister is installed. No fewer than one in four of those who voted Conservative in 2017 is currently saying they would vote for the Brexit Party. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, at least, is popular with many Brexit Party supporters. Maybe the Tories will soon be enjoying a lead in the polls thanks to a squeeze on the Brexit Party vote. That could make an early election a more attractive prospect to them. But equally, perhaps, the new prime minister will discover that Brexit Party voters are reluctant to return to the Tory fold until Brexit has actually been delivered.

"Credit score agency Equifax has agreed to pay up to $700m (Â£561m) as part of a settlement with a US regulator following a data breach in 2017. The Federal Trade Commission had alleged the Atlanta-based firm,externalfailed to take reasonable steps to secure its network. The records of at least 147 million people were exposed in the incident. At least $300m will go towards paying for identity theft services and other related expenses run up by the victims. This sum will expand to a maximum of $425m, if required to cover the consumers' losses. The rest of the money will be divided between 50 US states and territories and a penalty paid to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It represents the FTC's largest data-breach settlement to date, topping a $148m penalty Uber agreed to last year. ""Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach,"" said the FTC's chairman Joe Simons. ""This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud."" The agency added that among the stolen information, the hackers copied: at least 147 million names and dates of birth about 145.5 million Social Security numbers a total of 209,000 payment card numbers and expiration dates The UK's Information Commissioner's Officehas already issued the company with a Â£500,000 fine,externalfor failing to protect the personal information of up to 15 million UK citizens during the same attack. Equifax had been warned in March that one of its databases - the Equifax Automated Consumer Interview System (ACIS) - suffered from a critical vulnerability, the FTC said. The ACIS was used by members of the public to check their own credit reports. But because of the way that Equifax's IT systems had evolved, it also provided a means for hackers to access other unrelated records stored by the firm. The FTC alleged that Equifax's security team ordered that the vulnerable systems be patched within 48 hours after being informed of the discovery in March 2017. But the watchdog added that the firm failed to check that this was done, and that as a consequence multiple hackers were able to exploit the flaw and steal consumers' personal details over a period of several months. To make matters worse, it said, much of the sensitive information had been stored unencrypted in plain text. As part of the settlement the FTC said that Equifax had also agreed to: carry out its own annual audit of security risks submit to an external assessment of its security efforts once every two years ensure that third-parties given access to personal data stored by the firm also have adequate data protection measures in place Los Angeles mayor to give update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Liberal Democrat leadership: Ed Davey and Jo Swinson Jo Swinson or Sir Ed Davey will be named as the next leader of the Liberal Democrats later, replacing incumbent Sir Vince Cable. The result of the pro-EU party's leadership contest is expected at around 16:00 BST on Monday. Ms Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, has been the party's deputy leader for two years and is the bookmakers' favourite. She is up against ex-energy secretary Sir Ed, MP for Kingston and Surbiton Both candidates are backing another EU referendum. Chuka Umunna, who joined the party as an MP in May, said both candidates would make a good prime minister. He told the BBC voters ""look at two main parties consumed with division"" and they want a ""solution"". Mr Umunna added: ""Our leadership contest is a good advert for what we can do for the nation. ""There is a unity of purpose, and unless you can come together and run yourselves effectively, you cannot run the country [that way]."" Latest: Lib Dem leadership contest Rivals make their pitches The leadership candidates trying to stop Brexit The Liberal Democratsbegan the processof choosing their next leader in May, as Sir Vince - who has served as leader since July 2017 - announced he would be handing over a ""bigger, stronger party"". Under Sir Vince, the Lib Dems have been at the forefront of the campaign for another EU referendum as a means of stopping Brexit. The party now has 12 MPs and won 20% of the vote share in the European elections. In theEnglish local electionsin May, they were the biggest winners of the night. The other leadership contest may have been taking place slightly under the radar in recent weeks, but Ed Davey and Jo Swinson have been taking part in hustings up and down the country trying to win votes. Ms Swinson is widely seen as the frontrunner, but it's a close call, and in policy terms, there's really not a huge amount between them. Ed Davey makes a lot of his record on climate change and the environment - his experience of working on that issue in the coalition government. Jo Swinson, on the other hand, says she's a fresh face - and as a dynamic female leader she'll better be able to cut through in the media. It'll come down to whether Lib Dem members prefer a more experienced, older hand or a newer, younger figure, less associated with some of the controversial decisions made by the coalition. Ms Swinson has previously suggested that the election of Boris Johnson as Tory leader could be an excellent recruiting tool for the Lib Dems. She believes Mr Johnson - the favourite to replace Theresa May - would be disastrous as PM, but a ""silver lining"" would be that it would be good for her party. The result of the Tory battle for Number 10 will be announced on Tuesday. Meanwhile, setting out his pitch, Sir Ed previously said the UK needs ""a new economic model"" and ""making capitalism turn green so Britain is a world green finance capital"". ""That means being tough on our banks, on the stock exchange, on the pension funds, so they take account of climate risk."" Expectations were low when Sir Vince became leader in July 2017. The party was still in the political wilderness after its hammering in the 2015 general election. It hadn't made the progress it had hoped for in 2017's snap poll, and Tim Farron had quit suddenly as leader amid uncomfortable questions over his views on faith and homosexuality. MPs weren't exactly queuing up to replace Mr Farron - Sir Vince was elected unopposed. He inherited a party that seemed to be going nowhere, fast. Almost two years later, the picture couldn't be more different. His successor - who will be announced on Monday - will take over a party with a real spring in its step and genuine optimism about the future. So how did the turnaround happen and how much credit should the outgoing leader get for it?

"This video can not be played Adam Peaty wins 100m breaststroke gold at World Aquatics Championships 2019 World Aquatics Championships Dates:12-28 JulyVenue:Gwangju, South Korea Coverage:Highlights on BBC Two, updates on BBC R5L Sports Extra, and reports on the BBC Sport website and app. Great Britain's Adam Peaty has won the 100m breaststroke at the World Championships in South Korea - his third successive gold in the event. The 24-year-old clocked 57.14 seconds to comfortably beat compatriot James Wilby, with China's Yan Zibei in third. Peaty is unbeaten in five years over the distance in major competitions, and will compete in the 50m on Tuesday. The semi-final saw himbreak his own world record, becoming the first man to swim the event in under 57 seconds. He aimed to beat Sunday's record-breaking time, but said he was still ""over the moon"" with 57.14. ""I had to be a better version of myself. Unfortunately I made a tiny little mistake on that first length, trying to force the speed a bit too much,"" he said. ""But the most important lesson is I'm still learning. It's not like I've gone 56 and never have to learn again. ""I'm always learning, always trying to improve and that's the most important thing we can have going into the Olympics next year."" The Briton has set the 15 best times in the 100m breaststroke, and has become the first male swimmer to achieve a trio of world titles in the event. Peaty previously shared the record of two 100m world titles with American Brendan Hansen and Hungary's Norbert Rozsa. Monday's performance means he has also become the first man to win five world championship medals in breaststroke events. He recently revealedhe practises ""active meditation"" to aid his mental health after suffering a dip following his gold-medal winning performance in the 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016 and has since backed mental health campaigns. Wilby, who qualified in third place behind Zibei, achieved his first world medal, clocking 58.46. Peaty broke his first 100m world record in 2015 at the British Championships, with his time of 57.92, making him the first man to swim the distance in under 58 seconds. Elsewhere, Britain's Luke Greenbank knocked two-tenths of a second off his personal best with a 53.75 swim in the 100m backstroke semi-final. Molly Renshaw also smashed her personal best for the second time on Monday with a time of 1.06.73 effort to qualify for the women's 100m breaststroke final. Duncan Scott is into the 200m freestyle final on Tuesday, but compatriot James Guy missed out on a place in the same event. Britain's Ben Proud failed to defend his world title, finishing seventh in the 50m butterfly final. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor finished seventh in the women's 200m individual medley - which was won by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu - and Georgia Davies missed out on a place in the women's 100m backstroke final after a 12th-place finish in the semi-final. Meanwhile, Australian swimmer Mack Horton publiclyreignited his feudwith Chinese rival Sun Yang, years after accusing him of being a ""drug cheat"". Sun pipped Olympic champion Horton to claim gold in the 400m freestyle on Sunday. Horton later refused to share the medal podium with Sun - who has faced fresh claims of violating doping protocols. BBC Radio 5 live swimming pundit Karen Pickering You can't see where or why he's going to slow down. From where he won his first world title as a teenager, physically he will have changed so much and he has certainly got bigger. You can't get much bigger or much stronger but the experience that he has and how he can swim his races: you look and think 'if I can just tweak a little bit there' - he was out a tiny bit quicker and paid for it in the closing stages - you're just tweaking those little bits and you think those barriers are there to be broken each time by making tiny little margins of difference.

"Mack Horton (left) refused to join rival Sun Yang on a medal podium Australian swimmer Mack Horton has publicly reignited his feud with Chinese rival Sun Yang, years after accusing him of being a ""drug cheat"". Sun pipped Horton to claim gold in the 400m freestyle at the World Aquatics Championships in South Korea on Sunday. Horton later refused to share the medal podium with Sun - who has faced fresh claims of violating doping protocols. Afterwards, Sun told reporters: ""Disrespecting me was OK, but disrespecting China was unfortunate."" He added: ""I feel sorry about that."" Horton, the defending Olympic champion, had also declined to shake hands with Sun or pose for photos with him. He happily posed beside Italian bronze medallist Gabriele Detti. Sun served a three-month suspension in 2014 for testing positive for a banned stimulant trimetazidine, which he said had been for a heart complaint. The pair's enmity goes back to the 2016 Rio Olympics when Horton accused Sun of deliberately splashing him in a training session, saying: ""I ignored him, I don't have time or respect for drug cheats."" Later, he added: ""I just have a problem with athletes who have tested positive and are still competing."" China anger at Australia 'drug cheat' slur Horton won gold in Rio, but Sun has otherwise dominated the event in recent years - his win on Sunday in Gwangju is his fourth consecutive world title. Horton also declined to shake hands with Sun After claiming silver, Horton was asked how he felt and replied: ""Frustration is probably it. I think you know in what respect."" ""I don't think I need to say anything. His actions and how it has been handled speaks louder than anything I could say."" Sun said he was ""aware of the rumours"" but did not elaborate, saying ""I will keep trying to put a lot of effort in my swimming"". 'We'll race drug cheats at worlds' His comment about ""disrespecting"" China follows much antipathy from his fans towards Horton in 2016, when the Australian's social media accounts were flooded with abuse. Other swimming figures have expressed support for Horton's actions in Gwangju. Horton posed for photos with bronze medallist Gabriele Detti ""Absolutely awesome to see @_mackhorton protesting clean sport by not getting up on the podium next to Sun Yang,"" tweeted Horton's ex-teammate David McKeon. Sun faces a fresh hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in September, afterthe World Anti-doping Agency appealed against a decisionto clear him of a separate doping offence. Reports have alleged that he avoided a drugs ban after destroying blood samples. Sun has denied the allegations. Last week, Australia's Daily Telegraph posted a leaked 59-page report by the Fina doping panel following a hearing at which Sun said he refused to comply with a drugs test because of doubts over a testers' accreditation. This video can not be played Heart disease and mental health: What are the health risks of doping? Chinese swimming officials demanded an apology from Horton after his comments in 2016, but the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said he was ""entitled to express a point of view"". ""He has spoken out in support of clean athletes. This is something he feels strongly about and good luck to him,"" the AOC said at the time.

" Rebecca Henschke and Callistasia Wijaya Komodo dragons, owners of razor-sharp teeth and a venomous bite, are native to only one tiny corner of the globe. Tourists have flocked to see them, and horror films have been inspired by them. Locals even believe they are physically and spiritually related to them. But this human-lizard relationship may be about to change. Authorities in Indonesia want to hand Komodo Island back to the dragons. They want to close it to mass tourism, and expel the inhabitants who have lived alongside the earth’s largest lizards for generations. “It’s called Komodo Island, so it’s for the Komodo not for humans. There will be no human rights there, only animal rights,” says the region’s governor, Viktor Bungtilu Laiskodat. He wants the Unesco World Heritage site to be closed for a year in 2020, and then become a more exclusive place for just a relative handful of wealthy visitors. And he wants the islanders to be moved off it forever. The Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry in Jakarta, which manages the national park, is currently reviewing the governor’s proposal. The dragons certainly have more sightseers than they did when European explorers first visited the island in the early 20th Century. There were approximately 176,000 visitors to Komodo National Park last year. On a very hot day in June, a multi-storey cruise ship has docked in Loh Liang bay. As the park opens its gates at 07:00, thousands of tourists begin to pour out onto the island’s shore. Crowd management is then needed in the jungle. Each group is given just five minutes to marvel at five Komodo dragons lounging near a stream, before the tourists are moved on to make way for the next group. Nermin Ataman is entranced. “They are so incredibly beautiful, but scary too,” says the Turkish tourist. “I didn’t believe there were dragons but it’s true.” The Indonesian government is heavily promoting the picturesque region as a tourist destination, building infrastructure to support the increase in visitor numbers. Investors and hotel chains are flocking into Labuan Bajo, the gateway to the national park. The park is within one of the poorest regions in the archipelago and the tourist dollar has the potential to change that, says tour guide Tissa Septiani Indra. “There is excitement - so many people are coming here looking for jobs and opportunities. It’s an area under development and it feels like there’s unlimited opportunity right now,” she says. But the governor is not impressed with the direction it is heading in.  “The Komodo is not being protected,” says Laiskodat. “Too many people are coming in - they are paying next to nothing, and that means anyone can enter,” he says. The current charge is about $10 (£8) a person. For his new vision he would charge a much higher price. “People will have to become members and pay $1,000 [£790] to enter for a year. I think that’s cheap. So if we let 50,000 people in we will have $50m [£40m] a year.” Dr Tim Jessop, an Australian academic who has been monitoring the Komodo population in partnership with the national park since 2002, agrees there are issues with the current visitor numbers. He says the growing number of boats coming back and forth, including the plastic waste thrown from them, is having an impact on marine life. He has long advocated for better regulation of the industry before it gets too difficult to control, citing the Galapagos Islands - where visitor numbers are restricted - as a good model. Tour guide Indra agrees the tourism should be better managed. “They do need to make strict rules for tour operators, hotels, resorts and dive centres. They need to take care of the environment here.” But Jessop says the tourists’ impact on the Komodos themselves is limited, explaining that about 90% of them are walking in two areas that make up just 3-4% of the land area of the entire national park. Most Komodo dragons - about 1,727 of them - live on their namesake Komodo Island, but there are in fact more than 20 islands in Komodo National Park. The other sizeable population of dragons live on Rinca Island. Jessop says that the governor’s other concern, that the Komodos’ primary prey of deer is under threat, also seems ill-founded. He says that while the national park is secure in some places and not in others, there doesn’t seem to be sustained poaching that would affect the dragons. Park ranger Stefanus Jalak agrees that the deer now seem better protected. “Deer hunting has got much less, and the community now understands,” he says, “but sometimes we have to work with police and the military to stop it.” Komodo village, once just a tiny row of huts on the shore, is now home to about 2,000 people in the bay. Guest houses have been built here, there is now electricity at night provided by generators, and plastic waste from the street stalls litters the beach. Some 70% of the community on Komodo Island make their living from tourism, and the idea of fewer people coming is disastrous to them. “We don’t want to move! We don’t disturb the habitat of the Komodo,” says Rosa Saphira, 17. “Komodos and humans live in harmony here. We can work with the governor to better protect the Komodo - we don’t have to be moved away.” Nur, who runs one of the stalls at the souvenir market, says she is really worried about what the future might hold. She says losing income from tourism would be difficult as the islanders don’t have the means to return to their original hunter-gatherer lifestyle. “We don’t have fishing boats anymore, we can’t hunt and we have no land,” she says. Local guide Abdul Gafur Kasim fears that if the villagers felt forced to return to hunting and fishing, it could be worse for the environment. “The villagers will be forced to go back to the sea, and they might start using unsustainable methods again to catch the fish, like using bombs, and that will destroy the park’s marine life. Or they will go back to the forest and carry out illegal logging.” Researcher Jessop agrees the islanders are not currently a threat to the dragons. “I have walked thousands of kilometres in Komodo National Park over the years, and I have spent literally years in the field, and you don’t see people chopping trees, or walking around poaching or lighting fires. I have thought they are reasonably respectful to their environment.” The Komodo islanders say their respect for the dragons is strengthened by an ancient myth - they believe that a princess on the island gave birth to twins, one human, one Komodo dragon. Village elder Haji Amin, like most Indonesians, is a Muslim, and has made the pilgrimage to Mecca. The connection with Komodos here is not a matter of faith he insists, but history. “As [the twins] got older, the Komodo son only wanted to eat raw meat,” he says. “He would chase and eat the neighbour’s chickens - this angered the community. So in the end he went to live in the forest, but he always came back to the village to check on his mother and brother.” It is this sense of connection which means the islanders are not afraid of the lizards, even though they can grow up to 3m (10ft) long, and their bite can kill within a few hours. Indar Wati, Haji’s wife, has never worried about her children or grandchildren running into the forest behind her wooden home, perched on stilts on the bay. “I don’t worry about the dragons. My only worry is the children swimming in the sea - they could drown,” she says. There are no official records of the number of deaths or serious injuries from Komodo dragon attacks in the national park, but the authorities say they only know of 15 attacks over the last decade - one fatal. The governor of the region says the dragons have become too tame. He has a clear vision of how the island should be transformed. “So when people arrive it’s like: ‘Wow this is wild!” Laiskodat says. “We are going to make wild Komodos, not like the tame ones now. People will come and see Komodos in their natural habitat and they will be very wild and dangerous.” His argument for change has been bolstered by the recent interception of the first known Komodo smuggling ring - from the island of Flores. Indonesian police say a group of local men, with international links,successfully smuggled 45 baby Komodos out of the countrybefore they were caught in late March. Police believe they were to be sold as private zoo exhibits, or as exotic pets. Indonesia’s anti-trafficking task forces, despite making some significant raids in recent years, are struggling to stop the trade in its unique wildlife. Animal markets openly selling protected species can still be found in cities across the country. The four baby Komodos they saved now sit in a wildlife holding-pen in Surabaya on the island of Java – alongside a wealth of other rare animals in tiny cages that suffered a similar fate. “When I am in control of Komodo [Island], no-one will be brave enough to try and smuggle the dragons,” Laiskodat says. Under Indonesia’s regional autonomy laws, local leaders are increasingly powerful, but it is not clear whether the governor will get the all-clear for his plan. Laiskodat insists Indonesian President Joko Widodo is on board, and Widodo’s recent comments suggest this may be the case. “We want Komodo Island to be truly a conservation area,” Widodo said in a statement earlier this month, “so tourist numbers are very much limited, with a quota and an expensive entry price.” But he stresses that any plan needs to be “well designed and not done in bits and pieces. We are ready to invest significant money to get this right,” he says. Laiskodat says if his plan goes ahead, the villagers will be built new houses on other islands. But the Komodo villagers are vowing to put up a battle. “If we move, the Komodos will come with us,” says villager Indar. Her husband Haji claims the government tried to move them in the late 1970s and the Komodo dragons started jumping in the ocean and swimming away with them. “We would be better off dying than leaving this place, this is the land of our ancestors. “The relationship between us and the Komodo is that tight. We will fight to stay!” Living Among the Dragons is on BBC iPlayer and on BBC World on Thursday 25 July, 09:30 GMT, and Friday 26 July, 08:00 GMT.

Sun pipped Horton to claim gold in the 400m freestyle at the World Aquatics Championships in South Korea on Sunday. Horton later refused to share the medal podium with Sun - who has faced fresh claims of violating doping protocols. Afterwards, Sun told reporters: ""Disrespecting me was OK, but disrespecting China was unfortunate."" He added: ""I feel sorry about that."" Horton, the defending Olympic champion, had also declined to shake hands with Sun or pose for photos with him. He happily posed beside Italian bronze medallist Gabriele Detti.

"G4S made profits of more than Â£2m per year for running an immigration centre where detainees were filmed being mistreated by staff, a report says. The National Audit Office found the security firm made Â£14.3m profit running Brook House from 2012 to 2018. The findings raise serious questions about the Home Office's handling of sensitive contracts, MPs said. The Home Office said it had been working to improve leadership, management and training at the centre. Panorama footagebroadcast in September 2017 showed alleged assaults, humiliation and verbal abuse of detainees by officers at the centre, near Gatwick Airport. In total, 21 members of staff were identified as part of the Panorama allegations - 12 were later dismissed and three resigned. Home Office 'failing' on detention centres Detainees 'must get to face abusers' 'Abuse' detainees challenge Home Office The NAO report found G4S has been making ""significant profits"" on the Brook House contract. Between 2012 and 2018, G4S made Â£14.3m gross profits, (before deducting a share of company overheads, such as human resources), with gross profit rates of between 10% and 20% each year. It also pointed to the fact that under the terms of its contract G4S cannot be penalised if staff use excessive force or inappropriate language. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the findings raised ""serious questions"" about the Home Office's handling of sensitive contracts and claimed the department's monitoring should have picked up problems sooner. She said: ""For G4S to be making up to 20% gross profits on the Brook House contract at the same time as such awful abuse by staff against detainees was taking place is extremely troubling. ""Given that profits reduced when G4S had to increase staffing and training after the Panorama programme, this raises very serious questions about G4S's running of the centre to make higher profits whilst not having proper staffing, training and safeguarding systems in place."" She confirmed that the committee will further pursue both G4S and the Home Office. Despite the problems, the NAO found that G4S ""broadly delivered"" on the terms of the contract. Covert footage was filmed inside Brook House, near Gatwick Airport, for BBC Panorama A Home Office spokesman said it was making ""significant changes"" to the contracting model. They said: ""The Home Office and G4S have been working together and we remain committed to improving leadership, management and training at Brook House."" John Whitwam, managing director of G4S custodial and detention services, said: ""Building on the significant progress already made at Brook House IRC, we continue to work closely with the Home Office to improve further the services we provide."" According to the NAO, the Home Office has now concluded that the Brook House contract as written is no longer fit for purpose, given the lack of scope to impose financial penalties and enforce improvements in conditions and treatment. Any new contract is expected to include new performance measures covering staff recruitment, induction, training, mentoring and culture, and establish a contractual role for the Home Office to monitor the appropriateness of the use of force against detainees and the care of staff and detainees following an incident.

"A cross-party group of MPs and peers has urged the home secretary to sanction supervised drug consumption facilities, or ""fix rooms"". Glasgow City Council first proposed the measure three years ago, but the plan has fallen foul of UK drug laws which are reserved to Westminster. The idea is to encourage users to inject drugs in a safe and clean environment rather than on the street. The Home Office said there were no plans to allow consumption rooms. Scotland's drug crisis in six charts What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Are UK drug consumption rooms likely The appeal for a rethink comes afternew figures revealed drug-related deaths in Scotland soared to 1,187 last year,a record level and the highest reported rate per head of population in the EU. Tory Crispin Blunt, Labour's Jeff Smith and crossbench peer Baroness Meacher, along with seven Police and Crime Commissioners, have written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid urging him to allow local authorities to proceed with pilot schemes. MPs from the SNP, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats also signed the letter. Germany has a network of DCRs, including this one in Berlin The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform said in the letter that consumption rooms - also known as Overdose Prevention Centres (OPCs) - have been established in many countries with ""good public health results"" and an ""absence of the feared negative consequences"". The politicians, who co-chair the group, wrote: ""We and many of our colleagues have been assessing their value as part of local strategies to reduce drug-related deaths and infections (primarily HIV and hepatitis), as well as incidences of public disorder and needle litter. ""We are supportive of areas that wish to proceed with their implementation. ""We therefore call on the government to allow the relevant local authorities the discretion to proceed with locally developed, closely evaluated pilots."" The APPG said a refusal to sanction evidence-based interventions which would bring down drug-related deaths appears to be ""complacent and dangerous"". Former minister Mr Blunt said: ""The international evidence is clear - Overdose Prevention Centres save lives. ""We are facing a crisis of drug overdose deaths, and cannot afford to reject initiatives that will help bring the death rate down. ""Policymakers must urgently escape the simplicity of 'drugs are bad, they are banned' and engage in evidence-based policy and the complexities about how to reduce crime and save lives."" The Skyen drug consumption room is in Copenhagen Opposition whip Mr Smith added: ""Instead of condemning and marginalising people who use drugs, we need to support and encourage them into treatment, and give them a chance to turn their lives around. ""Overdose prevention centres (DCRs) are one proven means of doing so. Nobody has ever died of an overdose in one of these centres. ""If the government thinks there is not currently the legislative framework that would allow them to go ahead, it is their job to change that legislation."" Baroness Meacher said: ""This week's shocking figures from Scotland, showing a 27% increase in deaths in just one year, prove that this is a public health crisis. ""Responsible local authorities are desperate to try new approaches, but are being prevented by a Home Office putting ideology before people's lives."" The Green Party's Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat Tom Brake, the SNP's Ronnie Cowan and peers including Baroness Neuberger and Lord Adebowale also signed the letter. The Scottish government and a majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament have backed the idea of consumption rooms, but the UK government remains opposed, saying they would allow a range of offences to committed. The SNP's Ronnie Cowan said: ""Safe consumption rooms are not a magic bullet, but the evidence for their use is overwhelming - with even the Scottish Tory health spokesperson this week admitting they could tackle overdoses. ""The Home Office's stubborn refusal to even consider trialling their use is a dereliction of duty and leaves the UK Government on the wrong side of history. ""If the UK government refuse to act to save lives, it's time they devolved the powers so that Scotland can take the steps necessary."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Any death related to drug misuse is a tragedy. Our drug strategy is bringing together police, health, community and global partners to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover. ""The causes of drug misuse are complex and need a range of policy responses and many of the powers to deal with drug dependency such as healthcare, housing and criminal justice are devolved in Scotland. ""The UK government has been clear that there is no legal framework for the provision of drug consumption rooms and there are no plans to introduce them.""

"Voting has closed in the Conservative leadership contest, with the UK's next prime minister set to be announced on Tuesday. The next occupant of Number 10 will be either Boris Johnson - regarded as the frontrunner - or Jeremy Hunt. The winner and successor to Theresa May is due to take office on Wednesday. Before the polls closed, Sir Alan Duncan quit as a Foreign Office minister in protest against a possible Boris Johnson victory. Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC on Sunday heintends to resign as chancellor if Mr Johnson becomes prime minister. Justice Secretary David Gaukealso reiterated in the Sunday Times,externalthat he would also resign this week for the same reason. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the ministers could not stomach the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, which they think Mr Johnson is increasingly likely to oversee. Hammond plans to quit if Johnson becomes PM MPs back bid to block Parliament suspension Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt Mr Johnson has said the UK must leave the EU by the deadline of 31 October ""do or die, come what may"". Mr Hunt has said he too is prepared to leave with no deal, but would accept a further delay, if required, to get a new withdrawal deal. The EU has repeatedly said it will not re-open negotiations on the deal agreed with Mrs May. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson insisted a deal could be reached by 31 October if the country ""rediscovers its sense of mission"". ""We can come out of the EU on 31 October, and yes, we certainly have the technology to do so,"" he wrote. What we need now is the will and the spirit."" That message of optimism was echoed by one of his supporters, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the leadership frontrunner had the national self belief"" the country needed. ""We've risen to greater challenges before in the past. We should manage the risk but also grasp the opportunities which we don't get a chance to talk enough about,"" Mr Raab added. This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond announced on Sunday that he intends to resign Meanwhile, two former Labour prime ministers have warned about what they see as the dangers of leaving the EU without a deal. Writing in the Times, Tony Blair said a no-deal exit could range from being ""very difficult"" to ""catastrophic"". ""No-one knows with certainty the impact of no deal for the simple reason that no developed nation has ever left overnight its preferential trading arrangements in this manner,"" he wrote. Mr Blair added that there was ""no prospect"" of a new deal with the EU that Mr Johnson would approve of, arguing that instead, another Brexit referendum was the solution. Gordon Brown, meanwhile, is to claim in a speech in London that leaving without a deal would push the British economy ""off a cliff"". This is the week where everything changes, and, perhaps, nothing changes at all. A week where the old establishment becomes the new rebels; where the crowd-pleasing showman throwing rhetorical rocks at the leadership becomes, in all likelihood, the leader himself. The differences in temperament and character between the outgoing prime minister and her likely successor, Boris Johnson, could hardly be more stark. But while a change in personnel is coming, so many of the fundamentals remain the same. Where Mrs May looked nervously over her shoulder at rebels like Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg, Mr Johnson may do the same at opponents of the no deal Brexit he's willing to contemplate - their capacity to be awkward is turbo charged because their party has a barely existent majority. So there is one big question: Can Boris Johnson, if it is him, succeed where Theresa May failed? And if he can, what will success look like? Last week, MPsapproved measures aiming to stop the next prime minister suspending Parliamentto force through a no-deal Brexit. Mr Hunt has ruled this out as a way to ensure Brexit takes place before the end of October - but Mr Johnson has not done the same. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know On Sunday, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - who is managing Mr Johnson's campaign - said the issue was a ""complete red herring"". He said the suspension - or prorogation - of Parliament was not ""the real debate"" because MPs had already fixed the 31 October exit date in law. Either deputy leader Jo Swinson or former Energy Secretary Ed Davey will be announced as the Lib Dems next leader on Monday Meanwhile, Jo Swinsonhas becomethe first female Liberal Democrat leader, after decisively beating Sir Ed Davey in a poll of party members. The 39-year old, who succeeds Sir Vince Cable, said she was ""over the moon"" to have been elected and was ""ready for the fight of our lives"".

"This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip. The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Read more about Hong Kong's history Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"". The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. Some elected members have even been disbarredafter Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them. Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Were triads involved in Hong Kong attacks? Hong Kong'smini-constitution, the Basic Law,external, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like. The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature. In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear. While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese. Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show thatmost people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"",external-only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"",external- and 71% of people saythey do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens,external. The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young. ""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says. Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China. There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living. Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government. Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years. In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets. Do protests ever work in China? Young and unhappy in HK Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position. This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard. As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change. And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003,up to 500,000 people took to the streets,externalto protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over""patriotic education"" classesfollowing rallies against the move. However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority. In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

"A lack of funding is having a devastating impact on Northern Ireland's schools, the chairman of a Westminster committee has said. The NI Affairs Committee has carried out an inquiry into education funding. It concluded that a growing funding crisis in Northern Ireland's schools has led to unmanageable pressures on school budgets. It also found there was not enough resources for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) pupils. Autistic child suspended from school for 135 days Toilet roll donated to school due to cuts NI schools at 'rock bottom', MPs are told As a result,many were receiving ""delayed care and limited hours of specialist support"". There are around 80,000 pupils with some form of special needs, almost a quarter of the total number of pupils, and a majority of them are educated in mainstream schools. The committee called for the education budget to be increased to reflect the rising costs associated with caring for pupils with SEND. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has published a report into education funding in Northern Ireland The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee launched an inquiry into education funding in August 2018, due to the lack of scrutiny taking place in the absence of an assembly. It heard oral evidence and received written submissions from principals, schools, unions and sectoral bodies, as well as the Department of Education (DE) and the Education Authority (EA). The DE resource budget for 2018-19 was Â£1.98bn, ""a 0.6% increase on the previous year's allocation and a reduction in real terms"", according to the committee. It said the department's resource budget for 2019-20 also saw a real-terms cut. ""We recommend that future budget allocations to DE rise not only in line with inflation, but in proportion to the number of pupils in the school system in order to reflect increasing pupil numbers and the associated demand for additional staff,"" the report said. The committee found: individual school budgets had deteriorated. While the numbers of pupils had risen by 2.5% since 2011, spending per head on them had decreased; the fragmented nature of Northern Ireland's education systems - with a range of schools across a number of different sectors - led to duplication and did not make the best use of resources. As a result they recommended fewer, better resourced schools; the committee also raised concerns about how the EA procures goods and services for schools, saying there is scope for ""substantial savings"". It also said teachers in Northern Ireland had seen their pay ""stagnate"" compared to their counterparts in the rest of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland. ""This is deeply unfair to Northern Ireland's teachers and must be corrected,"" the report said. But it said schools could not afford to fund any pay rise and recommended that the secretary of stateapprove a pay rise, funded centrally by government. It also called on the secretary of state to take key decisions relating to education in the absence of an assembly. It recommends, for instance, that if the executive is not reformed by October that Karen Bradley should implement SEND reforms previously agreed by the assembly in 2016. Simon Hoare MP, who chairs the committee, said schools were facing ""unmanageable pressures"". ""Stagnant funding is evidently having a devastating impact on the ability of Northern Ireland's schools to provide the education and support their pupils deserve,"" he said. ""Without an executive or assembly, budgeting challenges have mounted into a crisis."" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: ""The department welcomes the publication of this report and will carefully study all of its conclusions and recommendations."" Maghaberry Primary School principal Graham Gault, who previously told MPs that parents were ""donating toilet roll"" at his school, appealed to the Northern Ireland secretary to ""take it [the report] seriously"". ""Our children can bear the brunt of the financial circumstances that our government are imposing on our schools no longer,"" he said.

"This video can not be played President Zelensky: Snap poll ""more important"" than presidential vote President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to become the first Ukrainian leader since the fall of communism to command an overall majority in parliament. Servant of the People, the party named after the TV sitcom that made him famous, has won 43.1% of the vote with almost 94% of results counted. The party is on course to win 253 of parliament's 450 seats. A decisive win for Mr Zelensky's party will make it easier for him to push through reforms and tackle corruption. It will also be the best result by any party in Ukraine's post-1991 history. Since he triumphed in April's presidential poll, Mr Zelensky, 41, has been unable to appoint the ministers he wants. On Sunday, 424 seats in the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, were contested. Those seats not included represent the war-torn Donbas region and Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Rock stars and wrestlers: Ukraine election produces colourful cast Why Zelensky needs second election win What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Speaking outside a polling station after casting his ballot in Kiev on Sunday, Mr Zelensky told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg the snap election was ""maybe more important than the presidential election"". His party was on course to win 124 seats in the party list vote, which is decided by proportional representation. It was also set to win a further 129 seats in single-seat races that make up half the vote. Five parties look on course to clear the 5% threshold to enter parliament, with the pro-Russian Opposition Platform-For Life party in second place with 13%. The Holos (Voice) party, seen as a possible coalition partner for Mr Zelensky should he need one, has so far won 5.8% of the vote. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, lead singer of the popular band Okean Elzy, heads the Holos party The other two parties projected to enter parliament are former President Petro Poroshenko's European Solidarity (8.1%) and Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) led by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (8.2%). The victorious party or coalition will form a government and nominate a prime minister. The president is in charge of foreign policy, defence and security but parliament handles nearly all other policy areas, notably the economy and social welfare A majority of MPs propose a prime minister-designate to the president The PM, if confirmed by president and parliament, names members of the government Parliament confirms or rejects the government team, or indeed individual ministers, and can impeach the president MPs have a veto on key state posts such as national security service chief, central bank chief and chief prosecutor The president told our correspondent the ""president, prime minister and parliament have to work together, just to make life happy for Ukraine"". He said the key issues were investment, democracy and safety. Mr Zelensky was known for his comic role on TV as a teacher who wins the heart of the nation and becomes president after his expletive-laden rant about politics goes viral. In reality, his route to the leadership was a bit more conventional than in his show - but only a bit. After shunning rallies and speeches and openly admitting he did not have any strong political views, he scored a landslide victory in April and unseated Mr Poroshenko, a political heavyweight. Petro Poroshenko's party was rebranded European Solidarity to remove his name The election was widely expected to give Mr Zelensky a greater mandate for reform, sweeping aside the old guard and bringing new faces to parliament. One of the candidates for Servant of the People, for example, is Zhan Beleniuk, a 28-year-old Olympic wrestler who has now become Ukraine's first mixed race MP.

"Prof Dame Sally Davies said people should not be taken in by vaccine myths on social media Countries must work together to tackle global health risks, England's outgoing chief medical officer has said. In her final annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies said focusing on domestic issues could risk failing to control global threats such as Ebola. And she said learning from other countries would also ensure the NHS was not left behind. After nine years as CMO, she is to become Master of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. Prof Davies said: ""Investing in global health is the smart thing to do because it is in our mutual interest. It creates a better world for us and for future generations. ""It helps to keep our population safe. ""We should invest in systems and solutions that contribute to making health more equitable, secure and sustainable. ""What we learn abroad will improve our NHS and support our domestic efforts to make sure no-one in the UK is left behind."" Dame Sally cited last year'smonkeypox outbreakin the UK - the first cases of the disease outside Africa since 2003. She said UK collaboration with the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control helped to contain and manage the situation, and minimise the public health impact. And, as in the 2014 Sierra Leone outbreak of Ebola, UK experts are helping those dealing with the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Another focus for global health initiatives should be the rise of non-communicable diseases including heart disease, strokes and cancer, said Dame Sally.

"A cross-party group of MPs and peers has urged the home secretary to sanction supervised drug consumption facilities, or ""fix rooms"". Glasgow City Council first proposed the measure three years ago, but the plan has fallen foul of UK drug laws which are reserved to Westminster. The idea is to encourage users to inject drugs in a safe and clean environment rather than on the street. The Home Office said there were no plans to allow consumption rooms. Scotland's drug crisis in six charts What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Are UK drug consumption rooms likely The appeal for a rethink comes afternew figures revealed drug-related deaths in Scotland soared to 1,187 last year,a record level and the highest reported rate per head of population in the EU. Tory Crispin Blunt, Labour's Jeff Smith and crossbench peer Baroness Meacher, along with seven Police and Crime Commissioners, have written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid urging him to allow local authorities to proceed with pilot schemes. MPs from the SNP, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats also signed the letter. Germany has a network of DCRs, including this one in Berlin The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform said in the letter that consumption rooms - also known as Overdose Prevention Centres (OPCs) - have been established in many countries with ""good public health results"" and an ""absence of the feared negative consequences"". The politicians, who co-chair the group, wrote: ""We and many of our colleagues have been assessing their value as part of local strategies to reduce drug-related deaths and infections (primarily HIV and hepatitis), as well as incidences of public disorder and needle litter. ""We are supportive of areas that wish to proceed with their implementation. ""We therefore call on the government to allow the relevant local authorities the discretion to proceed with locally developed, closely evaluated pilots."" The APPG said a refusal to sanction evidence-based interventions which would bring down drug-related deaths appears to be ""complacent and dangerous"". Former minister Mr Blunt said: ""The international evidence is clear - Overdose Prevention Centres save lives. ""We are facing a crisis of drug overdose deaths, and cannot afford to reject initiatives that will help bring the death rate down. ""Policymakers must urgently escape the simplicity of 'drugs are bad, they are banned' and engage in evidence-based policy and the complexities about how to reduce crime and save lives."" The Skyen drug consumption room is in Copenhagen Opposition whip Mr Smith added: ""Instead of condemning and marginalising people who use drugs, we need to support and encourage them into treatment, and give them a chance to turn their lives around. ""Overdose prevention centres (DCRs) are one proven means of doing so. Nobody has ever died of an overdose in one of these centres. ""If the government thinks there is not currently the legislative framework that would allow them to go ahead, it is their job to change that legislation."" Baroness Meacher said: ""This week's shocking figures from Scotland, showing a 27% increase in deaths in just one year, prove that this is a public health crisis. ""Responsible local authorities are desperate to try new approaches, but are being prevented by a Home Office putting ideology before people's lives."" The Green Party's Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat Tom Brake, the SNP's Ronnie Cowan and peers including Baroness Neuberger and Lord Adebowale also signed the letter. The Scottish government and a majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament have backed the idea of consumption rooms, but the UK government remains opposed, saying they would allow a range of offences to committed. The SNP's Ronnie Cowan said: ""Safe consumption rooms are not a magic bullet, but the evidence for their use is overwhelming - with even the Scottish Tory health spokesperson this week admitting they could tackle overdoses. ""The Home Office's stubborn refusal to even consider trialling their use is a dereliction of duty and leaves the UK Government on the wrong side of history. ""If the UK government refuse to act to save lives, it's time they devolved the powers so that Scotland can take the steps necessary."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Any death related to drug misuse is a tragedy. Our drug strategy is bringing together police, health, community and global partners to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover. ""The causes of drug misuse are complex and need a range of policy responses and many of the powers to deal with drug dependency such as healthcare, housing and criminal justice are devolved in Scotland. ""The UK government has been clear that there is no legal framework for the provision of drug consumption rooms and there are no plans to introduce them.""

"Nearly four years ago, we took the first steps on a path of enormous change in our politics. The unexpected began to happen. Conventions frayed. Those who had held the reins for years in our major political parties lost their grip. In September 2015, Jeremy Corbyn stormed the Labour leadership, exciting a phalanx of new and old Labour supporters. In June 2016, David Cameron lost the EU referendum. Despite the signs that were blatantly obvious during that campaign the result was an intense shock to most people who worked in and around Westminster. In the chaos that followed, Theresa May found her moment and moved in to Number 10. Then in June 2017, again, the public reminded the political class who was in charge, and surprised them by removing the Tories' majority, making a tricky job of governing precarious, changing everything for the Prime Minister who held on, only just. We are now on the verge of the fourth moment of transformation in those four years: Tomorrow morning the name of the new prime minister will be announced. The UK is set to have its third prime minister in little more than three years Unless Conservative members are an entirely duplicitous bunch, the name that is read will be Boris Johnson. A man whose career has been at the top, then in the trash, but whose ultimate belief in himself, and his ability to get others to buy into that, is about to land him in the very highest office in the land. A man whose dream of power, which he has tried continually to deny, has been obvious for more than a decade. A man who many voters adore, but who repels others. A man who some, even in his own party, believe is a nightmare. A man who has what might politely be described as an ""unusual relationship with the truth"", as one official told me. But he captures the attention of voters in a way so few politicians do, prompting members of the public to be near him, whether to scream insults or to shake his hand. But just as there are wildly varying interpretations of his character, his values, and motivations, so there are wildly varying guesses as to how he will answer the big questions that will face him in office, if, as expected, he walks across the threshold of Number 10 on Wednesday afternoon. Most intense among the demands are how he will cope with Brexit. That is the conundrum that has given him this chance. And the conundrum that may yet be impossible to solve. Is there really any chance of getting a different deal with the EU despite their repeated protestations to the contrary? If he cannot, would he really launch the country out of the union with no formal arrangement in place, given the warnings about the risks of doing so? Would he be willing to send MPs home and close down Parliament temporarily to get round the howls of protest from the green benches if he tries? Would he call an election to get his way? Mr Johnson has spent the last few weeks selling his standard brew of gags and promises in the campaign, and has visibly tried to keep options as open as he can, other than sticking firmly to the vow to leave the EU at Halloween. That has been the main difference between him and Jeremy Hunt, his rival candidate. And in a campaign that came about because of a failure to leave the EU, it is not surprising that the concrete guarantee to do that is the one absolute promise he has given. How would Johnson and Hunt deliver Brexit? Could technology solve the Irish border problem? For his most ardent Brexiteer supporters, they have him exactly where they want him, ""in a box"", as one describes, with sticking to the deadline ""his only way out"", even if it means leaving with no formal arrangement to start with. When it comes to those other questions, the answers make less compelling headlines, but the truthful responses are: It depends. Mr Johnson says he wants a different deal with the EU. They say overtly there is no chance of reopening the existing withdrawal agreement. But Mr Johnson is asking for something else - what his backers describe as a basic free trade deal, perhaps even a four-page statement of intent about how the EU and the UK would do business with each other in the future. Once that is done, so the plan goes, there would be a ""standstill"", or a period where not that much changes but the UK leaves the union at the end of October. In its most basic sense, we leave in a few months' time, both sides agree to do business sensibly with each other, and promise to sort out the hard stuff, like the Irish border, over a period of a few years. Before you scream, there is a very long list of quibbles with this plan. Not least, you might wonder, if it is that easy, why on earth has it not been done already? The EU has said repeatedly that they would not and could not accept any kind of deal without a solution for the Irish border being settled first. And there are also disagreements inside the varied tribes that make up Team Johnson these days, even if their man can persuade the EU to think again. Some of them believe that during the standstill period in the UK it would be fair enough, and worth the political pain, to accept the oversight of the European Courts for a while. For others that is absolutely toxic. Some of his supporters believe it is possible that an outline deal could get through Parliament in time with a straightforward thumbs up or thumbs down vote - an un-amendable statutory instrument, to use the technical term. Others cannot believe that is workable. But a new prime minister will bring a new mandate at home and creates a new political moment abroad. One senior EU diplomat told me ""we see Boris as an opportunity"". Don't get me wrong, they are not champing at the bit to tear up two years of hard work and make things happen for the former foreign secretary who perplexed them. A blimp of Boris Johnson was deployed at a protest directed against Brexit and the leadership frontrunner But there is an acknowledgement that the political situation is about to be reset and those on the other side of negotiating table have of course been thinking about possible ways through. It is going to take a lot more than a mini-break to Berlin, a weekend at President Macron's fort in the baking heat of the Cote D'Azur, or a few Pimms on the terrace at Chequers. A new kind of deal, that could get then get through Parliament in 100 days, seems very unlikely, but it is not completely out of the question - it depends. With the chances of a new agreement so small and the promise to leave on 31 October so big, other vexed questions arise about how Parliament would react to a prime minister determined to take us out. Would they be able to stop a still hypothetical Prime Minister Johnson ramming through departure without a formal deal? More from Westminster and beyond from BBC's Political Editor, Laura Kuenssberg A band of new rebels are lying in wait, leading to the bizarre spectacle of cabinet ministers chucking themselves over board before they get shoved. Some ardent backers of Mr Johnson believe that even so, he might be able to get Parliament on side for such a departure, or at least they could run the numbers close. There is a sprinkling of Labour MPs committed to getting it done, and do not underestimate the passions on the Tory side, including among some who think it is all a nightmare but they just want it to be over. It is impossible right now to predict how every MP would vote, but a Johnson government trying to take us out without a deal would at the very least meet very fierce resistance. That is why there has been frantic speculation about whether he would even consider temporarily closing down Parliament in order to get Brexit done. (That sounds crazy, but as the law stands we are leaving on 31 October, and if MPs are not sitting in the House of Commons they cannot change the law to stop it). Team Johnson will not rule that out, as they will not rule out any of the emergency rip cords they might have to pull to stick to their deadlines. But it is not the plan. The way to get round it may be much less dramatic, if almost as controversial, in the Commons. Several in Johnson's circle admitted they do not plan to send Parliament home, but instead hardly to put forward any legislation, if indeed any at all. One of his senior backers suggested they in fact would not try to have any discussion or votes on any laws at all before Halloween. That sounds technical. But the government controls what new laws are voted on in the House of Commons. And if they do not put any forward before 31 October, including none that could possibly have anything Brexit related tagged on to it, or amended, then MPs who want to stop us leaving without a formal deal simply will not have the chance to vote to do so. That is why earlier this year there was such controversy when Labour MP Yvette Cooper and others tried to grab control of the business in the Commons, so they could decide what got voted on and passed. And it is why one of Team Johnson joked last week that their chief whip might find ways of keeping MPs busy with general debates on all sorts of trivia, but they would not give them anything to vote on, so they would not have a chance to block Brexit from happening on time. And it is why others in his camp say there is a vigorous debate inside over what bits of legislation would be absolutely vital if we are to leave without a deal, and what you could do without. So would Boris Johnson suspend Parliament for a while to get Brexit done? The answer again seems, in one way or another, it depends. And because the answers to those still hypothetical questions still are ""it depends"", it is likely that he will before long find himself in a similar kind of agony to Theresa May - without a plan that can pass Parliament. That is why there is also frenzied speculation over whether he is planning secretly to bring about an election. Guess what? Here, too, there are different tribes of opinion. Certainly, there has been discussion that, without a majority, with Labour in despair, with a rocky road ahead on Brexit, it would be wise to move into a campaign as soon as possible, using the new mandate and new moment of change to try to improve the odds of success. But more voices in Johnson's camp caution against pursuing a public vote until Brexit has actually happened. It is familiar to hear a plan of chunky spending promises in the autumn, a departure from the EU however it happens, then an election that ""becomes viable from the spring"". But if Parliament defies the new government in the autumn, the circumstances could feel different, indeed. What we do know is after four years we are entering perhaps an even more unpredictable period - whether you are thrilled or horrified, understand, we are on the edge of another great change. One of the cabinet ministers who is likely to be packing up their office shortly quipped as they talked in disbelief about the mess of the last few years, that ""by Christmas it might be Johnson, Corbyn, even prime minister Cooper, Letwin or Swinson"" - knowing, as they tried to make light of their despair, that they weren't really joking at all. Who or what will happen? The answer, of course - it depends. Can Johnson deliver Brexit in 99 days? Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn?

"This video can not be played President Zelensky: Snap poll ""more important"" than presidential vote President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to become the first Ukrainian leader since the fall of communism to command an overall majority in parliament. Servant of the People, the party named after the TV sitcom that made him famous, has won 43.1% of the vote with almost 94% of results counted. The party is on course to win 253 of parliament's 450 seats. A decisive win for Mr Zelensky's party will make it easier for him to push through reforms and tackle corruption. It will also be the best result by any party in Ukraine's post-1991 history. Since he triumphed in April's presidential poll, Mr Zelensky, 41, has been unable to appoint the ministers he wants. On Sunday, 424 seats in the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, were contested. Those seats not included represent the war-torn Donbas region and Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Rock stars and wrestlers: Ukraine election produces colourful cast Why Zelensky needs second election win What does a comic president mean for Ukraine? Speaking outside a polling station after casting his ballot in Kiev on Sunday, Mr Zelensky told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg the snap election was ""maybe more important than the presidential election"". His party was on course to win 124 seats in the party list vote, which is decided by proportional representation. It was also set to win a further 129 seats in single-seat races that make up half the vote. Five parties look on course to clear the 5% threshold to enter parliament, with the pro-Russian Opposition Platform-For Life party in second place with 13%. The Holos (Voice) party, seen as a possible coalition partner for Mr Zelensky should he need one, has so far won 5.8% of the vote. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, lead singer of the popular band Okean Elzy, heads the Holos party The other two parties projected to enter parliament are former President Petro Poroshenko's European Solidarity (8.1%) and Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) led by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (8.2%). The victorious party or coalition will form a government and nominate a prime minister. The president is in charge of foreign policy, defence and security but parliament handles nearly all other policy areas, notably the economy and social welfare A majority of MPs propose a prime minister-designate to the president The PM, if confirmed by president and parliament, names members of the government Parliament confirms or rejects the government team, or indeed individual ministers, and can impeach the president MPs have a veto on key state posts such as national security service chief, central bank chief and chief prosecutor The president told our correspondent the ""president, prime minister and parliament have to work together, just to make life happy for Ukraine"". He said the key issues were investment, democracy and safety. Mr Zelensky was known for his comic role on TV as a teacher who wins the heart of the nation and becomes president after his expletive-laden rant about politics goes viral. In reality, his route to the leadership was a bit more conventional than in his show - but only a bit. After shunning rallies and speeches and openly admitting he did not have any strong political views, he scored a landslide victory in April and unseated Mr Poroshenko, a political heavyweight. Petro Poroshenko's party was rebranded European Solidarity to remove his name The election was widely expected to give Mr Zelensky a greater mandate for reform, sweeping aside the old guard and bringing new faces to parliament. One of the candidates for Servant of the People, for example, is Zhan Beleniuk, a 28-year-old Olympic wrestler who has now become Ukraine's first mixed race MP.
