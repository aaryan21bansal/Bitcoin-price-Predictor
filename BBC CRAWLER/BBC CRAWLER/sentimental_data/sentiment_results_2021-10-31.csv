"French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson (right) met in Rome on Sunday Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron remain at loggerheads in the ongoing dispute over permits for fishing boats. On Sunday, the leaders met to discuss tensions and the UK government said it was ""up to France"" to step back from threats over port access. But Mr Macron said the ball was ""in Britain's court"" and he hoped there would be a positive response on Monday. Mr Macron added it was not a bilateral issue for the nations but an EU issue. The row comes ahead of Tuesday, which is the deadline for more permits to be granted for French fishing boats to operate in British waters. Otherwise UK fishing boats could be barred from some ports, French officials have warned. Following the meeting on Sunday, French officials said the pair had agreed to work on a solution in the ""next hours and days"". But later, a spokesman for Mr Johnson said no measures had been agreed. Mr Johnson said it was a ""wide ranging and frank discussion"", and insisted that should be expected ""between long standing friends and very, very close allies"". Turbulence has hit relations with France, PM says Fishing row a test of UK's credibility - Macron Who really owns UK fishing rights? On Friday, a letter from the French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seen by the BBC, said the EU must demonstrate in this dispute that there was ""more damage to leaving the EU than remaining there"". Mr Johnson said he was ""puzzled"" by the letter: ""I must say I was puzzled to read a letter from the French prime minister explicitly asking for Britain to be punished for leaving the EU. ""I just have to say to everybody I don't believe that that is compatible either with the spirit or the letter of the Withdrawal Agreement or the Trade and Cooperation agreement, and that's probably all I'll say about that one."" It was perhaps inevitable there'd be a moment - or more than one moment - where the Brexit deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, would be tested. The new legal arrangements between the UK and EU set out how the two sides should interact, after decades of shared rules with the UK inside the bloc. First there were the rows about the Northern Ireland Protocol. And now fish. Strikingly, the prime minister has leant into the leaked letter from his French opposite number, Jean Castex, which had said the EU must demonstrate there was ""more damage to leaving the EU than remaining there."" Whatever the subsequent questions about the translation of chunks of the letter, Boris Johnson chose to point to it as a source of not just irritation, but something ""not compatible with the spirit or letter"" of the Brexit agreement. This brouhaha isn't done yet. An earlier statement on behalf of Mr Johnson said he had ""reiterated his deep concern over the rhetoric emanating from the French government in recent days, including the suggestion by the French prime minister that the UK should be punished for leaving the EU"". And it said Mr Johnson had ""expressed his hope that the French government would de-escalate this rhetoric and withdraw their threats"". The PM's spokesman then went further, adding: ""It's down to France to decide if they want to step away from the deeply concerning threats. ""We are not seeking to escalate this. We would welcome it if they de-escalate and withdraw the threats they have made. [But] it will be for the French to decide."" The two leaders held a 30-minute informal meeting in Rome, where leaders of the world's richest economies, the G20, have been holding talks. A French official said: ""We see that Boris Johnson is trying to make the fishing story a French-UK affair. It is a post-Brexit affair which should be handled between the European Union and the United Kingdom. ""And what we are asking for from the British is that they respect their signature."" Although fishing is a small part of both the British and French economies, it has played a large part politically throughout Brexit. But this particular row began after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. Since then, the wider issue of how many permits the UK grants to France post-Brexit to fish in British waters has come to the fore. France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing permits to dozens of French boats and argued this breached the Brexit deal. It then warned it would block British boats from landing their catches in some French ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing permits was not resolved by Tuesday. France has also said it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as it previously threatened in May. For a brief moment, it looked like the row over fishing permits might be about to calm down - but it was only brief. It is unusual to get quite such contradictory accounts of the same meeting. Of course, both men have home crowds to which they want to play. And over recent years, we've also got used to hearing punchy statements in the heat of diplomatic negotiations. But what will worry some is the possibility that this could be more than negotiating ""theatre"" and instead a sign of a growing lack of mutual trust between two important allies. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Johnson acknowledged there was ""turbulence"" in the UK's relationship with France. But he insisted the things that united the two countries were more important than their divisions. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg pressed the PM on Saturday over how he planned to remedy the fishing row However, taking to Twitter, his Brexit minister Lord Frost said on Saturday the government was ""actively considering"" launching a legal process against France under the Brexit agreement, as a result of the ""threats"". He tweeted: ""We will continue to talk constructively to try to resolve all the differences between us, and we urge the EU and France to step back from rhetoric and actions that make this more difficult."" On Sunday, France's minister for Europe, ClÃ©ment Beaune, replied to Lord Frost, saying France had been ""negotiating patiently and constructively for 10 months"". He rejected claims there had been technical issues leading to the problems, saying: ""It's not a technical issue, it's a political choice and a breach of the [Brexit deal]."" He added: ""A friend, ally and responsible partner should stand by its word and comply with legal commitments."" DON'T FORGET!:Why do we turn the clocks back?

"The UK has been ""left behind"" according to steel makers after the US agreed to end a trade war over items that also included whiskey and Harley-Davidsons. President Biden has signed a deal to end tariffs on steel imports from the EU, which were imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump. But the agreement does not cover exports from the UK, putting British steelmakers at a disadvantage. Trade body UK Steel said a deal for British producers was ""sorely needed"". The tariffs, which came into force in 2018, nearly halved British steel exports to the US, Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said. The US is the second-largest market for British-made steel. But the new deal will put UK producers at a competitive disadvantage compared to European rivals who will be able to ship their products to the US without paying import taxes. In return, the EU removed retaliatory tariffs that it had put on whiskey, power boats and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. ""Whilst it is promising to see the US take steps to open up access to its steel markets again, there is significant concern that UK producers have been left behind in this process and continue to wait for their own deal,"" Mr Stace said. ""The substantial competitive advantage that this deal provides EU steel producers over UK ones will undoubtedly result in our export orders to the US market being lost to EU exporters."" But International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has said the UK and US are in talks to remove ""damaging tariffs"" from British steel exports. Ms Trevelyan tweeted: ""We welcome the Biden administration's willingness to work with us to address trade issues relating to steel and aluminium. ""It is encouraging the US is taking steps to de-escalate this issue."" President Biden and head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen speak at a press conference at the G20 in Rome The US and EU hope the pact will limit the amount of so-called ""dirty"" steel from countries such as China, where steel production accounts for as much as 20% of all CO2 emissions. The country currently produces more than half of the world's steel. ""Together, the United States and European Union will work to restrict access to their markets for dirty steel and limit access to countries that dump steel in our markets, contributing to worldwide over-supply,"" the White House said. ""The arrangement is, of course, open to all like-minded partners. Steel manufacturing is one of the highest carbon emission sources globally,"" Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission said. In a statement, a Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""The UK is committed to addressing both global steel overcapacity and decarbonisation, and we remain focused on agreeing a resolution that sees damaging tariffs removed to the benefit of businesses on both sides of the Atlantic."" ""We welcome the Biden Administration's willingness to work with us to address trade issues relating to steel and aluminium, and it is encouraging that the US is taking steps to de-escalate this issue.""

"Refuse workers and street cleaners are striking for one week A strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow has started, as world leaders arrive for the COP26 climate summit. GMB Scotland said members in the city council's cleansing department would be striking for the next week. The union accused the council of failing to give members ""proper time and space"" to consider an offer from local authority body Cosla. Glasgow City Council said the union's decision was ""very disappointing"". They said they would meet with GMB ""at any time"" to resolve the dispute. Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer Glaswegians greet COP26 with pessimism and hope Rail strike action during COP26 called off Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal involved Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. GMB Scotland, Unison and Unite all suspended industrial action on Friday, after the offer was tabled, saying they would consult members. However, on Sunday GMB Scotland confirmed the strike in Glasgow was back on. The union's Drew Duffy told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the council was ""constantly goading our members"" and they had decided ""enough was enough and the strike continues"". He explained: ""The workforce are the lowest paid workers in Scotland. There are deep rooted problems within Glasgow City Council. We have been trying to meet with the council. ""It is a constant breakdown of industrial relations, there have been longstanding problems with low pay and discriminatory pay and our members have just had enough. The conditions they work in, the pay they receive is not good enough."" Refuse staff and street cleaners on a picket line outside the Dawsholm Recycling Centre in Glasgow on Monday morning The move by the union came as Glasgow geared up to welcome about 120 world leaders to the city for crucial climate talks at COP26. In a statement released on Monday, a Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: ""The agreement struck at national level gave two weeks to consider the pay offer and so there is no reason for this strike to go ahead at this time. It is very disappointing the GMB has opted for this course of action. ""We have already agreed their request for time to meet with their members. And, while we remain available to meet with them at any time, we are unable to deliver their request for a pay increase. ""That is part of a national negotiation and a new deal was tabled by Cosla last week. ""It appeared that GMB, along with the other unions, had agreed to suspend the strike until national consultation was complete and it is very disappointing they have reneged on that agreement and have not given us the required 14 days' notice after they publicly announced the suspension on Friday."" The GMB, Unison and Unite had initially called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from Cosla. Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said they put their ""new and improved"" offer to trade unions last week. ""We were pleased to note that that it was accepted with the expectation that strike action be suspended whilst they presented the new offer to their membership for consideration,"" she added. ""GMB in particular made a public statement that they were suspending strike action for a period of two weeks as of Friday whilst the ballot of their members was conducted nationally across all 32 councils that this affects. ""We very much hope that this remains the case and that all members are given the opportunity to participate whilst essential services are maintained."" The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic and were ""fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government"". The Scottish government said it was not party to the pay negotiations, but said it had made a one-off offer of Â£30m in additional funding to help find a solution. Scottish minister Michael Matheson, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, said: ""The GMB locally have entered into a dispute now with GCC which I understand is not to do with the actual package itself but it's the process around being able to engage with their members and discuss that with them. ""I understand that discussions were taking place last night and the Scottish government would want to continue to encourage Cosla, GCC and the GMB to continue to discuss this issue and to try and find a quick resolution to what I believe is a process issue rather than an issue around the deal that was proposed.""

"Alice Banfield says her work experience didn't encourage to seek a job again An autistic woman said her experience of work was traumatising and more consideration was needed for neurodiverse employees. Alice Banfield, 25, from Cardiff, said overstimulation and lack of communication led her to have an anxiety attack while working as a shop assistant. ""It didn't really encourage me to seek employment after that,"" she said. Figures suggestjust 22% of autistic adults,externalin the UK are in employment. After graduating, Alice took a part-time job as a seasonal shop assistant. ""It was very traumatising to me at the time,"" she said. She said she was not given clear instructions, struggled to read her colleagues' and customers' body language and was overstimulated by the busy and bright environment. Alice Banfield is now a freelance artist Disclosing her autism did not help. ""It was really stressful and put a lot of anxiety on to me and to the point I had an anxiety attack during one of my shifts. ""It really triggered [a lack of] trust in working with others and didn't really encourage me to seek employment again after that."" Alice is now a freelance artist and aims to educate people about autism through her work. ""I just don't feel like there is much support regarding employment for autistic people,"" she said. 'How being a delivery man helps my autistic son Does your company nurture neurodiverse talent?

Rebecca Ellis says job inductions, mentors and a quiet room to go to when over-stimulated would help autistic workers Rebecca Ellis, 29, is a PhD student at Swansea University and received herautism,externaldiagnosis when she was 24. When working full-time as a behavioural assistant at a mainstream school two years ago she suffered long-term fatigue and burnout. ""We were needed at break time, at lunch time, before school, after school, in between lessons and during lessons. ""Even in the staff room there were eight of us in there, it was very loud, everyone's always trying to get their lunch... it's very busy and it's very friendly... but even friendliness can be overwhelming and quite a lot to be dealing with if you're trying to have a moment to yourself to calm down.

Paddy McGuinness on raising his three autistic children The autism-friendly toy shop: 'We have got this' Rebecca wants to see a number of accommodations made for autistic people at work. She would like either alternatives to an interview, such as a written assessments, or changes to the way interviews are carried out, such as giving autistic candidates the questions ahead of time. Students at Beechwood College have the opportunity to work in its coffee shop ""Starting a job is going to be one of the most overwhelming things for an autistic individual because you haven't met your colleagues... you don't know the environment, you don't know the parameters of your job, and all these things can create a really overwhelming situation,"" she said She suggested offering autistic employees a job induction, a mentor and taking the ""burden of asking for accommodations off the autistic person and managed by someone who has been trained in working in a neuro-diverse environment"". Sound-cancelling headphones, ""a quiet space in which no-one comes to find you"" to retreat to when feeling over-stimulated and individual work spaces to give employees ""a safe space to return to"" would also help, she said. She said most of the changes would benefit everyone. Dr Vaughn Price says autistic people face barriers to entering and remaining in paid work Dr Vaughn Price is the principal psychologist at Beechwood further education college in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, for students with autistic spectrum conditions. The college offers experience of work through its coffee shop, selling crafts on an online marketplace and having a workspace set up like an office environment. He said if workplaces could accommodate autistic employees they would reap the rewards: ""Some of the students I work with are the most hard-working, honest, dedicated, imaginative and creative people that I've ever met. ""You meet the needs of an autistic individual, by far they could be some of your most productive, happy and dedicated workers. The possibilities are great."" Beechwood students sell their crafts on an online marketplace Sian Donovan is director of Cardiff-based cycling charity Pedal Power, and after taking advice from Dr Price on how to make the charity more welcoming to autistic people, she took on an autistic volunteer to help with administration. ""He has great difficulty in in communicating with large groups of people and people that he doesn't know but has an excellent brain - we found that once a task was explained, provided he was left quietly to work in an office, he would do an excellent job, and he was very comfortable knowing people would not try and engage in chit-chat"". She said she would encourage others to take on autistic workers and volunteers: ""Don't be afraid of labels... or think that you can't cope, you're just dealing with individuals who may not be as comfortable making eye contact as others but it doesn't mean that they won't be able to do an excellent job."" Sian Donovan says has been working to make her charity more welcoming to autistic people Cardiff-based motor insurance company Admiral said it had more than 200 neurodiverse employees and had trained about 200 line managers in how best to support them. It said it provided support and adjustments to employees from the recruitment stage and throughout their career.

"The UK is hosting an international summit seen as crucial to bringing climate change under control PM Boris Johnson says the challenge is huge but there are no compelling reasons for procrastination The goal is to keep warming limited to 1.5C by 2100 but we are on track for 2.7C, which the UN says would result in ""climate catastrophe"" COP26 president Alok Sharma says the summit is the world's ""last, best hope"" to hit the 1.5C target More than 25,000 people are descending on the Scottish city of Glasgow for the two-week event, with large protests expected Leaders of the richest countries urge ""meaningful and effective action"" to achieve 1.5C at a G20 meeting in Rome but agree few specific measures Nearly 200 countries are being asked for more ambitious targets to reduce their carbon emissions in Glasgow Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer After a very busy day of speeches and announcements from Rome and Glasgow, that's us done for today. Our live coverage was produced by Jen Meierhans, Paul McLaren, Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Yaroslav Lukov. It was edited by Kevin Ponniah and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll be back tomorrow morning, as world leaders descend on Glasgow and finally get into the conference venue. See you then, but if you want more now -read this on what the climate summit could mean for all of us. Nicola Sturgeon met Vietnamese prime minister Pham Minh Chinh on the first day of COP26 World leaders are heading to Glasgow tonight, ahead of their meetings tomorrow for COP26. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has
said she will do everything possible to help make it a success, despite not being at
""the top table in discussions"". Speaking earlier as world leaders arrived in Glasgow, Sturgeon said: ""Scotland is welcoming the world to what may be the most important international conference of this century. ""Once world leaders are all in the same room, they must seize the moment and agree the necessary steps to prevent catastrophic temperature rises. ""And when they leave Glasgow, they must return home carrying a message of hope for humanity's future."" President Biden was asked a range of questions by journalists at his G20 news conference, and became visibly moved while answering one about his debates and splits within Catholicism and his personal relationship with Pope Francis. ""Pope Francis has become - I don't want to exaggerate - someone who has provided great solace for my family when my son died,"" he told the media. The president said he lost ""the real part of his soul""when his son Beau died in 2015, and recounted a story of how, days after Beau's death, Biden met the Pope during a visit to the US while working under then-President Barack Obama. ""Before he left and got on the plane, the Pope asked whether or not he could meet with my family and we met in a hanger in Philadelphia airport,"" Biden said - adding the meeting had a ""cathartic impact""  for his family. ""He's just a fine, decent, honourable man and we keep in touch,"" he added, before leaving the stage. President Biden gifted Pope Francis a special coin during a meeting in Rome on Friday Glasgow has been honoured in a unique way for hosting COP26 - withan Antarctic glacier being named after the city. The 100km-long ice stream is in a region of the White Continent known to beexperiencing rapid melting. Eight other nearby glaciers will also carry the names of cities where important climate reports were issued, or policies were agreed. They include Geneva, which held the very first climate conference in 1979. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the G20, a newly announced US-EU trade agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs had
all the makings of an economic event. But - ahead of COP26 - US President Joe Biden and EU
Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen made it an environmental one. Biden announced the US
was dropping Trump-era tariffs on European steel and aluminum â with the EU
also promising to end its retaliatory tariffs. While Biden touted the economic
benefits of the move, he emphasised the agreementâs hoped-for
environmental impact, stressing the deal would incentivise emission reductions in steel production and restrict access to the US and EU markets for âdirty steelâ from places such as China. Noting that steel production is one of the most carbon-intensive sectors
of the global economy, he said the US and EU had agreed to a âcarbon-based
arrangementâ. Von der Leyen, for her part, said the agreement was the start of âa new
global, sustainable steel arrangementâ. The president has finished taking media questions now, and left the stage. He was also asked about hisBuild Back Betterframework's climate policies. He's asked if his incentives toward renewable energy go far enough, and also about potentially introducing punitive measures to hold companies accountable. ""Everyone knows which direction it's going,"" he says in defence of his carrot-and-stick approach with US industry. Biden opens up the floor to questions from the media. The president is asked if the world can be confident that the US will make good on its climate promises without him having the votes in Congress on bills to authorise funding. He says he remains confident his plans will pass. He then addresses disappointment by some about what was agreed at the G20 ahead of COP26. Mr Biden says China and Russia ""basically didn't show up"" on matters of the climate and says he ""found it disappointing"". This video can not be played President Biden says Russia and China 'not showing up' on climate It seems the delay had something to do with an elevator - the president apologises and says it's a long story... but begins addressing the media in Rome. He describes a ""series of very productive meetings"" at the G20 news conference and says he is ""looking forward to continuing to make progress"" on climate issues in Glasgow. He speaks aboutthe new global minimum taxagreement on big businesses - describing it as an ""incredible win"" for all countries. The president also addresses issues of supply chain issues at home in the US and speaks about the hard-fought infrastructure deal his administration is trying to get passed in Congress. And President Biden has just begun his news conference in Rome. It seems like his post-G20 press conference will be a little later than expected. It's now after 20:15 local time in Rome. Hundreds of people hoping to get to Glasgow are delayed after storms disrupted train services from London's Euston Station Travellers heading to Scotland for the COP26 climate summit have been left stranded by major rail disruption caused by ""intense storms"". Hundreds of people were left waiting at London's Euston station after fallen trees caused all trains to be suspended. Network Rail said trains had been able to resume using a diversion, only for that route to then also become blocked. Read morehere. While we wait for President Biden's news conference, let's take a look at some of the reaction from the G20 agreements. As we've been hearing from Italy's PM, the leaders of the world's richest economies - the G20 - have pledged to pursue efforts to limit global warming with ""meaningful and effective actions"". But exactly how this will be achieved was not revealed in their statement leaving activists ""disappointed"". Their closing statement, called a communiquÃ©, makes no reference to achieving net zero by 2050, which many countries have already pledged to do and scientists say is critical to avoiding a climate catastrophe. Italy's PM said they are committed to net zero by ""mid-century"", but China - the world's worst polluter - and Russia have pushed their deadline out to 2060. The communiquÃ© does pledge, however, to stop financing new, unabated coal plants internationally by the end of this year - a strong message to coal-reliant nations such as China, Russia and India. But the G20 leaders stopped short of agreeing to end coal power in their own nations. Oscar Soria, of the activist network Avaaz, told the Reuters news agency there was ""little sense of urgency"" coming from the group, adding: ""There is no more time for vague wish-lists, we need concrete commitments and action."" Read more:G20 pledge climate action but make few commitments We are expecting to hear from US President Joe Biden shortly. Biden will speak from Rome, where a summit of G20 leaders just concluded. Cynthia Tjipuka is looking forward to showcasing her adopted city As world leaders start to arrive in Glasgow, a 1,000-strong team of volunteers have taken to the streets of the Scottish city to play their part in COP26. The volunteers will be on hand with local information to help the expected 25,000 visitors get around the city. They will be based at key transport hubs and travel routes including Buchanan Street bus station and along Lancefield Quay on the Clyde. For many, the event - which runs until 12 November - is about promoting Glasgow on a global stage. Cynthia Tjipuka, who moved to Scotland from Namibia 10 months ago, is thrilled at the prospect of being able to help showcase her adopted home city. She said: ""I'm seriously honoured and humbled to be part of such a huge event. This is a life-changing event for our future generations and for the planet."" Watch here Global poverty charity Oxfam says the G20 group of the world's richest countries have offered ""vague promises and platitudes"" instead of providing ""the lightning bolt that the COP26 climate talks so desperately need"". Oxfamâs senior adviser, JÃ¶rn Kalinski, says confirming the 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement was a ""minimum requirement"" and without a promise to revise national climate plans ""it is meaningless"". However, Kalinski says the promise to stop financing new coal power plants overseas by the end of this year was ""one of the few positives"" of the G20's statement. The half-hearted words on financing adaptation in vulnerable countries were again not backed up by timeframes or targets. Without these, poorer nations will continue to lack the resources they need to protect lives, homes and businesses from weather disasters. JÃ¶rn Kalinski, Oxfam, senior adviser Reality Check PM Boris Johnson has just spoken about the carbon-cutting progress the UK has made saying it is ""proof"" that more can be done. And earlier, Alok
Sharma, president of COP26, compared the UKâs climate record
with other leading economies, telling the BBC: âWe as a country have decarbonised our economy more than any other
G20 nationâ. But is that true? Since 1990, the UK has had about a 44% reduction in its yearly
carbon emissions, according to the latest government data. That is a bigger drop than any other major economy over recent years. Germanyâs annual
emissions, for example, are down about 30% over the same time period. Most
of the UKâs reduction has been achieved by decarbonising the energy sector -
closing coal-fired power stations and spending money on solar, wind and nuclear
energy. But the UK has struggled to achieve such sustained reductions in
its buildings and transport sector, with just a 1.6% and 0.2% cut in emissions
since 2011 respectively. Campaigners, including Greta Thunberg, also question the 44%
figure, saying it doesnât cover all emissions â for example, those associated
with making goods in other countries, which the UK then imports. The way the UK
calculates its figures, however, is consistent with other countries and the UN. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are
mostly responsible for our climate problem, but methane makes a significant
contribution. Molecule for molecule, its warming effect is greater than CO2,
but itâs also short-lived in the atmosphere, meaning that if we can get on top
of its human-produced sources (like fossil fuels, agriculture and waste landfills) we could have some quick wins in the battle against global
heating. Governments attending COP26 are being asked to sign up forthe Global Methane Pledge,externalwhich commits to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at
least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Today also sees the formal launch
ofthe UN Environment Programmeâs International Methane Emissions Observatory,external(IMEO).  A lot of their data will come from self-reporting by governments and
companies, but the observatory will also be making good use of remote-sensing
tools. Take a look at this picture just released from the GHGSat company. GHGSat flies a constellation of small satellites that can
now spy sources of methane at high resolution - selling its data to companies to help them
understand their emissions and develop strategies to deal with them. This image depicts an open-cast coal mine in Kazakhstan. The gas is
likely seeping from a new wall thatâs being worked on in the mine. If you're just joining our live coverage - here are the main developments at the G20 summit in Rome and the opening day of the COP26 in Glasgow:   Stay with us - as we'll be bringing you all the latest developments, eyewitness accounts and analysis by our correspondents on the ground. Here's a clip of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging world leaders to take real action at COP26 to avert the summit's failure. This video can not be played Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister is known for a style that is rarely a sentence or two away from the jocular. Puns, jokes, bonhomie. There was none of that in Boris Johnson's news conference as the G20 Summit closes in Rome. In his tone and his language, there was a seriousness of purpose; even, as ITV Political Editor Robert Peston suggested, a gloominess. On climate, the G20 had merely been ""reasonable,"" he said, progress had merely ""inched forward"". He acknowledged that the communiquÃ©, the agreement published at the end of the summit, was vague in its promises because of disagreement among the world's biggest economies. It promises members will reach net zero carbon emissions ""at or around mid-century"" - an acceptance that some haven't committed to 2050, but instead to 2060 - or have made no commitment at all.

"Refuse workers and street cleaners are striking for one week A strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow has started, as world leaders arrive for the COP26 climate summit. GMB Scotland said members in the city council's cleansing department would be striking for the next week. The union accused the council of failing to give members ""proper time and space"" to consider an offer from local authority body Cosla. Glasgow City Council said the union's decision was ""very disappointing"". They said they would meet with GMB ""at any time"" to resolve the dispute. Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer Glaswegians greet COP26 with pessimism and hope Rail strike action during COP26 called off Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal involved Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. GMB Scotland, Unison and Unite all suspended industrial action on Friday, after the offer was tabled, saying they would consult members. However, on Sunday GMB Scotland confirmed the strike in Glasgow was back on. The union's Drew Duffy told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the council was ""constantly goading our members"" and they had decided ""enough was enough and the strike continues"". He explained: ""The workforce are the lowest paid workers in Scotland. There are deep rooted problems within Glasgow City Council. We have been trying to meet with the council. ""It is a constant breakdown of industrial relations, there have been longstanding problems with low pay and discriminatory pay and our members have just had enough. The conditions they work in, the pay they receive is not good enough."" Refuse staff and street cleaners on a picket line outside the Dawsholm Recycling Centre in Glasgow on Monday morning The move by the union came as Glasgow geared up to welcome about 120 world leaders to the city for crucial climate talks at COP26. In a statement released on Monday, a Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: ""The agreement struck at national level gave two weeks to consider the pay offer and so there is no reason for this strike to go ahead at this time. It is very disappointing the GMB has opted for this course of action. ""We have already agreed their request for time to meet with their members. And, while we remain available to meet with them at any time, we are unable to deliver their request for a pay increase. ""That is part of a national negotiation and a new deal was tabled by Cosla last week. ""It appeared that GMB, along with the other unions, had agreed to suspend the strike until national consultation was complete and it is very disappointing they have reneged on that agreement and have not given us the required 14 days' notice after they publicly announced the suspension on Friday."" The GMB, Unison and Unite had initially called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from Cosla. Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said they put their ""new and improved"" offer to trade unions last week. ""We were pleased to note that that it was accepted with the expectation that strike action be suspended whilst they presented the new offer to their membership for consideration,"" she added. ""GMB in particular made a public statement that they were suspending strike action for a period of two weeks as of Friday whilst the ballot of their members was conducted nationally across all 32 councils that this affects. ""We very much hope that this remains the case and that all members are given the opportunity to participate whilst essential services are maintained."" The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic and were ""fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government"". The Scottish government said it was not party to the pay negotiations, but said it had made a one-off offer of Â£30m in additional funding to help find a solution. Scottish minister Michael Matheson, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, said: ""The GMB locally have entered into a dispute now with GCC which I understand is not to do with the actual package itself but it's the process around being able to engage with their members and discuss that with them. ""I understand that discussions were taking place last night and the Scottish government would want to continue to encourage Cosla, GCC and the GMB to continue to discuss this issue and to try and find a quick resolution to what I believe is a process issue rather than an issue around the deal that was proposed.""

"Alok Sharma was addressing COP26 in Glasgow on Sunday morning The window to keep within the 1.5 degree warming target is closing, COP26 president Alok Sharma has warned the climate summit in Glasgow. Scientists say that keeping global warming below 1.5C - a target world leaders agreed to work towards in 2015 - will avoid the worst climate impacts. ""We know our shared planet is changing for the worse, and we can only address that together,"" said Mr Sharma. Sunday is day one of COP26, which was postponed from 2020. In his opening speech at the summit, Mr Sharma said: ""During that year climate change did not take time off."" Areport by the World Meteorological Organisation, launched to coincide with the start of COP26 , said that extreme weather events - including powerful heat waves and devastating floods - are the new normal. Mr Sharma said: ""We need to hit the ground running to develop the solutions that we need. And that work starts today - and we succeed or fail as one."" The Conservative MP added that COP26 was ""our last best hope"" to meet the aim originally set by world leaders in Paris six years ago. ""Where Paris promised, Glasgow delivers,"" he said. Simple guide to climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important Latest as pivotal climate change summit begins Mr Sharma, who was appointed to the role of COP26 president on 8 January, said the ""rapidly changing climate is sounding an alarm to the world"". ""I believe we can move negotiations forward and launch a decade of ever increasing ambition and action."" He earlier told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that ""this is on leaders"" and they needed ""to come forward"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC that climate change was ""the biggest threat to humanity"", saying it posed a ""risk to civilisation basically going backwards"". At face value, things do not look promising, for a simple reason: the previous 25 of these giant conferences failed to turn off the tap of the greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. Despite three decades of talking, the planet is now at least 1.1C hotter than the pre-industrial level - and rising. For this conference, however, expectations for real progress are higher than usual. That's partly because the risks are hitting home. This year floods killed 200 people in Germany, heatwaves struck chilly Canada and even the Siberian Arctic was burning. And scientists are clearer than ever that avoiding the most damaging temperatures means halving global carbon emissions by 2030 - a deadline looming close enough to focus minds. Read the full analysis The two-week COP26 summit, which ends on 12 November, will see delegates from around 200 countries discuss how to cut emissions by 2030. More than 25,000 people are expected to descend on the city for the event, including international delegates and protestors. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is currently in Glasgowbut told BBC One's Andrew Marrthat she had not been ""officially"" invited to speak at COP26. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Asked whether she believed an agreement would be reached to keep global warming below 1.5C, she said she thought it was ""possible in theory"". ""We know that change is possible, because we can look back in history and see that there have been massive changes in society that have been unprecedented,"" Ms Thunberg said. ""If we felt like there wasn't any hope, we wouldn't be activists."" By Debbie Jackson, BBC Scotland reporter, at the scene COP26 delegates are greeted with an authentic Glasgow welcome - it's a gloomy Sunday and the rain is pouring down. Traffic in the city centre is made up of electric buses, brought in to service the conference, and police vans from across the UK. Climate campaigners make their way along the river with damp flags, and the COP26 volunteers try to remain cheery in their sodden bobble hats. Blue-lanyarded delegates are being dropped off at the squinty bridge to walk to the venue. I bump into delegates from Gabon who arrived less than 24 hours ago. They've just had breakfast in a local cafÃ© and are ready to make their case. Ghislain Moussavou, director general of the government's forestry commission, is here with a private contractor, Hadi Ghossein. Mr Moussavou says: ""We are here to speak up for Africa. We are doing a lot to combat the effects of climate change and we bear a lot of its impact."" As COP26 begins, key political leaders have ended the G20 summit in Rome setting an ambition to reach carbon neutrality ""by or around mid-century"". In a draft of their final communique, seen by the BBC, they have agreed to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C. That goes further than the Paris agreement, in which much of the world agreed to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C. The G20 is a global forum where 19 countries and the European Union discuss major issues. China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin have chosen not to attend in person - instead appearing via video link. During the event, Prince Charles hasurged governmentsto work with the private sector in a bid to make progress ""for the sake of humanity"". The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Construction equipment maker JCB has signed a deal to buy billions of pounds of green hydrogen, defined as hydrogen produced using renewable energy. The deal means JCB will take 10% of the green hydrogen made by the Australian firm Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). FFI said the deal was a ""first-of-a-kind partnership"" that would see it become the UK's largest supplier of the clean fuel. Production, mostly done outside the UK, is expected to begin early next year. JCB and a firm called Ryze Hydrogen would then distribute it in the UK. Lord Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, said the deal would help to make green hydrogen a viable solution, telling the BBC it was ""the right thing to do"". Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? Can hydrogen fuel help drive towards green future? The global race to produce hydrogen offshore Hydrogen does not produce carbon emissions when it is burned, so is considered a likely replacement for fossil fuels in heavy industries such as shipping and steel and cement-making. Lord Bamford has also called on the government to invest in hydrogen-fuelled forms of transport such as buses, trains and aircraft. In a statement, he said: ""It's fine having an engine powered by green hydrogen, but no good if customers can't get green hydrogen to fuel their machines. ""This is a major advance on the road towards making green hydrogen a viable solution."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said low carbon hydrogenhas a critical role to play in the UK's transition to net zero- that is balancing the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. In the government's UK Hydrogen Strategy, the business secretary argues the UK's ""infrastructure and technical know-how make us ideally positioned to be a global leader in hydrogen"". However, he has previously admitted its production, and use, would have to rapidly increase for the government's ambitions to be achieved. Lord Bamford's son and entrepreneur Jo Bamford also owns Wrightbus, which built the world's first hydrogen double decker Robert Buckley, an energy analyst at Cornwall Insights, said: ""Hydrogen has the potential to be a very important energy source for heavy transport and industry."" But he pointed out that Australia, where the hydrogen for the JCB deal will largely be produced, has more solar electricity resources than the UK, as well as an established gas export industry. He said that could give other countries, such as Australia, ""an early advantage"" while hydrogen production in the UK became more established. Ministers think low carbon hydrogen has a critical role to play in the transition to net zero. The goal is 5 gigawatts of production capacity by 2030. However, the Business Secretary admits production and usage would have to be ramped up fast for that to be met. And when the government's UK Hydrogen Strategy was published in August, the trade association RenewableUK said it didn't focus enough on developing the UK's green hydrogen industry - meaning production that uses renewable energy, not natural gas. The new agreement involves importing green hydrogen from abroad, made by a subsidiary of Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Mining Group. One energy analyst said that such deals could mean that the technology becomes commercial quicker, and firms themselves take it up more quickly. That's clearly the hope for two hydrogen-enthusiastic businessmen. JCB, based in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire,also announced earlier this monththat it was spending Â£100m on a project to produce ""super efficient hydrogen engines"" to power its machinery. This latest deal ties in billionaire Lord Bamford and JCB with FFI, which is the newer renewables subsidiary of mining giant Fortescue Metals Group, owned by Andrew Forrest. Lord Bamford's son, entrepreneur Jo Bamford, is also founder of Ryze Hydrogen, which is building the UK's first network of green hydrogen production plants. Mr Bamford is also the chairman and owner of Wrightbus, which built the UK's first hydrogen double decker. DON'T FORGET!:Why do we turn the clocks back?

"French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson (right) met in Rome on Sunday Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron remain at loggerheads in the ongoing dispute over permits for fishing boats. On Sunday, the leaders met to discuss tensions and the UK government said it was ""up to France"" to step back from threats over port access. But Mr Macron said the ball was ""in Britain's court"" and he hoped there would be a positive response on Monday. Mr Macron added it was not a bilateral issue for the nations but an EU issue. The row comes ahead of Tuesday, which is the deadline for more permits to be granted for French fishing boats to operate in British waters. Otherwise UK fishing boats could be barred from some ports, French officials have warned. Following the meeting on Sunday, French officials said the pair had agreed to work on a solution in the ""next hours and days"". But later, a spokesman for Mr Johnson said no measures had been agreed. Mr Johnson said it was a ""wide ranging and frank discussion"", and insisted that should be expected ""between long standing friends and very, very close allies"". Turbulence has hit relations with France, PM says Fishing row a test of UK's credibility - Macron Who really owns UK fishing rights? On Friday, a letter from the French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seen by the BBC, said the EU must demonstrate in this dispute that there was ""more damage to leaving the EU than remaining there"". Mr Johnson said he was ""puzzled"" by the letter: ""I must say I was puzzled to read a letter from the French prime minister explicitly asking for Britain to be punished for leaving the EU. ""I just have to say to everybody I don't believe that that is compatible either with the spirit or the letter of the Withdrawal Agreement or the Trade and Cooperation agreement, and that's probably all I'll say about that one."" It was perhaps inevitable there'd be a moment - or more than one moment - where the Brexit deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, would be tested. The new legal arrangements between the UK and EU set out how the two sides should interact, after decades of shared rules with the UK inside the bloc. First there were the rows about the Northern Ireland Protocol. And now fish. Strikingly, the prime minister has leant into the leaked letter from his French opposite number, Jean Castex, which had said the EU must demonstrate there was ""more damage to leaving the EU than remaining there."" Whatever the subsequent questions about the translation of chunks of the letter, Boris Johnson chose to point to it as a source of not just irritation, but something ""not compatible with the spirit or letter"" of the Brexit agreement. This brouhaha isn't done yet. An earlier statement on behalf of Mr Johnson said he had ""reiterated his deep concern over the rhetoric emanating from the French government in recent days, including the suggestion by the French prime minister that the UK should be punished for leaving the EU"". And it said Mr Johnson had ""expressed his hope that the French government would de-escalate this rhetoric and withdraw their threats"". The PM's spokesman then went further, adding: ""It's down to France to decide if they want to step away from the deeply concerning threats. ""We are not seeking to escalate this. We would welcome it if they de-escalate and withdraw the threats they have made. [But] it will be for the French to decide."" The two leaders held a 30-minute informal meeting in Rome, where leaders of the world's richest economies, the G20, have been holding talks. A French official said: ""We see that Boris Johnson is trying to make the fishing story a French-UK affair. It is a post-Brexit affair which should be handled between the European Union and the United Kingdom. ""And what we are asking for from the British is that they respect their signature."" Although fishing is a small part of both the British and French economies, it has played a large part politically throughout Brexit. But this particular row began after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday. Since then, the wider issue of how many permits the UK grants to France post-Brexit to fish in British waters has come to the fore. France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing permits to dozens of French boats and argued this breached the Brexit deal. It then warned it would block British boats from landing their catches in some French ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute over fishing permits was not resolved by Tuesday. France has also said it could cut electricity supplies to Jersey, a British Crown dependency, as it previously threatened in May. For a brief moment, it looked like the row over fishing permits might be about to calm down - but it was only brief. It is unusual to get quite such contradictory accounts of the same meeting. Of course, both men have home crowds to which they want to play. And over recent years, we've also got used to hearing punchy statements in the heat of diplomatic negotiations. But what will worry some is the possibility that this could be more than negotiating ""theatre"" and instead a sign of a growing lack of mutual trust between two important allies. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Johnson acknowledged there was ""turbulence"" in the UK's relationship with France. But he insisted the things that united the two countries were more important than their divisions. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg pressed the PM on Saturday over how he planned to remedy the fishing row However, taking to Twitter, his Brexit minister Lord Frost said on Saturday the government was ""actively considering"" launching a legal process against France under the Brexit agreement, as a result of the ""threats"". He tweeted: ""We will continue to talk constructively to try to resolve all the differences between us, and we urge the EU and France to step back from rhetoric and actions that make this more difficult."" On Sunday, France's minister for Europe, ClÃ©ment Beaune, replied to Lord Frost, saying France had been ""negotiating patiently and constructively for 10 months"". He rejected claims there had been technical issues leading to the problems, saying: ""It's not a technical issue, it's a political choice and a breach of the [Brexit deal]."" He added: ""A friend, ally and responsible partner should stand by its word and comply with legal commitments."" DON'T FORGET!:Why do we turn the clocks back?

"Construction equipment maker JCB has signed a deal to buy billions of pounds of green hydrogen, defined as hydrogen produced using renewable energy. The deal means JCB will take 10% of the green hydrogen made by the Australian firm Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). FFI said the deal was a ""first-of-a-kind partnership"" that would see it become the UK's largest supplier of the clean fuel. Production, mostly done outside the UK, is expected to begin early next year. JCB and a firm called Ryze Hydrogen would then distribute it in the UK. Lord Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, said the deal would help to make green hydrogen a viable solution, telling the BBC it was ""the right thing to do"". Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? Can hydrogen fuel help drive towards green future? The global race to produce hydrogen offshore Hydrogen does not produce carbon emissions when it is burned, so is considered a likely replacement for fossil fuels in heavy industries such as shipping and steel and cement-making. Lord Bamford has also called on the government to invest in hydrogen-fuelled forms of transport such as buses, trains and aircraft. In a statement, he said: ""It's fine having an engine powered by green hydrogen, but no good if customers can't get green hydrogen to fuel their machines. ""This is a major advance on the road towards making green hydrogen a viable solution."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said low carbon hydrogenhas a critical role to play in the UK's transition to net zero- that is balancing the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. In the government's UK Hydrogen Strategy, the business secretary argues the UK's ""infrastructure and technical know-how make us ideally positioned to be a global leader in hydrogen"". However, he has previously admitted its production, and use, would have to rapidly increase for the government's ambitions to be achieved. Lord Bamford's son and entrepreneur Jo Bamford also owns Wrightbus, which built the world's first hydrogen double decker Robert Buckley, an energy analyst at Cornwall Insights, said: ""Hydrogen has the potential to be a very important energy source for heavy transport and industry."" But he pointed out that Australia, where the hydrogen for the JCB deal will largely be produced, has more solar electricity resources than the UK, as well as an established gas export industry. He said that could give other countries, such as Australia, ""an early advantage"" while hydrogen production in the UK became more established. Ministers think low carbon hydrogen has a critical role to play in the transition to net zero. The goal is 5 gigawatts of production capacity by 2030. However, the Business Secretary admits production and usage would have to be ramped up fast for that to be met. And when the government's UK Hydrogen Strategy was published in August, the trade association RenewableUK said it didn't focus enough on developing the UK's green hydrogen industry - meaning production that uses renewable energy, not natural gas. The new agreement involves importing green hydrogen from abroad, made by a subsidiary of Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Mining Group. One energy analyst said that such deals could mean that the technology becomes commercial quicker, and firms themselves take it up more quickly. That's clearly the hope for two hydrogen-enthusiastic businessmen. JCB, based in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire,also announced earlier this monththat it was spending Â£100m on a project to produce ""super efficient hydrogen engines"" to power its machinery. This latest deal ties in billionaire Lord Bamford and JCB with FFI, which is the newer renewables subsidiary of mining giant Fortescue Metals Group, owned by Andrew Forrest. Lord Bamford's son, entrepreneur Jo Bamford, is also founder of Ryze Hydrogen, which is building the UK's first network of green hydrogen production plants. Mr Bamford is also the chairman and owner of Wrightbus, which built the UK's first hydrogen double decker. DON'T FORGET!:Why do we turn the clocks back?

"The glaciers' floating fronts join to form a single, continuous platform, known as the Getz Ice Shelf A previously unnamed glacier in West Antarctica is to be called Glasgow Glacier to mark the Scottish city's hosting of the COP26 climate meeting. The 100km-long ice stream is in a region of the White Continent known to beexperiencing rapid melting. Eight other nearby glaciers will also carry the names of cities where important climate reports were issued, or policies were agreed. They include Geneva, which held the very first climate conference in 1979. But anyone who's followed the meandering road of international climate diplomacy down the years will recognise, too, the significance of Rio, Berlin, Kyoto, Bali, Stockholm, Paris and Incheon (see their history below). What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Four numbers to remember going into COP26 Antarctic place names recognise 'modern explorers' The scientists who proposed the names said they wanted the glaciers to be a symbol of what was at stake in Glasgow over the next couple of weeks. ""We know that if we continue on the current emissions path,we're heading for 2.7 degrees of warming(by the end of the century) and the consequences this will have for the intensity and regularity of events such as droughts, floods, cyclones, and issues with crop yields, etc,"" said Heather Selley, who monitors the glaciers using satellite imagery. ""It's now up to us to decide whether this is the point where humans step up and try to address climate change, or whether it represents a downward spiral with continuing reliance on fossil fuels and the pumping of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,"" the Leeds University and Alan Turing Institute researcher told BBC News. Artwork: Ms Selley uses the European Union's Sentinel-1 satellite system to monitor glaciers Ms Selley's team reported in February,externalhow the glaciers entering the ocean along the Getz coast in West Antarctica were being thinned and accelerated on encountering relatively warm seawater. Using the satellite data, the researchers calculated the area as a whole had lost some 315 billion tonnes of ice over the past 25 years - the equivalent of 126 million Olympic swimming pools of water. This would have raised the global ocean surface by 0.9mm over the period. That might not sound much but this contribution was from just one, 600km-wide region of coastal Antarctica. Other locations in the west of the White Continent are melting a lot faster. The new names for the Getz glaciers follow a chronological order, starting in the west with Geneva and ending with Glasgow in the east. This direction is also marked by a progressive increase in the heat content of the local ocean water. ""The order reflects the warming climate we saw as the events in these cities happened,"" explained Ms Selley. It's 104km (63 miles) in length, which is roughly 4/5ths the length of Hadrian's Wall Its area is 2,630 sq km (1,630 sq miles) or 15 times the size of the Scottish city itself The new glacier names were submitted by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office on behalf of the UK government and supported by the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee. The names will now be added to the international Composite Gazetteer for Antarctica, for use on maps, charts and future publications. Antarctica is so vast, many places still carry no formal name, only  latitude and longitude coordinates. Genevais named after the world's first climate conference in 1979.

"The River Conwy bursts its banks in Llanrwst last October The UK is hosting a summit at the end of October which is regarded as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. The COP26 meeting in Glasgow could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Here we outline in charts some of the key facts about the state of Wales and its climate change challenges. It's not something to be sniffed at but the 8.9 million sheep and 414,000 cows in Wales add a peculiar facet to the climate change landscape in Wales. Agriculture contributes nearly 14% of greenhouse gas emissions in Wales, with gases generated from the rear ends of livestock providing a good chunk of that. Energy supply, particularly from power generation, is the biggest single source though. Cars alone are behind nearly 60% of transport's share, but there is hope the move to hybrid and electric vehicles may have an impact. The iron and steel industry in Wales is the source of 60% of the business sector's emission levels in Wales. Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions It's been a bumpy road. As we can see from the chart below, there have been years recently when emissions have gone up, as well as down. It's mainly because we've got lots of heavy industry and some massive power plants. Just shutting Wales' last coal-fired power station helped towards half of the fall in emissions after 2016. Although overall we've seen a 31% cut in emissions over the last 30 years, by 2030 we need to have reached a 63% reduction - and in the 20 years after that, we have to have net zero carbon emissions. A big challenge. About 60% of us in Wales live in coastal areas, with some communities living below the high tideline. Just under 12,000 properties are at high risk from coastal or river flooding. There are just under 10,000 at high or medium risk of tidal flooding alone. This could increase by 260% by the 2080s - while 2,126 properties are likely to be at risk of coastal erosion where defences are not maintained. We've also got nationally important infrastructure - roads, railways, and big power plants - next to the sea. This map shows parts of north Wales that are at risk of flooding Flooding risk from climate change has been built intonew planning policy for developments in Wales, with details released in September These included new flood risk maps, like the one shown above for the north Wales coast. By 2050 it's thought it could get 6% more rainy in winter in Wales, with as much as 13% more rain by the 2080s. Also, when it does pour down it could be more intense, making flooding issues worse. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glashow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Traffic fumes from petrol and diesel cars are part of the problem when it comes to warming the atmosphere. But they also contain harmful pollutants that we breathe in - like nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The chart below shows NO2 as it is measured at 187 industrial and commercial sites around Wales. Refineries, iron and steel-making and cement works dominate the top 10 emission locations across the nation. Heavy industry supports substantial numbers of jobs, so the challenge is how to make processes cleaner - and move towards a greener economy. Demolition to start on Wales' most polluted street New 50mph limits will start being enforced One thing we all noticed during the Covid pandemic - the roads were a lot quieter. In fact, traffic on the roads in Wales dropped by nearly a quarter last year due to Covid and to levels we've not seen since 1998. So really we need to look at what ""normal"" looks like. Between 1993 and 2019, traffic volumes rose by 45%. A third of it was moving within Cardiff, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Carmarthenshire and Newport. We can also see in recent years that more of us were travelling by train too. Moving towards more public transport - and active travel - are priorities for policy makers. Latest surveys show 4% cycle to work or to a destination at least once a week, while 60% of us walked for an hour a week at least, for the same purpose. Cycling was the one mode of transport which actually showed a rise during lockdown, as many people worked from home or travelled locally. Climate change is already having an increasing impact on Wales' natural world, according to conservation groups. The annualState of Nature report,,externalpublished jointly by leading wildlife and nature charities, gives a snapshot of the threats in Wales.  666out of  3,902 species in Wales (17%) at threat of extinction 73species lost already 523of 6,500 species found in Wales (8%) at threat of extinction from Britain 35%fall in kittiwake population 15days earlier for arrival of swallows 11days earlier when great tits lay their eggs, compared to 1968 The kittiwake population of Wales has declined by 35% since 1986. Across the UK, climate change has reduced the availability of sand eels, a key food source. As well as seeing birds migrating here that we would not usually expect to see, swallows are arriving 15 days earlier and breeding 11 days earlier than they did in the 1960s Areas threatened include salt marsh habitats. We know 17% of species in 2019 were under threat of extinction. Hundreds of species in Wales under threat What is climate change doing to Wales? Woodland in ancient times used to cover much of Wales. Today, it makes up only about 15% of the land mass, but there isan ambition to create a National Forest for Wales. As well as protecting existing trees, the programme would see more woodland planted. New trees would eventually help climate change by taking carbon from the air as they grow, while also creating more habitat and helping to reduce flooding. But there has been a fall-back in new planting of woodland in recent years, so there is some ground to make up. In 2017, the Welsh government announced a target of meeting the equivalent of 70% of Wales' electricity demand from renewable electricity sources by 2030. In 2019, it is estimated that this figure stands at 51%. When we look at estimated electricity generated in Wales, more than two thirds comes from gas. Renewables account for 27% - with more than 18% of that from wind energy. The last coal-fired power station closed more than 18 months ago and there is currently no nuclear power option. It's not all doom and gloom.Wales is one of the world's best nations for recycling, according to one analysis. The research from the Eunomia environmental consultancy, at the end of 2017, looked at comparable data from each country to work out the kilograms per head recycled. Latest Welsh government figures show 64.8% of waste was recycled or composted in 2020 - a slight increase on 2019, despite the pandemic. Each of us still produces an average 173kg of household waste that's not recycled - but that has come down by 20% in seven years.

"The UK is hosting an international summit seen as crucial to bringing climate change under control PM Boris Johnson says the challenge is huge but there are no compelling reasons for procrastination The goal is to keep warming limited to 1.5C by 2100 but we are on track for 2.7C, which the UN says would result in ""climate catastrophe"" COP26 president Alok Sharma says the summit is the world's ""last, best hope"" to hit the 1.5C target More than 25,000 people are descending on the Scottish city of Glasgow for the two-week event, with large protests expected Leaders of the richest countries urge ""meaningful and effective action"" to achieve 1.5C at a G20 meeting in Rome but agree few specific measures Nearly 200 countries are being asked for more ambitious targets to reduce their carbon emissions in Glasgow Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer After a very busy day of speeches and announcements from Rome and Glasgow, that's us done for today. Our live coverage was produced by Jen Meierhans, Paul McLaren, Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Yaroslav Lukov. It was edited by Kevin Ponniah and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll be back tomorrow morning, as world leaders descend on Glasgow and finally get into the conference venue. See you then, but if you want more now -read this on what the climate summit could mean for all of us. Nicola Sturgeon met Vietnamese prime minister Pham Minh Chinh on the first day of COP26 World leaders are heading to Glasgow tonight, ahead of their meetings tomorrow for COP26. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has
said she will do everything possible to help make it a success, despite not being at
""the top table in discussions"". Speaking earlier as world leaders arrived in Glasgow, Sturgeon said: ""Scotland is welcoming the world to what may be the most important international conference of this century. ""Once world leaders are all in the same room, they must seize the moment and agree the necessary steps to prevent catastrophic temperature rises. ""And when they leave Glasgow, they must return home carrying a message of hope for humanity's future."" President Biden was asked a range of questions by journalists at his G20 news conference, and became visibly moved while answering one about his debates and splits within Catholicism and his personal relationship with Pope Francis. ""Pope Francis has become - I don't want to exaggerate - someone who has provided great solace for my family when my son died,"" he told the media. The president said he lost ""the real part of his soul""when his son Beau died in 2015, and recounted a story of how, days after Beau's death, Biden met the Pope during a visit to the US while working under then-President Barack Obama. ""Before he left and got on the plane, the Pope asked whether or not he could meet with my family and we met in a hanger in Philadelphia airport,"" Biden said - adding the meeting had a ""cathartic impact""  for his family. ""He's just a fine, decent, honourable man and we keep in touch,"" he added, before leaving the stage. President Biden gifted Pope Francis a special coin during a meeting in Rome on Friday Glasgow has been honoured in a unique way for hosting COP26 - withan Antarctic glacier being named after the city. The 100km-long ice stream is in a region of the White Continent known to beexperiencing rapid melting. Eight other nearby glaciers will also carry the names of cities where important climate reports were issued, or policies were agreed. They include Geneva, which held the very first climate conference in 1979. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the G20, a newly announced US-EU trade agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs had
all the makings of an economic event. But - ahead of COP26 - US President Joe Biden and EU
Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen made it an environmental one. Biden announced the US
was dropping Trump-era tariffs on European steel and aluminum â with the EU
also promising to end its retaliatory tariffs. While Biden touted the economic
benefits of the move, he emphasised the agreementâs hoped-for
environmental impact, stressing the deal would incentivise emission reductions in steel production and restrict access to the US and EU markets for âdirty steelâ from places such as China. Noting that steel production is one of the most carbon-intensive sectors
of the global economy, he said the US and EU had agreed to a âcarbon-based
arrangementâ. Von der Leyen, for her part, said the agreement was the start of âa new
global, sustainable steel arrangementâ. The president has finished taking media questions now, and left the stage. He was also asked about hisBuild Back Betterframework's climate policies. He's asked if his incentives toward renewable energy go far enough, and also about potentially introducing punitive measures to hold companies accountable. ""Everyone knows which direction it's going,"" he says in defence of his carrot-and-stick approach with US industry. Biden opens up the floor to questions from the media. The president is asked if the world can be confident that the US will make good on its climate promises without him having the votes in Congress on bills to authorise funding. He says he remains confident his plans will pass. He then addresses disappointment by some about what was agreed at the G20 ahead of COP26. Mr Biden says China and Russia ""basically didn't show up"" on matters of the climate and says he ""found it disappointing"". This video can not be played President Biden says Russia and China 'not showing up' on climate It seems the delay had something to do with an elevator - the president apologises and says it's a long story... but begins addressing the media in Rome. He describes a ""series of very productive meetings"" at the G20 news conference and says he is ""looking forward to continuing to make progress"" on climate issues in Glasgow. He speaks aboutthe new global minimum taxagreement on big businesses - describing it as an ""incredible win"" for all countries. The president also addresses issues of supply chain issues at home in the US and speaks about the hard-fought infrastructure deal his administration is trying to get passed in Congress. And President Biden has just begun his news conference in Rome. It seems like his post-G20 press conference will be a little later than expected. It's now after 20:15 local time in Rome. Hundreds of people hoping to get to Glasgow are delayed after storms disrupted train services from London's Euston Station Travellers heading to Scotland for the COP26 climate summit have been left stranded by major rail disruption caused by ""intense storms"". Hundreds of people were left waiting at London's Euston station after fallen trees caused all trains to be suspended. Network Rail said trains had been able to resume using a diversion, only for that route to then also become blocked. Read morehere. While we wait for President Biden's news conference, let's take a look at some of the reaction from the G20 agreements. As we've been hearing from Italy's PM, the leaders of the world's richest economies - the G20 - have pledged to pursue efforts to limit global warming with ""meaningful and effective actions"". But exactly how this will be achieved was not revealed in their statement leaving activists ""disappointed"". Their closing statement, called a communiquÃ©, makes no reference to achieving net zero by 2050, which many countries have already pledged to do and scientists say is critical to avoiding a climate catastrophe. Italy's PM said they are committed to net zero by ""mid-century"", but China - the world's worst polluter - and Russia have pushed their deadline out to 2060. The communiquÃ© does pledge, however, to stop financing new, unabated coal plants internationally by the end of this year - a strong message to coal-reliant nations such as China, Russia and India. But the G20 leaders stopped short of agreeing to end coal power in their own nations. Oscar Soria, of the activist network Avaaz, told the Reuters news agency there was ""little sense of urgency"" coming from the group, adding: ""There is no more time for vague wish-lists, we need concrete commitments and action."" Read more:G20 pledge climate action but make few commitments We are expecting to hear from US President Joe Biden shortly. Biden will speak from Rome, where a summit of G20 leaders just concluded. Cynthia Tjipuka is looking forward to showcasing her adopted city As world leaders start to arrive in Glasgow, a 1,000-strong team of volunteers have taken to the streets of the Scottish city to play their part in COP26. The volunteers will be on hand with local information to help the expected 25,000 visitors get around the city. They will be based at key transport hubs and travel routes including Buchanan Street bus station and along Lancefield Quay on the Clyde. For many, the event - which runs until 12 November - is about promoting Glasgow on a global stage. Cynthia Tjipuka, who moved to Scotland from Namibia 10 months ago, is thrilled at the prospect of being able to help showcase her adopted home city. She said: ""I'm seriously honoured and humbled to be part of such a huge event. This is a life-changing event for our future generations and for the planet."" Watch here Global poverty charity Oxfam says the G20 group of the world's richest countries have offered ""vague promises and platitudes"" instead of providing ""the lightning bolt that the COP26 climate talks so desperately need"". Oxfamâs senior adviser, JÃ¶rn Kalinski, says confirming the 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement was a ""minimum requirement"" and without a promise to revise national climate plans ""it is meaningless"". However, Kalinski says the promise to stop financing new coal power plants overseas by the end of this year was ""one of the few positives"" of the G20's statement. The half-hearted words on financing adaptation in vulnerable countries were again not backed up by timeframes or targets. Without these, poorer nations will continue to lack the resources they need to protect lives, homes and businesses from weather disasters. JÃ¶rn Kalinski, Oxfam, senior adviser Reality Check PM Boris Johnson has just spoken about the carbon-cutting progress the UK has made saying it is ""proof"" that more can be done. And earlier, Alok
Sharma, president of COP26, compared the UKâs climate record
with other leading economies, telling the BBC: âWe as a country have decarbonised our economy more than any other
G20 nationâ. But is that true? Since 1990, the UK has had about a 44% reduction in its yearly
carbon emissions, according to the latest government data. That is a bigger drop than any other major economy over recent years. Germanyâs annual
emissions, for example, are down about 30% over the same time period. Most
of the UKâs reduction has been achieved by decarbonising the energy sector -
closing coal-fired power stations and spending money on solar, wind and nuclear
energy. But the UK has struggled to achieve such sustained reductions in
its buildings and transport sector, with just a 1.6% and 0.2% cut in emissions
since 2011 respectively. Campaigners, including Greta Thunberg, also question the 44%
figure, saying it doesnât cover all emissions â for example, those associated
with making goods in other countries, which the UK then imports. The way the UK
calculates its figures, however, is consistent with other countries and the UN. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are
mostly responsible for our climate problem, but methane makes a significant
contribution. Molecule for molecule, its warming effect is greater than CO2,
but itâs also short-lived in the atmosphere, meaning that if we can get on top
of its human-produced sources (like fossil fuels, agriculture and waste landfills) we could have some quick wins in the battle against global
heating. Governments attending COP26 are being asked to sign up forthe Global Methane Pledge,externalwhich commits to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at
least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Today also sees the formal launch
ofthe UN Environment Programmeâs International Methane Emissions Observatory,external(IMEO).  A lot of their data will come from self-reporting by governments and
companies, but the observatory will also be making good use of remote-sensing

"The UK is hosting an international summit seen as crucial to bringing climate change under control PM Boris Johnson says the challenge is huge but there are no compelling reasons for procrastination The goal is to keep warming limited to 1.5C by 2100 but we are on track for 2.7C, which the UN says would result in ""climate catastrophe"" COP26 president Alok Sharma says the summit is the world's ""last, best hope"" to hit the 1.5C target More than 25,000 people are descending on the Scottish city of Glasgow for the two-week event, with large protests expected Leaders of the richest countries urge ""meaningful and effective action"" to achieve 1.5C at a G20 meeting in Rome but agree few specific measures Nearly 200 countries are being asked for more ambitious targets to reduce their carbon emissions in Glasgow Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer After a very busy day of speeches and announcements from Rome and Glasgow, that's us done for today. Our live coverage was produced by Jen Meierhans, Paul McLaren, Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Yaroslav Lukov. It was edited by Kevin Ponniah and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll be back tomorrow morning, as world leaders descend on Glasgow and finally get into the conference venue. See you then, but if you want more now -read this on what the climate summit could mean for all of us. Nicola Sturgeon met Vietnamese prime minister Pham Minh Chinh on the first day of COP26 World leaders are heading to Glasgow tonight, ahead of their meetings tomorrow for COP26. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has
said she will do everything possible to help make it a success, despite not being at
""the top table in discussions"". Speaking earlier as world leaders arrived in Glasgow, Sturgeon said: ""Scotland is welcoming the world to what may be the most important international conference of this century. ""Once world leaders are all in the same room, they must seize the moment and agree the necessary steps to prevent catastrophic temperature rises. ""And when they leave Glasgow, they must return home carrying a message of hope for humanity's future."" President Biden was asked a range of questions by journalists at his G20 news conference, and became visibly moved while answering one about his debates and splits within Catholicism and his personal relationship with Pope Francis. ""Pope Francis has become - I don't want to exaggerate - someone who has provided great solace for my family when my son died,"" he told the media. The president said he lost ""the real part of his soul""when his son Beau died in 2015, and recounted a story of how, days after Beau's death, Biden met the Pope during a visit to the US while working under then-President Barack Obama. ""Before he left and got on the plane, the Pope asked whether or not he could meet with my family and we met in a hanger in Philadelphia airport,"" Biden said - adding the meeting had a ""cathartic impact""  for his family. ""He's just a fine, decent, honourable man and we keep in touch,"" he added, before leaving the stage. President Biden gifted Pope Francis a special coin during a meeting in Rome on Friday Glasgow has been honoured in a unique way for hosting COP26 - withan Antarctic glacier being named after the city. The 100km-long ice stream is in a region of the White Continent known to beexperiencing rapid melting. Eight other nearby glaciers will also carry the names of cities where important climate reports were issued, or policies were agreed. They include Geneva, which held the very first climate conference in 1979. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the G20, a newly announced US-EU trade agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs had
all the makings of an economic event. But - ahead of COP26 - US President Joe Biden and EU
Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen made it an environmental one. Biden announced the US
was dropping Trump-era tariffs on European steel and aluminum â with the EU
also promising to end its retaliatory tariffs. While Biden touted the economic
benefits of the move, he emphasised the agreementâs hoped-for
environmental impact, stressing the deal would incentivise emission reductions in steel production and restrict access to the US and EU markets for âdirty steelâ from places such as China. Noting that steel production is one of the most carbon-intensive sectors
of the global economy, he said the US and EU had agreed to a âcarbon-based
arrangementâ. Von der Leyen, for her part, said the agreement was the start of âa new
global, sustainable steel arrangementâ. The president has finished taking media questions now, and left the stage. He was also asked about hisBuild Back Betterframework's climate policies. He's asked if his incentives toward renewable energy go far enough, and also about potentially introducing punitive measures to hold companies accountable. ""Everyone knows which direction it's going,"" he says in defence of his carrot-and-stick approach with US industry. Biden opens up the floor to questions from the media. The president is asked if the world can be confident that the US will make good on its climate promises without him having the votes in Congress on bills to authorise funding. He says he remains confident his plans will pass. He then addresses disappointment by some about what was agreed at the G20 ahead of COP26. Mr Biden says China and Russia ""basically didn't show up"" on matters of the climate and says he ""found it disappointing"". This video can not be played President Biden says Russia and China 'not showing up' on climate It seems the delay had something to do with an elevator - the president apologises and says it's a long story... but begins addressing the media in Rome. He describes a ""series of very productive meetings"" at the G20 news conference and says he is ""looking forward to continuing to make progress"" on climate issues in Glasgow. He speaks aboutthe new global minimum taxagreement on big businesses - describing it as an ""incredible win"" for all countries. The president also addresses issues of supply chain issues at home in the US and speaks about the hard-fought infrastructure deal his administration is trying to get passed in Congress. And President Biden has just begun his news conference in Rome. It seems like his post-G20 press conference will be a little later than expected. It's now after 20:15 local time in Rome. Hundreds of people hoping to get to Glasgow are delayed after storms disrupted train services from London's Euston Station Travellers heading to Scotland for the COP26 climate summit have been left stranded by major rail disruption caused by ""intense storms"". Hundreds of people were left waiting at London's Euston station after fallen trees caused all trains to be suspended. Network Rail said trains had been able to resume using a diversion, only for that route to then also become blocked. Read morehere. While we wait for President Biden's news conference, let's take a look at some of the reaction from the G20 agreements. As we've been hearing from Italy's PM, the leaders of the world's richest economies - the G20 - have pledged to pursue efforts to limit global warming with ""meaningful and effective actions"". But exactly how this will be achieved was not revealed in their statement leaving activists ""disappointed"". Their closing statement, called a communiquÃ©, makes no reference to achieving net zero by 2050, which many countries have already pledged to do and scientists say is critical to avoiding a climate catastrophe. Italy's PM said they are committed to net zero by ""mid-century"", but China - the world's worst polluter - and Russia have pushed their deadline out to 2060. The communiquÃ© does pledge, however, to stop financing new, unabated coal plants internationally by the end of this year - a strong message to coal-reliant nations such as China, Russia and India. But the G20 leaders stopped short of agreeing to end coal power in their own nations. Oscar Soria, of the activist network Avaaz, told the Reuters news agency there was ""little sense of urgency"" coming from the group, adding: ""There is no more time for vague wish-lists, we need concrete commitments and action."" Read more:G20 pledge climate action but make few commitments We are expecting to hear from US President Joe Biden shortly. Biden will speak from Rome, where a summit of G20 leaders just concluded. Cynthia Tjipuka is looking forward to showcasing her adopted city As world leaders start to arrive in Glasgow, a 1,000-strong team of volunteers have taken to the streets of the Scottish city to play their part in COP26. The volunteers will be on hand with local information to help the expected 25,000 visitors get around the city. They will be based at key transport hubs and travel routes including Buchanan Street bus station and along Lancefield Quay on the Clyde. For many, the event - which runs until 12 November - is about promoting Glasgow on a global stage. Cynthia Tjipuka, who moved to Scotland from Namibia 10 months ago, is thrilled at the prospect of being able to help showcase her adopted home city. She said: ""I'm seriously honoured and humbled to be part of such a huge event. This is a life-changing event for our future generations and for the planet."" Watch here Global poverty charity Oxfam says the G20 group of the world's richest countries have offered ""vague promises and platitudes"" instead of providing ""the lightning bolt that the COP26 climate talks so desperately need"". Oxfamâs senior adviser, JÃ¶rn Kalinski, says confirming the 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement was a ""minimum requirement"" and without a promise to revise national climate plans ""it is meaningless"". However, Kalinski says the promise to stop financing new coal power plants overseas by the end of this year was ""one of the few positives"" of the G20's statement. The half-hearted words on financing adaptation in vulnerable countries were again not backed up by timeframes or targets. Without these, poorer nations will continue to lack the resources they need to protect lives, homes and businesses from weather disasters. JÃ¶rn Kalinski, Oxfam, senior adviser Reality Check PM Boris Johnson has just spoken about the carbon-cutting progress the UK has made saying it is ""proof"" that more can be done. And earlier, Alok
Sharma, president of COP26, compared the UKâs climate record
with other leading economies, telling the BBC: âWe as a country have decarbonised our economy more than any other
G20 nationâ. But is that true? Since 1990, the UK has had about a 44% reduction in its yearly
carbon emissions, according to the latest government data. That is a bigger drop than any other major economy over recent years. Germanyâs annual
emissions, for example, are down about 30% over the same time period. Most
of the UKâs reduction has been achieved by decarbonising the energy sector -
closing coal-fired power stations and spending money on solar, wind and nuclear
energy. But the UK has struggled to achieve such sustained reductions in
its buildings and transport sector, with just a 1.6% and 0.2% cut in emissions
since 2011 respectively. Campaigners, including Greta Thunberg, also question the 44%
figure, saying it doesnât cover all emissions â for example, those associated
with making goods in other countries, which the UK then imports. The way the UK
calculates its figures, however, is consistent with other countries and the UN. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are
mostly responsible for our climate problem, but methane makes a significant
contribution. Molecule for molecule, its warming effect is greater than CO2,
but itâs also short-lived in the atmosphere, meaning that if we can get on top
of its human-produced sources (like fossil fuels, agriculture and waste landfills) we could have some quick wins in the battle against global
heating. Governments attending COP26 are being asked to sign up forthe Global Methane Pledge,externalwhich commits to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at
least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Today also sees the formal launch
ofthe UN Environment Programmeâs International Methane Emissions Observatory,external(IMEO).  A lot of their data will come from self-reporting by governments and
companies, but the observatory will also be making good use of remote-sensing
tools. Take a look at this picture just released from the GHGSat company. GHGSat flies a constellation of small satellites that can
now spy sources of methane at high resolution - selling its data to companies to help them
understand their emissions and develop strategies to deal with them. This image depicts an open-cast coal mine in Kazakhstan. The gas is

"The River Conwy bursts its banks in Llanrwst last October The UK is hosting a summit at the end of October which is regarded as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. The COP26 meeting in Glasgow could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Here we outline in charts some of the key facts about the state of Wales and its climate change challenges. It's not something to be sniffed at but the 8.9 million sheep and 414,000 cows in Wales add a peculiar facet to the climate change landscape in Wales. Agriculture contributes nearly 14% of greenhouse gas emissions in Wales, with gases generated from the rear ends of livestock providing a good chunk of that. Energy supply, particularly from power generation, is the biggest single source though. Cars alone are behind nearly 60% of transport's share, but there is hope the move to hybrid and electric vehicles may have an impact. The iron and steel industry in Wales is the source of 60% of the business sector's emission levels in Wales. Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions It's been a bumpy road. As we can see from the chart below, there have been years recently when emissions have gone up, as well as down. It's mainly because we've got lots of heavy industry and some massive power plants. Just shutting Wales' last coal-fired power station helped towards half of the fall in emissions after 2016. Although overall we've seen a 31% cut in emissions over the last 30 years, by 2030 we need to have reached a 63% reduction - and in the 20 years after that, we have to have net zero carbon emissions. A big challenge. About 60% of us in Wales live in coastal areas, with some communities living below the high tideline. Just under 12,000 properties are at high risk from coastal or river flooding. There are just under 10,000 at high or medium risk of tidal flooding alone. This could increase by 260% by the 2080s - while 2,126 properties are likely to be at risk of coastal erosion where defences are not maintained. We've also got nationally important infrastructure - roads, railways, and big power plants - next to the sea. This map shows parts of north Wales that are at risk of flooding Flooding risk from climate change has been built intonew planning policy for developments in Wales, with details released in September These included new flood risk maps, like the one shown above for the north Wales coast. By 2050 it's thought it could get 6% more rainy in winter in Wales, with as much as 13% more rain by the 2080s. Also, when it does pour down it could be more intense, making flooding issues worse. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glashow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Traffic fumes from petrol and diesel cars are part of the problem when it comes to warming the atmosphere. But they also contain harmful pollutants that we breathe in - like nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The chart below shows NO2 as it is measured at 187 industrial and commercial sites around Wales. Refineries, iron and steel-making and cement works dominate the top 10 emission locations across the nation. Heavy industry supports substantial numbers of jobs, so the challenge is how to make processes cleaner - and move towards a greener economy. Demolition to start on Wales' most polluted street New 50mph limits will start being enforced One thing we all noticed during the Covid pandemic - the roads were a lot quieter. In fact, traffic on the roads in Wales dropped by nearly a quarter last year due to Covid and to levels we've not seen since 1998. So really we need to look at what ""normal"" looks like. Between 1993 and 2019, traffic volumes rose by 45%. A third of it was moving within Cardiff, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Carmarthenshire and Newport. We can also see in recent years that more of us were travelling by train too. Moving towards more public transport - and active travel - are priorities for policy makers. Latest surveys show 4% cycle to work or to a destination at least once a week, while 60% of us walked for an hour a week at least, for the same purpose. Cycling was the one mode of transport which actually showed a rise during lockdown, as many people worked from home or travelled locally. Climate change is already having an increasing impact on Wales' natural world, according to conservation groups. The annualState of Nature report,,externalpublished jointly by leading wildlife and nature charities, gives a snapshot of the threats in Wales.  666out of  3,902 species in Wales (17%) at threat of extinction 73species lost already 523of 6,500 species found in Wales (8%) at threat of extinction from Britain 35%fall in kittiwake population 15days earlier for arrival of swallows 11days earlier when great tits lay their eggs, compared to 1968 The kittiwake population of Wales has declined by 35% since 1986. Across the UK, climate change has reduced the availability of sand eels, a key food source. As well as seeing birds migrating here that we would not usually expect to see, swallows are arriving 15 days earlier and breeding 11 days earlier than they did in the 1960s Areas threatened include salt marsh habitats. We know 17% of species in 2019 were under threat of extinction. Hundreds of species in Wales under threat What is climate change doing to Wales? Woodland in ancient times used to cover much of Wales. Today, it makes up only about 15% of the land mass, but there isan ambition to create a National Forest for Wales. As well as protecting existing trees, the programme would see more woodland planted. New trees would eventually help climate change by taking carbon from the air as they grow, while also creating more habitat and helping to reduce flooding. But there has been a fall-back in new planting of woodland in recent years, so there is some ground to make up. In 2017, the Welsh government announced a target of meeting the equivalent of 70% of Wales' electricity demand from renewable electricity sources by 2030. In 2019, it is estimated that this figure stands at 51%. When we look at estimated electricity generated in Wales, more than two thirds comes from gas. Renewables account for 27% - with more than 18% of that from wind energy. The last coal-fired power station closed more than 18 months ago and there is currently no nuclear power option. It's not all doom and gloom.Wales is one of the world's best nations for recycling, according to one analysis. The research from the Eunomia environmental consultancy, at the end of 2017, looked at comparable data from each country to work out the kilograms per head recycled. Latest Welsh government figures show 64.8% of waste was recycled or composted in 2020 - a slight increase on 2019, despite the pandemic. Each of us still produces an average 173kg of household waste that's not recycled - but that has come down by 20% in seven years.

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"Climate change is linked to more extreme weather like flooding which killed 200 people in Germany this summer Will COP26 be a climate ""turning point"" as Boris Johnson wants, or more ""blah blah blah"" of the kind Greta Thunberg condemns? At face value, things do not look promising, for a simple reason: the previous 25 of these giant conferences failed to turn off the tap of the greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. Despite three decades of talking, the planet is now at least 1.1C hotter than the pre-industrial level - and rising. Even if everyone sticks to their current promises to reduce emissions, we'll still be on course for a dangerous increase of 2.7C by the end of the century. For this conference, however, expectations for real progress are higher than usual. That's partly because the risks are hitting home. This year floods killed 200 people in Germany, heatwaves struck chilly Canada and even the Siberian Arctic was burning. And scientists now have the evidence to say it's unequivocal that human activity is behind climate change and that's making violent extremes more likely. They're also clearer than ever that avoiding the most damaging temperatures means halving global carbon emissions by 2030 - a deadline looming close enough to focus minds. Arnold Schwarzenegger angered by world leaders' climate policies Greta Thunberg: 'We need public pressure, not just summits' Four numbers that set the stage for COP26 Oil chiefs grilled on climate disinformation And we are seeing something unimaginable even a few years ago: an unprecedented flurry of countries and businesses, some more plausibly than others, pledging to go net zero by mid-century. That means any greenhouse gases they're still releasing by then should be balanced by an equivalent amount absorbed from the atmosphere, through tree-planting for example. So will Glasgow be the venue where the world shifts towards a zero-carbon future? In truth, it's never likely that a single meeting could ever achieve that. COPs were set up specifically for governments to tackle climate change, and the annual round of conferences does remain the only forum to tackle the problem collectively. But they operate by consensus between nearly 200 countries that all have very different perspectives. This video can not be played Watch how three Kuwaitis cope in their country's ""unbearable"" heat ""Try herding 200 cats,"" one official once told me. Many of the nations that are rich in oil or coal have been downright hostile to the whole climate agenda, and have tried everything to slow it down. Others that are poor and vulnerable see rising temperatures threatening their very existence and are desperate for help. At the first COP I reported from, in the deep freeze of a Montreal winter in 2005, the pace of talks matched the glacial weather. Negotiators were arguing overnight over 'square brackets' that marked unresolved and impenetrable points in a text that was never destined to leave much of a trace. When they finally reached agreement at dawn - and I spotted the then UK environment secretary Margaret Beckett with tears in her eyes - I asked a veteran observer what was being celebrated. ""They've agreed to keep talking,"" he said, without irony. ""So the process continues."" And the conferences have rolled on, more or less productively, and at the nine I've witnessed so far, there have been some painful scenes. In Nairobi in 2006, I heard a frustrated German minister ask why anyone bothered to turn up. In Bali in 2007, the top UN official, exhausted and exasperated, started weeping openly. A really simple guide to climate change How do we know humans caused climate change? How hot could it get where you live? And in Copenhagen in 2009, clumsy hosting triggered walkouts that nearly led the talks to collapse. Yet one former UK government adviser, who was at the heart of those negotiations in Denmark, believes that COPs, for all their faults, are an essential mechanism. Without them, according to Prof Mike Jacobs - now of the University of Sheffield - ""emissions would have risen even higher than they are now"". He says having ""a simultaneous and collective commitment"" forces governments to stay focused on the problem. And that led to the COP that stands out as a rare example of success - Paris in 2015. The French government, supported by a carefully cultivated alliance, ushered in the Paris Agreement, the first accord of its kind to tackle climate change. This was a landmark moment because never before had every country agreed to act together to limit the rise in temperatures to 2C or, if possible, a lower target of 1.5C. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could affect our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Yes, the most difficult small print was left unresolved and the accord is entirely voluntary - no country is obliged to cut its emissions faster than it wants to. But Prof Jacobs reckons that setting up a global framework generated a sense of momentum, which in itself has proved significant. That's because more and more of the world's governments are now setting their own targets for renewable energy or phasing out petrol and diesel cars, and that sends a message to businesses that the agenda is serious. So investments in wind and solar power have recently been so vast that their costs have tumbled, which in turn makes a zero-carbon transition more feasible. And provided the Glasgow talks don't collapse in acrimony, that signal of a greener direction should get even more attention. It could be a 'tipping-point' where big investors start to shift their trillions of dollars out of fossil fuels - a few days ago Europe's largest pension fund announced it would do just that. Already the giant carmakers are having to gear up to go electric, and shipping companies - long accused of dragging their feet - are under pressure to clean up too. Plans to decarbonise even the most polluting industries - with so-called 'green cement' and 'green steel' - are becoming more mainstream. But the speed of this response is the key question for COP26. As things stand, given all the pledges made so far, greenhouse gas emissions are actually set to rise by 16% by 2030, rather than fall by 45% as the science demands. And if the picture remains unchanged after a fortnight of talking, the accusations of failure will come thick and fast. A second challenge is finance for the poorest countries, hit hardest by rising sea levels, floods and droughts, and needing help to go green. They've long felt let down, seeing promises unfulfilled, including a key pledge that was seen as a fundamental issue of trust, for assistance worth $100bn a year to be delivered by now. Prof Saleemul Huq, an adviser to the prime minister of Bangladesh, is among those cynical about the whole process. ""This annual shindig is redundant - it's not as if climate change is an issue just once a year. ""It's happening now for everyone, every day, not some time in the future - it needs attention all the time."" So what is Prof Huq expecting? ""I presume they'll manage to pull a rabbit out of the hat in the end but you journalists must check the details of what's announced - is it really what they say it is?"" Ultimately, the conferences provide a focus for climate action but they can never lead to a transformation overnight. The observer in Montreal was right: it's about a process. And in a sign of managed expectations for Glasgow, there's talk of the next gatherings: COP27 in Egypt, and COP28, maybe in Qatar. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.
