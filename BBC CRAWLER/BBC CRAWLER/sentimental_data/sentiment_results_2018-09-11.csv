"This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Hurricane Florence - the most powerful storm to threaten the Carolinas in nearly three decades - is expected to strengthen, say forecasters. Officials warn there is a chance of ""life-threatening inundation from rising water"" over the next 48 hours as Florence heads for the US East Coast. With sustained winds of about 140mph (225km/h), the weather system is currently a category four storm. It could make landfall on Friday, near Wilmington, North Carolina. Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC, and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. New El NiÃ±o event likely this winter Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms ""This storm is a monster,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference on Tuesday. ""It's big and it's vicious. ""It is an extremely dangerous, life-threatening, historic hurricane."" Hurricane Florence was 670 miles (1,078km) south-east of Cape Fear, in North Carolina, as of 23:00 Atlantic Standard Time on Tuesday (03:00 GMT Wednesday),according to the latest National Hurricane Center update,external. The update says Florence - which is moving north-west at about 17mph (28km/h) - is expected to strengthen on Tuesday night and on Wednesday. ""While some weakening is expected on Thursday, Florence is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through landfall,"" it says. Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday. The National Weather Service predicts potential storm surges of up to 13ft (4m) on the coasts along with dangerously large swells and rip currents. Hurricane-force winds will extend outward up to 60 miles from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds up to 175 miles. Evacuees seek shelter at a school Wilmington, North Carolina Rainfall could be up to 25in (64cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. He said Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (Â£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. It is also likely to affect the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in Southport, North Carolina, which is just a few miles from where Florence is expected to make landfall. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster initially ordered the entire coastline of his state to leave. However, the order was later confined to the northern coast.

US President Donald Trump has signed declarations of emergency for both North Carolina and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and resources for the storm response. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the government would spare ""no expense"" in responding to Hurricane Florence, adding the storm was ""tremendously big and tremendously wet"". Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path Mr Trump also spoke of the US response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as ""one of the best jobs that has ever been done"", describing it as an ""incredible, unsung success"". The description is in stark contrast to the assessment of Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, who describedMr Trump's response to the disaster as a ""stain on his presidency""after officials revised the death toll last month. The toll now stands at an estimated 2,975 people- nearly 50 times the earlier figure of 64. That number includes those who were killed directly by Hurricane Maria, as well as those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. The US government has a National Flood Insurance Programme (NFIP) that helps pay for flood coverage in high-risk zones across the country. The programme, which is billions of dollars in debt, has been up for renewal several times - Congress' next deadline to re-authorise the NFIP is 30 November. While some wind damage may be covered by regular homeowners' insurance, flooding is a different story. This video can not be played Hurricane Florence seen from space In the US, flood protection policies from private providers are often very expensive, largely because it is difficult to assess a home's flood risk. These policies also take 30 days to kick in, meaning any homeowners without coverage in the Carolinas now will not be able to insure their property before Florence hits. According to the Insurance Information Institute,14% of Americans living in the southern states had flood insurance as of 2016,external.

"Bowie pictured on London's Kingly Street, off Carnaby Street in 1963 The first known studio recording of David Bowie has sold for nearly Â£40,000 - four times the estimate. The 1963 demo tape, rejected by Decca, features a 16-year-old Bowie - then known as David Jones - singing I Never Dreamed with first band The Konrads. The 18-minute recording was sold by the band's drummer David Hadfield, who had discovered it in an old bread basket in his loft. Omega Auctions said it sold for a total of Â£39,360 after a ""bidding frenzy"". They had estimated it would reach Â£10,000. David Bowie: A life in pictures How Bowie's career shaped modern pop This video can not be played A clip of a 1963 recording, thought to be the first, of a teenage David Bowie singing Director of Omega Auctions Karen Fairweather said the recording was the last lot of the day, and it had already reached Â£11,000 in pre-bidding before the auction began. The bidding was fierce between two overseas collectors, who did not attend in person, before the winning bid was made. ""There was certainly applause when the hammer went down,"" she said. ""It's a fantastic piece of history."" Auctioneer Paul Fairweather described the tape - thought to be the only copy that exists - as a ""significant recording, completely unique"". He said it offers new insight into Bowie as a ""fledgling musician who would go on to super-stardom."" Promotional sketches by Bowie from when he was in The Konrads, along with photographs and band documents, sold for Â£17,130 and an early 1963 poster of the band went for Â£6,600. All prices include buyers' premium. This picture, showing Bowie performing on saxophone at a youth club at Biggin Hill in May 1963, is believed to be one of the first images of him on stage Bowie was The Konrads' saxophonist but it was decided that he should sing lead vocals for the tape. Hadfield said: ""David had no inclination to become a singer at this point, his heart and mind were focused on becoming a world-class saxophone player. ""Our agent, Eric Easton, who also managed the Rolling Stones, asked us to do a demo so he could try and get us an audition at Decca. ""We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song. ""Decca initially turned us down, but when they eventually gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies."" Bowie left the band shortly after the audition, which did not result in the band being signed. Bowie performing at a concert in Paris in 2002 He went on to become a solo artist six years later, having changed his surname to Bowie so he didn't get confused with The Monkees' Davy Jones, and gained worldwide success. He died of cancer in January 2016, two days after his 69th birthday - and the release of his 25th studio album.

"Labrador Lottie's life was saved by the operation A couple spent Â£12,000 on a pioneering double-bypass heart operation for their pet labrador in a procedure never previously carried out on a dog. Paul and Pauline Daley, from Cheshire, sacrificed money saved for their 20th wedding anniversary to save the life of 11-month-old Lottie. The dog's rare heart defects had been described as a ""ticking time-bomb"". Lottie is on course to make a full recovery after the operation led by Royal Veterinary College surgeons. The college said the operation, on 30 July, was the first time it had carried out such a procedure on a dog. Although other pets have had bypass surgery, the college said this particular operation involved two distinct sections of the heart and was a world first. Surgeons even consulted paediatricians from Royal Brompton Hospital in London for advice on how similar operations were carried out on babies. Pauline Daley said she was ""delighted"" with the procedure's success Mrs Daley, 59, from Malpas, said: ""We're delighted. We won't be going on holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but you can go on holiday any time. ""We were told Lottie could have died at any point."" The dog's heart abnormalities were revealed during routine tests before it was spayed. A faulty heart valve meant a mix of oxygenated and non-oxygenated blood was circulating around the body, while there were further problems with the upper chamber of the heart. Lottie, pictured with Paul Daley, had to undergo a four-hour operation Mrs Daley said: ""We were devastated when we were told her condition was like a ticking time-bomb."" The four-hour operation was carried out by a team of 10 from the college. Prof Dan Brockman, who led the operation, said it was ""complex"" but they were ""desperate to try and help"". He added: ""With careful pre-operative planning and using our previous experience, we were able to design and execute the surgical treatment."" He said it was ""still early days"" but the initial signs were positive and she is due for a check-up next week.

"Serena Williams, pictured after losing to Naomi Osaka during the US Open, was the subject of a newspaper cartoon widely criticised as racist and sexist An Australian newspaper which found itself at the centre of a race row over its cartoonist's depiction of Serena Williams has come out strongly in support of the artist. The Herald Sun has hit out at those who criticised Mark Knight's drawing, which shows Williams jumping over a broken racquet next to a baby's dummy. Critics said the cartoon used racist and sexist stereotypes. But that did not stop the newspaper reprinting the image on its front page. Billie Jean King: 'Williams out of line but umpire blew it' Underneath the headline ""Welcome to PC world"", the newspaper wrote: ""If the self-appointed censors of Mark Knight get their way on his Serena Williams cartoon, our new politically correct life will be very dull indeed"".

"Kirstie Allsopp is best known for presenting Location, Location, Location on Channel 4 Kirstie Allsopp has left Twitter after facing a fierce backlash when she admitted she smashed her children's iPads over her gaming rules. Parents slammed the TV presenter online after sherevealed she broke her sons' deviceswhen they played games outside their permitted time. Criticism soon flooded onto social media, with many people calling her ""privileged"" and ""absurd"". Her Twitter account has since been deleted. It was not long before outraged parents took to social media to vent their fury at the Location, Location, Location presenter, who has two sons and two stepsons. Thousands of people have been commenting on it - the majority condemning her actions and the message it sends to children. But she has also received backing from fellow parents weary of tantrums come time to turn off machines. Some took quite a strong stance and suggested she was condoning violence and criminal damage.

"Over 1,500 migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean so far this year More than 100 migrants died in a shipwreck off the Libyan coastline earlier this month, an aid agency says. Two rubber boats set off on 1 September but one of the vessels deflated and sank, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says. The 276 survivors were eventually taken to the Libyan port city of Khoms, around 100 km (62 miles) to the south-east of the capital Tripoli. MSF says the group is now being held in ""arbitrary detention"". The survivors, including pregnant women, children and infants, have been treated by MSF for pneumonia or burns from leaked fuel. It appears to be the largest migrant death toll in the Mediterranean in several months. In early June, 112 people reportedly drowned after a boat sank off the Tunisian coast. Later the same month, theUNHCR said that 220 people had died in three separate incidents,externalover the course of two days. Why is Libya so lawless? How Libya holds the key to solving Europe's migration crisis 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre Over 1,500 migrants have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Many more have been rescued, although Italy, a primary destination for migrants travelling from Libya, has recently started to refuse entry to migrant ships. The numbers of those crossing the Mediterranean has fallen from the peak of over one million in 2015, but the journey is becoming deadlier: while fewer deaths have been reported, more people are dying as a proportion of those who reach Europe. Although these numbers do not include the increasing numbers who are now being returned to Libya, the rise can be explained by the shift from the shorter sea route between Turkey and Greece in 2014-15 to the much longer and more dangerous route between Italy and Libya. Meanwhile, concerns remain for migrants who remain in Libya, with reports emerging late last year of sub-Saharan African migrants being kidnapped for ransom or sold as slaves in the northern African country. Libya remains unstable since the overthrow of long-term leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Hundreds of migrants held in detention had to be moved afterdeadly clashes broke out in the Tripoli in late August, whilegunmen also attacked the National Oil Corporationon 10 September.

"Tony Hall said Evans had been under ""pressure"" after his salary was revealed BBC director general Tony Hall has said the publication of star salaries was a factor in radio presenters Chris Evans and Eddie Mair choosing to leave. Lord Hall told a committee of MPs the pay disclosures had ""made it harder for us to retain people like that"". Evans is moving from Radio 2 to Virgin, while Mair has joined LBC from Radio 4. ""We have to recognise we're not going to attract people at the kind of mega sums others in the commercial sphere might be able to pay,"" Lord Hall said. The director general said Evans found the pressure ""quite hard"" aftertopping the BBC talent pay list last yearandcoming second in this year's list. Eddie Mair earned more than Â£330,000 at Radio 4 in 2017/18 ""For three or four days he was the centre of a lot of attention,"" he said. Lord Hall told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee: ""[It has a] bearing on when you think about where you want to work in the future. I think he's a remarkable presenter. He's a loss to the BBC, a loss to our audiences."" Who will take over from Chris Evans? Amol Rajan: I was wrong on BBC 'poachers' charter' Who earned what at the BBC in 2017-18? However, Lord Hall also said: ""I have no complaint, disclosure is a good thing."" He added that Evans, who was paid Â£1.66m in 2017-18, also wanted to leave so he could find a new challenge. MPs asked the BBC director general about the recent Sir Cliff Richard court case Last year was the first time the pay of stars earning more than Â£150,000 had been made public. The BBC was compelled to reveal the information under the terms of its new royal charter. Lord Hall said the corporation would ""find the next generation of talent"" and promote from within rather than compete with the ""mega"" salaries on offer from commercial rivals. ""A lot of [current BBC] presenters I know could make possibly more money outside but actually are not doing it for that - they're doing it because they're committed to the BBC and I admire them hugely for that,"" he said. ""But of course we will lose some people and of course we have lost a couple of people for a large number of reasons, but no doubt disclosure and the fact people know their pay has been a factor in some of those losses."" Claudia Winkleman (left) is still the best-paid woman on the BBC pay list Lord Hall was asked about equal pay at the corporation, given thatthe top 12 earners on the BBC's latest list of star salaries are all men. ""Myself and the team want to get to the point where the top 20 are made up equally of men and women and not just women at the bottom and men at the top,"" he said. The director general also revealed he had approached Sir Cliff Richard personally ahead of the recent court case involving the BBC. In July,Sir Cliff won his privacy case against the corporationover its coverage of a 2014 police raid on his home. The singer said the BBC's reporting of the raid, which included helicopter footage of his home being searched, was a ""serious invasion"" of privacy. He was never arrested or charged. Lord Hall said: ""We approached Sir Cliff's lawyers and... I approached Sir Cliff on a couple of occasions suggesting could we sit down and try to sort this out without going to the court. ""But sadly, and, I guess understandably, the legal view came back that, 'We don't want to talk.'"" Lord Hall added that Sir Cliff's team said they were only prepared to reach a settlement if the BBC admitted it had acted illegally, but he said he didn't think the corporation had acted illegally. He said: ""We are really sorry about what Sir Cliff has been through. ""We reported accurately what happened but we overdid it, the helicopter overdid it, it was something to report but [further] down the bulletin."" Lord Hall also said the BBC would be publishing a new edition of its editorial guidelines later this autumn, following the Sir Cliff episode. The committee also discussed the BBC licence fee concession for over-75s. The government used to meet this cost in its entirety but itwas agreed in 2015that the BBC would take on the full cost of the concession over a phased period. The BBC is due to absorb the full cost from 2020/21 - but Lord Hall said the corporation will review whether it continues to offer the arrangement after that time. Lord Hall said it was ""a difficult balance between what people can afford and our need to give proper services"". He added: ""[It's]quite a weighty decision. A very difficult issue."" The total financial liability for licences for over-75s for 2017/18 was Â£655m. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

The same night Devlin and two accomplices broke into another house and threatened a woman and her two children, stealing a quantity of jewellery.

"Labrador Lottie's life was saved by the operation A couple spent Â£12,000 on a pioneering double-bypass heart operation for their pet labrador in a procedure never previously carried out on a dog. Paul and Pauline Daley, from Cheshire, sacrificed money saved for their 20th wedding anniversary to save the life of 11-month-old Lottie. The dog's rare heart defects had been described as a ""ticking time-bomb"". Lottie is on course to make a full recovery after the operation led by Royal Veterinary College surgeons. The college said the operation, on 30 July, was the first time it had carried out such a procedure on a dog. Although other pets have had bypass surgery, the college said this particular operation involved two distinct sections of the heart and was a world first. Surgeons even consulted paediatricians from Royal Brompton Hospital in London for advice on how similar operations were carried out on babies. Pauline Daley said she was ""delighted"" with the procedure's success Mrs Daley, 59, from Malpas, said: ""We're delighted. We won't be going on holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but you can go on holiday any time. ""We were told Lottie could have died at any point."" The dog's heart abnormalities were revealed during routine tests before it was spayed. A faulty heart valve meant a mix of oxygenated and non-oxygenated blood was circulating around the body, while there were further problems with the upper chamber of the heart. Lottie, pictured with Paul Daley, had to undergo a four-hour operation Mrs Daley said: ""We were devastated when we were told her condition was like a ticking time-bomb."" The four-hour operation was carried out by a team of 10 from the college. Prof Dan Brockman, who led the operation, said it was ""complex"" but they were ""desperate to try and help"". He added: ""With careful pre-operative planning and using our previous experience, we were able to design and execute the surgical treatment."" He said it was ""still early days"" but the initial signs were positive and she is due for a check-up next week. Mrs Daley and her husband Paul, 64, also keep chickens as well as two retired race horses. She said: ""Lottie is adorable. We have been told she has made a good progress and should make a good recovery.""

"Over 1,500 migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean so far this year More than 100 migrants died in a shipwreck off the Libyan coastline earlier this month, an aid agency says. Two rubber boats set off on 1 September but one of the vessels deflated and sank, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says. The 276 survivors were eventually taken to the Libyan port city of Khoms, around 100 km (62 miles) to the south-east of the capital Tripoli. MSF says the group is now being held in ""arbitrary detention"". The survivors, including pregnant women, children and infants, have been treated by MSF for pneumonia or burns from leaked fuel. It appears to be the largest migrant death toll in the Mediterranean in several months. In early June, 112 people reportedly drowned after a boat sank off the Tunisian coast. Later the same month, theUNHCR said that 220 people had died in three separate incidents,externalover the course of two days. Why is Libya so lawless? How Libya holds the key to solving Europe's migration crisis 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre Over 1,500 migrants have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Many more have been rescued, although Italy, a primary destination for migrants travelling from Libya, has recently started to refuse entry to migrant ships. The numbers of those crossing the Mediterranean has fallen from the peak of over one million in 2015, but the journey is becoming deadlier: while fewer deaths have been reported, more people are dying as a proportion of those who reach Europe. Although these numbers do not include the increasing numbers who are now being returned to Libya, the rise can be explained by the shift from the shorter sea route between Turkey and Greece in 2014-15 to the much longer and more dangerous route between Italy and Libya. Meanwhile, concerns remain for migrants who remain in Libya, with reports emerging late last year of sub-Saharan African migrants being kidnapped for ransom or sold as slaves in the northern African country. Libya remains unstable since the overthrow of long-term leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Hundreds of migrants held in detention had to be moved afterdeadly clashes broke out in the Tripoli in late August, whilegunmen also attacked the National Oil Corporationon 10 September.

"A final decision has not yet been made on US President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Republic of Ireland in November, the White House has said. Earlier, an Irish government spokesperson said the trip had been ""postponed for scheduling reasons"". However since then the White House said the president will travel to Paris in November as previously announced. ""We are still finalising whether Ireland will be a stop on that trip,"" spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. The White House had announced the visit earlier in September. The US president was expected to visit his golf course in Doonbeg, County Clare, and Dublin on the weekend of 10-11 November. Mr Trump is due to travel to Paris on 11 November for commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One. A visit to Ireland was raised by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during his trip to the US in March The office for Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar confirmed the November visit was cancelled and said the ""US side has cited scheduling reasons"". Politicians and activists in Ireland had indicated they would hold protests during Mr Trump's visit. Brendan Howlin, the leader of the Labour Party in the Republic of Ireland, said that Mr Trump was ""no friend of democracy or human rights"". The Green Party had called on the Irish government to cancel the visit. Donald Trump owns Trump Doonbeg, a golf resort in County Clare The US president owns a golf resort in County Clare, Trump Doonbeg,which he bought in February 2014. He last visited Doonbeg in May 2014 and was due to visit again a few months before the US presidential election, in the summer of 2016, but later shelved the plan. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar invited Mr Trump to Ireland during a meeting at the St Patrick's Day celebrationsin Washington in March. In 2017, Mr Varadkar's predecessor, Enda Kenny, also extended an offer for the US president to come and visit.

"Wages saw faster than expected growth in the three months to July, as they continued to outstrip rising prices. Excluding bonuses, wages grew by 2.9%,according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),,externalwell above the inflation rate. Earnings have now outstripped inflation for four months. Unemployment continued to fall, dropping by 55,000 to 1.36 million, with the jobless rate remaining at 4%, its lowest level for over 40 years. The number of people in work was unchanged at 32.4 million. The ONS said the labour market was ""robust"" with the number of people in work ""still at historically high levels"". ""With the number of people in work little changed, employment growth has weakened,"" said the ONS's head of labour market statistics, David Freeman. ""Meanwhile, earnings have grown faster than prices for several months, especially looking at pay excluding bonuses."" The inflation rate for the three-month period to July was 2.4%, with the rate for just July slightly higher at 2.5%. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Markets, said the figures indicated that ""competition for workers is finally starting to provide greater support to wages"". However, he does not expect the rosier picture for wages to prompt an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. ""We still think that the MPC will hold off raising interest rates again until the near-term uncertainty due to the Brexit negotiations is resolved,"" he added. The Bank of England raised its key interest ratefor only the second time in a decade last month.The current interest rate of 0.75% is the highest since March 2009. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown said the latest employment figures showed that the Bank of England was right to raise rates last month. ""The Bank looks at wage growth as a key driver of inflation. ""The problem is that if wages grow without corresponding productivity growth - as we've seen in the UK - it means more money chasing the same quantity of goods and services, which pushes up prices,"" he warned. Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Yesterday economic growth hit 0.6%, the best number since July last year. Today, incomes are up 2.9%, a figure that has not been bettered since July 2015. With inflation for the month of July at 2.5%, real wage growth (which accounts for price rises) rose to 0.5% between May and July. High levels of employment could finally be passing through to our incomes as firms compete for our work. It will take a long time to repair the damage to incomes over the decade since the financial crisis. But with economic growth stronger and the possibility of some form of Brexit deal rising, this is certainly better news for the economy overall. Higher wages can feed through to higher levels of consumer spending. And consumer spending drives around two-thirds of what happens in the economy. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, said: ""Since 2010 we have delivered significant growth in jobs, and in the last six months we've seen real-terms wage growth. ""We haven't had a lower unemployment rate for over 40 years and I'm especially proud that youth unemployment is at a record low, falling by over 45% since 2010 - opening up career opportunities for our next generation."" Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said: ""Today's figures hide the real story of the labour market under this government: people are earning less than they did in 2008, and millions of workers are stuck in insecure jobs. ""More families are working harder to get by, but the rising cost of living and low pay means that a job is no longer a reliable route out of poverty."" The ONS said job vacancies rose by 14,000 in the period to 833,000 - a record high. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said this was ""alarmingly high"" and ""further evidence of persistent skills shortages"". ""While the number of people in work stands close to historic highs, firms continue to report that attempting to recruit staff with the right skills is an increasingly uphill struggle, which is stifling their ability to grow and boost productivity,"" he added. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said firms were now in heated competition for skills. ""Vacancies are at an all-time high, and recruiters are finding it increasingly difficult to match available workers with job descriptions. ""In these circumstances, we would normally expect significant increases to salaries as firms attempt to attract the talent they need, but high costs and subdued productivity growth have impeded this somewhat,"" he added. Mr Parikh urged the chancellor to act in the forthcoming Autumn Budget to help provide reduce costs for businesses.

"Mark Carney will remain Bank of England governor until the end of January 2020, Chancellor Philip Hammond has told MPs. Mr Hammond said the seven-month extension would ""support a smooth exit"" from the European Union. The extension was agreed in anexchange of letters,externalbetween the governor and the chancellor published on Wednesday. Mr Carney said he was ""willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England"". It is the second extension of his tenure as governor. When Mr Carney took over from Mervyn King in 2013, he agreed a five-year term with the option of a further three. The typical term for the position has been eight years. In October 2016, Mr Carney said he would staying on for an extra year, until June 2019, after his initial five-year term ended in 2018. The 'rock star' central banker Carney's 'toughest day' as Bank governor Mr Hammond told the Commons that the early part of summer 2019 ""could be quite a turbulent period for our economy"" following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU on 29 March. Mr Carney had agreed ""despite various personal pressures"" to stay on until January 2020 to ""help support continuity in our economy during this period"", the chancellor said. The extension will give the government more time to recruit his successor, amid concern that few candidates would want to take on the role during an unpredictable stage in the Brexit process. Sir Jon Cunliffe, Bank of England deputy governor with responsibility for financial stability, has also been re-appointed for a second five-year term that will last until October 2023. Bradley Fried, chair of the Bank's Court of Directors, welcomed their decisions to stay on: ""Continuity in the outstanding leadership they provide will help the Bank succeed in our crucial work."" Nicky Morgan, chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, said the announcement provided ""much-needed stability and clarity"". ""The government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning. It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury Committee to scrutinise the appointment,"" she added. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move. ""I have a good working relationship with Mark Carney. We meet on a regular basis and I have a lot of confidence in him, so I'm pleased this will give us a bit of stability."" Mr Carney is married to economist Diana Fox The Canadian was the first non-Briton to be appointed governor in the Bank's 300-year history and had previously run the Bank of Canada for five and a half years from February 2008. In March 2008, just a month after his appointment, Mr Carney cut Canadian interest rates amid the financial crisis. That move, along with other measures, was considered to have boosted investor confidence, enabling Canada to recover more quickly than some other countries. He had a commercial banking background, as well as experience in the public sector - unlike his two most recent predecessors who had spent their careers within the Bank of England and academia. Mr Carney worked for investment banking giant Goldman Sachs in New York before returning home to work for Canada's Department of Finance. Born in March 1965 in Fort Smith in Canada's Northwest Territories, he graduated from Harvard University in 1988 and then earned a doctorate in economics at Oxford University in 1995. That year he married economist Diana Fox, whom he met at Oxford, and the couple now have four children.

"Pedestrians tried to escape the ""chaos"" of the 2017 Westminster terror attack but never stood a chance, a witness has told the inquest into their deaths. Kylie Smith, a teacher accompanying a group of children, described seeing Khalid Masood's car hit people. ""It was very clearly a deliberate act. The way he turned the car to change the direction,"" she told the Old Bailey. Four people were killed on Westminster Bridge before PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death outside Parliament. ""It was chaos. It was just chaos,"" Ms Smith told the hearing. ""People trying to get out of the way but nobody really had a chance."" Those killed in the attack on 22 March last year were Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster attack: What happened Westminster inquest: Day one Ms Smith said she saw American tourist Mr Cochran and his wife Melissa ""walking hand in hand... having a nice time"". ""The car came towards them. The man tried to pull his girlfriend behind him, tried to shield her from the impact,"" she said. ""The man went over the car and just flew up in the air."" Police say the attack began at 14:40 when Masood's vehicle, a rented Hyundai Tucson SUV, mounted the kerb on Westminster Bridge, travelling at an average speed of 31mph. Kurt and Melissa Cochran walking on Westminster Bridge before the attack This video can not be played The moments before Westminster attack Mr Cochran - who was standing with his wife at the south side of the bridge - was the first to be hit. Giving evidence, Mrs Cochran, from Utah, told the inquest they had been sightseeing for two and a half hours before the attack. She said: ""I remember hearing a car revving. I remember seeing the front of the vehicle. The next thing I remember, being on the ground."" Melissa Cochran talks about 'the love of my life' Mrs Cochran, who spent about a month in hospital recovering from serious injuries, said she did not recall being pushed out of the way by her husband, but said such behaviour was ""typical"" of him. Another witness, Neil Hulbert, described how he heard an ""almighty crash"" and saw Mr Cochran ""flying through the air"" over the balustrade of the bridge. He said: ""I guessed some sort of vehicle was involved, just the way he was ejected over. I did not notice there was any movement from him as such. I knew then it was going to be serious."" Mrs Cochran arriving at the inquest where she recalled sightseeing before the attack Paramedic James Richards said he arrived at the scene minutes after the attack. ""Initially we saw several abandoned vehicles, many people moving in different directions, casualties around clearly injured, generally a scene of chaos,"" he said. ""I remember approaching several casualties and checking each was conscious, breathing."" He was then informed Mr Cochran was on the embankment below the bridge and attended to him. At first Mr Cochran had ""rasping"" breath, the paramedic said, but his condition deteriorated over the next 17 minutes and he was pronounced dead as Big Ben was chiming at 15:00. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The inquest is examining the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the five victims in what Judge Mark Lucraft QC, chief coroner of England and Wales, has described as ""82 seconds of high and terrible drama"". Retired window cleaner Mr Rhodes, from south London, died after being knocked into the air and dragged by Masood's car. Dr Gareth Lloyd helped treat Mr Rhodes in the road before paramedics arrived, and he then travelled with him to hospital. He told the coroner he had been walking on the opposite side of the bridge from where the attack unfolded and saw Masood's vehicle ""gathering pace rather than stopping"" and hit three people as it was driven ""intermittently off and on"" the pavement. CCTV of Leslie Rhodes on the bridge moments before the attack was also shown in court Dr Lloyd said it appeared Mr Rhodes, who died in hospital the following day, had an ""unsurvivable injury"". The inquest heard the air ambulance had been on its way to help him before apparently being diverted and sent to PC Palmer. And lawyers for his family raised the question of whether this could have led to a delay in his treatment. Ms Frade, a school PA, was thrown 17 metres into a bus lane, then fell under a slow-moving oncoming bus. Romanian tourist Ms Cristea was knocked into the Thames from the bridge and was in the water for nearly nine minutes before being rescued. She died in hospital just over two weeks later. After crashing his car into a fence outside Parliament, Masood - armed with two knives - ran into the Palace of Westminster's Carriage Gate. Who was attacker Khalid Masood? PC Palmer, 48, who was unarmed, challenged him but was forced backwards and stabbed. Masood was shot by plain-clothed armed officers and later died. The inquests, which are expected to last up to five weeks, will be followed by a separate jury inquest for Masood. Kylie Smith cried as she described the chaos on the bridge By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent, at the Old Bailey There were tears and the occasional smile as those caught up in the attack on Westminster Bridge gave evidence on the second day of the inquest. At times during her evidence, Melissa Cochran smiled when she spoke of her husband, Kurt. ""We had one day in London so we were cramming everything in we could,"" she said. Kylie Smith, a teacher who was with her students on Westminster Bridge, cried as she recalled seeing Mr Cochran being hit and the chaos and panic that followed. She described seeing the couple holding hands before Mr Cochran was run down and said it seemed like they were having a good time. Dr Gareth Lloyd, who was also on the bridge at the time of the attack, tried to help Leslie Rhodes. In a touching moment at the end of his evidence he thanked the family for inviting him to his funeral and said it was a privilege to attend.

"The shortage of NHS staff in England has started worsening again, official figures show. One in 11 posts is vacant with the situation particularly bad among the nursing workforce. Experts described the situation as at risk of becoming a ""national emergency"" given the rising demands on the NHS. It comes after sustained efforts by ministers and NHS bosses to tackle the shortages, including a new pay deal and recruitment and retention campaigns. Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes The latest figures have been published by the regulator, NHS Improvement, for the April to June period. They showed: 11.8% of nurse posts were not filled - a shortage of nearly 42,000 9.3% of doctor posts were vacant - a shortage of 11,500 Overall, 9.2% of all posts were not filled - a shortage of nearly 108,000 This is slightly worse than this time last year and comes after improvements at the end of last year and start of this year. The difficulties facing hospitals, ambulances and mental health services mean spending on temporary staff is going over budget. Tom Sandford, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the report painted a ""bleak picture"", pointing out that the number of nurse vacancies had risen by 17% in the past three months alone. ""The government must immediately investigate this sudden spike."" Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said the shortage of nurses was at risk of becoming a ""national emergency"". Chris Hopson, head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said services were ""most worried"" about the vacancies given the situation had started deteriorating. He said the NHS was facing a ""triple challenge"" of increasing demand, growing workforce shortages and pressure on finances. Alongside the workforce figures, the quarterly report showed that a deficit of Â£519m was being forecast for this year, although that is lower than it has been for the previous three years. It comes as waiting-time targets for A&E and planned operations continue to be missed. NHS Improvement chief executive Ian Dalton acknowledged that staff were working ""extremely hard to cope"". But he said steps were being taken to relieve the pressure, including a concerted effort to get patients out of hospital more quickly with the help of services in the community. And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman praised ""hard-working"" staff and said despite the pressures the NHS was still providing ""world class"" care. Alongside the pay rise, he also pointed out that the number of training places for doctors, nurses and midwives was increasing by 25% in the coming years.

"David Devlin was on the run from jail at the time of the two burglaries A violent burglar who tried to destroy DNA evidence by clipping his victim's fingernails has been jailed. David Devlin was one of three men who smashed their way into a Leicester house, then attacked the woman inside. After she scratched his face, Devlin washed her hands and cut her nails to destroy DNA evidence, but did not take the clippings away and was traced. Devlin admitted two charges of robbery and one count of grievous bodily harm and was jailed for 22 years. East Midlands Live: Couple married 60 years after breaking up; Crash fight death accused girlfriend in court Leicester Crown Court heard Devlin, of no fixed address, was on the run after absconding from HMP Sudbury when the robbery took place in March. He grabbed the woman, who is in her 60s, and demanded cash and gold, along with two other men who have not been traced. Leicestershire Police said Devlin started punching the woman's face but when she grabbed his balaclava she scratched his face. The woman's hands and face were then sprayed with a cleaning fluid and he cut her fingernails using nail clippers. Despite these precautions, Devlin left the clippings behind and when they were analysed the DNA was matched to him. The victim suffered injuries including a fractured left wrist which required surgery, bruising to her face and damage to her eye. The same night Devlin and two accomplices broke into another house and threatened a woman and her two children, stealing a quantity of jewellery. Leicestershire Police described the attacks as ""truly shocking"". Devlin also admitted absconding from lawful custody, two counts of aggravated burglary and one count of handling stolen goods.

"A final decision has not yet been made on US President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Republic of Ireland in November, the White House has said. Earlier, an Irish government spokesperson said the trip had been ""postponed for scheduling reasons"". However since then the White House said the president will travel to Paris in November as previously announced. ""We are still finalising whether Ireland will be a stop on that trip,"" spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. The White House had announced the visit earlier in September. The US president was expected to visit his golf course in Doonbeg, County Clare, and Dublin on the weekend of 10-11 November. Mr Trump is due to travel to Paris on 11 November for commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One. A visit to Ireland was raised by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during his trip to the US in March The office for Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar confirmed the November visit was cancelled and said the ""US side has cited scheduling reasons"". Politicians and activists in Ireland had indicated they would hold protests during Mr Trump's visit. Brendan Howlin, the leader of the Labour Party in the Republic of Ireland, said that Mr Trump was ""no friend of democracy or human rights"". The Green Party had called on the Irish government to cancel the visit.

"Serena Williams lost to Naomi Osaka at the US Open at the weekend An Australian cartoonist has defended his depiction of Serena Williams at the US Open, after the image went viral and was criticised as racist and sexist. Mark Knight's newspaper cartoon showed Williams jumping above a broken racquet next to a baby's dummy. Critics said it used racist stereotypes. The cartoonist denied it was racist, saying he had intended to depict only the tennis player's ""poor behaviour"". Some also said Knight had ""whitewashed"" Japanese player Naomi Osaka. Williams sparked controversy during her loss to Osaka, whose father is Haitian and mother Japanese, when she accused the umpire of sexism and being a ""thief"". Knight's drawing was published in Australia's most-read newspaper, the Herald Sun on Monday, and referenced Williams's outburst and showed the umpire asking Osaka: ""Can you just let her win?"" Serena Williams and 'angry black women' It has been strongly defended by Knight and the newspaper's editor, Damon Johnston, who denied the cartoon is racist or sexist. ""It rightly mocks poor behaviour by a tennis legend... Mark has the full support of everyone,""he said in a tweet,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Others on social media pointed out that Osaka, who is mixed race, had been drawn as a white woman with blonde hair. The National Association of Black Journalists in the US denounced the cartoon as ""repugnant on many levels"". Rants, jeers and tears - 'most bizarre match'? 'Sexism doesn't excuse Williams' behaviour' ""[It] not only exudes racist, sexist caricatures of both women, but Williams' depiction is unnecessarily sambo-like,"" it said in a statement. The 1899 children's book, The Story of Little Black Sambo, featured derogatory racial depictions - such as characters with thick red lips. Knight said he had ""no knowledge of those cartoons or that period"", saying on Tuesday that ""the world has just gone crazy"". ""The cartoon was just about Serena on the day having a tantrum. That's basically it,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Knight also rejected a suggestion that he would not draw a similar image of a man. As evidence, he tweeted his recent cartoon of tennis player Nick Kyrgios. By 12:15 GMT on Tuesday, both his Twitter and Facebook accounts had been shut down. One sociology expert told the BBC that Knight had used ""a genre that has a long history of racist impact"". ""The author may not even realise their own framing of the world has been shaped by history of racism in Australia,"" said emeritus Prof Andrew Jakubowicz from the University of Technology, Sydney. He said there had been ""a tradition"" in many Australian cartoons to exaggerate physical characteristics of minority groups, including indigenous Australians, to ""trigger a reaction"" - such as humour.

"The government's refusal to increase police pay by 3% in England and Wales is a ""punch on the nose"", Britain's most senior police officer has said. Cressida Dick said she was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision to give police a 2% rise, against the recommendation of an independent board. The Met Police chief said she did not want police to be affected by understaffing like the prison service. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it had been a collective government decision. ""When it comes to pay recommendationsâ¦ for millions of public sector workersâ¦ you have to, as a government, take them all into account,"" he told the Police Superintendents' Association annual conference in Leicester. Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Ministers 'unaware of police cuts impact' No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Mr Javid said that he understood concerns, however. ""This is a reflection of trying to strike that balance and I'm not pretending it's easy,"" he said, adding that he knows there is ""a need for more resources"". The comments from Ms Dick come as a public spending watchdog called the government's approach to police funding ""ineffective"". According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"" following widespread funding cuts. Sajid Javid said he will ""continue to fight on the police's behalf"" Ms Dick told the Police Superintendents' Association that the government decision on pay would make it harder to recruit and retain officers. ""I do think that decision will have affected morale,"" she said. ""I don't want the government to wait until we are struggling like the prison service with chronic understaffing."" She said the decision to impose the 2% pay award for pensionable pay flew in the face of evidence and rational argument, adding that it ""feels like 1% to our officers"". ""I am extremely disappointed by that outcome,"" she said, adding that police had worked ""tirelessly"" with the Home Office and the independent Pay Review Body (PRB) to make the case for ""fair pay"" for officers. Ms Dick noted it was the second year in a row the PRB recommendation had been rejected, adding that it leaves the whole process ""in tatters"". The Home Office acknowledges forces are stretched but says it has increased funding this year and points out that new officers are being recruited. However, Ms Dick argued that it was proving difficult to recruit in the Met, partly, she said because of officers' pay, which starts at Â£22,300 in London. At the conference Mr Javid also said he will ensure police chiefs can award bonuses of up to Â£4,000 for superintendents in challenging roles and officers in hard-to-fill jobs. ""I do fully recognise the pressures on policing so let me be very clear with you,"" he said. ""I will continue to fight on the police's behalf so that you have the resources that you need to do your jobs effectively."" BBC home editor Mark Easton said the Home Office had faced a double whammy with Ms Dick's comments and the audit office's report, which was ""one of the most critical I can remember"". ""In normal circumstances the home secretary might be on the ropes on a day like today, but I think because Sajid Javid is new to the job I think there's understanding  he's still getting his feet under the table,"" he said. ""But of course the public is getting more concerned about crime, there's still the threat from terrorism, and I don't think he's going to be able to dodge these questions for that much longer.""

The police superintendents warmed to Sajid Javid. They laughed at his joke about Bodyguard, the TV drama focusing on a protection officer assigned to look after a home secretary. And they enjoyed the conference hall banter between him and his brother, Bas, a chief superintendent in the West Midlands who was watching the speech. The brothers later embraced and posed for pictures. Having a close relative in the police has clearly helped Mr Javid understand the challenges facing the service. Finding the answers, though, is less straightforward. The home secretary is banking on squeezing more money out of the Treasury in the next spending review: there's ""no plan B"" he said. And unlike the earlier part of his address, he wasn't joking. Since March 2010 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition came into power - there has been a cut of 21,330 police officers. Ms Dick told the conference that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". She announced a new scheme to encourage recently retired officers to return to work, saying ""expertise"" was being lost. ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 A Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""We need to listen to people like Cressida Dick and the government needs to make the effort to understand what the effects of its cuts are, not just put the blame on police and crime commissioners."" Offers for 2018-19 have not yet been made in Scotland or Northern Ireland. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) continues to discuss police officer pay and there were constructive discussions at the latest meeting today. PNB will refer its agreement to Scottish ministers for approval in due course."" The starting salary for newly-recruited police constables in Scotland is higher than in England and Wales. The situation in Northern Ireland isyet to be determinedbecause of the absence of a devolved administration.

"Many areas of the police service in England and Wales are ""on the verge of crisis"", the president of the Police Superintendents' Association will warn. Chief Superintendent Gavin Thomas will give a speech to the group's conference on Tuesday saying forces are ""utterly reliant"" on fewer staff working longer. It comes a year after he warned policing faced a ""perfect storm""due to budget cuts and rising crime. The Home Office said it is committed to getting officers the support they need. Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Do Corbyn's police claims stack up? Ch Supt Thomas is expected to tell the conference: ""I cannot emphasise enough that the delivery of routine policing functions should not be dependent on officers effectively giving their time for free by staying past their shift times or working on leave days. ""That exploits police officers and defrauds the public."" As well as arguing policing is now in a worst state than last year, Ch Supt Thomas will say: ""I would now suggest that this great service is on the verge of crisis in many areas. ""The vision for policing has to be something more strategic than a hope for more collaborations, otherwise we will be in a perpetual state of crisis."" Ch Supt Thomas is also expected to urge the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, and leading officers to take ""difficult and bold"" decisions. ""There is a void in the long-term strategic vision for the police service of the future,"" he will add. ""We need to know what the overall goal is for reform. What are we ultimately working towards? What is the vision for policing in 21st Century England and Wales?"" The association has already highlighted concerns about force collaborations after it found some officers spent hours driving more than 100 miles to cover two areas, using two different laptops, IDs and email addresses, all for the same job. Ch Supt Thomas will say: ""We have been debating our structures for delivering service to the public on and off for years, and yet have been trying to make the same systems and structures work. ""The famous definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" The Home Office said it is carrying out a review of front-line policing to bring about improvements. ""The home secretary has made it clear that he is committed to a good working relationship with the police and to ensuring that front-line officers get the support and professional development they deserve,"" said a spokeswoman. ""The ongoing front-line review will help officers and staff to drive change in policing and ensure that the barriers  they face on a day-to-day basis are identified and addressed.""

"This video can not be played Pizza, dogs and Bake Off: what Mark Carney really likes Dealing with the immediate result of the Brexit referendum produced Mark Carney's ""toughest day"" in his job. The governor of the Bank of England made his comments when answering questions from childrenin Coventryas part of the BBC'sSchool Report. The June referendum produced a narrow majority in favour of the UK leaving the European Union. Mr Carney said he had been worried about theBank's complex plans,externalfor dealing with the referendum aftermath. ""The reason that was a tough day [overnight and on the morning of the referendum result] was not because of the result, but because we had put in place a bunch of plans... for either outcome,"" he said. ""In order to make sure those plans worked we had to have a huge number of people co-ordinate with people both here in the UK, and with people who do my type of job around the world, and ensure that everyone did the right thing at the right time, so that nobody noticed any ripples as a result of it."" Kamal Ahmed: Chocolate, dogs and Craig David - my school day with the governor The Bank of England had put in place contingency plans to ensure that the UK's banking system would work normally, regardless of the referendum result. The most high profile element involved offering banks the opportunity to borrow up to Â£250bn extra, both before and after the June vote, to finance their day-to-day operations. The Bank also offered to lend foreign currency to UK banks, if needed. Mr Carney said he had been worried that something might go wrong, regardless of how careful the Bank's advanced planning had been. ""You have a plan but you have to put it into place and there's always a bit of concern that it won't work perfectly, you haven't anticipated everything, or that somehow or other it just won't execute the way it should,"" he explained. But in the end, nothing went wrong. ""It definitely worked because everything that was supposed to happen, happened,"" Mr Carney said. Questioned on other issues, the governor said if Scotland became independent it would have to give up some of its sovereignty if it wanted to continue using the pound. ""If it were ever an independent country and wanted to continue to share the pound sterling - you need to share some degree of your sovereignty,"" he said. He declined to say if he preferred working with David Cameron or Theresa May as Prime Minister. ""They are both very professional, incredibly easy to work with, both focused on making the country better. And that holds for the chancellors that I've worked with both here and in Canada,"" he said. And asked about his favourite TV programme, film and food, he nominated the Great British Bake Off, the 1981 war drama Gallipoli, and pizza.

"The impact of funding on rising crime is a matter of hot debate, but what is certain is that police forces in England and Wales have less money than they did in 2010. Putting a precise figure on it is harder than you might think, however, because budgets are made up of different elements and these elements are not published officially in one place. After five years of cuts, in 2015 the government committed to protecting English and Welsh police forces' budgets in real terms overall. But there are big caveats to this. Police forces in England and Wales mainly get their money from a combination of grants from central government - the biggest chunk - and money raised through council taxes. There are also separate grants from central government which fund areas that are dealt with on a national level, like cyber-crime and counter-terrorism. Not every police force will receive this money. Firstly, police spending is only protected in real terms overall once you include these national grants. When it comes to funding individual forces' policing, budgets are protected in cash terms which means forces are still experiencing a real-terms cut because of the rising costs of policing. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? What's happened to police numbers? For example, the Met is getting the same amount of money - its funding from government is not being reduced - but its costs are rising so it says it must find Â£400m in savings. There are also big variations in how much money different areas are able to raise in council tax, and therefore how much they rely on grants from central government. In Surrey which has more taxpayers and more valuable properties, the force gets 44% of its funding from central government. In Northumbria, where council tax take is lower, 83% of police funding comes from central government. The Institute for Fiscal Studies saysoverall police budgets fell by 14%,externalbetween 2010-11 and 2014-15. BBC Reality Check calculates that between 2010 and 2017 there has been about a 20% cut in police funding in real terms. As funding has fallen, so have numbers of police officers. In December, Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced what she described as a ""substantial"" Â£450m increase in police funding in England and Wales. This brings us to our second caveat. More than half of this money (Â£270m) will be raised from council tax. It's not new money from government. This commitment to protect budgets relies on police and crime commissioners putting up council tax by the maximum they are allowed. The chunk of funding that comes from central government has been falling in cash terms in every year up to 2017-18. It is going to stay the same in 2018-19 as the year before. 'Extra Â£450m funding' for police in England and Wales Reality Check: Is the Met Police facing Â£400m in cuts? The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority,Sir David Norgrove, has flagged the lack of transparency,externalaround police funding in the past. He also said: ""The prime minister's statement and the Home Office's tweet could have led the public to conclude incorrectly that central government is providing an additional Â£450m for police spending in 2018-19. ""The Home Office tweet also implied that the Â£450m sum is guaranteed. As the minister for policing's statement outlined, up to Â£270m of the funding settlement will come from local council tax, if police and crime commissioners and mayors choose to raise these sums."" Ms Rudd emphasised the government's determination to halt the rise in violence but her strategy did not mention funding All UK forces have seen reductions to their funding since 2010. In Scotland, there is a single police service, formed through the merger of eight forces in April 2013. The Police Service of Scotland (PSoS) is centrally funded by the Scottish government and has no council-tax raising powers, although local authorities are able to put some of their general budgets into funding local policing priorities. Between 2013, when the single police service was formed, and 2016, the Scottish Police Authority's budget fell by about 9% in real terms. Projections published in 2017 suggested the police service would be almost Â£200m in deficit by 2021. In Northern Ireland, the police service'sbudget reduced by 17%,externalbetween 2011 and 2015. Northern Ireland also has a single police service, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) which is centrally funded from Westminster. It bids for funding from the Treasury and cannot raise money through local taxes.

"Mark Carney has ""star quality and knows how to use it,"" says Scott Reid Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he will be staying on an extra year after his initial term comes to an end in 2018, to help oversee the UK's Brexit negotiations with the European Union. Mr Carney's decision came after increasing speculation about his future as the head of the Bank of England. Governors are traditionally appointed for an eight-year term, but when Mr Carney took the job in 2013 he initially signed up for five years, with an option for a further three. He has now saidhe will stay until June 2019. In his letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond, Mr Carney said his move should help ""contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK's new relationship with Europe"". During the referendum, Mr Carney had come under pressure from some Brexit campaigners for his remarks thatvoting to leave the EU would push the UK into a recession- seen by some as outside the governor's non-political remit. The governordefended his intervention, saying the Bank's role was to ""identify risks, not to cross your fingers and hope risks would go away"". Mr Carney has overseen the introduction of the Bank's first polymer banknotes Nevertheless, this sparked calls for him to resign. Mr Carney ""never seems to want to recognise the result of the referendum and get on with it,"" said one MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, recently. Since his arrival three years ago, Mr Carney has presided over measures designed to boost the UK economy in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. There have been bouts ofquantitative easing- pumping money directly into the financial system. He introduced a policy of""forward guidance""at the Bank, also aimed at raising confidence; though just six months after its implementation in 2013 this needed a rethink. The Bank had originally said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7% or below. But when that seemed likely to happen much sooner than anticipatedthe Bank altered its stance, saying it would focus on a range of economic variables rather than just the jobless numbers before changing rates. This video can not be played Mark Carney reacted with apparent amusement after Robert Peston asked if the Chancellor was being ""irrational and hysterical"" But Mr Carney did then give clear hints that rates would have to gradually rise towards 2017. Instead, the opposite has happened, and in the wake of the UK's Brexit vote theBank actually cut rates to 0.25%this summer. When Mark Carney became the Bank of England's governor in June 2013, he was the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank's 300-year history. He came after a successful stint as Canada's central banker, where he was credited for shielding the country from some of the worst effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Likened more than once to Hollywood actor George Clooney, Mr Carney has become one the UK's best-known central bank governors In March 2008, just a month after his appointment, he cut Canadian interest rates. This and other measures helped boost market confidence and enabled Canada to recover from the crisis more quickly than some of its peers. Likened more than once to the Hollywood actor George Clooney, ahead of his arrival in the UK Mr Carney was touted as a ""rock star"" banker, a change from the usual Bank of England head. ""He's got star quality, and he knows how to use it,"" said fellow Canadian and former government colleague Scott Reid. Mr Carney's appointment was a break with tradition in many ways. He had a commercial banking, as well as a public sector background - unlike his two most recent predecessors who had spent their careers within the Bank of England and academia. Mr Carney worked for investment banking giant Goldman Sachs in New York before returning to Canada to work for the country's Finance Department - and then Canada's central bank. Born 16 March 1965: Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada 1988: Graduates from Harvard University 1991-95: Gains a doctorate in economics at Oxford University 1995: Marries economist Diana Fox, whom he met at Oxford. The couple now have four children Works at Goldman Sachs in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, rising to position of managing director 2004-07: Senior position at Canada's Department of Finance 2008-13: Governor, Bank of Canada 2013-present: Governor, Bank of England Another difference was the size of his pay packet, which was well above that of his predecessor, Sir Mervyn King. His starting annual salary of Â£480,000 (plus Â£144,000 pension allowance) was Â£175,000 more than Sir Mervyn received - and that's not counting his Â£250,000 annual accommodation allowance. So what is it about Mr Carney that separates him from other central bankers? ""He's extraordinarily charismatic,"" says Scott Reid. ""You go to his speeches and you'll find them just as dry as anyone's. ""But it's the way he does things, he takes the time to linger on you... and the public and the press find that very intoxicating. ""He such a fetching figure - but let's not be shy about that. He's conscious of it. He's shrewd when it comes to his image."" Following the UK's Brexit vote, many in the markets see Mr Carney as one of the few voices of continuity Married to an Englishwoman, the 48-year-old's postgraduate education was at Oxford University, where he studied economics. His former tutor during his Masters degree, economist Peter Oppenheimer, says ""he was a typically bright, transatlantic student"". ""That sounds terribly old fashioned, but he wasn't the sort of young man who walked around in torn sweaters."" Prof Oppenheimer says Mr Carney was an interesting choice to run the Bank of England. ""He wasn't an insider, he wasn't an academic economist, and he was a practical banker of a certain kind. ""The really good governors of the post-Second World War period have been people with practical banking experience, such as Gordon Richardson and Robin Leigh-Pemberton. ""They have been the outstanding governors. More so than Bank insiders, or people with long academic careers."" It's been said Mr Carney wanted to stay to help the UK through the challenges of Brexit, and that leaving early might be seen by some of his critics as admitting defeat. Mrs May believes Mark Carney is ""the right man for the job"" Crucially, he has thebacking of the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who believes he is the right person to be Bank of England governor. There is also the matter of market confidence. Following the referendum result and all the personnel changes in the Conservative government, many in the markets see Mr Carney as one of the few voices of continuity in the UK.

"In Merseyside 86% of burglaries went unsolved Serious and organised crime will increase without ""desperately needed"" investment in policing, Merseyside's police and crime commissioner said. Jane Kennedy's2017-18 report,externalrevealed there are 153 active organised crime gangs in Merseyside with crime increasing by 14% in the past year. She also defended her force's record as figures show four out of five burglaries in the region went unsolved. The Home Office said Merseyside Police funding had increased by Â£5.2m. A spokesman said the Home Secretary was ""committed to prioritising police funding in next year's Spending Review"". Merseyside Police insist there has been a 12% decrease in burglaries since March and a 7% increase in people arrested on suspicion of burglary. The police commissioner said: ""Officers and investigators looked at the areas where burglaries were happening and really got to grips with it. ""As a result the numbers of burglaries have been reduced and the people who have been perpetrating the burglaries have been brought to justice."" An analysis of Home Office figures by the Press Association revealed that no suspect was identified by police in 86% of burglaries on Merseyside. This was the sixth highest rate for a police force in England and Wales. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, she said: ""When a burglar goes to prison, the burglary rate in the area where that person has been operating often goes through the floor."" The commissioner pointed that Merseyside Police have made Â£83m cuts over the last eight years with Â£18m over the next four years at the same time as an increase in crime. Her2017-18 annual report,externalfound that the force's workforce has been cut by a quarter after eight years of cuts while at the same time: Crime in Merseyside has risen by 13.8% with 125,000 crimes reported over the last 12 months Police have to deal with 340 crimes and 1,246 incidents in an average day There are 94 recorded rapes every month Almost 1 million calls a year She said: ""We need action from central government and we desperately need new money invested in this, our most vital of public services.

"Boris Johnson was among leading Tory MPs present to endorse the launch of the report Boris Johnson and other leading Tory Brexiteers have attacked Theresa May's Brexit plan at an event putting the economic case for leaving the EU without an agreement on trade. TheEconomists For Free Trade report,externalsaid the UK had ""nothing to fear"" from a ""clean break"" from the EU and using World Trade Organisation rules. This could give an Â£80bn boost to the tax base and cut prices by 8%, it said. But the claims were branded ""Project Fantasy"" by Labour MP Chuka Umunna. And Chancellor Philip Hammond said the economic assumptions behind the analysis were ""not sustainable"" and out of line with other forecasts. Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' Brexit Mr Hammond, who earlier on Tuesday announced Bank of England Governor Mark Carney would be extending his contract until January 2020 to provide continuity after Brexit, has issued a fresh warning of ""some turbulence"" if the UK left the EU in March without a deal. Ministers have said reaching a general agreement on future economic co-operation with the EU is in the UK's interests before it leaves on 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU are hoping to agree a way forward next month, at the same time as they settle the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the bloc, including a transition period up to the end of 2020. Carney to stay at Bank of England till 2020 At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Mr Johnson and other Conservative MPs opposed to Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU are facing growing pressure to provide an alternative plan. Mr Johnson, who made a surprise appearance at the launch of the report in Westminster, said Mrs May's Chequers plan would mean ""abandoning our seat around the table in Brussels and continuing to accept the single market legislation"". He added: ""That seems to me to be a particular economic risk in Chequers and makes it substantially worse than the status quo."" By the BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason In Committee Room 9, the glitterati of the Brexiteer establishment. This was a gig with two key messages: banishing the bogeyman, as they see it, of WTO rules; they can be embraced, not fled from. Oh, and the government's Chequers plan is terrible. Boris Johnson and David Davis were both there, and recipients of applause for being willing to leave the cabinet on principle. Other stalwarts of the Eurosceptic army joined the crowd: Bill Cash, Iain Duncan Smith, and from the business world, Richard Tice and John Mills. This was not about sticking two fingers up to the EU. Plenty in the room argued that leaving the EU on WTO terms next March would be fine, but preferred reaching a withdrawal agreement, and securing a transition period. During this transition a looser long term relationship could be negotiated with Brussels, which they want to be a souped-up version of the free trade agreement between Canada and the EU. Jacob Rees-Mogg said the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs he chairs would spell out its solution to the issue of avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland at a meeting on Wednesday. ""Leaving on a world trade deal is a perfectly sensible thing to do but I think we can do better,"" he added.

"The government's refusal to increase police pay by 3% in England and Wales is a ""punch on the nose"", Britain's most senior police officer has said. Cressida Dick said she was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision to give police a 2% rise, against the recommendation of an independent board. The Met Police chief said she did not want police to be affected by understaffing like the prison service. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it had been a collective government decision. ""When it comes to pay recommendationsâ¦ for millions of public sector workersâ¦ you have to, as a government, take them all into account,"" he told the Police Superintendents' Association annual conference in Leicester. Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Ministers 'unaware of police cuts impact' No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Mr Javid said that he understood concerns, however. ""This is a reflection of trying to strike that balance and I'm not pretending it's easy,"" he said, adding that he knows there is ""a need for more resources"". The comments from Ms Dick come as a public spending watchdog called the government's approach to police funding ""ineffective"". According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"" following widespread funding cuts. Sajid Javid said he will ""continue to fight on the police's behalf"" Ms Dick told the Police Superintendents' Association that the government decision on pay would make it harder to recruit and retain officers. ""I do think that decision will have affected morale,"" she said. ""I don't want the government to wait until we are struggling like the prison service with chronic understaffing."" She said the decision to impose the 2% pay award for pensionable pay flew in the face of evidence and rational argument, adding that it ""feels like 1% to our officers"". ""I am extremely disappointed by that outcome,"" she said, adding that police had worked ""tirelessly"" with the Home Office and the independent Pay Review Body (PRB) to make the case for ""fair pay"" for officers. Ms Dick noted it was the second year in a row the PRB recommendation had been rejected, adding that it leaves the whole process ""in tatters"". The Home Office acknowledges forces are stretched but says it has increased funding this year and points out that new officers are being recruited. However, Ms Dick argued that it was proving difficult to recruit in the Met, partly, she said because of officers' pay, which starts at Â£22,300 in London. At the conference Mr Javid also said he will ensure police chiefs can award bonuses of up to Â£4,000 for superintendents in challenging roles and officers in hard-to-fill jobs. ""I do fully recognise the pressures on policing so let me be very clear with you,"" he said. ""I will continue to fight on the police's behalf so that you have the resources that you need to do your jobs effectively."" BBC home editor Mark Easton said the Home Office had faced a double whammy with Ms Dick's comments and the audit office's report, which was ""one of the most critical I can remember"". ""In normal circumstances the home secretary might be on the ropes on a day like today, but I think because Sajid Javid is new to the job I think there's understanding  he's still getting his feet under the table,"" he said. ""But of course the public is getting more concerned about crime, there's still the threat from terrorism, and I don't think he's going to be able to dodge these questions for that much longer.""

The police superintendents warmed to Sajid Javid. They laughed at his joke about Bodyguard, the TV drama focusing on a protection officer assigned to look after a home secretary. And they enjoyed the conference hall banter between him and his brother, Bas, a chief superintendent in the West Midlands who was watching the speech. The brothers later embraced and posed for pictures. Having a close relative in the police has clearly helped Mr Javid understand the challenges facing the service. Finding the answers, though, is less straightforward. The home secretary is banking on squeezing more money out of the Treasury in the next spending review: there's ""no plan B"" he said. And unlike the earlier part of his address, he wasn't joking. Since March 2010 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition came into power - there has been a cut of 21,330 police officers. Ms Dick told the conference that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". She announced a new scheme to encourage recently retired officers to return to work, saying ""expertise"" was being lost. ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 A Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""We need to listen to people like Cressida Dick and the government needs to make the effort to understand what the effects of its cuts are, not just put the blame on police and crime commissioners."" Offers for 2018-19 have not yet been made in Scotland or Northern Ireland. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) continues to discuss police officer pay and there were constructive discussions at the latest meeting today. PNB will refer its agreement to Scottish ministers for approval in due course."" The starting salary for newly-recruited police constables in Scotland is higher than in England and Wales. The situation in Northern Ireland isyet to be determinedbecause of the absence of a devolved administration.

"Ministers do not know the impact that funding cuts have had on police forces, the UK's public spending watchdog says. According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"". It calls the approach to police funding ""ineffective"" and ""detached"" from the changing demands faced by officers. A Home Office spokesman said the department had conducted a substantial review of police pressures last year. However, the Home Office had not even forecast the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the NAO said. Since September 2009 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservatives came into government - there has been a cut of 22,424 police officers. There were 126,252 police officers in England and Wales in September 2017, according to the latest figures. Historically there have been fewer officers - with 123,474 in 2001; 125,453 in 1991; and 116,544 in 1981, for example. Officer numbers grew during the Labour government from 2002 onwards, peaking in 2009. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. Durham's chief constable Mike Barton said the decisions of Home Office ministers in regards to police funding were ""sometimes in the hands of the Treasury"". ""I actually think the cuts in 2010 were the wake up call that policing needed to say: 'Come on spend your money wisely',"" Mr Barton told BBC Breakfast. But he said there had been a ""constant strain"" since then with ""austerity dragging out"". Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? What has happened to police funding? No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Mark Burns-Williamson, police and crime commissioner for West Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report highlighted what other PCCs had been saying ""for some time"". Firstly, that the overall amount of funding for policing ""isn't enough"" - and secondly that the funding formula was ""not really fit for purpose"", leading to ""unfairness and differences"" between different areas. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said MPs had repeatedly heard about police forces being overstretched, calling the report ""very accurate"" and ""damning"". The Labour MP told the BBC it showed an ""irresponsible approach from the Home Office"" in making ""substantial cuts"" in the police budget ""without appearing to have any clear idea about what the impact of those cuts are"". The NAO report comes as Home Secretary Sajid Javid prepares for a speech to police superintendents in which he will say the police must be equipped for a changing landscape. On Monday, the leader of the superintendents' association warned the service wason the verge of a crisis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officers worked 97 hours' overtime in year 'Cash-strapped' police taking second jobs Number of special constables falling Police forces in England and Wales are funded through a Â£12.3bn combination of a central grant to each police and crime commissioner, as well as additional cash raised locally through the council tax and one-off grants for special projects. The NAO says the amount coming from the government is down 30% in real terms since 2010-11. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. The NAO's Tom McDonald said the Home Office ""does not really understand the nature of the demand"" facing police forces. He said the funding formula used to allocate money was ""out of date"", three years after the Home Office told Parliament that the formula was ineffective. ""It's unlikely that the money is going to the right places,"" he said. ""We have real concerns about it."" By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs Correspondent This report from the national spending watchdog paints a picture of a service on the front line of public protection under severe pressure - but nobody in government being entirely sure how much pressure it is really under. The assessors said that while no force was about to financially fail, the stress was apparent. Since two years ago, officers are taking four days longer to charge suspects - an indication of workload rather than rising crime - and there is less ""proactive work"", such as motorway stops of dangerous drivers, breathalyser tests and convictions for drug possession. The rolling national crime survey has charted rising dissatisfaction with the police - and many communities have campaigned against losing local cuts. Two cities - St Albans and Bath - no longer have a dedicated police station with a front desk. A Home Office plan to revise the police funding formula, to more fairly distribute funds, was mothballed following the June 2017 general election. The NAO said individual forces had been developing their own ways of predicting demand for their services but the Home Office itself had ""no overarching strategy for policing"". But a Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman.

The UK is set to quit the single market but Mrs May wants British manufacturers to continue to have full access to European markets for their goods through a free trade zone - which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book. The Treasury has warned that a no-deal Brexit could result in Â£80bn extra borrowing by 2030 The so-called Chequers plan is unpopular with many Tory MPs, who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty, and Economists For Free Trade, led by Professor Patrick Minford. said the evidence showed it was not necessary to enjoy preferential market status to trade successfully with the EU. In the past 25 years, it said the UK had been ""heavily outperformed"" by countries outside the single market trading with the EU on WTO rules, such as the United States, India and China. During that period, it said the aggregate export growth of WTO countries had been four times larger than the growth of UK exports into the single market. At the same time, it said British exports to the rest of the world had grown more than three times faster than to the EU. The group of economists said it was wrong to characterise leaving the EU without a trade agreement in place as ""crashing out"" without a deal, because the UK and the European Commission would have a duty to reach a series of individual agreements in areas such as aviation and energy. ""We have nothing to fear from trading on WTO terms,"" it said. ""Let Brexit mean Brexit and let us flourish under the auspices of the WTO."" Â£200m land sale to test Brexit effect November Brexit deal is doable - Barnier May plans to 'keep calm and carry on' Outside the EU, the report argues, the UK would be free to set its own tariffs on imports and if these were eliminated, it could reduce prices for consumers by as much as 8%. with those on low incomes benefiting the most from cheaper food and clothing. On the other hand, it said if the EU chose to impose import tariffs on popular items, the UK could reciprocate and its large trade surplus with the UK could result in an annual boost to the UK Exchequer of as much as Â£13bn. But Mr Hammond suggested the report over-estimated the economic benefit to the UK of removing tariffs on EU imports as well as ""implausibly"" assuming there would be no new non-tariff barriers in the event of a no-deal exit nor additional burdens on financial services firms. ""The model makes no allowance for differences in quality and safety of imported goods... and it assumes all standards on imported goods will be abolished,"" he told the Lords economic affairs committee. ""I'm sure the model is very effective but the assumptions that it makes are widely out of line with assumptions used by other economic models and frankly, I believe, are not sustainable"". Labour's Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final deal, said a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK. ""The latest Project Fantasy document from advocates of an ultra-hard Brexit promises to take us to a land of milk-and-honey,"" he said. ""The reality is that, before we have even left, Brexit is forcing up prices in the shops, destabilising our economy and stripping our health service of the doctors and nurses that it so badly needs."" In a related development, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's largest car manufacturer, has warned the wrong kind of Brexit deal could cost the firm Â£1.2bn and result in jobs being moved abroad. Dr Ralph Speth told a conference in Birmingham that unrestricted access to the single market was vital for his business and ""any friction at the border puts business at jeopardy"".

"Ministers do not know the impact that funding cuts have had on police forces, the UK's public spending watchdog says. According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"". It calls the approach to police funding ""ineffective"" and ""detached"" from the changing demands faced by officers. A Home Office spokesman said the department had conducted a substantial review of police pressures last year. However, the Home Office had not even forecast the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the NAO said. Since September 2009 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservatives came into government - there has been a cut of 22,424 police officers. There were 126,252 police officers in England and Wales in September 2017, according to the latest figures. Historically there have been fewer officers - with 123,474 in 2001; 125,453 in 1991; and 116,544 in 1981, for example. Officer numbers grew during the Labour government from 2002 onwards, peaking in 2009. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. Durham's chief constable Mike Barton said the decisions of Home Office ministers in regards to police funding were ""sometimes in the hands of the Treasury"". ""I actually think the cuts in 2010 were the wake up call that policing needed to say: 'Come on spend your money wisely',"" Mr Barton told BBC Breakfast. But he said there had been a ""constant strain"" since then with ""austerity dragging out"". Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? What has happened to police funding? No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Mark Burns-Williamson, police and crime commissioner for West Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report highlighted what other PCCs had been saying ""for some time"". Firstly, that the overall amount of funding for policing ""isn't enough"" - and secondly that the funding formula was ""not really fit for purpose"", leading to ""unfairness and differences"" between different areas. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said MPs had repeatedly heard about police forces being overstretched, calling the report ""very accurate"" and ""damning"". The Labour MP told the BBC it showed an ""irresponsible approach from the Home Office"" in making ""substantial cuts"" in the police budget ""without appearing to have any clear idea about what the impact of those cuts are"". The NAO report comes as Home Secretary Sajid Javid prepares for a speech to police superintendents in which he will say the police must be equipped for a changing landscape. On Monday, the leader of the superintendents' association warned the service wason the verge of a crisis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officers worked 97 hours' overtime in year 'Cash-strapped' police taking second jobs Number of special constables falling Police forces in England and Wales are funded through a Â£12.3bn combination of a central grant to each police and crime commissioner, as well as additional cash raised locally through the council tax and one-off grants for special projects. The NAO says the amount coming from the government is down 30% in real terms since 2010-11. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. The NAO's Tom McDonald said the Home Office ""does not really understand the nature of the demand"" facing police forces. He said the funding formula used to allocate money was ""out of date"", three years after the Home Office told Parliament that the formula was ineffective. ""It's unlikely that the money is going to the right places,"" he said. ""We have real concerns about it."" By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs Correspondent This report from the national spending watchdog paints a picture of a service on the front line of public protection under severe pressure - but nobody in government being entirely sure how much pressure it is really under. The assessors said that while no force was about to financially fail, the stress was apparent. Since two years ago, officers are taking four days longer to charge suspects - an indication of workload rather than rising crime - and there is less ""proactive work"", such as motorway stops of dangerous drivers, breathalyser tests and convictions for drug possession. The rolling national crime survey has charted rising dissatisfaction with the police - and many communities have campaigned against losing local cuts. Two cities - St Albans and Bath - no longer have a dedicated police station with a front desk. A Home Office plan to revise the police funding formula, to more fairly distribute funds, was mothballed following the June 2017 general election. The NAO said individual forces had been developing their own ways of predicting demand for their services but the Home Office itself had ""no overarching strategy for policing"". But a Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said.

"The data breach affected 380,000 transactions by BA customers A cyber-security firm has said it found malicious code injected into the British Airways website, which could be the cause ofa recent data breach that affected 380,000 transactions. A RiskIQ researcher analysed code from BA's website and app around the time when the breach began, in late August. He claimed to have discovered evidence of a ""skimming"" script designed to steal financial data from online payment forms. BA said it was unable to comment. A very similar attack, by a group dubbed Magecart, affected the Ticketmaster website recently, which RiskIQ said it also analysed in depth. The company said the code found on the BA site was very similar, but appeared to have been modified to suit the way the airline's site had been designed. Video: British Airways boss promises compensation British Airways hit by 'malicious' data breach ""This particular skimmer is very much attuned to how British Airway's payment page is set up, which tells us that the attackers carefully considered how to target this site instead of blindly injecting the regular Magecart skimmer,"" the researcher wrotein a report on the findings,external. ""The infrastructure used in this attack was set up with British Airways in mind and purposely targeted scripts that would blend in with normal payment processing to avoid detection."" Hacks like this make use of an increasingly common phenomenon, in which large websites embed multiple pieces of code from other sources or third-party suppliers. Such code may be needed to do specific jobs, such as authorise a payment or present ads to the user. But malicious code can be slipped in instead - this is known as a supply chain attack. In BA's case, hackers stole names, email addresses and credit card details - including the long number, expiry date and the three-digit CVV security code. ""As this is a criminal investigation, we are unable to comment on speculation,"" said BA in a statement. A spokesman for the UK's National Crime Agency said it was aware of the RiskIQ report but would not be commenting at this time. RiskIQ said the malicious script consisted of just 22 lines of code. It worked by grabbing data from BA's online payment form and then sending it to the hackers' server once a customer hit the ""submit"" button. The cyber-security firm added that the attackers had apparently been able to gather data from mobile app users as well because the same script was found loaded into the app on a page describing government taxes and carrier charges. ""The page [in the app] is built with the same... components as the real website, meaning design and functionality-wise, it's a total match,"" the RiskIQ report noted. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated RiskIQ recommended that BA customers affected by the breach get a new debit or credit card from their bank. The firm pointed out that whoever was behind the attack had apparently decided to target specific brands and that more breaches of a similar nature were likely. ""There is a very clear emerging risk where the weakest link in payment processes is being actively targeted,"" cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont told the BBC. ""And that weakest link in the chain is often by placing older systems or third-party code into the payment chain."" Andrew Dwyer, a cyber-security researcher at the University of Oxford added that the attackers appeared to have gone to ""extraordinary lengths"" to tailor their code to the BA site. According to RiskIQ, they also acquired a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate - which suggests to web browsers, not always accurately, that a web page is safe to use. If this was indeed how the attack worked, he added, there are ways of preventing third-party code taking data from sensitive web pages. ""BA should have been able to see this,"" he told the BBC.

"Serena Williams lost to Naomi Osaka at the US Open at the weekend An Australian cartoonist has defended his depiction of Serena Williams at the US Open, after the image went viral and was criticised as racist and sexist. Mark Knight's newspaper cartoon showed Williams jumping above a broken racquet next to a baby's dummy. Critics said it used racist stereotypes. The cartoonist denied it was racist, saying he had intended to depict only the tennis player's ""poor behaviour"". Some also said Knight had ""whitewashed"" Japanese player Naomi Osaka. Williams sparked controversy during her loss to Osaka, whose father is Haitian and mother Japanese, when she accused the umpire of sexism and being a ""thief"". Knight's drawing was published in Australia's most-read newspaper, the Herald Sun on Monday, and referenced Williams's outburst and showed the umpire asking Osaka: ""Can you just let her win?"" Serena Williams and 'angry black women' It has been strongly defended by Knight and the newspaper's editor, Damon Johnston, who denied the cartoon is racist or sexist. ""It rightly mocks poor behaviour by a tennis legend... Mark has the full support of everyone,""he said in a tweet,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Herald Sun editor later tweeted a copy of Wednesday's front page,external- which reprinted the cartoon along with a series of others, hitting out at the ""self-appointed sensors of Mark Knight"".

Others on social media pointed out that Osaka, who is mixed race, had been drawn as a white woman with blonde hair. The National Association of Black Journalists in the US denounced the cartoon as ""repugnant on many levels"". Rants, jeers and tears - 'most bizarre match'? 'Sexism doesn't excuse Williams' behaviour' ""[It] not only exudes racist, sexist caricatures of both women, but Williams' depiction is unnecessarily sambo-like,"" it said in a statement. The 1899 children's book, The Story of Little Black Sambo, featured derogatory racial depictions - such as characters with thick red lips. Knight said he had ""no knowledge of those cartoons or that period"", saying on Tuesday that ""the world has just gone crazy"". ""The cartoon was just about Serena on the day having a tantrum. That's basically it,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Knight also rejected a suggestion that he would not draw a similar image of a man. As evidence, he tweeted his recent cartoon of tennis player Nick Kyrgios. By 12:15 GMT on Tuesday, both his Twitter and Facebook accounts had been shut down. One sociology expert told the BBC that Knight had used ""a genre that has a long history of racist impact"". ""The author may not even realise their own framing of the world has been shaped by history of racism in Australia,"" said emeritus Prof Andrew Jakubowicz from the University of Technology, Sydney. He said there had been ""a tradition"" in many Australian cartoons to exaggerate physical characteristics of minority groups, including indigenous Australians, to ""trigger a reaction"" - such as humour. Knight was also accused of racism last month for a cartoon which showed faceless black figures fighting in a Melbourne subway, a reference to a debate about African-Australian street gangs.

"Kirstie Allsopp is best known for presenting Location, Location, Location on Channel 4 Kirstie Allsopp has left Twitter after facing a fierce backlash when she admitted she smashed her children's iPads over her gaming rules. Parents slammed the TV presenter online after sherevealed she broke her sons' deviceswhen they played games outside their permitted time. Criticism soon flooded onto social media, with many people calling her ""privileged"" and ""absurd"". Her Twitter account has since been deleted. It was not long before outraged parents took to social media to vent their fury at the Location, Location, Location presenter, who has two sons and two stepsons. Thousands of people have been commenting on it - the majority condemning her actions and the message it sends to children.

"The government should be ""hanging their heads in shame"" over its efforts to tackle illegal Gypsy and traveller sites, MPs have warned. Ministers are being urged to change their policy and ""make deliberate trespass a criminal offence"". Tory MP Mark Francois said this would give police ""a real deterrent power"" to move travellers from land they do not own or have permission to be on. A spokesman for the Gypsy, Roma and traveller community said criminalisation was ""unhelpful"". ""The government should focus on supporting local authorities to build more authorised sites and stopping places - and to allow Gypsies and travellers who want sites on their own land equitable access to the planning system,"" said Jim Davies from The Traveller Movement. Mr Davies told the BBC thatrecent research conducted by the charity,externalrevealed that 91% of the traveller community ""experienced discrimination"". He called on the government to promote equality. ""Criminalising stopping is unhelpful and will only aggravate issues experienced by gypsies, Roma and Irish Travellers whilst ensuring even poorer relations with the rest of society,"" he said. Police chief on 'anger' over travellers Ditch dug to stop travellers returning MP's bid to curb illegal traveller sites Leading the debate on Gypsies and travellers in the Commons on Monday, former Tory minister Andrew Selous said the ""time for endless, constant reviews is over"". The government is currently preparing its formal response to a consultation on the law around unauthorised caravan sites and developments. But Mr Selous said people who were seeing ""atrocious living conditions in their areas, which often become ungoverned space where modern slavery and other crime flourishes, want action now"". My name is Debbie Saunders. I am a Romany Gypsy. I have lived in a trailer (caravan) all my life. My family and myself have travelled through England for many years, but now, sadly, it seems the people who run our government and the people I call my countrymen want this stopped. The doors of England are open to every culture, every colour and every creed - that is, unless you are a Gypsy or traveller, then you are not welcome. I'm faced with hatred and racism every day of my life - and then I get told it's not racist because Gypsies aren't a race. Should I be looked at with mistrust because of what I am? Should my children have to accept it as well? Why should I have to change my life, my culture, my heritage to conform with the ideals of the non-travellers? The Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire said there had been 116 unauthorised traveller camps in Central Bedfordshire last year. Clear-up costs were around Â£350,000, he said, with 250 tonnes of litter cleared from one encampment. He said current policy was failing both traveller and settled communities. A school sports day had to be cancelled after a number of Romany Gypsies parked on a field at Milton Keynes Rugby Club earlier this year ""The whole situation is a complete disgrace in the United Kingdom in 2018, and government ministers and officials responsible for this policy area should be hanging their heads in shame,"" Mr Selous added. The government said the majority of the traveller community were law-abiding. Mr Selous and Mr Francois were among those arguing for the government to emulate Ireland, which in 2002 made deliberate trespass a criminal offence. The knock-on effect of this change has been that more travellers have arrived in England from Ireland, as ""we are regarded as something of a soft touch"", Mr Francois added. A change in the law would give police greater power to move travellers on. ""If they did not do so, they could be arrested, and their vehicles could be impounded - which, believe you me, would be a very powerful deterrent to the travelling community."" In response, communities minister Kit Malthouse told MPs the communities secretary had recently met the Irish government to discuss their approach.

"This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Hurricane Florence - the most powerful storm to threaten the Carolinas in nearly three decades - is expected to strengthen, say forecasters. Officials warn there is a chance of ""life-threatening inundation from rising water"" over the next 48 hours as Florence heads for the US East Coast. With sustained winds of about 140mph (225km/h), the weather system is currently a category four storm. It could make landfall on Friday, near Wilmington, North Carolina. Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC, and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. New El NiÃ±o event likely this winter Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms ""This storm is a monster,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference on Tuesday. ""It's big and it's vicious. ""It is an extremely dangerous, life-threatening, historic hurricane."" Hurricane Florence was 670 miles (1,078km) south-east of Cape Fear, in North Carolina, as of 23:00 Atlantic Standard Time on Tuesday (03:00 GMT Wednesday),according to the latest National Hurricane Center update,external. The update says Florence - which is moving north-west at about 17mph (28km/h) - is expected to strengthen on Tuesday night and on Wednesday. ""While some weakening is expected on Thursday, Florence is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through landfall,"" it says. Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday. The National Weather Service predicts potential storm surges of up to 13ft (4m) on the coasts along with dangerously large swells and rip currents. Hurricane-force winds will extend outward up to 60 miles from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds up to 175 miles. Evacuees seek shelter at a school Wilmington, North Carolina Rainfall could be up to 25in (64cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. He said Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (Â£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. It is also likely to affect the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in Southport, North Carolina, which is just a few miles from where Florence is expected to make landfall. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster initially ordered the entire coastline of his state to leave. However, the order was later confined to the northern coast. This video can not be played Hurricane Florence gathers strength as it moves closer to US Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. John Johnson, a hardware store manager in Charleston, South Carolina, told AFP news agency there had been a ""nonstop"" rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags. Some petrol stations were running dry as customers filled up. Curtis Oil, a fuel distributor in Chesterfield, South Carolina, said it had been ""overwhelmed with requests by state agencies and everybody else"". US President Donald Trump has signed declarations of emergency for both North Carolina and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and resources for the storm response. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the government would spare ""no expense"" in responding to Hurricane Florence, adding the storm was ""tremendously big and tremendously wet"". Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path Mr Trump also spoke of the US response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as ""one of the best jobs that has ever been done"", describing it as an ""incredible, unsung success"". The description is in stark contrast to the assessment of Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, who describedMr Trump's response to the disaster as a ""stain on his presidency""after officials revised the death toll last month. The toll now stands at an estimated 2,975 people- nearly 50 times the earlier figure of 64. That number includes those who were killed directly by Hurricane Maria, as well as those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. The US government has a National Flood Insurance Programme (NFIP) that helps pay for flood coverage in high-risk zones across the country. The programme, which is billions of dollars in debt, has been up for renewal several times - Congress' next deadline to re-authorise the NFIP is 30 November. While some wind damage may be covered by regular homeowners' insurance, flooding is a different story. This video can not be played Hurricane Florence seen from space In the US, flood protection policies from private providers are often very expensive, largely because it is difficult to assess a home's flood risk. These policies also take 30 days to kick in, meaning any homeowners without coverage in the Carolinas now will not be able to insure their property before Florence hits. According to the Insurance Information Institute,14% of Americans living in the southern states had flood insurance as of 2016,external. No. On the opposite side of the country, officials in Hawaii are warning residents and tourists to brace for the arrival of Tropical Storm Olivia. Forecasters say Olivia - with current wind speeds of 65mph - will make landfall on Wednesday morning. Schools and state parks have closed. Ten to 15in (25 to 38 cm) of rain is forecast for Big Island. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"Mark Carney will remain Bank of England governor until the end of January 2020, Chancellor Philip Hammond has told MPs. Mr Hammond said the seven-month extension would ""support a smooth exit"" from the European Union. The extension was agreed in anexchange of letters,externalbetween the governor and the chancellor published on Wednesday. Mr Carney said he was ""willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England"". It is the second extension of his tenure as governor. When Mr Carney took over from Mervyn King in 2013, he agreed a five-year term with the option of a further three. The typical term for the position has been eight years. In October 2016, Mr Carney said he would staying on for an extra year, until June 2019, after his initial five-year term ended in 2018. The 'rock star' central banker Carney's 'toughest day' as Bank governor Mr Hammond told the Commons that the early part of summer 2019 ""could be quite a turbulent period for our economy"" following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU on 29 March. Mr Carney had agreed ""despite various personal pressures"" to stay on until January 2020 to ""help support continuity in our economy during this period"", the chancellor said. The extension will give the government more time to recruit his successor, amid concern that few candidates would want to take on the role during an unpredictable stage in the Brexit process. Sir Jon Cunliffe, Bank of England deputy governor with responsibility for financial stability, has also been re-appointed for a second five-year term that will last until October 2023. Bradley Fried, chair of the Bank's Court of Directors, welcomed their decisions to stay on: ""Continuity in the outstanding leadership they provide will help the Bank succeed in our crucial work."" Nicky Morgan, chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, said the announcement provided ""much-needed stability and clarity"". ""The government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning. It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury Committee to scrutinise the appointment,"" she added. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move. ""I have a good working relationship with Mark Carney. We meet on a regular basis and I have a lot of confidence in him, so I'm pleased this will give us a bit of stability."" Mr Carney is married to economist Diana Fox The Canadian was the first non-Briton to be appointed governor in the Bank's 300-year history and had previously run the Bank of Canada for five and a half years from February 2008. In March 2008, just a month after his appointment, Mr Carney cut Canadian interest rates amid the financial crisis. That move, along with other measures, was considered to have boosted investor confidence, enabling Canada to recover more quickly than some other countries. He had a commercial banking background, as well as experience in the public sector - unlike his two most recent predecessors who had spent their careers within the Bank of England and academia. Mr Carney worked for investment banking giant Goldman Sachs in New York before returning home to work for Canada's Department of Finance. Born in March 1965 in Fort Smith in Canada's Northwest Territories, he graduated from Harvard University in 1988 and then earned a doctorate in economics at Oxford University in 1995. That year he married economist Diana Fox, whom he met at Oxford, and the couple now have four children.

"The Grease star became a cancer campaigner after her initial diagnosis in 1992 Singer and actress Olivia Newton-John has opened up about a third diagnosis for cancer, saying she believed she would ""win over it"". The Grease star, 69, told Australian TV show Sunday Night she was now using medicinal marijuana and other natural remedies. Newton-John survived her initial breast cancer diagnosis in 1992 but revealed that it had returned in 2013. A third diagnosis, of a tumour in the lower back, was made last year. Olivia Newton-John's cancer returns Cancer patient unveils 'topless' statue Doctor turns superhero for final treatment The new diagnosis is stage 4 breast cancer that has metastasized to the spine. In the emotional interview on Sunday Night, she said: ""I'm one of millions in this fight. I shouldn't say fight... in this journey. ""A lot of people see it as a fight, and wherever you choose to see it, that's your prerogative. I see it as part of my mission."" She said the natural treatments were ""doing really well"", although radiation therapy was also involved. ""I believe I will win over it and that's my goal."" Newton-John called on Australia to adopt the laws of the US state where she lives, California, and allow the medicinal use of marijuana. ""My dream is that, in Australia soon, it will be available to all the cancer patients and people going through cancer that causes pain,"" she said. The four-time Grammy award winner admitted to moments of despair but said she had ""an incredible career"" and ""nothing to complain about"".

"Debenhams' chairman has said the firm was forced to rush out an early trading statement on Monday to stop ""nosy neighbours"" gossiping about its future. Sir Ian Cheshire said speculation about the department store chain had become ""a circus"" and it wanted investors to know that trading had not collapsed. ""We're not insolvent,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. But he said the retailer was looking at ""every option in the longer term"" to turn around its performance. ""The only analogy I can have to it is like having a bunch of nosy neighbours watching your house. ""Somebody sees somebody in a suit going into a room. The second person concludes it's a doctor, the third person concludes it's an undertaker and by the time it gets to the end of the day you've got cause of death and everyone's looking forward to the funeral,"" he said. Debenhams seeks to reassure investors Debenhams calls in advisers from KPMG Debenhams' shares plunged 17% on Monday, eventually closing 10% lower,  after the company confirmed at the weekend that it had appointed consultancy firm KPMG to help improve its fortunes. In its trading statement,the retailer said that annual profits would be below June's downgraded forecast, but in line with current market forecasts. Sir Ian said that speculation it was actively driving an insolvency process aimed at reducing store rents with landlords and cutting stores, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), was ""simply not true"". ""If that's the right thing for the company and our broader stakeholders then obviously that's an option but the implication was we were about to do it and that... trading had somehow collapsed,"" he added. He noted when he joined the board two years ago, it had successfully followed that process in Ireland and had ""made a loss-making business into a profitable one and saved thousands of jobs"". Sir Ian also confirmed the company planned to close stores and said it was ""working out way through what was an appropriate mix"". He said the main issue for these plans was the ""flexibility of store leases"". Last year, Debenhams said that 10 of its 165 UK stores might have to close over the next five years. Since then two of those stores have closed - Farnborough and Eltham in south-east London - with eight remaining stores still under review. Debenhams is the UK's biggest seller of make-up, says Sir Ian Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Sir Ian Cheshire's job this morning was to reassure the market - and Debenhams' customers - that the department store chain was not going to be the latest casualty of the retail wars. He did that, up to a point. The retailer was not, he said, actively considering a company voluntary arrangement, the controversial restructuring process that allows companies to slough off legacy costs and emerge fitter and leaner. He did not rule it out, however, and hinted that much depended on negotiations with landlords. If they were not more ""flexible"" - code for agreeing to reductions in rents, or breaks to leases where stores are losing money - then all options were still on the table. Investors would have hoped that Sir Ian's comments would have helped shore up the share price, down by more than 90% since the company floated on the stock market in 2006. It listed then at 195p, and the stock sunk to close at 11.5p yesterday. In early trading they crept forward to a smidgen under 12p. The rot has been stopped for the moment, but the market's clear verdict is that there is a risk that Debenhams's shares might in the end turn out to be worthless. It is a race against time. If Sir Ian and his board can shrink the estate, renegotiate leases and sell assets faster than trading declines, then they might prove the doubters wrong. The retailer is in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales. Debenhams has issuedthree profit warnings this year, and has lost two-thirds of its share price value since January. As part of its cost cutting plans, Debenhams said in August that 80 to 90 jobs at its headquarters would be shed. That followed an announcement in February that it was planning to cut 320 store management jobs. The business is also looking at raising cash by selling off its Scandinavian department store chain Magasin du Nord for as much as Â£200m. Many of Debenhams' rivals are also struggling, with House of Fraser entering administration and Marks and Spencer saying it intends to close 100 shops. Sir Ian said the entire retail sector faced a ""structural shift"" as more shoppers went online, but he denied the department store format was ""dead"". People still enjoyed the social aspect of shopping, he said, adding that there was scope for what he called ""a 21st century department store"" based on a mix of online and offline shopping.

"The data breach affected 380,000 transactions by BA customers A cyber-security firm has said it found malicious code injected into the British Airways website, which could be the cause ofa recent data breach that affected 380,000 transactions. A RiskIQ researcher analysed code from BA's website and app around the time when the breach began, in late August. He claimed to have discovered evidence of a ""skimming"" script designed to steal financial data from online payment forms. BA said it was unable to comment. A very similar attack, by a group dubbed Magecart, affected the Ticketmaster website recently, which RiskIQ said it also analysed in depth. The company said the code found on the BA site was very similar, but appeared to have been modified to suit the way the airline's site had been designed. Video: British Airways boss promises compensation British Airways hit by 'malicious' data breach ""This particular skimmer is very much attuned to how British Airway's payment page is set up, which tells us that the attackers carefully considered how to target this site instead of blindly injecting the regular Magecart skimmer,"" the researcher wrotein a report on the findings,external. ""The infrastructure used in this attack was set up with British Airways in mind and purposely targeted scripts that would blend in with normal payment processing to avoid detection."" Hacks like this make use of an increasingly common phenomenon, in which large websites embed multiple pieces of code from other sources or third-party suppliers. Such code may be needed to do specific jobs, such as authorise a payment or present ads to the user. But malicious code can be slipped in instead - this is known as a supply chain attack. In BA's case, hackers stole names, email addresses and credit card details - including the long number, expiry date and the three-digit CVV security code. ""As this is a criminal investigation, we are unable to comment on speculation,"" said BA in a statement. A spokesman for the UK's National Crime Agency said it was aware of the RiskIQ report but would not be commenting at this time. RiskIQ said the malicious script consisted of just 22 lines of code. It worked by grabbing data from BA's online payment form and then sending it to the hackers' server once a customer hit the ""submit"" button. The cyber-security firm added that the attackers had apparently been able to gather data from mobile app users as well because the same script was found loaded into the app on a page describing government taxes and carrier charges. ""The page [in the app] is built with the same... components as the real website, meaning design and functionality-wise, it's a total match,"" the RiskIQ report noted. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated RiskIQ recommended that BA customers affected by the breach get a new debit or credit card from their bank. The firm pointed out that whoever was behind the attack had apparently decided to target specific brands and that more breaches of a similar nature were likely. ""There is a very clear emerging risk where the weakest link in payment processes is being actively targeted,"" cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont told the BBC. ""And that weakest link in the chain is often by placing older systems or third-party code into the payment chain."" Andrew Dwyer, a cyber-security researcher at the University of Oxford added that the attackers appeared to have gone to ""extraordinary lengths"" to tailor their code to the BA site. According to RiskIQ, they also acquired a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate - which suggests to web browsers, not always accurately, that a web page is safe to use. If this was indeed how the attack worked, he added, there are ways of preventing third-party code taking data from sensitive web pages. ""BA should have been able to see this,"" he told the BBC.

"The government should be ""hanging their heads in shame"" over its efforts to tackle illegal Gypsy and traveller sites, MPs have warned. Ministers are being urged to change their policy and ""make deliberate trespass a criminal offence"". Tory MP Mark Francois said this would give police ""a real deterrent power"" to move travellers from land they do not own or have permission to be on. A spokesman for the Gypsy, Roma and traveller community said criminalisation was ""unhelpful"". ""The government should focus on supporting local authorities to build more authorised sites and stopping places - and to allow Gypsies and travellers who want sites on their own land equitable access to the planning system,"" said Jim Davies from The Traveller Movement. Mr Davies told the BBC thatrecent research conducted by the charity,externalrevealed that 91% of the traveller community ""experienced discrimination"". He called on the government to promote equality. ""Criminalising stopping is unhelpful and will only aggravate issues experienced by gypsies, Roma and Irish Travellers whilst ensuring even poorer relations with the rest of society,"" he said. Police chief on 'anger' over travellers Ditch dug to stop travellers returning MP's bid to curb illegal traveller sites Leading the debate on Gypsies and travellers in the Commons on Monday, former Tory minister Andrew Selous said the ""time for endless, constant reviews is over"". The government is currently preparing its formal response to a consultation on the law around unauthorised caravan sites and developments. But Mr Selous said people who were seeing ""atrocious living conditions in their areas, which often become ungoverned space where modern slavery and other crime flourishes, want action now"". My name is Debbie Saunders. I am a Romany Gypsy. I have lived in a trailer (caravan) all my life. My family and myself have travelled through England for many years, but now, sadly, it seems the people who run our government and the people I call my countrymen want this stopped. The doors of England are open to every culture, every colour and every creed - that is, unless you are a Gypsy or traveller, then you are not welcome. I'm faced with hatred and racism every day of my life - and then I get told it's not racist because Gypsies aren't a race. Should I be looked at with mistrust because of what I am? Should my children have to accept it as well? Why should I have to change my life, my culture, my heritage to conform with the ideals of the non-travellers? The Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire said there had been 116 unauthorised traveller camps in Central Bedfordshire last year. Clear-up costs were around Â£350,000, he said, with 250 tonnes of litter cleared from one encampment. He said current policy was failing both traveller and settled communities. A school sports day had to be cancelled after a number of Romany Gypsies parked on a field at Milton Keynes Rugby Club earlier this year ""The whole situation is a complete disgrace in the United Kingdom in 2018, and government ministers and officials responsible for this policy area should be hanging their heads in shame,"" Mr Selous added. The government said the majority of the traveller community were law-abiding. Mr Selous and Mr Francois were among those arguing for the government to emulate Ireland, which in 2002 made deliberate trespass a criminal offence. The knock-on effect of this change has been that more travellers have arrived in England from Ireland, as ""we are regarded as something of a soft touch"", Mr Francois added. A change in the law would give police greater power to move travellers on. ""If they did not do so, they could be arrested, and their vehicles could be impounded - which, believe you me, would be a very powerful deterrent to the travelling community."" In response, communities minister Kit Malthouse told MPs the communities secretary had recently met the Irish government to discuss their approach.

"Labour would extend workers' rights and ""restore the balance of power in the workplace"", shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. He promised more rights for people working in the so-called gig economy. In a speech to the Trades Union Congress in Manchester, Mr McDonnell said a ""new workplace environment"" would boost productivity. The Tories said unemployment was at an all-time low with millions of low-paid workers given a pay rise. In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the ""gigs"" they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. A government report publishedin February found about 2.8 million people,externalhad worked in in the gig economy in the previous year, most commonly 18-34 year olds in the London area. Supporters say many workers like the flexible hours and short-term contracts on offer but Mr McDonnell said they have contributed to ""a workplace environment of insecurity not seen since the 1930s"". Under a future Labour government, he said workers in the gig economy could be given similar rights to those in permanent work, including eligibility for sick pay, maternity pay and similar benefits. What is the 'gig' economy? 'Gig' economy all right for some Unions call for four-day working week His other proposals include allowing collective bargaining across different sectors of the economy and introducing employee ownership funds - under which staff at larger companies would be given shares in order to give them a stake in the profits and management of firms. ""Our programme of workplace reform will restore the balance between employer and worker and it will do so by installing basic trade union rights in law again, modernising corporate governance structures and extending the opportunity for employees to share collectively in the benefits of ownership of their company,"" he said. A Labour government would ban zero hours contracts and introduce a ""real living wage"" of Â£10 an hour, as well as scrapping ""anti-trade union"" laws, he told the TUC. Mr McDonnell, who received a standing ovation from trade unionists at the end of his speech, did not rule out backing a second EU referendum - as the TUC says it wants - but said his preferred option was a general election. In a wide-ranging speech, he said he believed a general election ""could come at any time"" and Labour was working on detailed economic planning and policies for its first Queen's Speech. A Labour government would set up a new department for employment to ""transform"" the workplace, putting the ""principles of trade unionism right at the heart of it,"" he promised. He also pledged to join railway workers on the picket line if they launch winter strikes. Earlier, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, Mr McDonnell said there was a huge group of people who were doing multiple jobs and still only ""just about surviving"" because of low wages. He dismissed claims that extending union rights and employee ownership could destroy jobs - arguing they were needed to stop exploitation and create a civilised society. ""If we want people treated fairly at work, we should have equal rights and from day one,"" he said. Wage growth accelerates TUC issues EU referendum warning to May The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the Labour leadership believe the sort of radical polices being outlined would appeal to a much wider swathe of voters ahead of a general election which they believe could be only months away in the event of a disorderly Brexit. But Chancellor Philip Hammond hit back, saying: ""This is Labour's record on workers - the last Labour government left over half a million more people out of work, and every Labour government leaving office with unemployment higher than when it started."" The Institute of Directors, said employee ownership already existed as a business model, with tax incentives on offer to firms to encourage greater worker participation. ""Labour's proposal seems to cross the line between encouragement and coercion,"" the business group said. ""Different company structures have different pros and cons, and directors are best placed to decide what is in their organisation's best long-term interests.""

"This video can not be played Bolton: ""The ICC is dead to us"" The US has threatened sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) if it goes ahead with prosecutions against Americans. The court is currently considering prosecuting US servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan. National Security Adviser John Bolton called the court ""illegitimate"" and vowed the US would do everything ""to protect our citizens"". The US is among dozens of nations not to have joined the court. The court investigates and brings to justice people responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002, and has been ratified by 123 countries, including the UK. However several countries, including China, India, and Russia, have refused to join. Some African countries have called for withdrawal from the courtover perceived unfair treatment of Africans. The US has been critical of the ICC since it was established - and Mr Bolton has been particularly vocal in his opposition to the court. In his speech on Monday in Washington, Mr Bolton attacked two areas of the court's work. Why is the ICC controversial? 'I want justice for my mother' The first was ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's request last year for a full investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan, which would include any committed by US military and intelligence officials. A 2016 report from the ICC said there was a reasonable basis to believe the US military had committed torture,externalat secret detention sites in Afghanistan operated by the CIA, and that the Afghan government and the Taliban had committed war crimes. US personnel in Afghanistan could be subjected to ICC investigations Mr Bolton said neither Afghanistan nor any government signatory to the ICC's statute had requested an investigation. However, ICC prosecutors also have the ability to take independent action, although any prosecutions must be approved by a panel of judges. The second area Mr Bolton addressed was the Palestinian move to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in Gaza and the occupied West Bank - a move dismissed by Israel as politicised. Mr Bolton said the Palestinian move was one of the reasonsthe US administration had decided to close the Palestinians' diplomatic mission in Washington. In his tirade against the court, Mr Bolton said it: Was a threat to ""American sovereignty and US national security"" Lacked checks and balances, claimed ""jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions"" and failed to ""deter and punish atrocity crimes"" Was ""superfluous"" as the US administration did ""not recognise any higher authority than the US Constitution"" Mr Bolton said: ""We will not co-operate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us."" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders backed Mr Bolton, saying President Donald Trump would use ""any means necessary to protect our citizens [and] those of our allies from unjust prosecution from the ICC"". The court in The Hague was founded in 2002 by a treaty known as the Rome Statute ICC judges and prosecutors would be barred from entering the US and their funds in the US would be targeted. ""We will prosecute them in the US criminal system. We will do the same for any company or state that assists an ICC investigation of Americans,"" Mr Bolton said. More ""binding, bilateral agreements"" would be signed to stop countries submitting US citizens to the court's jurisdiction. The ICC has pledged to ""continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with... the overarching idea of the rule of law"". ""The ICC, as a judicial institution, acts strictly within the legal framework of the Rome Statute and is committed to the independent and impartial exercise of its mandate,"" it said in a statement, referring to the treaty that established the ICC. Liz Evenson, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, told AFP news agency that Mr Bolton had shown ""callous disregard for victims of atrocity crimes"" and that the US was ""more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers... than supporting impartial justice"". The US has had a varied history with the ICC. The US signed a treaty to establish the ICC in 2000,external, under President Bill Clinton's administration. The US said it strongly supported ""international accountability"" but believed the treaty, known as the Rome Statute, had ""significant flaws"" that still needed addressing. However, the US never ratified the treaty. Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and George W Bush all took different approaches to the ICC In 2002, shortly before the court was formally established, President George W Bush's administration told the UN that the US would not join the ICC. President Barack Obama took a more positive approach to the ICC. He sought to develop co-operation with the ICC and sent observers to the court, although his administration also opted not to ratify the Rome Statute. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter As a diplomat, John Bolton was famously bellicose: he once said if the UN building in New York ""lost 10 storeys, it wouldn't make a bit of difference"". And he's made clear how he stands on carrot-and-stick diplomacy, saying: ""I don't do carrots."" As national security adviser, he's been more aggressive than the president at times - and has been reined in. On Monday, though, Mr Bolton made his first major address as national security adviser and showed he's in sync with the president. In threatening to take sanctions against ICC judges, he is helping to reinforce the president's ""America First"" policy.

"England is facing changing health demands due to an ageing population and the NHS must quickly adapt, says Public Health England. It has compiled what it calls ""the most comprehensive picture"" of the nation's current health and future fitness. It shows England's population is growing in size and people are living longer but not all in good health. While smoking rates may be decreasing, diabetes, obesity, dementia and mental health issues are on the rise. The Health Profile for England report shows average life expectancy has reached 79.6 years for men and 83.2 for women. In 2017, there were 1.35 million people aged 85 and over in England - nearly three times more than in 1971. By 2031, it could exceed two million, says Public Health England. But the number of years that people live in poor health is also going up. Latest data suggests people can expect to live about 63 years in good health. That means men face about 16 years of ill health - a fifth of their life - and women more than 19 years or nearly a quarter of their life in poor health. Age-related diseases, such as dementia, have been increasing. Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is already the leading cause of death in women and it looks set to overtake heart disease to soon become the biggest killer of men too. Hearing loss, sight loss and muscle and joint problems have also gone up. But heart attacks and strokes have gone down, as blood pressure and cholesterol levels have improved. Obesity and smoking are the two leading risk factors for ill health. While smoking rates have been going down, rates of obesity have been going up. In 2016, one in four adults was obese - and Public Health England expects levels of adult obesity may continue to rise. The number of people with diabetes is also rising and is expected to increase by a million to reach almost five million in 2035. Poor mental health is also taking a significant toll. In young people, mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, along with substance use, now account for a third of all ill health. Inequalities in the health of the population also persist. People in the richest areas of England enjoy more than 19 years more good health than those in the poorest. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, said: ""The challenge now is for the NHS to respond to this changing landscape and to focus on preventing as well as treating the conditions which are causing the greatest disease burden across our nation. ""In many ways it needs to respond more quickly than any time in its history because the speed of the change in these data, in the epidemiology, is really quite remarkable."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""As this report shows, there are a number of reasons why some people are more likely to develop these conditions than others, including genetic predisposition and socio-economic factors - but there remains a clear connection between the quality of our patients' lifestyle and their overall health. ""It's so encouraging to see that smoking prevalence has dropped to just 15% over the last seven years, for example, but the chances of people developing illnesses like diabetes is still worryingly high and frequently is the result of poor diet and lack of exercise as well as genetic factors."" She called for more investment to help the NHS deliver the care patients needed and deserved.

"Rose replaces American Dustin Johnson as world number one BMW Championship final-round leaderboard -20J Rose (Eng), K Bradley* (US);-19B Horschel (US), X Schauffele (US);-18R McIlroy (NI);-17T Woods (US), W Simpson (US);-16T Fleetwood (Eng), F Molinari (Ita), T Finau (US), R Fowler (US) Selected others:-11D Johnson (US), J Day (Aus);-4I Poulter (Eng);-3J Spieth (US) Full leaderboard England's Justin Rose has become world number one for the first time after finishing in second place at the BMW Championship in Philadelphia. The 38-year-old climbs from fourth and replaces Dustin Johnson after losing a play-off to American Keegan Bradley. Rose, reigning Olympic champion and 2013 US Open winner, could have sealed victory with a par putt at the last regulation hole but missed narrowly. ""It's boyhood dream stuff, something I am incredibly proud of,"" Rose said. ""It's been a good stretch of golf. I've played solidly over the past year. I'm delighted to get to the top,"" he told Sky Sports. On his putt at the last to win, he said: ""I thought it was as good a putt as I've hit to win a tournament. To see it spin out was really unfortunate. I'd always envisaged getting to number one by winning tournaments. ""Last week's second was a good-feeling second and this one is a stinging-feeling second, but I know there is a bit of good news."" Can you name all 22 world number ones? Finau named as final US wildcard Rose, who last week finished two shots back as Bryson DeChambeau won the Dell Technologies Championship, is just the fourth Englishman to top the world rankings, after Sir Nick Faldo, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald. He and Bradley finished on 20 under par after a rain-delayed final round and the 2011 US PGA champion required just one extra hole to seal victory. Rose bogeyed the par-four 18th to hand the 32-year-old American his fourth PGA Tour win. The final round had been scheduled for Sunday but was postponed until Monday after persistent rain made the Aronimink course unplayable. Bradley began the day three shots behind Rose but moved up the leaderboard with a six-under-par 64 as Rose shot a 67. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who trailed then-leader Rose by one shot after round three, finished fifth following a 68. American 14-time major winner Tiger Woods closed with a 65, moving up to a share of sixth, one shot behind McIlroy. England's Tommy Fleetwood only managed a 69 as he fell down the leaderboard to eighth from joint third.

"Time for a sequel to this summer's blockbuster summit? North Korea's Kim Jong-un has written to US President Donald Trump asking for a follow-up to their historic summit, the White House says. The US says it is already looking at scheduling a new meeting. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the ""very warm"" letter showed Pyongyang's ""continued commitment to focus on denuclearisation"". Negotiations on the topic appeared to have stalled after the two leaders' historic summit in Singapore in June. ""The primary purpose of the letter was to request and look to schedule another meeting with the president, which we are open to and are already in the process of co-ordinating that,"" Ms Sanders said. She gave no indication of when a second meeting between the two leaders could potentially take place. North Korea's dazzling propaganda show Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade 'I marched in a North Korean parade' This video can not be played The anniversary parade showed off North Korea's military strength South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed the news, saying that ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is an issue that should fundamentally be resolved between the US and North Korea through negotiation"", Mr Moon had been crucial in brokering the Singapore summit in June and is himself scheduled to meet with Mr Kim in Pyongyang next week for a third round of face-to-face talks. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says Mr Moon sees himself as a mediator between the two sides and has called on them both to make bold steps. Pyongyang's letter comes a day after Yukiya Amano, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, warned that North Korea's ongoing nuclear activities violated UN Security Council resolutions. International inspectors are banned from North Korea, but Mr Amano said they were ready to return if a political agreement could be reached. Ms Sanders also praised North Korea's military parade last weekend, saying that it ""for once was not about their nuclear arsenal"". She attributed that to the ""tremendous success"" of Mr Trump's policies. While North Korea did roll out soldiers, tanks and other weaponry, the parade did not display any intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at the parade marking its 70th anniversary, reports say. A display of ICBMs - which can reach the US mainland, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead - would have been seen as provocative. Thousands of troops marched in the parade Mr Trump himself thanked the North Korean leader via Twitter, saying the parade was ""a big and very positive statement from North Korea"". ""Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will both prove everyone wrong!"" Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? Why did Trump mention N Korea's beaches? Trump Kim summit: Win-win or a Kim win? At their June summit in Singapore, the two leaders signed an agreement to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But it did not include a timeline, details or any mechanisms to verify the process. High-level talks and visits have continued, but the most recent scheduled trip by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was called off at the last minute. Both sides have also blamed each other for stalling negotiations while insisting that they were committed to the process.

"Michel Barnier has said a Brexit deal is possible within six to eight weeks. The EU's chief negotiator said if both sides are ""realistic"" there could be an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by early November. His comments come amid unconfirmed reports a one-off summit of EU leaders could be convened in the middle of November to sign off the agreement. The BBC's Katya Adler said Mr Barnier's tone may have changed but the substance of his arguments was still the same. While the EU was not about to compromise its Brexit principles, our Europe editor said the bloc was aware of Mrs May's domestic political troubles and ""planned to throw her as much of a lifeline as possible"". Mrs May has been warned she faces a mass Tory rebellion if she persists with her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU, with former Brexit minister Steve Baker claiming as many as 80 Tories could oppose it in a Commons vote later this year. Brexit: All you need to know The Chequers plan explained Laura Kuenssberg: Keep calm and carry on Labour, unions and the Brexit vote issue Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles The UK and EU are hoping to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation in time for an EU summit in mid-October or by the end of the month at the latest. Mr Barnier has said this is vital if the UK and EU Parliaments are to have enough time to consider and vote on the proposals before the UK's scheduled departure on 29 March 2019. But some senior Tory Brexiteers are continuing to urge the PM to change course, saying proposals agreed by her cabinet in July - which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods - will not be backed by Parliament. Mr Baker said the party risked a ""catastrophic split"" if the PM didn't rethink her approach, which he suggested many MPs - including some who backed Remain - thought was worse than staying in the EU as it would leave the UK without any say in its rules. This video can not be played What Labour's Stephen Kinnock claimed Mr Barnier told him about Chequers A key argument that has been made by MPs opposed to the Chequers deal in recent weeks is that the EU will not accept it, since it seeks different levels of market access and obligations for goods and services. After meeting Mr Barnier last week, Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Frenchman's views were closer to his than those of the prime minister while Labour MP Stephen Kinnock claimed he told him and other MPs that, referring to the Chequers plan, ""les propositions sont mortes"" (the proposals are dead). But asked about this at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia, Mr Barnier said this was not true. ""I never said that, I don't think that. It is not my feeling."" He described the Chequers plan as a ""very important"" document and suggested the EU was now ""benchmarking"" it against the mandate it had been given by the EU's 27 other members. ""It is useful because it clearly defines what the wishes are for the UK for future relations."" This video can not be played Steve Baker: We are not trying to topple the prime minister Mr Barnier said there were ""many, many points of convergence"" between the two sides, particularly over defence and security and a deal on the terms of withdrawal could be settled within six to eight weeks. But he warned that the UK's core proposals for trading relations after it leaves were a direct challenge to the founding principles of the EU and the integrity of the single market. ""It is not possible to get freedom for goods without freedom for services, in particular for the movement of people,"" he said. The BBC's Katya Adler said there was a suggestion EU leaders might be preparing to give Mr Barnier an updated negotiating mandate when they meet in Salzburg later this month, but that any changes were likely to be ""pretty cosmetic"" rather than a fundamental change in the EU's negotiating position. The talk in Brussels among senior EU officials is increasingly of a special Brexit summit in the week commencing 12 November, if as is widely expected, a deal cannot be struck in October. The Chequers agreement led to the resignations of then-Brexit Secretary David Davis and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom have continued to criticise the direction of government policy. Mr Johnson caused controversy over the weekendwith a column in the Mail on Sunday, calling the PM's plan a ""suicide vest"" around the UK, with the detonator in Brussels' hands. No 10 has said its plan was the ""only one on the table"" able to deliver on the will of British people while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. Asked when Brexiteers outside of the government would come up with a detailed alternative, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he and others would be putting forward a ""whole set of new ideas"" in the coming weeks but it was up to ministers to mould them into a plan that would be approved by Parliament.

"This video can not be played Russia prepares for its largest military exercise since the Cold War Russia has launched its biggest military exercise since the Cold War, involving about 300,000 service personnel, in eastern Siberia. China is sending 3,200 troops to take part in ""Vostok-2018"", with many Chinese armoured vehicles and aircraft. Mongolia is also sending some units. The last Russian exercise of similar scale was in 1981, during the Cold War, but Vostok-2018 involves more troops. The week-long manoeuvres come at a time of heightened Nato-Russia tensions. As the exercises began, Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a forum in the eastern city of Vladivostok and told him ""we have a trusting relationship in the sphere of politics, security and defence"". Relations between Russia and Nato - a 29-member defence alliance dominated by the US - have worsened since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. What is Nato? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the drills were justified given ""aggressive and unfriendly"" attitudes towards Russia. Tuesday and Wednesday will see planning and preparation while actual operations will start on Thursday and last five days, the head of the Russian general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, was quoted as saying. The Russian defence ministry says 36,000 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and armoured infantry vehicles will take part in Vostok-2018, from 11 to 17 September, along with more than 1,000 aircraft. Vostok is Russian for east. The exercise will be spread across five army training grounds, four airbases and areas in the Sea of Japan, Bering Straits and Sea of Okhotsk. Up to 80 naval vessels will take part, from two Russian fleets. The drills will not be near the disputed Kuril islands north of Japan, Russia says. The ministry's TV channel Zvezda says three brigades of Russian paratroops will play a key role, during drills at the Tsugol military range, near Russia's borders with China and Mongolia. A key aim is to practise the rapid deployment of thousands of troops, as well as aircraft and vehicles, from western Russia to eastern regions, across thousands of miles, TV Zvezda reports. That involves in-flight refuelling of fighter jets. The scale of Vostok-2018 is equivalent to the forces deployed in one of the big World War Two battles. A smaller-scale Russia-Belarus exercise was held last year. President Vladimir Putin has made military modernisation, including new nuclear missiles, a priority. Russia's armed forces are reckoned to have about one million personnel in total. A Russian senator and reserve colonel, Frants Klintsevich, said ""it suited the West that our units and headquarters lacked combat skills and co-ordination, but times have changed; now we have a different attitude to combat readiness"". Russia's military role in Syria grows Russia's new military - should Nato worry? Russia launches huge war games with Belarus The Chinese defence ministry spoke of deepening military co-operation and enhancing both sides' ability to jointly respond to ""various security threats"", without specifying those threats. Mongolia has not given details of its involvement. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says Islamist extremism in Central Asia is a major threat to Russian security. Chinese and Russian naval infantry trained together in Russia's far east last year China has imposed heavy security and censorship in the mainly Muslim Xinjiang region. Xinjiang has seen intermittent violence - followed by crackdowns - for years. China accuses Islamist militants and separatists of orchestrating the trouble. China denies holding one million Uighurs China's 'globalised' military power In recent yearsRussia and China have deepened military co-operationand during these drills they will have a joint field headquarters. Observers say the two sides have been building ties partly as an attempt to counter the US's international influence. They have also been boosting economic co-operation, with Chinese direct investment soaring by 72% in 2017, according to state news agency Xinhua. Xi Jinping has called Vladimir Putin his ""best, most intimate friend"" As Beijing has become embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with Washington this year, Russia has become an increasingly important trade partner and is now China's ninth largest. Russia is now China's biggest oil supplier and its largest energy company, Gazprom, is building a 3,000km (1,864mi) gas pipeline that will link eastern Siberia to the Chinese border. Mr Putin and Mr Xi are said to get along well too - in June, the Chinese leader called his Russian counterpart his ""best, most intimate friend"". It is a big contrast from the Cold War years, when China and what was then the USSR were rivals for global communist leadership and clashed on their far eastern border. Revival of Russia's 'Wild East' Spokesman Dylan White said Nato was briefed on Vostok-2018 in May and would monitor it. He said ""all nations have the right to exercise their armed forces, but it is essential that this is done in a transparent and predictable manner"". ""Vostok demonstrates Russia's focus on exercising large-scale conflict. It fits into a pattern we have seen over some time: a more assertive Russia, significantly increasing its defence budget and its military presence."" It has been increasing since Russia intervened in Ukraine in 2014, backing pro-Russian separatist rebels. Nato responded by deploying extra forces in eastern Europe, sending 4,000 troops to the Baltic region. Russia says the Nato build-up is unjustified and provocative. It says the Ukrainian revolution of 2013-2014 was a coup masterminded by the West. Russian diplomats were expelled from Nato countries after the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with a nerve agent in southern England in March. The UK blamed Russian military intelligence - the GRU - for the attack; Moscow denied involvement.

"Natalie Hunt now helps others through her art classes Poor mental health affects half of all employees, according to a survey of 44,000 people carried out by the mental health charity Mind. Only half of those who had experienced problems with stress, anxiety or low mood had talked to their employer about it. That's something that must change, says Mind. Fear, shame and job insecurity are some of the reasons people may choose to hide their worries. Natalie Hunt, 34, from Salford, got her first job at 18. That role was working in a department store, serving customers, but she found it extremely stressful. ""It was dealing with complaints and helping people with queries. I'd had anxiety and depression as a teenager and the full-time job made me really anxious. I began to get shy and withdrawn, going more and more into myself, and I was worried about having a panic attack at work. ""Colleagues started to notice and eventually my boss wanted a word."" Natalie says that at the time, her employer didn't really understand or know what to do. There was no support. She then left the workplace altogether and took up an art course at college. She now teaches art classes to people with mental health problems, and at a homeless shelter. She also works part-time in an office, even though sometimes she can go through stages of poor mental health. Natalie says it makes a huge difference when the workplace is supportive - they have flexible hours and regular catch-ups. ""I first started back in the workplace with a bit of voluntary work in a charity shop, which was great. Because it was voluntary and part-time, I didn't feel pressured and it helped me regain some confidence. That was when I was 20. ""Now I run my own art classes for people with mental health conditions. It's lovely to be making a difference."" Mind says around 300,000 people lose their job each year due to a mental health problem. The charity - along with The Royal Foundation, Heads Together and 11 other organisations - has created anonline resource,externalfor employers and employees with information, advice, resources and training that workplaces can use to improve wellbeing. Arecent poll by the Institute of Directorsfound less than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers. Poor relationships with line managers, along with workload, have the biggest negative impact on employees' mental health, the survey found - closely followed by poor relationships with colleagues.

"Forecasters say the hurricane will certainly hit the US coastline Evacuations have been ordered as the US East Coast braces for Hurricane Florence - in what may be the strongest storm to hit the region in decades. South Carolina's governor ordered the evacuation of its entire coastline while North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency. Officials say Florence is now a category four storm with 130mph (195km/h) winds, and gaining strength. It is expected to strike the Carolinas by Thursday. New El NiÃ±o event likely this winter Florence - which was 1,200 miles (2,000km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Monday morning - started the day as a category two storm. International Space Station astronaut Ricky Arnold took this photo of Florence on 6 September The weather system could reach category five as its draws strength from the warm Atlantic waters, say forecasters. It would be the first category four storm to hit the region since Hugo ravaged North Carolina in 1989, wreaking $7bn (Â£5.3bn) in damage and claiming 49 lives. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Florence has the makings of an ""extremely dangerous"" meteorological event. It may bring catastrophic levels of rain and flooding to coastal and inland regions. The NHC said: ""There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland, and damaging hurricane-force winds.""

North Carolina officials on Monday ordered residents to evacuate the state's Outer Banks barrier islands while the governor described the state as ""the bulls-eye"" of the storm. There have been long queues in supermarkets around communities near waterways and coastlines as residents clear shelves of water, batteries and plywood. South Carolina's state emergency management agency said on Sunday that it is ""preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster"". A government satellite image shows the storm's location on Sunday ""Pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore,"" said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.

Two other hurricanes are currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricanes Isaac and Helene are expected to accelerate, but at this point, are not expected to threaten the US mainland. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Hurricane Florence - the most powerful storm to threaten the Carolinas in nearly three decades - is expected to strengthen, say forecasters. Officials warn there is a chance of ""life-threatening inundation from rising water"" over the next 48 hours as Florence heads for the US East Coast. With sustained winds of about 140mph (225km/h), the weather system is currently a category four storm. It could make landfall on Friday, near Wilmington, North Carolina. Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC, and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. New El NiÃ±o event likely this winter Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms ""This storm is a monster,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference on Tuesday. ""It's big and it's vicious. ""It is an extremely dangerous, life-threatening, historic hurricane."" Hurricane Florence was 670 miles (1,078km) south-east of Cape Fear, in North Carolina, as of 23:00 Atlantic Standard Time on Tuesday (03:00 GMT Wednesday),according to the latest National Hurricane Center update,external. The update says Florence - which is moving north-west at about 17mph (28km/h) - is expected to strengthen on Tuesday night and on Wednesday. ""While some weakening is expected on Thursday, Florence is forecast to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through landfall,"" it says. Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday. The National Weather Service predicts potential storm surges of up to 13ft (4m) on the coasts along with dangerously large swells and rip currents. Hurricane-force winds will extend outward up to 60 miles from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds up to 175 miles. Evacuees seek shelter at a school Wilmington, North Carolina Rainfall could be up to 25in (64cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. He said Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (Â£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. It is also likely to affect the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in Southport, North Carolina, which is just a few miles from where Florence is expected to make landfall. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster initially ordered the entire coastline of his state to leave. However, the order was later confined to the northern coast. This video can not be played Hurricane Florence gathers strength as it moves closer to US Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. John Johnson, a hardware store manager in Charleston, South Carolina, told AFP news agency there had been a ""nonstop"" rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags. Some petrol stations were running dry as customers filled up. Curtis Oil, a fuel distributor in Chesterfield, South Carolina, said it had been ""overwhelmed with requests by state agencies and everybody else"". US President Donald Trump has signed declarations of emergency for both North Carolina and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and resources for the storm response. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the government would spare ""no expense"" in responding to Hurricane Florence, adding the storm was ""tremendously big and tremendously wet"". Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path Mr Trump also spoke of the US response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as ""one of the best jobs that has ever been done"", describing it as an ""incredible, unsung success"". The description is in stark contrast to the assessment of Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, who describedMr Trump's response to the disaster as a ""stain on his presidency""after officials revised the death toll last month. The toll now stands at an estimated 2,975 people- nearly 50 times the earlier figure of 64. That number includes those who were killed directly by Hurricane Maria, as well as those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. The US government has a National Flood Insurance Programme (NFIP) that helps pay for flood coverage in high-risk zones across the country. The programme, which is billions of dollars in debt, has been up for renewal several times - Congress' next deadline to re-authorise the NFIP is 30 November. While some wind damage may be covered by regular homeowners' insurance, flooding is a different story. This video can not be played Hurricane Florence seen from space In the US, flood protection policies from private providers are often very expensive, largely because it is difficult to assess a home's flood risk. These policies also take 30 days to kick in, meaning any homeowners without coverage in the Carolinas now will not be able to insure their property before Florence hits. According to the Insurance Information Institute,14% of Americans living in the southern states had flood insurance as of 2016,external. No. On the opposite side of the country, officials in Hawaii are warning residents and tourists to brace for the arrival of Tropical Storm Olivia. Forecasters say Olivia - with current wind speeds of 65mph - will make landfall on Wednesday morning. Schools and state parks have closed. Ten to 15in (25 to 38 cm) of rain is forecast for Big Island.

"In Merseyside 86% of burglaries went unsolved Serious and organised crime will increase without ""desperately needed"" investment in policing, Merseyside's police and crime commissioner said. Jane Kennedy's2017-18 report,externalrevealed there are 153 active organised crime gangs in Merseyside with crime increasing by 14% in the past year. She also defended her force's record as figures show four out of five burglaries in the region went unsolved. The Home Office said Merseyside Police funding had increased by Â£5.2m. A spokesman said the Home Secretary was ""committed to prioritising police funding in next year's Spending Review"". Merseyside Police insist there has been a 12% decrease in burglaries since March and a 7% increase in people arrested on suspicion of burglary. The police commissioner said: ""Officers and investigators looked at the areas where burglaries were happening and really got to grips with it. ""As a result the numbers of burglaries have been reduced and the people who have been perpetrating the burglaries have been brought to justice."" An analysis of Home Office figures by the Press Association revealed that no suspect was identified by police in 86% of burglaries on Merseyside. This was the sixth highest rate for a police force in England and Wales. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, she said: ""When a burglar goes to prison, the burglary rate in the area where that person has been operating often goes through the floor."" The commissioner pointed that Merseyside Police have made Â£83m cuts over the last eight years with Â£18m over the next four years at the same time as an increase in crime. Her2017-18 annual report,externalfound that the force's workforce has been cut by a quarter after eight years of cuts while at the same time: Crime in Merseyside has risen by 13.8% with 125,000 crimes reported over the last 12 months Police have to deal with 340 crimes and 1,246 incidents in an average day There are 94 recorded rapes every month Almost 1 million calls a year She said: ""We need action from central government and we desperately need new money invested in this, our most vital of public services.

"Ministers do not know the impact that funding cuts have had on police forces, the UK's public spending watchdog says. According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"". It calls the approach to police funding ""ineffective"" and ""detached"" from the changing demands faced by officers. A Home Office spokesman said the department had conducted a substantial review of police pressures last year. However, the Home Office had not even forecast the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the NAO said. Since September 2009 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservatives came into government - there has been a cut of 22,424 police officers. There were 126,252 police officers in England and Wales in September 2017, according to the latest figures. Historically there have been fewer officers - with 123,474 in 2001; 125,453 in 1991; and 116,544 in 1981, for example. Officer numbers grew during the Labour government from 2002 onwards, peaking in 2009. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. Durham's chief constable Mike Barton said the decisions of Home Office ministers in regards to police funding were ""sometimes in the hands of the Treasury"". ""I actually think the cuts in 2010 were the wake up call that policing needed to say: 'Come on spend your money wisely',"" Mr Barton told BBC Breakfast.

Officers worked 97 hours' overtime in year 'Cash-strapped' police taking second jobs Number of special constables falling Police forces in England and Wales are funded through a Â£12.3bn combination of a central grant to each police and crime commissioner, as well as additional cash raised locally through the council tax and one-off grants for special projects. The NAO says the amount coming from the government is down 30% in real terms since 2010-11. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. The NAO's Tom McDonald said the Home Office ""does not really understand the nature of the demand"" facing police forces.

""It's unlikely that the money is going to the right places,"" he said. ""We have real concerns about it."" By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs Correspondent This report from the national spending watchdog paints a picture of a service on the front line of public protection under severe pressure - but nobody in government being entirely sure how much pressure it is really under. The assessors said that while no force was about to financially fail, the stress was apparent. Since two years ago, officers are taking four days longer to charge suspects - an indication of workload rather than rising crime - and there is less ""proactive work"", such as motorway stops of dangerous drivers, breathalyser tests and convictions for drug possession. The rolling national crime survey has charted rising dissatisfaction with the police - and many communities have campaigned against losing local cuts. Two cities - St Albans and Bath - no longer have a dedicated police station with a front desk. A Home Office plan to revise the police funding formula, to more fairly distribute funds, was mothballed following the June 2017 general election. The NAO said individual forces had been developing their own ways of predicting demand for their services but the Home Office itself had ""no overarching strategy for policing"". But a Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said.

"Before 'keep calm and carry on' was a phrase that appeared on cushions, mugs, fridge magnets, and memes, it was a useful phrase to describe a particularly British attitude demonstrated by unflashy politicians who ignored (or should we say tried to ignore) colleagues who were looking for limelight, concentrated on what they were trying to get done and went back for more when times got rough. And, if you can forget the over-use of what was a wartime propaganda phrase, it is still an instruction that is useful to characterise much of the prime minister's attitude. Indeed, when she's chosen a more dramatic tack it sometimes has not exactly gone well. Calling the election in 2017, her biggest strategic mistake, was an entirely unnecessary drama. November Brexit deal is doable - Barnier What's the Brexiteers' alternative plan? And as the real crunch period for Brexit approaches, KCACO (surely there's a Whitehall acronym for this somewhere) is firmly the prime minister's approach. And despite the disagreements in the Tory party being ventilated every moment, Theresa May has, in public at least, little intention of overreacting - if reacting at all. The new heat of the Tory despair and disagreements is because we are now, at last you might say, nearing at least the beginning of the end of the Brexit process. There is less than a school term to go before the overall political deal is meant to be done. The stakes therefore are huge. And when times are anxious, the smallest thing can cause outrage or ecstasy. So in this kind of political atmosphere, every word, every warning, every stray comment, every indiscretion can send people screaming to slam the panic button. Inside government the plan is to keep going, take the knocks, carry on, however strong the resistance is, and to make a more determined effort to try to persuade people of the merits of their proposal. There is frustration inside government that the prime minister hasn't made more effort to expound the benefits of the Chequers approach. She did, after all, make chunky speeches on previous occasions when there were big developments in the government's thinking. Not this time. But in the frenetic run-up to the Tory conference, government ministers will be despatched around the country to at least try to get Tory Party members on side. But the calculation inside government is, as it has been throughout this very bumpy road, that in the end, there will be a Brexit deal and that a majority of MPs will be too alarmed at the prospect of no deal with the EU, which would mean no two year period of getting used to it, to do more than flirt with the notion of voting it down. In the end therefore, the government's assumption is that a deal would go through because of old-fashioned common sense. Here's the thing - politics is not always governed by common sense. People are also motivated by conviction, by ideology, by identity, by emotion, and a different kind of common sense. To many Tories in government it is common sense to try to stay as close to the EU as possible to try to minimise disruption. To many others, that's simply the wrong way to look at Brexit. And those Conservatives who want looser ties are very serious about what they are trying to do which is no less than force her to change tack. Theresa May is trying very hard to KCACO.  She's showing no sign of budging - perhaps her deal will acquire a sense of inevitability. But despite warmer words from Brussels, at home with no majority Theresa May won't have the luxury of ignoring her critics forever.

"This video can not be played Steve Baker: This not a plot to topple the prime minister Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa May's Chequers plan, a former Brexit minister has warned. Steve Baker told the BBC the PM's blueprint for future relations with the EU had alienated Leavers and Remainers. He warned of a ""catastrophic split"" if his party was not able to unite around a different, more flexible arrangement. No 10 said its plan was the ""only one on the table"" able to deliver on the will of British people while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. The cabinet backed the so-called Chequers plan when it met at the PM's country residence in July. The agreement, which led to the resignations of then-Brexit Secretary David Davis and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, sets out a blueprint for the future relationship with the EU once the UK leaves in March 2019. Mr Baker is the former chairman of the Eurosceptic group the European Research Group (ERG), which plans to publish its own proposals for Brexit ahead of the Conservative Party conference. Brexit: All you need to know The Chequers plan explained Labour, unions and the Brexit vote issue Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles He told the Press Association that the lack of support for Mrs May's plan, which would involve the UK accepting a common rule book for trade in goods, among Tory MPs left her with a ""massive problem"" in the run-up to next month's Conservative conference. If the government tried to push through a Brexit deal through the Commons, on the back of Labour votes, he said the Tory Party ""would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid"". ""It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative Party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party."" Theresa May's cabinet agreed the Chequers plan in July, but it led to a number to resignations Mr Baker told the BBC that opposition to Chequers was so widespread that some colleagues who backed remaining in the EU would prefer the UK to leave without a deal than sign up to the current proposal. Despite his criticism, he insisted he was not seeking a change in leadership and he would back the PM if she changed tack and backed a free trade deal modelled on Canada's arrangements with the EU. ""We want to change the policy and we would be delighted to unite behind Theresa May with a different policy. ""The Conservative Party must come together to deliver Brexit behind a policy and the policy we are arguing for is the one the EU has offered us in March."" Former leader Iain Duncan Smith said the PM's plan was ""unacceptable"" to the majority of Tory MPs and was ""essentially dead"". Asked when Brexiteers outside of the government would come up with a detailed alternative, he said he and others would be putting forward a ""whole set of new ideas"" in the coming weeks but it was up to ministers to mould them into a plan that would be approved by Parliament. The latest interventions follow a week of criticism of the Chequers deal from MPs, notably former foreign secretary Boris Johnson. He caused controversy over the weekendwith a column in the Mail on Sunday, calling the PM's plan a ""suicide vest"" around the UK, with the detonator in Brussels' hands. A number of senior Tories criticised the language he used, with one minister saying it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics but other colleagues of Mr Johnson said critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". Boris Johnson has criticised the Chequers deal in a number of newspaper articles In his weekly column in Monday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson wrote that the Conservative government should cut taxes to help ""striving"" families and give the UK a post-Brexit boost. But Justice Secretary David Gauke said there was ""no vacancy"" in Downing Street and ex-education secretary Nicky Morgan, who backs a Norway-style association agreement with the EU, said getting a Brexit deal through the Commons would potentially depend on the support of Labour MPs. ""Surely the public want politicians to work together on this matter of national interest,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""That is why I hope the government is going to appeal to MPs on all sides to do the right thing for the country."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. A deal on the UK's withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for an EU summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship. However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly opposed"" to aspects of the Chequers plan. But with the clock ticking to next month's summit, the Financial Times said EU leaders now seem prepared to begin discussions on the most contentious points of Mrs May's plan. The paper reported they would give Mr Barnier the green light to begin talks at a meeting in Salzburg later this month. But, at the same time, The Republic of Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan signalled that further UK compromises would be needed and ""factionalism"" within the Conservative Party could scupper any chance of an agreement. ""If the UK attitude is Chequers and only Chequers, there will be no agreement before March next year on the future trade relationship,"" he said in a speech in the town of New Ross.

"The impact of funding on rising crime is a matter of hot debate, but what is certain is that police forces in England and Wales have less money than they did in 2010. Putting a precise figure on it is harder than you might think, however, because budgets are made up of different elements and these elements are not published officially in one place. After five years of cuts, in 2015 the government committed to protecting English and Welsh police forces' budgets in real terms overall. But there are big caveats to this. Police forces in England and Wales mainly get their money from a combination of grants from central government - the biggest chunk - and money raised through council taxes. There are also separate grants from central government which fund areas that are dealt with on a national level, like cyber-crime and counter-terrorism. Not every police force will receive this money. Firstly, police spending is only protected in real terms overall once you include these national grants. When it comes to funding individual forces' policing, budgets are protected in cash terms which means forces are still experiencing a real-terms cut because of the rising costs of policing. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? What's happened to police numbers? For example, the Met is getting the same amount of money - its funding from government is not being reduced - but its costs are rising so it says it must find Â£400m in savings. There are also big variations in how much money different areas are able to raise in council tax, and therefore how much they rely on grants from central government. In Surrey which has more taxpayers and more valuable properties, the force gets 44% of its funding from central government. In Northumbria, where council tax take is lower, 83% of police funding comes from central government. The Institute for Fiscal Studies saysoverall police budgets fell by 14%,externalbetween 2010-11 and 2014-15. BBC Reality Check calculates that between 2010 and 2017 there has been about a 20% cut in police funding in real terms. As funding has fallen, so have numbers of police officers. In December, Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced what she described as a ""substantial"" Â£450m increase in police funding in England and Wales. This brings us to our second caveat. More than half of this money (Â£270m) will be raised from council tax. It's not new money from government. This commitment to protect budgets relies on police and crime commissioners putting up council tax by the maximum they are allowed. The chunk of funding that comes from central government has been falling in cash terms in every year up to 2017-18. It is going to stay the same in 2018-19 as the year before. 'Extra Â£450m funding' for police in England and Wales Reality Check: Is the Met Police facing Â£400m in cuts? The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority,Sir David Norgrove, has flagged the lack of transparency,externalaround police funding in the past. He also said: ""The prime minister's statement and the Home Office's tweet could have led the public to conclude incorrectly that central government is providing an additional Â£450m for police spending in 2018-19. ""The Home Office tweet also implied that the Â£450m sum is guaranteed. As the minister for policing's statement outlined, up to Â£270m of the funding settlement will come from local council tax, if police and crime commissioners and mayors choose to raise these sums."" Ms Rudd emphasised the government's determination to halt the rise in violence but her strategy did not mention funding All UK forces have seen reductions to their funding since 2010. In Scotland, there is a single police service, formed through the merger of eight forces in April 2013. The Police Service of Scotland (PSoS) is centrally funded by the Scottish government and has no council-tax raising powers, although local authorities are able to put some of their general budgets into funding local policing priorities. Between 2013, when the single police service was formed, and 2016, the Scottish Police Authority's budget fell by about 9% in real terms. Projections published in 2017 suggested the police service would be almost Â£200m in deficit by 2021. In Northern Ireland, the police service'sbudget reduced by 17%,externalbetween 2011 and 2015. Northern Ireland also has a single police service, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) which is centrally funded from Westminster. It bids for funding from the Treasury and cannot raise money through local taxes.

"Ministers do not know the impact that funding cuts have had on police forces, the UK's public spending watchdog says. According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"". It calls the approach to police funding ""ineffective"" and ""detached"" from the changing demands faced by officers. A Home Office spokesman said the department had conducted a substantial review of police pressures last year. However, the Home Office had not even forecast the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the NAO said. Since September 2009 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservatives came into government - there has been a cut of 22,424 police officers. There were 126,252 police officers in England and Wales in September 2017, according to the latest figures. Historically there have been fewer officers - with 123,474 in 2001; 125,453 in 1991; and 116,544 in 1981, for example. Officer numbers grew during the Labour government from 2002 onwards, peaking in 2009. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. Durham's chief constable Mike Barton said the decisions of Home Office ministers in regards to police funding were ""sometimes in the hands of the Treasury"". ""I actually think the cuts in 2010 were the wake up call that policing needed to say: 'Come on spend your money wisely',"" Mr Barton told BBC Breakfast. But he said there had been a ""constant strain"" since then with ""austerity dragging out"". Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? What has happened to police funding?

"The Grease star became a cancer campaigner after her initial diagnosis in 1992 Singer and actress Olivia Newton-John has opened up about a third diagnosis for cancer, saying she believed she would ""win over it"". The Grease star, 69, told Australian TV show Sunday Night she was now using medicinal marijuana and other natural remedies. Newton-John survived her initial breast cancer diagnosis in 1992 but revealed that it had returned in 2013. A third diagnosis, of a tumour in the lower back, was made last year. Olivia Newton-John's cancer returns Cancer patient unveils 'topless' statue Doctor turns superhero for final treatment The new diagnosis is stage 4 breast cancer that has metastasized to the spine. In the emotional interview on Sunday Night, she said: ""I'm one of millions in this fight. I shouldn't say fight... in this journey. ""A lot of people see it as a fight, and wherever you choose to see it, that's your prerogative. I see it as part of my mission."" She said the natural treatments were ""doing really well"", although radiation therapy was also involved. ""I believe I will win over it and that's my goal."" Newton-John called on Australia to adopt the laws of the US state where she lives, California, and allow the medicinal use of marijuana. ""My dream is that, in Australia soon, it will be available to all the cancer patients and people going through cancer that causes pain,"" she said. The four-time Grammy award winner admitted to moments of despair but said she had ""an incredible career"" and ""nothing to complain about"". After surviving her cancer diagnosis in 1992, Newton-John became a prominent campaigner, setting up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness research centre in Melbourne.

"Ministers do not know the impact that funding cuts have had on police forces, the UK's public spending watchdog says. According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"". It calls the approach to police funding ""ineffective"" and ""detached"" from the changing demands faced by officers. A Home Office spokesman said the department had conducted a substantial review of police pressures last year. However, the Home Office had not even forecast the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the NAO said. Since September 2009 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservatives came into government - there has been a cut of 22,424 police officers. There were 126,252 police officers in England and Wales in September 2017, according to the latest figures. Historically there have been fewer officers - with 123,474 in 2001; 125,453 in 1991; and 116,544 in 1981, for example. Officer numbers grew during the Labour government from 2002 onwards, peaking in 2009. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick told the annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. Durham's chief constable Mike Barton said the decisions of Home Office ministers in regards to police funding were ""sometimes in the hands of the Treasury"". ""I actually think the cuts in 2010 were the wake up call that policing needed to say: 'Come on spend your money wisely',"" Mr Barton told BBC Breakfast. But he said there had been a ""constant strain"" since then with ""austerity dragging out"". Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? What has happened to police funding? No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Mark Burns-Williamson, police and crime commissioner for West Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report highlighted what other PCCs had been saying ""for some time"". Firstly, that the overall amount of funding for policing ""isn't enough"" - and secondly that the funding formula was ""not really fit for purpose"", leading to ""unfairness and differences"" between different areas. Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said MPs had repeatedly heard about police forces being overstretched, calling the report ""very accurate"" and ""damning"". The Labour MP told the BBC it showed an ""irresponsible approach from the Home Office"" in making ""substantial cuts"" in the police budget ""without appearing to have any clear idea about what the impact of those cuts are"". The NAO report comes as Home Secretary Sajid Javid prepares for a speech to police superintendents in which he will say the police must be equipped for a changing landscape. On Monday, the leader of the superintendents' association warned the service wason the verge of a crisis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officers worked 97 hours' overtime in year 'Cash-strapped' police taking second jobs Number of special constables falling Police forces in England and Wales are funded through a Â£12.3bn combination of a central grant to each police and crime commissioner, as well as additional cash raised locally through the council tax and one-off grants for special projects. The NAO says the amount coming from the government is down 30% in real terms since 2010-11. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. The NAO's Tom McDonald said the Home Office ""does not really understand the nature of the demand"" facing police forces. He said the funding formula used to allocate money was ""out of date"", three years after the Home Office told Parliament that the formula was ineffective. ""It's unlikely that the money is going to the right places,"" he said. ""We have real concerns about it."" By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs Correspondent This report from the national spending watchdog paints a picture of a service on the front line of public protection under severe pressure - but nobody in government being entirely sure how much pressure it is really under. The assessors said that while no force was about to financially fail, the stress was apparent. Since two years ago, officers are taking four days longer to charge suspects - an indication of workload rather than rising crime - and there is less ""proactive work"", such as motorway stops of dangerous drivers, breathalyser tests and convictions for drug possession. The rolling national crime survey has charted rising dissatisfaction with the police - and many communities have campaigned against losing local cuts. Two cities - St Albans and Bath - no longer have a dedicated police station with a front desk. A Home Office plan to revise the police funding formula, to more fairly distribute funds, was mothballed following the June 2017 general election. The NAO said individual forces had been developing their own ways of predicting demand for their services but the Home Office itself had ""no overarching strategy for policing"". But a Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said.

"The value of purchases made by plastic now accounts for more than three-quarters of retail sales. Cash use fell a further 1% last year and now accounts for just 22% of purchases, according to the British Retail Consortium. But the switch to plastic hasn't stopped Britons spending - there were almost 20 billion retail transactions over the year. That works out at 54 million transactions a day, or 40,000 a minute. Debit card payments overtook cash use for the first time last year, banking trade bodyUK Finance revealed in June. The latest annual Payments Survey from the BRC backs that up. It reveals that cards were used to pay for Â£277.1bn-worth of goods in 2017, accounting for 76% of all retail sales and passing the 75% milestone for the first time. Meanwhile cash continued its ongoing decline both as a share of retail transactions (falling 0.5%) and as a share of retail sales (falling 1.2%). The cash decline has partly been driven by UK consumers increasingly using cards for lower-value payments, traditionally dominated by cash, the BRC said. That has been helped by the rise and ease of using contactless technology, where cards are placed on or near a reader without the need to enter a pin number. In fact, UK Finance estimated that 3.4 million people hardly used cash at all during the year. It said young consumers, aged between 25 and 34, were most likely to make contactless payments. Those who shunned cash entirely were also most likely to be among that age group. Meanwhile, total UK retail sales rose by 4.3% in 2017 to Â£366bn, up from Â£351bn the previous year, the BRC said.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Kurt and Melissa Cochran moments before Westminster attack Lives were torn apart by ""82 seconds of high and terrible drama"" in the 2017 Westminster attack, an inquest into their deaths has been told. Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death. The attack, on 22 March, ""cruelly and brutally"" ripped victims from their families, said the husband of Aysha Frade, who was killed on the bridge. Tributes to the five have been read out on the first day of the hearing. Those hit by Masood's car were Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, and Andreea Cristea. PC Keith Palmer was killed in the forecourt of the Palace of Westminster. He made the ""ultimate sacrifice"", a colleague told the Old Bailey. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster attack: What happened Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Judge Mark Lucraft QC, chief coroner of England and Wales, said ""the lives of many were torn apart by high and terrible drama"" that day in little more than a minute. He warned that video footage shown during the inquest would be ""graphic and shocking"" and some family members chose to leave the court when it was played. Among the images shown was one of the moment US tourist Kurt Cochran saved his wife's life by pushing her away from the path of Masood's car before being hit by it himself. Gareth Patterson QC, representing three of the victims' families, said people were hit like ""human bowling pins"" and ""thrown in the air like rag dolls"". Mr Patterson said Masood would have ""seen and heard every impact as he drove over the bridge"", suggesting there was ""no getting away from the barbarity of what happened and the inhumanity of what took place"". Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Det Supt John Crossley, who led the police investigation, said the attack began at 14:40 when Masood's vehicle, a rented Hyundai Tucson, mounted the kerb on Westminster Bridge, travelling at an average of 31mph. Mr Cochran - who was standing with his wife at the south end of the bridge - was the first to be hit. The CCTV also showed Mr Rhodes being knocked into the air and dragged by Masood's car. He was taken to hospital, but died the following day from head injuries. Ms Frade was thrown 17 metres into a bus lane, then fell under a slow-moving oncoming bus. Ms Cristea was knocked into the Thames from the bridge and was in the water for nearly nine minutes before being rescued. She died just over two weeks later. After crashing his car, Masood got out and ran around the fence to enter the Palace of Westminster's Carriage Gate, where he continued his attack. PC Palmer, who was unarmed, challenged him but was forced backwards into the Parliamentary estate and stabbed. One of the CCTV images seen in court showed Masood standing over PC Palmer with a knife in each hand. The court heard two of his colleagues ran towards the attacker to give PC Palmer the chance to get away, but he collapsed a short distance away. At the beginning of the hearing, a minute's silence was held and members of the victims' families embraced one another. The families and friends of victims read out tributes to their loved ones. First was Mr Cochran's sister-in-law, Angela Stoll, who read out a tribute on behalf of his wife Melissa, who had travelled to the inquest from the US. Melissa Payne Cochran's sister read a statement on her behalf She said: ""I was so lucky to have had 25 wonderful years with the man of my dreams. He made me laugh every single day. She said she was ""forever grateful"" for their time together, ""and especially his heroic actions on that day, saving my life"". By BBC News correspondent Helena Lee, at the Old Bailey Relatives of those who died came to court number one today, nearly 18 months after the attack, to share their memories, their pain and their loss. They read, through tears, powerful tributes to their loved ones from the witness box in front of a full, hushed courtroom. Pictures of those who died were put up on big screens for all to see. As the events of that day last March were recalled, the coroner warned them of the harrowing and graphic footage ahead. He told them they could leave if they wanted to - and some did. Those left behind watched as the horrifying footage was played of the attacker driving erratically along Westminster Bridge and ploughing into pedestrians. The families will return to the Old Bailey on Tuesday. They'll be hoping the days and weeks ahead will give them answers about the final moments of their loved ones' lives. Ms Frade's husband John said she had been ""cruelly and brutally ripped away from us"". ""Her spirit lives on in the eyes of her children,"" he added. John Frade told the court his wife's spirit lived on Romanian interior designer Ms Cristea, who would have turned 33 on the day the inquest began, was walking with her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz on a visit to London when she was hit. Andreea Cristea was visiting London with her boyfriend Her family described her as a ""lovely, enchanting and life-loving"" woman, who had a thriving business. PC Palmer's sister Angela said he had ""died protecting strangers whilst doing his job and he will be remembered by many for his courage and bravery"". Chief Inspector Neil Sawyer said the 48-year-old constable had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"". Amanda Rhodes, the niece of retired window cleaner Mr Rhodes, told the inquest the family was ""devastated"" and ""incredibly angry"" about the 75-year-old's death. Flowers and candles were left on Westminster Bridge in tribute to the victims The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held but only once the one into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined. Who was attacker Khalid Masood?

"Indea Ford took her two daughters to Sitka, Alaska without their father's knowledge A British mother has admitted abducting her two children and moving to Alaska to live with her new partner without their father's permission. Indea Ford, 34, previously from Maidstone in Kent, admitted two counts of abduction, at Isleworth Crown Court. She took her children to Sitka in October 2015 after she married an American following the breakdown of her relationship with their father. Ford was jailed for three years and six months. She had met the children's father almost 10 years ago and the couple had two daughters. However, the relationship ended in early 2012. A family court in Dartford ordered that custody be shared between the biological parents. At that hearing the judge said each parent must hold one of the girls' passports. Ford then obtained a new passport for the second child, claiming it had been lost or stolen, having already failed to get a family court to approve their move to the US. She married the American who was in the military in 2014 and the children moved to Alaska the following year, breaking the custody order and the family court judgement. The girls' father began a bid through the family court to get the children back and Ford was extradited to the UK in April. The children remain with their stepfather in Alaska. Recorder Gibson Grenfell QC said: ""A cynic might say the defendant has achieved what she set out to achieve - keep the children in America permanently."" But he said the father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, may have at times behaved ""reprehensibly"" during the relationship.

"This video can not be played Russia prepares for its largest military exercise since the Cold War Russia has launched its biggest military exercise since the Cold War, involving about 300,000 service personnel, in eastern Siberia. China is sending 3,200 troops to take part in ""Vostok-2018"", with many Chinese armoured vehicles and aircraft. Mongolia is also sending some units. The last Russian exercise of similar scale was in 1981, during the Cold War, but Vostok-2018 involves more troops. The week-long manoeuvres come at a time of heightened Nato-Russia tensions. As the exercises began, Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a forum in the eastern city of Vladivostok and told him ""we have a trusting relationship in the sphere of politics, security and defence"". Relations between Russia and Nato - a 29-member defence alliance dominated by the US - have worsened since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. What is Nato? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the drills were justified given ""aggressive and unfriendly"" attitudes towards Russia. Tuesday and Wednesday will see planning and preparation while actual operations will start on Thursday and last five days, the head of the Russian general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, was quoted as saying. The Russian defence ministry says 36,000 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and armoured infantry vehicles will take part in Vostok-2018, from 11 to 17 September, along with more than 1,000 aircraft. Vostok is Russian for east. The exercise will be spread across five army training grounds, four airbases and areas in the Sea of Japan, Bering Straits and Sea of Okhotsk. Up to 80 naval vessels will take part, from two Russian fleets. The drills will not be near the disputed Kuril islands north of Japan, Russia says. The ministry's TV channel Zvezda says three brigades of Russian paratroops will play a key role, during drills at the Tsugol military range, near Russia's borders with China and Mongolia. A key aim is to practise the rapid deployment of thousands of troops, as well as aircraft and vehicles, from western Russia to eastern regions, across thousands of miles, TV Zvezda reports. That involves in-flight refuelling of fighter jets. The scale of Vostok-2018 is equivalent to the forces deployed in one of the big World War Two battles. A smaller-scale Russia-Belarus exercise was held last year. President Vladimir Putin has made military modernisation, including new nuclear missiles, a priority. Russia's armed forces are reckoned to have about one million personnel in total. A Russian senator and reserve colonel, Frants Klintsevich, said ""it suited the West that our units and headquarters lacked combat skills and co-ordination, but times have changed; now we have a different attitude to combat readiness"". Russia's military role in Syria grows Russia's new military - should Nato worry? Russia launches huge war games with Belarus The Chinese defence ministry spoke of deepening military co-operation and enhancing both sides' ability to jointly respond to ""various security threats"", without specifying those threats. Mongolia has not given details of its involvement. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says Islamist extremism in Central Asia is a major threat to Russian security. Chinese and Russian naval infantry trained together in Russia's far east last year China has imposed heavy security and censorship in the mainly Muslim Xinjiang region. Xinjiang has seen intermittent violence - followed by crackdowns - for years. China accuses Islamist militants and separatists of orchestrating the trouble. China denies holding one million Uighurs China's 'globalised' military power In recent yearsRussia and China have deepened military co-operationand during these drills they will have a joint field headquarters. Observers say the two sides have been building ties partly as an attempt to counter the US's international influence. They have also been boosting economic co-operation, with Chinese direct investment soaring by 72% in 2017, according to state news agency Xinhua. Xi Jinping has called Vladimir Putin his ""best, most intimate friend"" As Beijing has become embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with Washington this year, Russia has become an increasingly important trade partner and is now China's ninth largest. Russia is now China's biggest oil supplier and its largest energy company, Gazprom, is building a 3,000km (1,864mi) gas pipeline that will link eastern Siberia to the Chinese border. Mr Putin and Mr Xi are said to get along well too - in June, the Chinese leader called his Russian counterpart his ""best, most intimate friend"". It is a big contrast from the Cold War years, when China and what was then the USSR were rivals for global communist leadership and clashed on their far eastern border. Revival of Russia's 'Wild East' Spokesman Dylan White said Nato was briefed on Vostok-2018 in May and would monitor it. He said ""all nations have the right to exercise their armed forces, but it is essential that this is done in a transparent and predictable manner"". ""Vostok demonstrates Russia's focus on exercising large-scale conflict. It fits into a pattern we have seen over some time: a more assertive Russia, significantly increasing its defence budget and its military presence."" It has been increasing since Russia intervened in Ukraine in 2014, backing pro-Russian separatist rebels. Nato responded by deploying extra forces in eastern Europe, sending 4,000 troops to the Baltic region. Russia says the Nato build-up is unjustified and provocative. It says the Ukrainian revolution of 2013-2014 was a coup masterminded by the West. Russian diplomats were expelled from Nato countries after the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with a nerve agent in southern England in March. The UK blamed Russian military intelligence - the GRU - for the attack; Moscow denied involvement.
