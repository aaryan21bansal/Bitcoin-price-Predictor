"The Army Foundation College in Harrogate trains recruits between the ages of 16 and 17 Smoking and vaping is to be banned at the UK's only Army training centre for teenage recruits. Hundreds of junior soldiers pass through the Army Foundation College (AFC) in Harrogate each year. Its commanding officer Lt Col Richard Hall said it was ""unacceptable"" that ""most recruits don't smoke on arrival, yet most do by graduation"". New recruits will be barred from smoking next week, with a complete ban on smoking and vaping on site by 2020. In a statement, Lt Col Hall said the ban was in order to develop recruits' health and fitness. He added: ""I hope that this will discourage smoking amongst new recruits and reverse the recent trend we've seen in recruits taking up the habit."" Allow Twitter content?

The college trains recruits between the ages of 16 and 17. The Army's website says it ""plays a vital role in providing basic military training and developing future leadership"". The military has a higher proportion of smokers than the civilian population. Figures supplied by the Ministry of Defence in 2013 showed 33% of Army personnel were regular smokers. In comparison, in the same year a NHS report found 19% of adults smoked regularly. Since then the number of civilian smokers has dropped further, with the latest NHS figures reporting 14.7% of adults smoking. It is against the law for under 18s to buy tobacco in England and Wales, although it is not illegal to smoke under the age of 18.

"This refill shop is bringing shoppers to Barry's town centre, which has suffered from large retailers closing down in quick succession Shop closures of large retailers in Wales far outweighed all new chain store openings in the first half of 2019, research has indicated. There was a net loss of 37 chain shops in the 11 towns surveyed, suggesting Wales was proportionally the worst-affected part of the UK. Pubs, bookmakers, and men's clothes shops saw the highest fall in Wales. However, there was some growth in opticians, chocolatiers, sports good shops and beauty salons. Researchers studied town centres deemed to be in Great Britain's top 500 high streets, including Abergavenny, Barry, Newport, Swansea, Cardiff, Carmarthen, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pontypridd, Bridgend and Cwmbran. Five ways the High Street is changing Shops in Wales faced worst June in 20 years Towns eyeing big chains 'doomed to failure' The analysis by Local Data Company and PwC showed the shortfall between chains opening and closing was at the highest level since the analysis began in 2014. Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan was the only town surveyed in Wales not to see a net decline. The town's centre saw one chain shop closing and one opening in the first half of this year. Fifty-five per cent of its shops are independent, meaning the chain retailers make up a significant proportion of the occupants. Rachael Williams thinks chain closures can create a negative perception of an area Rachael Williams, who is involved with the Holton Road Traders' Association, said the departure of chains such as Dorothy Perkins, Burton and New Look had affected footfall and created a negative perception of the area. ""You've either got to make the units bigger to attract the bigger shops, or you've got to make the rates lower to attract the independents,"" she added. Her husband Ceri Williams, who co-owns Marshalls Butchers on the main street Holton Road, said a reduction in chain shops was ""another nail in the coffin"" for the high street. In July, locals Stuart Burnell and his fiancÃ©e opened the Awesome Wales zero waste refill shop, next to Marshalls, and said they had been well-supported by residents. ""It's vitally important we have different types of shop that will bring people back into the town centre,"" he said. Towns eyeing big chains to pull shoppers 'doomed to failure' Retailers 'frustrated' over progress to help struggling shops Shops in Wales faced worst June in 20 years His neighbour Mr Williams added: ""Getting people in the town is the biggest challenge because it's so hard to draw people in, but the [refill] shop next door, he has brought a lot of people in, and nice people who care about the environment and we're getting a bit of spin off from that."" This video can not be played 'Empty shops everywhere' on High Street The analysis looked at the top 500 high streets with the largest number of chain stores, which is why there were no towns in north Wales on the list. Ben Cottam, from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales, described the analysis as ""sobering"". ""We now see that some of the pressures of consumer behaviour, business rates burdens and other issues are hitting even the biggest names,"" he added. FSB Wales called on the Welsh Government to allocate some of the Â£600m announced for Wales in the chancellor's recent spending review towards a future of Welsh towns fund to develop new thinking on boosting regional towns. The Welsh Government said the money did ""not make up for nearly a decade of cuts"" and it was considering how best to use the money and would bring forward a budget for 2020-21 ""as early as possible"".

"In the ad, someone is shown receiving a delivery in a field after apparently tunnelling underground to escape from prison A TV ad for Deliveroo has been banned for suggesting the food delivery firm could deliver anywhere in the UK. The ad, shown in March, showed various scenes of people using the Deliveroo app and having food delivered to them, all in unusual places or circumstances. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was ""likely to mislead"" because it wrongly implied delivery ""was unrestricted throughout the UK"". Deliveroo said it felt on-screen text had made it clear restrictions applied. In the ad someone is shown receiving a delivery in a field after apparently tunnelling underground to escape from prison. An astronaut is also shown receiving a delivery in space. Meanwhile a voice-over states: ""Order what you want; where you want; when you want it"" while text at the bottom of the screen reads: ""Some restrictions apply, obviouslyâ¦"" Philadelphia and VW ads banned over gender rules Vaping advert banned over Mo Farah confusion There were 22 complaints from people who, knowing that Deliveroo did not deliver to their areas, said that the ad was misleading. Deliveroo's parent company, Roofoods, said that the exaggerated scenes in the ad showed it was not meant to represent real life - simply that it was possible to order from Deliveroo in different everyday locations. It also said customers could check their app to see whether their area was covered without incurring any cost. But the ASA said that without any additional explanation, viewers were likely to take the claim ""Order what you want; where you want; when you want it"" literally. A woman is also shown receiving a delivery during a car chase ""Because we considered the ad suggested delivery was unrestricted throughout the UK when that was not the case, we concluded that it was likely to mislead,"" it said. The ad must not appear again in its current form and Roofoods has been told to ensure that similar claims do not appears in its marketing again. A Deliveroo spokesman said: ""Deliveroo designed a playful advert to show that, through our service, people are able to order food to a wide range of places, whether home or work, for a range of occasions. ""We know some will be disappointed that their local area isn't currently served by Deliveroo, but we are expanding rapidly across the UK.""

"The store was a three-month experiment said Sainsbury's Tills have been reinstalled in an experimental till-less shop opened by supermarket Sainsbury's. It had been totally refurbished to remove the entire checkout area, freeing up shop assistants to help customers on the shop floor. Customers had to scan their groceries using Sainsbury's Pay & Go app, paying for them as they went around the shop. But it resulted in long queues at the helpdesk as people attempted to pay for their groceries in the traditional way. Sainsbury's said it had learned ""a huge amount"" from the experiment. Launching the three-month experiment at its Holborn store, group chief digital officer Clodagh Moriarty said executives ""were excited to understand how our customers respond to the app experience"". But this week, Sainsbury's saidin a blogpost,external: ""It's clear that not all our customers are ready for a totally till-free store.""

"This video can not be played Watson: Labour should 'unequivocally back Remain' Labour should ""unequivocally back Remain"" in a fresh Brexit referendum and only then pursue power in a general election, its deputy has said. Tom Watson said there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit deal"" and the 2016 Leave vote had been ""invalidated"". Jeremy Corbyn said he did ""not accept or agree with"" his deputy's view. ""Our priority is to get a general election in order to give the people a chance to elect a government that cares for them,"" he said. The Labour leader wants to hold another referendum once Labour has won power, in which voters would have the choice to remain in the EU alongside a ""credible"" Leave proposal. However, he has said he would only choose a side once the shape of any revised Brexit deal negotiated by a Labour government became clear. The BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, said Mr Watson was directly elected as deputy leader by party members, not appointed by Mr Corbyn, and so has a right to roam on policy other shadow cabinet ministers might not get away with it. Watson: What's Corbyn's thinking on Brexit? Labour manifesto to offer vote on Leave and Remain In a speech in London, Mr Watson said while an autumn general election seemed inevitable ""that does not make it desirable"". ""Elections should never be single issue campaigns,"" he argued, suggesting vital issues such as the future of the NHS, economic inequality and crime would be ""drowned out"" by the prime minister's ""do or die"" Brexit message. ""The only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum,"" he said. ""A general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos."" In the event of another general election in the coming months, Mr Watson said Labour must be ""crystal clear"" about where it stands on Brexit if it wants to get a hearing for the rest of its domestic policy agenda. ""There is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, which is why I believe we should advocate for Remain. That is what the overwhelming majority of Labour Party members, MPs and trade unions believe."" Mr Watson will said that, though ""very difficult"", he and many others ""respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time"". But, he added: ""There eventually comes a point when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again."" The Liberal Democrats, who pushed Labour into third place in May's European elections with a strident anti-Brexit message, are pushing for Brexit to be stopped in its tracks by revoking Article 50 - the legal process for the UK's departure. While stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson said it was not too late for Labour to ""win back"" Remain voters. Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Where do the parties stand? Labour's hunt for Brexit 'reconciliation' ""My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,"" he added. ""They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it."" Former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith said Mr Watson was speaking for ""the majority of Labour members and Labour voters"", and that the party ""should be clearing the Brexit issue off the table before we get to an election"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn committed to a referendum with a ""credible Leave option"" on Tuesday But another Labour MP, Gareth Snell - one of a group of MPs in the party wanting to bring back an amended version of Theresa May's original withdrawal agreement - said the ""numbers simply don't exist"" in Parliament to approve a further referendum. He told Today: ""The public have no appetite for a second referendum. The doors I knock every weekâ¦ [voters] are not telling me they want to go back to the divisive referendum [but] they want a decision on this process to be taken as soon as possible."" Just 24 hours after Jeremy Corbyn hammered out a deal with the Labour-supporting unions, his deputy, Tom Watson, shattered any fragile unity. Mr Watson and many Labour activists want a clearer commitment to campaign on a Remain platform - especially during a snap election. So, apart from his own scepticism towards an EU that he believes needs reform, what is the thinking behind Jeremy Corbyn's position? Well, it comes down to four things - psephology, party unity, politics and personal authority. Read more from Iain. Unite's Len McCluskey dismissed Mr Watson's intervention, accusing him of ""undermining"" the leadership and suggesting his views ""don't really matter"". The two men, who used to be close friends, fell out spectacularly in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum during an uprising by Labour MPs against Mr Corbyn's leadership. The union leader suggested Mr Watson was ""languishing on the fringes"" of the party, adding: ""It's sad. Now and again Tom pops up from where he has been hiding and comes up with somethingâ¦ which is normally to try and undermine his leader."" The Conservatives said Mr Watson had made it clear he wanted to ""cancel"" the 2016 Brexit referendum result. Labour has voted twice against Boris Johnson's plans for a poll on 15 October. The party's leadership has insisted it is eager for an election after the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been ruled out.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Taking a slowfie with the iPhone 11 Apple has unveiled its iPhone 11 range of handsets, which feature more cameras than before and a processor that has been updated to be faster while consuming less power. The company said the two Pro models would last between four to five hours longer than their XS predecessors. But it did not launch a 5G model, and some rumoured features were missing. Apple also revealed a new version of its smartwatch, which features an ""always on"" display for the first time. The Series 5 Watch adjusts how often it refreshes the screen to as little as one frame per second as well as dimming the image to promise the same 18-hour battery life as the previous version. The new Apple Watch line-up becomes available on 20 September It also introduces a compass as well as the option of a titanium case. Its new operating system will alert owners to when nearby noise rises to risky levels, and adds menstrual cycle-tracking. ""I love strategically where Apple is going with its health and safety capabilities, but was disappointed to not see a sleep study or feature mentioned,"" commented analyst Patrick Moorhead. The company added that it will keep its Series 3 model on the market, which will cost $199 - or Â£199 in the UK - marking a new entry price point for the wearable. Allow Twitter content?

Apple currently accounts for 49% of the global smartwatch market, according to research firm IDC. It is also the UK's top-selling smartphone brand by a wide margin. The new iPhones are notable for introducing an ""ultrawide"" rear camera, offering 2x optical zoom-out. The iPhone 11 Pro is said to last four hours more than before, while the Pro Max is said to last five hours longer The Pro models retain the telephoto and normal lenses found in the last generation's XS and XS Max, while the basic iPhone 11 only has an ultrawide and standard lens. Apple made a virtue of a new Night Mode, which automatically brightens the image when required while taking steps to minimise the digital noise produced as a result. Google, Samsung and Huawei had already introduced a similar feature to their handsets. Apple said the image on the left shows Night Mode turned off, while the one on the right is when it is on A new facility called Deep Fusion was also teased. It takes nine snaps with a variety of exposures and then picks through them ""pixel by pixel"" to combine the best parts from each to create a superior image. This will not, however, be available at launch but should be added via a software update before the year's end. Other enhancements include the ability to shoot slow-motion videos with the front camera. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The handsets' processor - the A13 Bionic - has also been upgraded. Apple claims its CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) are more powerful than those featured in any Android phone. In addition, the chip's ""neural engine"" has been optimised to better handle matrix calculations - a type of algebra used by neural networks - and is said to be 20% faster than the A12. However, the new models are not compatible with Apple's Pencil stylus, as had been expected by many. That feature was already offered by its lowest-end iPad. Nor can they wirelessly recharge other devices, unlike Samsung and Huawei's premium phones. The entry-level iPhone 11 is said to last up to one hour longer than the earlier XR The handsets also stick with having lightning ports rather than making the shift to USB-C, as has happened with the iPad Pro - which could have made faster data transfers possible. The iPhone 11 is slightly cheaper than its XR forerunner in the UK, ranging between Â£729 and Â£879 depending on the amount of storage. But the Pro models are more expensive than the XS ones, costing between Â£1,049 and Â£1,499. They go on sale in 10 days time. Apple experienced a bigger drop in demand for new handsets than many of its rivals over the past year. But the firmrecently reported that its active install base,external- the number of iPhones in use - was at an ""all time high"". ""Several forces play here,"" commented Marta Pinto from IDC. ""Apple designs devices that last longer than an average Android device, and it's been very good at rolling out new versions of its operating system. ""There's also a very good second-hand trade in iPhones, and the overall smartphone market is slowing down. ""But Apple doesn't mind because its focus is now turning to services, and its wearables are also doing well."" Trump's tariffs puts Apple's golden goose at risk The new iPhone line-up does not feature a 5G model, in part because Intel struggled to develop the required modem. Sir Jony Ive attended the event despite announcing he was leaving Apple in June At a time when consumers are holding onto their handsets for longer before upgrading, that could place a further constraint on sales - especially in countries where 5G networks have already launched, such as the UK. ""Given people's loyalty to iPhone, if they really want 5G they'll probably just wait,"" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. Apple CEO Tim Cook took a selfie with attendees ""That said, don't be surprised to see rivals, particularly Samsung, positioning 5G devices as 'future-proof' options. ""I'm sure they will be arguing that buying a premium priced 4G smartphone right now would be like buying a TV a few years ago that was not HD-Ready."" Earlier at the event, chief executive Tim Cook revealed that Apple's two forthcoming subscription services would each cost $4.99 - or Â£4.99 in the UK - per month. Capcom's Shinksekai: Into the Depths was one of the exclusive video games demoed on an iPad Apple Arcade - a video games deal offering exclusive access to games that do not feature in-app fees - will become available on 19 September.

It will be followed by Apple TV+ - a television programme and movie-streaming platform with content not available elsewhere - which will make its first shows available on 1 November. The latter will be cheaper than rival services from Disney and Netflix, but appears to promise less material at this stage. ""I applaud web access to Apple TV+, but would have preferred an Android and Windows app,"" commented Mr Moorhead. See - a fantasy show set in the future starring Jason Momoa - is one of the shows that will be offered by Apple TV+ There was no mention of Apple bundling the new services with its existing cloud storage, news and music offerings for a discount, as had been speculated. But it will offer one year's Apple TV+ membership to consumers buying one of its computers or set-top boxes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It has now been nearly 13 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. Apple has since become one of the world's most valuable companies, in part because of investors' hopes that it can pull off a similar trick. ""Everyone wants Apple to have a new 'wow' product and its got a pretty good track record,"" commented Mr Wood. ""But the next big hit is proving elusive right now. My money is still on smart glasses but I think it could still be years before we see anything."" These updates are less about bringing in new features, but enhancing the things we're already familiar with. The iPhone Pro's camera setup is being aimed at - as you might guess - professionals. I think Apple sees big potential in indie filmmakers and documentary-makers. The battery-life bump should also help. Apple TV+ is cheap compared to its competitors. But is it good value? Disney+, Netflix, HBO et al have huge back catalogues of loved TV shows and movies. Apple doesn't, or at least it's not clear what it will have, even one year from now. All Apple really has is a boatload of cash to fill up Apple TV+ with content it hopes people will like. We've seen no evidence, yet, that it's capable of fulfilling that goal. Giving one year's access away with new devices is a way of making sure those new shows have wide exposure - but it needs to convince the entertainment industry that it's worth making a show for Apple+ instead of its rivals. Kyocera VP-210 VisualPhone (1999) Although there is some dispute over which mobile first featured a built-in colour camera, many credit this handset as having the honour. It featured a 0.11 megapixel (MP) sensor and could only store 20 selfies, but was able to transmit a jerky video feed in real-time at about two frames per second. Sharp J-SH04 (2000) Sharp's first photo-snapping mobile placed its sensor on the rear of its handset to encourage its use as an alternative to standard cameras. Its 0.11MP snaps could then be sent to friends via email. Sony Ericsson T68i (2002) The handset's optional CommuniCam MCA-20 accessory snapped on to the bottom of the handset, helping keep down the phone's size when not in use. It was limited to taking VGA (0.3MP) resolution shots, but the images could be texted to others via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) if they had compatible phones. Samsung D500 (2004) This was one of the first handsets to offer more than one megapixel of image quality. What's more it had a flash. Meanwhile the software made it possible to add graphical frames around photos and turn images sepia or apply a ""negative"" effect. Nokia N90 (2005) Nokia's N90 had a somewhat clunky swivel design, but a two megapixel sensor and a lens developed in collaboration with the famed German optics firm Carl Zeiss pitched it firmly at camera enthusiasts. Samsung G800 (2007) The megapixel wars were well under way by the time Samsung unveiled the G800. It took 5MP shots, had a 3x optical zoom and even featured a lens-cover slider, meaning that from the rear it could be easily mistaken for a dedicated camera. iPhone 4 (2010) Apple's fourth-generation iPhone is widely credited with helping kickstart the selfie craze, despite being far from the first to have a front camera. But at its launch, Steve Jobs was keener to show off how the feature could be used for Facetime, the firm's video chat app. LG Optimus 3D (2011) Smartphones with two rear cameras were still a rarity when LG's Android phone went on sale. It used them to create 3D images that could be viewed without special glasses on its display. But 3D phones proved to be as unpopular as 3D TVs, marking an evolutionary dead end for the industry. HTC One (2013) HTC's 2013 flagship sought to shift the battle to low-light photography. To do this it made the pixels larger than normal to gather more light, and dubbed them ""ultrapixels"". The trade-off was that its photos were limited to 4MP. Nokia Lumia 1020 (2014) This Windows Phone featured an industry-leading 41MP  sensor attached to an optical image stabilisation system. It allowed users to zoom in and crop without worrying about images becoming blurred, or to combine the data to make 5MP photos with less visual noise than would otherwise be the case. Lenovo Phab2Pro (2016) This was the first handset to build in Google's doomed Project Tango depth and motion-sensing cameras. They made augmented reality features possible, such as superimposing graphical images of furniture into views of a room. Tango was short-lived, but AR has lived on by other means. Samsung Note 8 (2017) This was one of the first phones to feature ""live focus"" - a facility that allowed users to adjust background blur in their photos before or after taking them. It achieved this by comparing the view from each of its two rear cameras to create a depth map of the scene. iPhone X (2017) Apple's tenth anniversary handset introduced its Face ID camera system, which used tens of thousands of infrared dots to map the user's features. As a consequence, the display had to make space for a ""notch"", which was widely copied by rivals even if they didn't feature such an elaborate facial recognition system. Pixel 2 (2017) Google found a way to let users blur the background of their photos using a single camera in its second-generation Pixel. This made it possible to offer the effect from both its front-facing selfie camera as well as the rear sensor. Huawei P20 Pro (2018) The Chinese firm's phone was one of the first to feature three cameras on its back. But the standout feature was its ability to produce quality snaps in near-dark conditions by taking long-exposure snaps and then using machine learning software to keep the details crisp. Oppo Reno 10x Zoom (2019) This had two unusual camera features. Firstly, one of the rear cameras has a periscope design that directs light sideways into the device's body, making it possible to let users zoom into a shot more than usual without sacrificing detail. Secondly, the selfie camera pops up from the top, making more space for the display. Hands-on with iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.

"Aaron Campbell was 16 when he killed Alesha MacPhail The teenager who abducted, raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has had his 27-year minimum sentence reduced by appeal judges. Aaron Campbell was 16 when he was sentenced to life for killing the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute. In August, his counsel, Brian McConnachie QC, told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that theterm was excessive in light of his age. Three judges ruled on Tuesday his sentence should be cut by three years. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Alesha: The little girl with the big smile The killer caught by his mother's CCTV Campbell, now 17, will still serve the longest term of detention to be imposed on a juvenile offender in Scotland. Prior to Campbell's sentence, Luke Mitchell, the teenager who killed school girl Jodi Jones in 2003, received 20 years. Mr McConnachie told Lady Dorrian, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young at the start of the appeal: ""It was clearly an appalling and heinous crime. ""The outcome of this appeal will not determine when, or indeed if, the appellant is allowed release."" However, psychologist Dr Gary Macpherson concluded: ""I am of the view that the capacity for change may be limited due to the nature of Aaron Campbell's personality structure and his complex risk factors. ""I apologise to the court for appearing pessimistic, however, I am not confident that Aaron Campbell has the capacity or desire to change his behaviour in any meaningful way and as such the risks will remain for the foreseeable future."" The appeal ruling said: ""In determining the appropriate punishment part the trial judge took account of several cases where the appellant had been a young person."" It went on to say that comparing Campbell's case with past cases gave ""limited guidance"", and the majority in that case also ""highlighted the difficulty of such a comparative exercise"". After comparing a number of cases where the offender had been a young person or when the crime was of a violent nature, the judges reduced Campbell's sentence from 27 to 24 years. The ruling said: ""A punishment part in excess of 20 years was plainly merited. We have concluded that a punishment part of 24 years would be appropriate to reflect the appellant's youth. ""We will accordingly allow the appeal to the extent of substituting that period for the sentence imposed."" Alesha was on a family holiday when she was taken from her bed by Campbell before being murdered After hearing about the ruling, Alesha's uncle, Calum-John MacPhail, posted on social media that he would speak to Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf about the decision. He later told BBC news: ""I am angry, upset, done with it. I'm angry at the decision. ""He should be tried like an adult. He doesn't deserve to have been given any less - or even an appeal."" Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said the ruling was ""disgraceful"". He said: ""This is one of the most vile criminals in Scotland, and he should not be enjoying having time shaved off his sentence. If anything he should be looking at an even longer stint. ""Yet again Scotland's justice system has come down favourably on the side of the criminal and it will cause massive upset to the victim's family."" A Scottish government spokesperson said they would not comment on decisions about sentencing. However, they added: ""A person will not be considered for parole until the punishment part of the sentence has expired."" Alesha, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was only a few days into a family holiday in Rothesay when Campbell took her from her bed in the middle of the night on 2 July last year. The child's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel the following morning. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 injuries. During his nine-day trial in February, Campbell lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. He also took the stand and told the jury his DNA must have been planted at the crime scene. However, before being sentenced he confessed to the killing.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""We will commit to a public vote"" Jeremy Corbyn has promised a further referendum on Brexit with a ""credible Leave option"" versus Remain if his party wins the next general election. He said Labour was ""ready"" for the campaign, but its ""priority"" was to stop a no-deal Brexit. Its manifesto will promise to reach a better Brexit deal, but is not expected to commit to either Leave or Remain. Some senior party figures - close Corbyn allies - say they will campaign to stay in the EU in any circumstances. They include shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who have both said remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal. Union leaders want Leave on the ballot and met Mr Corbyn earlier to discuss the issue. What would the parties do about Brexit? Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Corbyn: PM shifting power to wealthy Watson: Labour's hunt for Brexit 'reconciliation' The BBCs political correspondent, Iain Watson, said senior Labour figures had been arguing that backing Remain would recover ground lost to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats in recent elections. Pro-Remain Labour activists are also hoping the party's conference later this month will commit the leadership to backing Remain under all circumstances. But, while Labour-affiliated unions - including Unite, who are one of the party's biggest backers - would rather stay in the EU than have no deal, they believe a Corbyn government should offer voters a choice in a referendum between a negotiated deal and Remain. Speaking to the TUC conference in Brighton on Tuesday, he said: ""Our priority is first to stop no-deal and then to trigger a general election. ""No one can trust the word of a prime minister who is threatening to break the law to force through no deal. ""So a general election is coming, but we won't allow Johnson to dictate the terms."" He added: ""We're ready for that election. We're ready to unleash the biggest people-powered campaign we've ever seen. ""And in that election we will commit to a public vote with a credible option to leave and the option to remain."" The basis of Labour's election policy on Brexit became clear today. Jeremy Corbyn agreed with Labour's significant funders - the affiliated trade unions - that if elected, the party would negotiate a new Brexit deal and put that to a referendum, along with the option to remain. But the party will not say which option it would back during a general election. So, during an imminent campaign, the leadership will be unable to tell voters if a future Labour government would advocate coming out or staying in the EU. The Labour leader has rejected calls from senior figures in the party and grassroots activists to campaign explicitly to Remain during the election, amid fears votes and seats will be lost to the Lib Dems. Today's union meeting was described as a senior Labour source as ""decisive"" in determining policy because the unions are formally represented on the committee which draws up the manifesto, so have huge influence over it. Labour insiders hope to confine any disagreements on Brexit to a referendum, but sources admit the election campaign will be difficult to manage, as some shadow cabinet members have said they'd personally campaign to Remain even against a Labour deal. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Corbyn also promised to ""put power in the hands of workers"", pledging a future Labour government would enact ""the biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen."" If elected, Labour would set up a specific government department for employment rights, he said, and give the brief to a dedicated cabinet minister. Enforcement of rights would be boosted by a new agency with the power to enter workplaces and bring prosecutions on behalf of staff, he added. Conservatives - 288 MPs Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"". He says he wants to leave with a deal, but is willing to exit without one to ensure Brexit goes ahead by the current deadline. SNP - 35 MPs The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum on Brexit, and if it were to get one, would support Remain. Liberal Democrats - 17 MPs The Lib Dems also want to stay in the EU and have another referendum to achieve their goal - to revoke Article 50 (the law that sees the UK having to leave the bloc). Democratic Unionist Party - 10 MPs The DUP has a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives, giving them their support in the Commons. They are backing the PM's plans to leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of October. The Independent Group for Change - 5 MPs This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour because of their positions on Brexit (as well as allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party). They back another referendum, or ""People's Vote"", and want the UK to remain in the EU. Plaid Cymru - 4 MPs The Welsh Party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting out in the referendum. They want a further referendum and to Remain. Green Party - 1 MP The party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, has been a vocal campaigner for another referendum and believes the UK should stay in the EU.

"Up to 30,000 delegates are expected to attend A major United Nations climate change summit will take place in Glasgow. The UK has won the bid to host the 26th Conference of the Parties, known as COP26, following a partnership with Italy. Up to 30,000 delegates are expected to attend the event at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus (SEC) at the end of next year. It is designed to produce an international response to the climate emergency. The Scottish Events Campus includes the Armadillo and the SSE Hydro The UK will host the main COP summit while Italy will host preparatory events and a significant youth event, as part of the agreement. Claire Perry, UK nominated president for COP26, said: ""In 2020, world leaders will come together to discuss how to tackle climate change on a global scale - and where better to do so than Glasgow, one of the UK's most sustainable cities with a great track record for hosting high-profile international events."" The Scottish government's Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the decision to host COP26 in Scotland was right ""given our leadership on climate action"". She continued: ""Scotland was one of the first countries in the world to acknowledge the global climate emergency and the Scottish government has introduced the toughest targets in the UK to ensure our action matches the scale of our climate ambitions. ""We look forward to working collaboratively with partners to deliver an ambitious and effective conference that ensures Scotland plays a leading role to help promote the increased global effort to tackle climate change."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the announcement was a ""vote of confidence"" from the UK's international partners. He added: ""The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change. We're the first major economy to pass laws to end the UK's contribution to global warming. ""Since 1990 the UK has reduced its emissions by over 40% while growing the economy by over two thirds."" The UK government said it had cut greenhouse gas emissions by 16 million tonnes in the last eight years. Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said: ""The UK government is showing great leadership on this vital issue - becoming the first major economy to pass new laws to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050.""

The conference has been described as the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Lasting for two weeks, it would be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, with up to 200 world leaders expected to attend for the final weekend. 2020's conference is seen as a major crossroads in the battle against global climate change. It will likely be held just after the next US presidential election. It will also be the year in which governments are due to review their promises to cut carbon emissions in line with the latest science. The stark photo highlighting Greenland's ice loss UK government to commit to 2050 target EU leaders face pressure to deliver on climate change Campaigners have said the event will give the UK the chance to set the tone for the world's future. Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg appeared at the 2018 conference in Poland. It is expected to pose major security challenges for the Scottish government and police. Sources have told BBC Scotland that police will seek additional funding from the Scottish and UK governments. Deputy chief constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Police Scotland has an enviable reputation for successfully and safely policing major events. ""We will now start the detailed process of planning, with partners, for what will be a complex and expensive policing operation to support COP26 and to ensure a safe and secure event."" Intense, overcrowded and bewildering - a few impressions from UN climate conferences I've reported from over the years. They're a rare chance for the world to get together to tackle climate change but because the stakes are high the atmosphere is always tense. The negotiations are complicated - with long arguments over phrases or even individual words. They regularly drag through the night leaving delegates exhausted. In Montreal back in 2005, at dawn on the final day, the then British environment secretary Margaret Beckett wept with relief when a deal was reached. In Copenhagen in 2009, some environmental campaigners were so frustrated with the lack of progress that they walked out - while at the same time other campaigners, who had staged a march outside the conference centre, battled with police in an effort to get inside. The gathering in Paris in 2015 was one of the smoothest, clever French diplomacy navigating towards a landmark deal, what's called the Paris Agreement. A system of voluntary cuts in carbon emissions, it formally comes into effect next year. The Whitehall view is that this is an extraordinary opportunity. But it also means there's a huge responsibility now on British shoulders. Glasgow could host UN climate change summit UK 'likely' to host key climate meeting Do you know this pooch?

"Germany's Ursula von der Leyen will replace Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November Incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has named her choices for the EU's new top team. Those on her list face some difficult challenges, including handling the UK's exit from the 28-nation bloc and the fight against climate change. If approved by the European Parliament, Mrs von der Leyen's executive team will be the most gender-diverse in EU history, with 13 women and 14 men. There is no UK nominee, as Brexit is currently scheduled for 31 October. That exit date is the day before the new Commission takes office. MEPs will hold confirmation hearings for each nominee. Based in Brussels, the Commission is in charge of enforcing EU rules and the bloc's treaties. It is the only EU body that can draft laws. Mrs von der Leyen, Germany's former defence minister, will officially replace Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November. Where does von der Leyen stand on the big issues? What does Europe's top job involve? The new executive team of 27 - one for each member state - is planned to be in place for five years. BBC reporter Adam Fleming says the appointments are considered hugely significant in Brussels - akin to the Oscars film awards - with national pride at stake. Mrs von der Leyen's list features some new posts within the Commission, but who are the key players? Nominee for Trade Commissioner In his current role as EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, the former Irish government minister has criticised the UK government's attitude during Brexit negotiations and what he has called the ""tough guy approach"" of some ""Brexiteers"". Mr Hogan described what he said was Britain's poor grasp of the importance of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border issue as ""disheartening"". He has warned the UK that it faces ""a huge gap between hope and experience"" when it begins operating its own trade policy. Earlier this year, the 59-year-old warned plans published by the UK government for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit were an attempt ""to break EU unity"" over the Irish border issue. On Tuesday, Mrs von der Leyen described Mr Hogan as an ""excellent"" negotiator, adding that he would be ""very fair but determined"". Nominee for Vice-President and Protecting Our European Way of Life Known to be extremely careful about what he does and does not say, the current EU Commission spokesman and member of Greece's governing centre-right party New Democracy has been outspoken about Brexit. Mr Schinas, 57, has pushed the UK to provide ""clarification"" on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain after Brexit. He has also said that in a no-deal scenario, it would be ""pretty obvious"" that there would be a hard border on the island of Ireland - meaning checks on people and goods. If approved for the role, Mr Schinas will oversee migration, security, employment and education. Nominee for Executive Vice-President for European Green Deal Currently First Vice-President of the Commission, the centre-left politician has already shown a preparedness to tackle the climate crisis, helping to steer through EU legislation banning plastic straws. The multilingual 58-year-old could now see himself helping to implement further environmental policies, which will be at the heart of the EU's agenda for the next five years. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first ""climate-neutral"" continent He has also previously negotiated the EU's 2016 deal with Turkey to reduce the flow of migrants and has warned of the risks of nationalism. ""People who used to vote for my party and many parties here are now voting for nationalist parties, sometimes even extremist parties. That's our fault,"" he said in June. Nominee for Executive Vice-President, Europe Fit for the Digital Age A big name in Danish politics, Ms Vestager has spent the past five years as EU competition commissioner, spearheading EU anti-trust investigations that have ended in big fines for US technology giants Google and Apple. Her nomination may cause technology firms to sit up and take note. She has already earned the wrath of US President Donald Trump: ""Your tax lady, she really hates the US,"" he is reported to have told her boss, Jean-Claude Juncker. But Ms Vestager believes companies must pay their way. Ms Vestager, 51, is a member of the European liberal group Renew Europe. She gained ground in the European elections earlier this year and was among the nominees for Mrs von der Leyen's role. She has previously served as Denmark's economy and interior minister.

"The DUP's meeting with the PM comes as pressure grows on Downing Street to reach a deal with the EU Boris Johnson has confirmed his rejection of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit deadlock, the DUP has said. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party had a ""very good meeting"" with the prime minister in Downing Street. The DUP had insisted the government would not back such a proposal as it would not have ""unionist consent"". In a statement, it said a deal without cross-community support is ""doomed to failure"". Could a no-deal still happen on 31 October? No-deal Brexit 'would be a failure' - Johnson Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Red Lines: Barnier, bigfooting & the backstop In the statement, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister had ""confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland-only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland"". A Number 10 spokesman said the 50-minute meeting was ""positive"". The meeting with Mr Johnson came as pressure grows on Downing Street to reach a deal with the EU ahead of a key summit in October. The prime minister has insisted he will not seek an extension to the Brexit deadline if there is no agreement with the EU. The DUP has said it wants a ""sensible deal"", but will not support any arrangement that could see Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK. Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson met outside Government Buildings in Dublin on Monday In Dublin on Monday, Mr Johnson said he hadan ""abundance of proposals"" to replace the Irish border backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, until a wider solution is found. The idea of a NI-only backstop was first suggested early in the Brexit negotiations. Former PM Theresa May rejected it in 2018 because she relied on the votes of the 10 DUP MPs in Parliament. The Irish government has said it is willing to look at a ""Northern-Ireland specific solution"". On Tuesday, Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan told RTÃ thatthere is ""movement"" happening on both sides,externalof the Brexit negotiations. Proposed by the EU, it would have kept Northern Ireland in the EU's customs union, which would have meant applying EU tariffs for goods entering NI from outside the EU customs union - including Great Britain. It would also have applied EU single market rules for goods and animal products in Northern Ireland. This would have got rid of the need for checks at the Irish border, but would have led to checks on goods passing between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It was criticised by the DUP and other unionist parties for ""creating a border in the Irish Sea"" and posing a risk to the union. In February 2018, Theresa May saidno prime minister could back such a proposal. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The main difference between the original backstop and the agreed solution is in relation to customs. In the backstop agreed by the UK and EU in November 2018, the whole of the UK, would be included in a ""temporary customs territory"" with the EU. Some pro-Brexit MPs claimed the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. It would also see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC the proposal would ""run contrary to the principles at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement that say there should be no change to the relationship between Northern Ireland and Great Britain unless there is consent for it"". ""There would not be unionist consent for such an arrangement."" On Monday night, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party was prepared to look at ""arrangements"" to maintain all-island agri-food regulations - but only under a previously agreed role for the devolved assembly at Stormont. Non-unionist political parties in Northern Ireland support the backstop and would be happy if the UK and EU agreed to an NI-only backstop. The Ulster Unionist Party also opposes a backstop in any form, and claims unionists in Northern Ireland are being ""hung out to dry"". However, business and farming groups in Northern Ireland have urged support for a backstop, saying it is an acceptable way to protect cross-border trade. Johnson's plan for a deal?

"This video can not be played Sir Geoffrey Boycott told Today he 'couldn't give a toss' about knighthood criticism Geoffrey Boycott has said he ""couldn't give a toss"" about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood in her resignation honours list. Domestic abuse charities and Labour said the honour should be removed from the ex-cricketer, who wasconvicted of beating his girlfriend in 1998.,external Boycott, who has always denied the assault, later questioned why the issue had been raised by the media. Mrs May's list of 57 names was made up of mostly political figures. Every departing prime minister can draw up a resignation honours list. Mrs May announced her resignation in June after failing to get support for the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated for the UK to leave the EU. Which notable people have lost knighthoods? Guide to the Honours What's the difference between OBE, MBE and CBE? The former prime minister showed her love of cricket with knighthoods for Boycott and fellow formerEngland captain Andrew Strauss. Boycott was fined Â£5,000 and given a three-month suspended sentence in 1998 after being convicted of beating his then-girlfriend Margaret Moore in a French Riviera hotel. During the trial, the court heard Boycott pinned Miss Moore down and punched her 20 times in the face before checking out and leaving her to pay the bill. Boycott denied the allegations, saying Miss Moore had slipped after flying into a rage when he refused to marry her. Mrs May, who introduced a landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to Parliament earlier this year, was accused of sending a ""dangerous message"" by Women's Aid's co-acting chief executive Adina Claire. She said the honour ""should be taken away"" from Boycott, adding that it sent ""completely the wrong message"" to survivors of domestic abuse. This video can not be played Women's Aid co-leader Adina Claire says the knighthood sends 'a terrible message' Asked about the criticism from Women's Aid by presenter Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Boycott responded: ""I don't give a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago so you can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it."" The 78-year-old, who is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team for the current Ashes series, added: ""It's very difficult to prove your innocence in another country, in another language. ""I have to live with it - and I do. I'm clear in my mind, and I think most people in England are, that it's not true."" This video can not be played Geoffrey Boycott said his knighthood had been soured In a subsequent interview, Boycott said that the day had been ""soured"" by Radio 4 ""setting me up"", saying the station's agenda had been to talk about domestic violence and ""make publicity"". He told BBC's Look North Yorkshire: ""Is that what interviewing is about - is it always to ask difficult questions? Shouldn't it be just a nice day for me? ""I said I don't give a toss about her [Ms Claire from Woman's Aid], not domestic violence. That's not something anyone should feel good about."" A spokesperson for the Today programme said the question was ""entirely appropriate... given the concerns raised about Geoffrey Boycott's knighthood by Women's Aid and others"". Boycott scored 8,114 runs in 108 Tests for England from 1964 to 1982 The shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, joined the call for Boycott's knighthood to be rescinded. ""Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister's favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is,"" she said, adding that the whole system needed ""radically overhauling"". And former Spice Girl Melanie Browntweeted,externalthat Boycott was ""a disgrace to Yorkshire"", saying the ""perpetrators of domestic abuse shouldn't be held up as heroes EVER"". The Woman's Trust charity said it was ""disappointed"" to see Boycott included in the honour's list because it either suggested that, despite his conviction, he was believed over the survivor, or his fame meant it did not matter.

Boycott also had to apologise in 2017,externalafter joking that he would have to ""black up"" to be given a knighthood, reportedly saying they were handed out to West Indian cricketers ""like confetti"". Mrs May once compared her determination to delivering Brexit with the fighting spirit in Boycott's batting marathons. Telling journalists he was one of her sporting heroes,she said in November 2018: ""Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end."" Since his retirement from cricket, Boycott has gone on to become a successful broadcaster and is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team. A BBC spokesperson said: ""He is a world renowned cricketer and employed for his knowledge and expertise of the sport."" The government checks all nominees are suitable for an honour, including whether they have paid their taxes. However, Mrs May's resignation honours list would not have gone through the same review process as nominations for the New Year and Queen's Birthday honours. In those cases, a specific committee, for example one including figures from the world of sport, would consider the nominations before they go before the main honours committee. In contrast, people nominated for resignation honours only undergo propriety and probity checks by the Cabinet Office. Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill were Mrs May's closest advisers before the 2017 general election The 37 men and 20 women on Mrs May's list include members of Downing Street staff, political aides and lifelong supporters of the Conservative Party. It includes recipients from all four nations of the UK as well as non-political figures and members of civic society. Labour said the honours rewarded ""big Tory donors and No 10 cronies"". Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, Mrs May's former chiefs of staff who left their jobs after the 2017 general election in which the Conservatives lost their majority in the Commons, become Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, or CBEs. The former prime minister's chief EU negotiator Olly Robbins receives a knighthood. The senior civil servant helped to create Mrs May's Brexit deal before it was defeated in Parliament three times. It has been announcedthat Mr Robbins is to join investment bank Goldman Sachs. There is also a knighthood for her former director of communications, Robbie Gibb. When her predecessor David Cameron awarded a knighthood to his own head of communications, Craig Oliver, Mrs May laterjoked that she ""retched violently"" at seeing his name on the list. Gavin Barwell, left, and Olly Robbins are honoured by former PM Theresa May Gavin Barwell, the former Tory MP who Mrs May brought in as her chief of staff to replace Mr Timothy and Ms Hill, is one of eight new Conservative peers. Sir Kim Darroch - who wasforced to resignas ambassador to the US after comments he made about President Trump were leaked - has been made a crossbench peer. Boris Johnson, who was then running in the Tory leadership contest prior to becoming prime minister, was criticised at the time for not showing enough support for Sir Kim. Meanwhile, there is a damehood for Cressida Dick, whose police career started at the age of 23 aftera brief spell working in a fish-and-chip shop.She is one of just a few non-political figures on Mrs May's list. Sir Simon Woolley, the founder of operation Black Vote, and Ruth Hunt, the ex-chief executive of Stonewall, have been made crossbench life peers. British Empire Medals, or BEMs, have been awarded to Graham Howarth and Debra Wheatley - Mrs May's head chef at Chequers and housekeeper at Downing Street respectively. The list of peerages - which sees those appointed sit in the House of Lords - include several nominated by other parties to sit on their benches. Among them are former NUT general secretary Christine Blower, for Labour, and former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will become the party's second peer in the House of Lords. The Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, said Mrs May's list was ""substantially smaller"" than those drawn up by predecessors, helping to reduce the size of the House of Lords. Several MPs have received honours: Sir Patrick McLoughlin, Conservative MP for Derbyshire Dales (Companion of Honour) George Hollingbery, Conservative MP for Meon Valley (Knighthood) David Lidington, Conservative MP for Aylesbury (Knighthood) Charles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne (Knighthood) Brandon Lewis, Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth (CBE) Julian Smith, Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripon (CBE) Seema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble (OBE) John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw and an independent government adviser on anti-Semitism, received a non-affiliated peerage. Mr Mann isstanding down as MP,citing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the party's anti-Semitism crisis. Margaret Ritchie, who was leader of the SDLP in Northern Ireland between 2010 and 2011, also received a non-affiliated peerage. She said she wouldremain ""SDLP to the core""even though she has had to quit the party to become a peer. The former South Down MP made history in 2010 when shebecame the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a remembrance poppy. A source close to Mrs May said the list ""recognises the many different people who have made a significant contribution to public life"" during her political career. Criticising Mrs May's choices, Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""It comes as no surprise that big Tory donors and Number 10 cronies are being honoured yet again. ""The Tories only care about looking after their own and will only stand up for the wealthy few who fund them."" The SNP's Pete Wishart accused Mrs May of ""handing out peerages like sweeties"", adding that it was the ""worst kind of cronyism"". Which notable people have lost knighthoods?

It included details such as what contraception was used, when periods were due and the type of symptoms experienced. Since the investigation, one app said it was changing its privacy policies. Menstruation apps collect some of the most intimate data imaginable - from general health, to information about sex, moods, what the user eats, drinks and even what sanitary products she uses.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Taking a slowfie with the iPhone 11 Apple has unveiled its iPhone 11 range of handsets, which feature more cameras than before and a processor that has been updated to be faster while consuming less power. The company said the two Pro models would last between four to five hours longer than their XS predecessors. But it did not launch a 5G model, and some rumoured features were missing. Apple also revealed a new version of its smartwatch, which features an ""always on"" display for the first time. The Series 5 Watch adjusts how often it refreshes the screen to as little as one frame per second as well as dimming the image to promise the same 18-hour battery life as the previous version. The new Apple Watch line-up becomes available on 20 September It also introduces a compass as well as the option of a titanium case. Its new operating system will alert owners to when nearby noise rises to risky levels, and adds menstrual cycle-tracking. ""I love strategically where Apple is going with its health and safety capabilities, but was disappointed to not see a sleep study or feature mentioned,"" commented analyst Patrick Moorhead. The company added that it will keep its Series 3 model on the market, which will cost $199 - or Â£199 in the UK - marking a new entry price point for the wearable. Allow Twitter content?

Apple currently accounts for 49% of the global smartwatch market, according to research firm IDC. It is also the UK's top-selling smartphone brand by a wide margin. The new iPhones are notable for introducing an ""ultrawide"" rear camera, offering 2x optical zoom-out. The iPhone 11 Pro is said to last four hours more than before, while the Pro Max is said to last five hours longer The Pro models retain the telephoto and normal lenses found in the last generation's XS and XS Max, while the basic iPhone 11 only has an ultrawide and standard lens. Apple made a virtue of a new Night Mode, which automatically brightens the image when required while taking steps to minimise the digital noise produced as a result. Google, Samsung and Huawei had already introduced a similar feature to their handsets. Apple said the image on the left shows Night Mode turned off, while the one on the right is when it is on A new facility called Deep Fusion was also teased. It takes nine snaps with a variety of exposures and then picks through them ""pixel by pixel"" to combine the best parts from each to create a superior image. This will not, however, be available at launch but should be added via a software update before the year's end. Other enhancements include the ability to shoot slow-motion videos with the front camera. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The handsets' processor - the A13 Bionic - has also been upgraded. Apple claims its CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) are more powerful than those featured in any Android phone. In addition, the chip's ""neural engine"" has been optimised to better handle matrix calculations - a type of algebra used by neural networks - and is said to be 20% faster than the A12. However, the new models are not compatible with Apple's Pencil stylus, as had been expected by many. That feature was already offered by its lowest-end iPad. Nor can they wirelessly recharge other devices, unlike Samsung and Huawei's premium phones. The entry-level iPhone 11 is said to last up to one hour longer than the earlier XR The handsets also stick with having lightning ports rather than making the shift to USB-C, as has happened with the iPad Pro - which could have made faster data transfers possible. The iPhone 11 is slightly cheaper than its XR forerunner in the UK, ranging between Â£729 and Â£879 depending on the amount of storage. But the Pro models are more expensive than the XS ones, costing between Â£1,049 and Â£1,499. They go on sale in 10 days time. Apple experienced a bigger drop in demand for new handsets than many of its rivals over the past year. But the firmrecently reported that its active install base,external- the number of iPhones in use - was at an ""all time high"". ""Several forces play here,"" commented Marta Pinto from IDC. ""Apple designs devices that last longer than an average Android device, and it's been very good at rolling out new versions of its operating system. ""There's also a very good second-hand trade in iPhones, and the overall smartphone market is slowing down. ""But Apple doesn't mind because its focus is now turning to services, and its wearables are also doing well."" Trump's tariffs puts Apple's golden goose at risk The new iPhone line-up does not feature a 5G model, in part because Intel struggled to develop the required modem. Sir Jony Ive attended the event despite announcing he was leaving Apple in June At a time when consumers are holding onto their handsets for longer before upgrading, that could place a further constraint on sales - especially in countries where 5G networks have already launched, such as the UK. ""Given people's loyalty to iPhone, if they really want 5G they'll probably just wait,"" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. Apple CEO Tim Cook took a selfie with attendees ""That said, don't be surprised to see rivals, particularly Samsung, positioning 5G devices as 'future-proof' options. ""I'm sure they will be arguing that buying a premium priced 4G smartphone right now would be like buying a TV a few years ago that was not HD-Ready."" Earlier at the event, chief executive Tim Cook revealed that Apple's two forthcoming subscription services would each cost $4.99 - or Â£4.99 in the UK - per month.

It will be followed by Apple TV+ - a television programme and movie-streaming platform with content not available elsewhere - which will make its first shows available on 1 November. The latter will be cheaper than rival services from Disney and Netflix, but appears to promise less material at this stage. ""I applaud web access to Apple TV+, but would have preferred an Android and Windows app,"" commented Mr Moorhead. See - a fantasy show set in the future starring Jason Momoa - is one of the shows that will be offered by Apple TV+ There was no mention of Apple bundling the new services with its existing cloud storage, news and music offerings for a discount, as had been speculated.

It has now been nearly 13 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. Apple has since become one of the world's most valuable companies, in part because of investors' hopes that it can pull off a similar trick. ""Everyone wants Apple to have a new 'wow' product and its got a pretty good track record,"" commented Mr Wood. ""But the next big hit is proving elusive right now. My money is still on smart glasses but I think it could still be years before we see anything."" These updates are less about bringing in new features, but enhancing the things we're already familiar with. The iPhone Pro's camera setup is being aimed at - as you might guess - professionals. I think Apple sees big potential in indie filmmakers and documentary-makers. The battery-life bump should also help. Apple TV+ is cheap compared to its competitors. But is it good value? Disney+, Netflix, HBO et al have huge back catalogues of loved TV shows and movies. Apple doesn't, or at least it's not clear what it will have, even one year from now. All Apple really has is a boatload of cash to fill up Apple TV+ with content it hopes people will like. We've seen no evidence, yet, that it's capable of fulfilling that goal. Giving one year's access away with new devices is a way of making sure those new shows have wide exposure - but it needs to convince the entertainment industry that it's worth making a show for Apple+ instead of its rivals. Kyocera VP-210 VisualPhone (1999) Although there is some dispute over which mobile first featured a built-in colour camera, many credit this handset as having the honour. It featured a 0.11 megapixel (MP) sensor and could only store 20 selfies, but was able to transmit a jerky video feed in real-time at about two frames per second. Sharp J-SH04 (2000) Sharp's first photo-snapping mobile placed its sensor on the rear of its handset to encourage its use as an alternative to standard cameras. Its 0.11MP snaps could then be sent to friends via email. Sony Ericsson T68i (2002) The handset's optional CommuniCam MCA-20 accessory snapped on to the bottom of the handset, helping keep down the phone's size when not in use. It was limited to taking VGA (0.3MP) resolution shots, but the images could be texted to others via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) if they had compatible phones. Samsung D500 (2004) This was one of the first handsets to offer more than one megapixel of image quality. What's more it had a flash. Meanwhile the software made it possible to add graphical frames around photos and turn images sepia or apply a ""negative"" effect. Nokia N90 (2005) Nokia's N90 had a somewhat clunky swivel design, but a two megapixel sensor and a lens developed in collaboration with the famed German optics firm Carl Zeiss pitched it firmly at camera enthusiasts. Samsung G800 (2007) The megapixel wars were well under way by the time Samsung unveiled the G800. It took 5MP shots, had a 3x optical zoom and even featured a lens-cover slider, meaning that from the rear it could be easily mistaken for a dedicated camera. iPhone 4 (2010) Apple's fourth-generation iPhone is widely credited with helping kickstart the selfie craze, despite being far from the first to have a front camera. But at its launch, Steve Jobs was keener to show off how the feature could be used for Facetime, the firm's video chat app. LG Optimus 3D (2011) Smartphones with two rear cameras were still a rarity when LG's Android phone went on sale. It used them to create 3D images that could be viewed without special glasses on its display. But 3D phones proved to be as unpopular as 3D TVs, marking an evolutionary dead end for the industry. HTC One (2013) HTC's 2013 flagship sought to shift the battle to low-light photography. To do this it made the pixels larger than normal to gather more light, and dubbed them ""ultrapixels"". The trade-off was that its photos were limited to 4MP. Nokia Lumia 1020 (2014) This Windows Phone featured an industry-leading 41MP  sensor attached to an optical image stabilisation system. It allowed users to zoom in and crop without worrying about images becoming blurred, or to combine the data to make 5MP photos with less visual noise than would otherwise be the case. Lenovo Phab2Pro (2016) This was the first handset to build in Google's doomed Project Tango depth and motion-sensing cameras. They made augmented reality features possible, such as superimposing graphical images of furniture into views of a room. Tango was short-lived, but AR has lived on by other means. Samsung Note 8 (2017) This was one of the first phones to feature ""live focus"" - a facility that allowed users to adjust background blur in their photos before or after taking them. It achieved this by comparing the view from each of its two rear cameras to create a depth map of the scene. iPhone X (2017) Apple's tenth anniversary handset introduced its Face ID camera system, which used tens of thousands of infrared dots to map the user's features. As a consequence, the display had to make space for a ""notch"", which was widely copied by rivals even if they didn't feature such an elaborate facial recognition system. Pixel 2 (2017) Google found a way to let users blur the background of their photos using a single camera in its second-generation Pixel. This made it possible to offer the effect from both its front-facing selfie camera as well as the rear sensor. Huawei P20 Pro (2018) The Chinese firm's phone was one of the first to feature three cameras on its back. But the standout feature was its ability to produce quality snaps in near-dark conditions by taking long-exposure snaps and then using machine learning software to keep the details crisp. Oppo Reno 10x Zoom (2019) This had two unusual camera features. Firstly, one of the rear cameras has a periscope design that directs light sideways into the device's body, making it possible to let users zoom into a shot more than usual without sacrificing detail. Secondly, the selfie camera pops up from the top, making more space for the display. Hands-on with iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.

"This video can not be played Sir Geoffrey Boycott told Today he 'couldn't give a toss' about knighthood criticism Geoffrey Boycott has said he ""couldn't give a toss"" about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood in her resignation honours list. Domestic abuse charities and Labour said the honour should be removed from the ex-cricketer, who wasconvicted of beating his girlfriend in 1998.,external Boycott, who has always denied the assault, later questioned why the issue had been raised by the media. Mrs May's list of 57 names was made up of mostly political figures. Every departing prime minister can draw up a resignation honours list. Mrs May announced her resignation in June after failing to get support for the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated for the UK to leave the EU. Which notable people have lost knighthoods? Guide to the Honours What's the difference between OBE, MBE and CBE? The former prime minister showed her love of cricket with knighthoods for Boycott and fellow formerEngland captain Andrew Strauss. Boycott was fined Â£5,000 and given a three-month suspended sentence in 1998 after being convicted of beating his then-girlfriend Margaret Moore in a French Riviera hotel. During the trial, the court heard Boycott pinned Miss Moore down and punched her 20 times in the face before checking out and leaving her to pay the bill. Boycott denied the allegations, saying Miss Moore had slipped after flying into a rage when he refused to marry her. Mrs May, who introduced a landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to Parliament earlier this year, was accused of sending a ""dangerous message"" by Women's Aid's co-acting chief executive Adina Claire. She said the honour ""should be taken away"" from Boycott, adding that it sent ""completely the wrong message"" to survivors of domestic abuse. This video can not be played Women's Aid co-leader Adina Claire says the knighthood sends 'a terrible message' Asked about the criticism from Women's Aid by presenter Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Boycott responded: ""I don't give a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago so you can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it."" The 78-year-old, who is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team for the current Ashes series, added: ""It's very difficult to prove your innocence in another country, in another language. ""I have to live with it - and I do. I'm clear in my mind, and I think most people in England are, that it's not true."" This video can not be played Geoffrey Boycott said his knighthood had been soured In a subsequent interview, Boycott said that the day had been ""soured"" by Radio 4 ""setting me up"", saying the station's agenda had been to talk about domestic violence and ""make publicity"". He told BBC's Look North Yorkshire: ""Is that what interviewing is about - is it always to ask difficult questions? Shouldn't it be just a nice day for me? ""I said I don't give a toss about her [Ms Claire from Woman's Aid], not domestic violence. That's not something anyone should feel good about."" A spokesperson for the Today programme said the question was ""entirely appropriate... given the concerns raised about Geoffrey Boycott's knighthood by Women's Aid and others"". Boycott scored 8,114 runs in 108 Tests for England from 1964 to 1982 The shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, joined the call for Boycott's knighthood to be rescinded. ""Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister's favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is,"" she said, adding that the whole system needed ""radically overhauling"". And former Spice Girl Melanie Browntweeted,externalthat Boycott was ""a disgrace to Yorkshire"", saying the ""perpetrators of domestic abuse shouldn't be held up as heroes EVER"". The Woman's Trust charity said it was ""disappointed"" to see Boycott included in the honour's list because it either suggested that, despite his conviction, he was believed over the survivor, or his fame meant it did not matter.

Boycott also had to apologise in 2017,externalafter joking that he would have to ""black up"" to be given a knighthood, reportedly saying they were handed out to West Indian cricketers ""like confetti"". Mrs May once compared her determination to delivering Brexit with the fighting spirit in Boycott's batting marathons. Telling journalists he was one of her sporting heroes,she said in November 2018: ""Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end."" Since his retirement from cricket, Boycott has gone on to become a successful broadcaster and is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team. A BBC spokesperson said: ""He is a world renowned cricketer and employed for his knowledge and expertise of the sport."" The government checks all nominees are suitable for an honour, including whether they have paid their taxes. However, Mrs May's resignation honours list would not have gone through the same review process as nominations for the New Year and Queen's Birthday honours. In those cases, a specific committee, for example one including figures from the world of sport, would consider the nominations before they go before the main honours committee. In contrast, people nominated for resignation honours only undergo propriety and probity checks by the Cabinet Office. Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill were Mrs May's closest advisers before the 2017 general election The 37 men and 20 women on Mrs May's list include members of Downing Street staff, political aides and lifelong supporters of the Conservative Party. It includes recipients from all four nations of the UK as well as non-political figures and members of civic society. Labour said the honours rewarded ""big Tory donors and No 10 cronies"". Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, Mrs May's former chiefs of staff who left their jobs after the 2017 general election in which the Conservatives lost their majority in the Commons, become Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, or CBEs. The former prime minister's chief EU negotiator Olly Robbins receives a knighthood. The senior civil servant helped to create Mrs May's Brexit deal before it was defeated in Parliament three times. It has been announcedthat Mr Robbins is to join investment bank Goldman Sachs. There is also a knighthood for her former director of communications, Robbie Gibb. When her predecessor David Cameron awarded a knighthood to his own head of communications, Craig Oliver, Mrs May laterjoked that she ""retched violently"" at seeing his name on the list. Gavin Barwell, left, and Olly Robbins are honoured by former PM Theresa May Gavin Barwell, the former Tory MP who Mrs May brought in as her chief of staff to replace Mr Timothy and Ms Hill, is one of eight new Conservative peers. Sir Kim Darroch - who wasforced to resignas ambassador to the US after comments he made about President Trump were leaked - has been made a crossbench peer. Boris Johnson, who was then running in the Tory leadership contest prior to becoming prime minister, was criticised at the time for not showing enough support for Sir Kim. Meanwhile, there is a damehood for Cressida Dick, whose police career started at the age of 23 aftera brief spell working in a fish-and-chip shop.She is one of just a few non-political figures on Mrs May's list. Sir Simon Woolley, the founder of operation Black Vote, and Ruth Hunt, the ex-chief executive of Stonewall, have been made crossbench life peers. British Empire Medals, or BEMs, have been awarded to Graham Howarth and Debra Wheatley - Mrs May's head chef at Chequers and housekeeper at Downing Street respectively. The list of peerages - which sees those appointed sit in the House of Lords - include several nominated by other parties to sit on their benches. Among them are former NUT general secretary Christine Blower, for Labour, and former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will become the party's second peer in the House of Lords. The Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, said Mrs May's list was ""substantially smaller"" than those drawn up by predecessors, helping to reduce the size of the House of Lords. Several MPs have received honours: Sir Patrick McLoughlin, Conservative MP for Derbyshire Dales (Companion of Honour) George Hollingbery, Conservative MP for Meon Valley (Knighthood) David Lidington, Conservative MP for Aylesbury (Knighthood) Charles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne (Knighthood) Brandon Lewis, Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth (CBE) Julian Smith, Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripon (CBE) Seema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble (OBE) John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw and an independent government adviser on anti-Semitism, received a non-affiliated peerage. Mr Mann isstanding down as MP,citing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the party's anti-Semitism crisis. Margaret Ritchie, who was leader of the SDLP in Northern Ireland between 2010 and 2011, also received a non-affiliated peerage. She said she wouldremain ""SDLP to the core""even though she has had to quit the party to become a peer. The former South Down MP made history in 2010 when shebecame the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a remembrance poppy. A source close to Mrs May said the list ""recognises the many different people who have made a significant contribution to public life"" during her political career. Criticising Mrs May's choices, Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""It comes as no surprise that big Tory donors and Number 10 cronies are being honoured yet again. ""The Tories only care about looking after their own and will only stand up for the wealthy few who fund them."" The SNP's Pete Wishart accused Mrs May of ""handing out peerages like sweeties"", adding that it was the ""worst kind of cronyism"". Which notable people have lost knighthoods?

"CNN said President Trump's meeting with Russia's Sergei Lavrov in 2017 had spooked the CIA More details have emerged of an alleged high-level spy the US reportedly extracted from Russia amid fears his cover was about to be blown. Russian media named him as Oleg Smolenkov, who worked for a key aide to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Smolenkov was not senior, had been fired years ago and the extraction reports were fiction, the Kremlin said. A CNN report said,externalthe CIA had feared President Trump's ""mishandling"" of intelligence could put the spy at risk. CNN said the extraction came after the president met senior Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the White House in May 2017 and had unexpectedly shared classified US intelligence. How defectors come in from the cold Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered G20: Trump jokes to Putin about Russian meddling The CIA said CNN's reporting of the extraction was ""misguided"" and ""simply false"". Later US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the report as ""materially inaccurate"". CNN released the initial report on Monday, citing ""multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge"" of the extraction operation. The alleged agent was not named by US media but it was claimed the intelligence asset was the highest-level US source inside Russia, with regular access to President Putin. This video can not be played Why did Trump give information to the Russians in the White House? The reporter who broke the story explains The reports said the source had spied for the US for more than a decade. The New York Times said the agent was instrumental in the conclusion by US intelligence agencies in 2016 that Mr Putin had personally orchestrated Russia's interference in the US presidential election. However, its report said the CIA had wanted to extract the agent before Mr Trump took office because investigations by media were putting the asset at risk. There was no suggestion President Trump had directly compromised the source, it said. On Tuesday, CNN quoted sources who had served under Mr Trump as sayingthe president had repeatedly expressed his opposition to using overseas spies,externalbecause it damaged relations with other nations. Russian media quickly came up with the name of OlegÂ Smolenkov. The Kommersant newspaper said he had gone on holiday with his family to Montenegro in 2017 and disappeared, before a man with the same name and a woman with the same name as Mr Smolenkov's wife purchased a house in the US state of Virginia, near Washington DC. Law enforcement sources told Kommersant that Moscow had investigated whether Mr Smolenkov had been killed in Montenegro, but concluded he was now living abroad. Without naming the alleged agent at the request of US officials, NBC News said one of its reporters had visited the Virginia home on Monday and found the man was ""living openly under his true name"". The reporter was tracked by two men in an SUV when he rang the doorbell, NBC said. Russian reports said Mr Smolenkov had worked for Yury Ushakov, a senior foreign policy aide to President Putin and a former Russian ambassador to the US. Mr Smolenkov was with Mr Ushakov in the US for a number of years until the latter was recalled in 2008. A former colleague told RIA Novosti that Mr Smolenkov handled administrative affairs such as purchases for the embassy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov: ""This is more the genre of pulp fiction, crime reading"" Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: ""It is true that Smolenkov worked in the presidential administration but he was fired several years ago. His job was not at a senior official level."" He could not confirm whether Mr Smolenkov was a spy nor why he had been sacked, but added: ""All this US media speculation about who urgently extracted who and saved who from who and so on - this is more the genre of pulp fiction, crime reading, so let's leave it up to them."" Mr Lavrov said he did not know Mr Smolenkov. ""I have never seen him, I have never met him, and I have neither kept track of his career nor his movements,"" the foreign minister said. He added that no state secrets had been divulged at the White House meeting with Mr Trump. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Getting an agent out of Moscow can be challenging but what comes after can be even harder. During the Cold War, British and American intelligence came up with an array of plans to extract agents. The most dramatic was the smuggling of KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky across the Finnish border in the boot of an MI6 officer's car. That was particularly difficult since he was already under suspicion. If an agent is not under watch then it is easier for them to simply disappear on a work trip or holiday. But that is not the end of the story. Russian (and formerly) Soviet intelligence has shown a willingness and desire to go after such agents after they have fled. The most recent example was Sergei Skripal (who had left in a swap after being pardoned). That means that protecting agents after they settle in the West and providing them with long-term security can be as challenging as getting them out in the first place. It sounds like the makings of a John le CarrÃ© espionage novel. A high-level intelligence asset - one who provided key information about an attempt to sabotage a US presidential election - is extracted from Russia in the face of potentially grave danger. If multiple media reports are to be believed, however, this is real life - and the US political consequences could be significant. The episode highlights the US intelligence community's concerns about Donald Trump and his associates in the early days of his presidency. It reflects a conclusion that an undisciplined commander-in-chief could pose a national security risk - even if only inadvertently. Those concerns were already public knowledge, of course, but this is the most dramatic example of their consequences. The Trump administration has vehemently denied the reporting. The president, who has spent much of his time feuding with, and occasionally directly condemning, the US intelligence community - the so-called ""deep state"" - surely will be furious. This revelation will only make White House tensions with, and suspicions about, the personnel who provide the president with clandestine information about world affairs all the more acute.

"Up to 30,000 delegates are expected to attend A major United Nations climate change summit will take place in Glasgow. The UK has won the bid to host the 26th Conference of the Parties, known as COP26, following a partnership with Italy. Up to 30,000 delegates are expected to attend the event at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus (SEC) at the end of next year. It is designed to produce an international response to the climate emergency. The Scottish Events Campus includes the Armadillo and the SSE Hydro The UK will host the main COP summit while Italy will host preparatory events and a significant youth event, as part of the agreement. Claire Perry, UK nominated president for COP26, said: ""In 2020, world leaders will come together to discuss how to tackle climate change on a global scale - and where better to do so than Glasgow, one of the UK's most sustainable cities with a great track record for hosting high-profile international events."" The Scottish government's Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the decision to host COP26 in Scotland was right ""given our leadership on climate action"". She continued: ""Scotland was one of the first countries in the world to acknowledge the global climate emergency and the Scottish government has introduced the toughest targets in the UK to ensure our action matches the scale of our climate ambitions. ""We look forward to working collaboratively with partners to deliver an ambitious and effective conference that ensures Scotland plays a leading role to help promote the increased global effort to tackle climate change."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the announcement was a ""vote of confidence"" from the UK's international partners. He added: ""The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change. We're the first major economy to pass laws to end the UK's contribution to global warming. ""Since 1990 the UK has reduced its emissions by over 40% while growing the economy by over two thirds."" The UK government said it had cut greenhouse gas emissions by 16 million tonnes in the last eight years. Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said: ""The UK government is showing great leadership on this vital issue - becoming the first major economy to pass new laws to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050.""

The conference has been described as the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Lasting for two weeks, it would be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, with up to 200 world leaders expected to attend for the final weekend. 2020's conference is seen as a major crossroads in the battle against global climate change. It will likely be held just after the next US presidential election. It will also be the year in which governments are due to review their promises to cut carbon emissions in line with the latest science. The stark photo highlighting Greenland's ice loss UK government to commit to 2050 target EU leaders face pressure to deliver on climate change Campaigners have said the event will give the UK the chance to set the tone for the world's future. Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg appeared at the 2018 conference in Poland. It is expected to pose major security challenges for the Scottish government and police. Sources have told BBC Scotland that police will seek additional funding from the Scottish and UK governments. Deputy chief constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Police Scotland has an enviable reputation for successfully and safely policing major events. ""We will now start the detailed process of planning, with partners, for what will be a complex and expensive policing operation to support COP26 and to ensure a safe and secure event."" Intense, overcrowded and bewildering - a few impressions from UN climate conferences I've reported from over the years. They're a rare chance for the world to get together to tackle climate change but because the stakes are high the atmosphere is always tense. The negotiations are complicated - with long arguments over phrases or even individual words. They regularly drag through the night leaving delegates exhausted. In Montreal back in 2005, at dawn on the final day, the then British environment secretary Margaret Beckett wept with relief when a deal was reached. In Copenhagen in 2009, some environmental campaigners were so frustrated with the lack of progress that they walked out - while at the same time other campaigners, who had staged a march outside the conference centre, battled with police in an effort to get inside. The gathering in Paris in 2015 was one of the smoothest, clever French diplomacy navigating towards a landmark deal, what's called the Paris Agreement.

"The store was a three-month experiment said Sainsbury's Tills have been reinstalled in an experimental till-less shop opened by supermarket Sainsbury's. It had been totally refurbished to remove the entire checkout area, freeing up shop assistants to help customers on the shop floor. Customers had to scan their groceries using Sainsbury's Pay & Go app, paying for them as they went around the shop. But it resulted in long queues at the helpdesk as people attempted to pay for their groceries in the traditional way. Sainsbury's said it had learned ""a huge amount"" from the experiment. Launching the three-month experiment at its Holborn store, group chief digital officer Clodagh Moriarty said executives ""were excited to understand how our customers respond to the app experience"". But this week, Sainsbury's saidin a blogpost,external: ""It's clear that not all our customers are ready for a totally till-free store.""

"Lady Usher of the Black Rod, Sarah Clarke, is the first woman to hold the post Black Rod plays a key role in the State Opening of Parliament, which took place on Wednesday 17 July. The House of Lords official liaises between the upper chamber and the House of Commons during a number of important Parliamentary events. Black Rodis one of the most senior officers in the House of Lords,external, and participates in major ceremonial events in the Palace of Westminster. Their full title is Lady or Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. Sarah Clarke was appointed Lady Usher of the Black Rod in November 2017, formally taking up the role in February 2018. She isthe first female holder of the position in its 650-year history. Black Rod's role in theState Opening of Parliament,externalis one of the most well-known moments in the parliamentary calendar. After being sent from the House of Lords, Black Rod knocks on the door of the House of Commons, to summon MPs for the King's Speech. Traditionally, the door of the Commons is slammed in Black Rod's face. Black Rod is best-known for the role performed at the beginning of the State Opening of Parliament He or she then has to knock three times on the door with the rod to gain entry, before it is opened and MPs follow Black Rod back to the upper chamber. The refusal to let Black Rod enter at the first knock is widely believed to symbolise the Commons' independence from the Crown. However, Erskine May, the ""bible"" of parliamentary procedure, says the custom isto allow the Commons to establish Black Rod's identity,external. Black Rod also plays a key role inthe selection of the House of Commons Speaker. They summon MPs to the House of Lords to receive the King's instructions to appoint the Speaker. As well as organising ceremonial events, Black Rod - who can earn up to Â£93,000 a year - manages a team of 30 staff involved in the day-to-day running of the House of Lords. Their deputy is calledthe Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod,external. What is the King's Speech and why is it important? Key points in King's Speech at a glance What is the House of Lords and how does it work? The title Black Rod comes from the ebony staff, topped with a golden lion, carried by the holder. The earliest known reference to ""the Usher to the Order of the Garter"" is in letters patent - a written order from a monarch granting an office, right or title to an individual - from 1361. There are thought to have been 60 holders of the position since then. Black Rod's uniform consists of black shoes, buckles, breeches and a coat, as well as silk stockings. The position of Black Rod also exists in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Ms Clarke was previously in charge of organising the Wimbledon tennis championships. Prior to that, she worked for the London Marathon, UK Sport, and on four Olympic Games - including London 2012. Accepting the role of Black Rod in 2017, she said: ""I am both deeply honoured and delighted to be invited to take up the role."" She said the House of Lords was ""a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none"".

"Wages have continued to grow at a strong pace and employment remains at record highs,official figures show.,external Earnings excluding bonuses grew at an annual pace of 3.8% in the May to July period, down slightly from the previous reading. Including bonuses, wages rose at an annual pace of 4% - the highest rate since mid-2008. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.8%, while the estimated employment rate remained at a record 76.1%. Click here to take part in a short study,externalabout this article run by the University of Cambridge. The number of available jobs was at its lowest level since November 2017, with David Freeman from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) saying: ""Vacancies continue to fall back from recent record highs, with much of this decline coming from small businesses."" He added: ""The employment rate has remained fairly constant at a joint record high for some months now, while the unemployment rate was last lower at the end of 1974. ""Including bonuses, wages are now growing at 4% a year in cash terms for the first time since 2008. Once adjusted for inflation, they have now gone above 2% for the first time in nearly four years."" If you prefer to be ""half-full"", you will be happy that in the three months from May to July, the ONS recorded the fastest pay rise (including bonuses) for more than 11 years. If you're more ""half-empty"" you may note that if you strip out the effect of inflation, pay including bonuses is still Â£23 less than it was more than 11 years ago. Similarly, a half-full view might note that employment is at a new record of 32.8 million people. A half-empty one might say it's not always a good thing that more women now have to work into their 60s because they can no longer claim the state pension. There is no doubt, though, that the labour market remains tighter - tighter than it was a year ago -  and that employees are benefiting, especially in sectors such as construction where there are shortages of labour. Some of that tightness, however, may now be easing, with vacancies continuing to drop from their recent record highs. There was a total of 32.78 million people aged 16 or over in employment. The increase in employment has been mainly driven by more women in work, the ONS said, which is partly down to the rise in the state pension age, meaning fewer retire between the ages of 60 and 65. There was a rise of 284,000 employed women over the year to a total of 15.52 million. Male employment also rose by 86,000 to reach 17.26 million, mainly because of rising numbers of self-employed. However, the number of people aged between 16 and 64 considered economically inactive continued to rise, increasing by 6,000 to 8.59 million. Employment Minister Mims Davies said the figures indicated the labour market was ""booming"", adding that it was ""especially pleasing to see continued record female employment"". And Chancellor Sajid Javid said the wage data showed ""that people across the country are taking home more every week"". But shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The slowdown in job creation is a concern with the current uncertainty over Brexit, and average pay still has not returned to the level it was in 2008. ""For millions of people, the reality of work is one of low pay and insecurity."" Debapratim De, UK economist at Deloitte, warned ""the glory days of rapidly falling unemployment could be behind us"". He added that the figures indicated ""a tight labour market and further gains in consumer spending power"". What is the UK's GDP? The dos and don'ts of getting a pay rise Government offers 'inflation-busting' pay rises And Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The renewed fall in the unemployment rate distracts from an otherwise troubling labour market report. ""Brexit uncertainty undoubtedly has sapped firms' enthusiasm for hiring new workers, but sharply rising unit labour costs also are playing a role."" However, PwC economist Jing Teow said evidence of continued jobs growth, together withthe stronger-than-expected growth figures released on Monday, ""reinforces our view that the UK should avoid a technical recession in the third quarter"". He added that the accounting giant predicted ""potential GDP growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of 2019. This would more than reverse the 0.2% GDP decline seen in the second quarter"".

"Germany's Ursula von der Leyen will replace Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November Incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has named her choices for the EU's new top team. Those on her list face some difficult challenges, including handling the UK's exit from the 28-nation bloc and the fight against climate change. If approved by the European Parliament, Mrs von der Leyen's executive team will be the most gender-diverse in EU history, with 13 women and 14 men. There is no UK nominee, as Brexit is currently scheduled for 31 October. That exit date is the day before the new Commission takes office. MEPs will hold confirmation hearings for each nominee. Based in Brussels, the Commission is in charge of enforcing EU rules and the bloc's treaties. It is the only EU body that can draft laws. Mrs von der Leyen, Germany's former defence minister, will officially replace Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November. Where does von der Leyen stand on the big issues? What does Europe's top job involve? The new executive team of 27 - one for each member state - is planned to be in place for five years. BBC reporter Adam Fleming says the appointments are considered hugely significant in Brussels - akin to the Oscars film awards - with national pride at stake. Mrs von der Leyen's list features some new posts within the Commission, but who are the key players? Nominee for Trade Commissioner In his current role as EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, the former Irish government minister has criticised the UK government's attitude during Brexit negotiations and what he has called the ""tough guy approach"" of some ""Brexiteers"". Mr Hogan described what he said was Britain's poor grasp of the importance of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border issue as ""disheartening"". He has warned the UK that it faces ""a huge gap between hope and experience"" when it begins operating its own trade policy. Earlier this year, the 59-year-old warned plans published by the UK government for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit were an attempt ""to break EU unity"" over the Irish border issue. On Tuesday, Mrs von der Leyen described Mr Hogan as an ""excellent"" negotiator, adding that he would be ""very fair but determined"". Nominee for Vice-President and Protecting Our European Way of Life Known to be extremely careful about what he does and does not say, the current EU Commission spokesman and member of Greece's governing centre-right party New Democracy has been outspoken about Brexit. Mr Schinas, 57, has pushed the UK to provide ""clarification"" on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain after Brexit. He has also said that in a no-deal scenario, it would be ""pretty obvious"" that there would be a hard border on the island of Ireland - meaning checks on people and goods. If approved for the role, Mr Schinas will oversee migration, security, employment and education. Nominee for Executive Vice-President for European Green Deal Currently First Vice-President of the Commission, the centre-left politician has already shown a preparedness to tackle the climate crisis, helping to steer through EU legislation banning plastic straws. The multilingual 58-year-old could now see himself helping to implement further environmental policies, which will be at the heart of the EU's agenda for the next five years. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first ""climate-neutral"" continent He has also previously negotiated the EU's 2016 deal with Turkey to reduce the flow of migrants and has warned of the risks of nationalism. ""People who used to vote for my party and many parties here are now voting for nationalist parties, sometimes even extremist parties. That's our fault,"" he said in June. Nominee for Executive Vice-President, Europe Fit for the Digital Age A big name in Danish politics, Ms Vestager has spent the past five years as EU competition commissioner, spearheading EU anti-trust investigations that have ended in big fines for US technology giants Google and Apple. Her nomination may cause technology firms to sit up and take note. She has already earned the wrath of US President Donald Trump: ""Your tax lady, she really hates the US,"" he is reported to have told her boss, Jean-Claude Juncker. But Ms Vestager believes companies must pay their way. Ms Vestager, 51, is a member of the European liberal group Renew Europe. She gained ground in the European elections earlier this year and was among the nominees for Mrs von der Leyen's role. She has previously served as Denmark's economy and interior minister.

"The government's Brexit legislation is on hold as the UK gears up for the general election on 12 December. But where do the parties stand on Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to leave the European Union (EU) with the revised deal he agreed. He says that with a majority Conservative government,he would start the process to ""get Brexit done"" on day one,externalof the new Parliament. He previously said the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"". However, Mr Johnson was forced to write a Brexit extension letter to the EU, after MPs failed to approve his revised deal. Mr Johnson secured changes to the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May. It includes scrappingthe controversial Irish backstopand replacing it witha new customs arrangement. Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal has not yet been approved by the UK Parliament Brexit left the Conservative Party heavily divided, with 21 MPs expelled for failing to follow the government's line. Ten were later welcomed back. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Key Conservative Party manifesto promises explained If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. It says it will achieve this within six months. Labour says its referendumwould be a choice between a ""sensible"" Leave option versus Remain.,external Under its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a ""close"" single market relationship. This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. If a referendum was held,Mr Corbyn has said he would remain neutralif he was prime minister ""so I can credibly carry out the results"". Just like the Conservatives, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"". While Labour's election strategy early on was to emphasise that the vote was about more than Brexit, it is changing its focus. The message now is thatLabour's leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Mr Johnson's deal- it wants to find what it believes is a better one. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Key Labour Party manifesto promises explained The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum,externalon Brexit. Alternatively,it wants Article 50 revokedif it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""catastrophic"" The SNP's ultimate objective is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the EU. SNP launch: Scotland's Remain party? The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit if they win power at the general election. Party leader Jo Swinson says a Lib Dem majority government would cancel Brexit The policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference. If the Lib Dems do not win a majority, they would support another referendum. Leader Jo Swinson says thatstopping Brexit would free up Â£50bn, over five years, to spend on public services. She says that so-called ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra money for schools and to help support low-paid workers. Lib Dems promise Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit Key Lib Dems manifesto promises explained The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had an agreement with the Conservatives whereby it lent it support in the Commons during the last Parliament. However,while the DUP wants the UK to leave the EU,,externalit opposes elements of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal which relate to Northern Ireland,. The DUP is unhappy with the revised Brexit deal At its manifesto launch,the party said it will seek further changes to the dealif he is still prime minister after the election. The deal includes special arrangements for Northern Ireland. One gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a majority vote on how customs arrangements would work after Brexit. The DUP wants such a vote to be taken on a cross-community basis, rather than a straight majority. Johnson 'should seek Brexit deal changes' This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour, in part because of their positions on Brexit. It backs another referendum, or ""People's Vote"",,externaland wants the UK to remain in the EU. The party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting Leave in the referendum.It wants a further referendum,externaland to Remain.

"Menstruation apps track users' fertility Intimate data, including when people have had sex, is being shared with Facebook, a study from Privacy International has suggested. PI studied a range of period-tracking apps,externalto see exactly what information was shared with the social network. It included details such as what contraception was used, when periods were due and the type of symptoms experienced. Since the investigation, one app said it was changing its privacy policies. Menstruation apps collect some of the most intimate data imaginable - from general health, to information about sex, moods, what the user eats, drinks and even what sanitary products she uses. In exchange for this, the app will offer the user the dates of the month she is most fertile or when to expect her next period. PI published what it says Facebook sees - ""Purpose: Get Pregnant"" would provide invaluable insights to advertisers Sharing to Facebook happens via the social network's software development kit (SDK), tools that can be used by apps to help them make money by reaching advertisers who, in turn, provide users with personalised ads. PI found the most popular apps in this category - Period Tracker, Period Track Flo and Clue Period Tracker did not share data with Facebook. But others - such as Maya by Plackal Tech (which has 5 million downloads on Google Play), MIA by Mobapp Development Limited (1 million downloads) and My Period Tracker by Linchpin Health (more than 1 million downloads) - did. PI said: ""The wide reach of the apps that our research has looked at might mean that intimate details of the private lives of millions of users across the world are shared with Facebook and other third parties without those users' free unambiguous and informed or explicit consent, in the case of sensitive personal data, such as data relating to a user's health or sex life."" On being shown the study, Maya told PI that it had ""removed both the Facebook core SDK and Analytics SDK from Maya"" with the changes coming into effect almost immediately. It said it would continue to use Facebook Ad SDK for those who had agreed to its terms and conditions and privacy policy, but added that no ""personally identifiable data or medical data"" is shared. In a statement to the BBC it added: ""All data accessed by Maya are essential to the proper functioning of the product.

"This video can not be played A charity says councils have powers to take over some homes to bring them back into use There are more than 27,000 empty privately-owned homes in Wales, up more than 40% since 2010, figures show. The scale of the problem has been described as a ""wasted resource"" when so many people need affordable homes. Shelter Cymru said councils have powers to take over some homes to bring them back into use, but do not out of a fear of ""getting it wrong"". The Welsh Government said it had given councils Â£40m to bring empty properties back into use. Shelter Cymru wants a simpler process introduced - such as in Scotlandwhere councils can take over and auction empty homes. Homes often remain empty because authorities are unable to contact the owner, the owner cannot afford to renovate when needed or are waiting for the property market to improve. Thousands of new council homes over next 20 years Austerity 'hits' affordable housing Builders' woes 'add to housing shortage' Empty homes can attract vandalism, drug use and anti-social behaviour, while flats above shops are particularly difficult to return to use. John Puzey, director of housing charity Shelter Cymru, said: ""We know when you reduce empty homes, you reduce crime and vandalism. ""We also know there are a lot of people who are desperately seeking affordable homes. ""So if we can put empty homes in an appropriate place and the right conditions together with people who need them, it's a win-win situation."" Mr Puzey said there was a lot of variation in policy and practises of local councils. ""It's complicated. There are things called empty dwelling management orders and compulsory purchase orders but actually there has been no empty dwelling management order issued in Wales for at least the last three years, if not longer. ""There's these powers there that could be used but not being used. Why is that? Possibly a lack of expertise or concern that they might get it wrong."" The number of empty home has gone up by 8,200 since 2010 Wales has 27,213 empty private homes, figures from Data Cymru for 2018-19 showed, compared to the earliest set of available StatsWales figures - 18,980 in 2009-10 - a rise of 43%. Allan Morris, a councillor in Newport which has more than 7,000 households looking for affordable homes and 1,199 empty private homes, said: ""When you're desperate and see a premises just degenerating it's very difficult to understand why you can't put two and two together, why homeless families can't use those premises. ""It's absolutely frustrating, it's heartbreaking in many cases."" Stuart Ropke, the chief executive of the housing charity Community Housing Cymru said housing associations were ""well placed to work with local authorities and the private sector to bring homes back into use"". However, in evidence submitted to a group of AMs on the Equality, Local Government and Communities committee, Community Housing Cymru said: ""Even if all 27,000 of the estimated empty homes were returned to use, this would only meet housing need and demand in Wales for just over two years."" The Welsh Government - which aims tobuild 20,000 affordable homes by 2021- said: ""We have provided councils with Â£40m to help bring empty properties back into use and we expect the number of empty homes to fall over the next two years. ""We are also improving ourHouses to Homes,externalscheme to simplify our grants and loan process and have established a new enforcement team to help councils tackle empty homes.""

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""We will commit to a public vote"" Jeremy Corbyn has promised a further referendum on Brexit with a ""credible Leave option"" versus Remain if his party wins the next general election. He said Labour was ""ready"" for the campaign, but its ""priority"" was to stop a no-deal Brexit. Its manifesto will promise to reach a better Brexit deal, but is not expected to commit to either Leave or Remain. Some senior party figures - close Corbyn allies - say they will campaign to stay in the EU in any circumstances. They include shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who have both said remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal. Union leaders want Leave on the ballot and met Mr Corbyn earlier to discuss the issue. What would the parties do about Brexit? Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Corbyn: PM shifting power to wealthy Watson: Labour's hunt for Brexit 'reconciliation' The BBCs political correspondent, Iain Watson, said senior Labour figures had been arguing that backing Remain would recover ground lost to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats in recent elections. Pro-Remain Labour activists are also hoping the party's conference later this month will commit the leadership to backing Remain under all circumstances. But, while Labour-affiliated unions - including Unite, who are one of the party's biggest backers - would rather stay in the EU than have no deal, they believe a Corbyn government should offer voters a choice in a referendum between a negotiated deal and Remain. Speaking to the TUC conference in Brighton on Tuesday, he said: ""Our priority is first to stop no-deal and then to trigger a general election. ""No one can trust the word of a prime minister who is threatening to break the law to force through no deal. ""So a general election is coming, but we won't allow Johnson to dictate the terms."" He added: ""We're ready for that election. We're ready to unleash the biggest people-powered campaign we've ever seen. ""And in that election we will commit to a public vote with a credible option to leave and the option to remain."" The basis of Labour's election policy on Brexit became clear today. Jeremy Corbyn agreed with Labour's significant funders - the affiliated trade unions - that if elected, the party would negotiate a new Brexit deal and put that to a referendum, along with the option to remain. But the party will not say which option it would back during a general election. So, during an imminent campaign, the leadership will be unable to tell voters if a future Labour government would advocate coming out or staying in the EU. The Labour leader has rejected calls from senior figures in the party and grassroots activists to campaign explicitly to Remain during the election, amid fears votes and seats will be lost to the Lib Dems. Today's union meeting was described as a senior Labour source as ""decisive"" in determining policy because the unions are formally represented on the committee which draws up the manifesto, so have huge influence over it. Labour insiders hope to confine any disagreements on Brexit to a referendum, but sources admit the election campaign will be difficult to manage, as some shadow cabinet members have said they'd personally campaign to Remain even against a Labour deal. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Corbyn also promised to ""put power in the hands of workers"", pledging a future Labour government would enact ""the biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen."" If elected, Labour would set up a specific government department for employment rights, he said, and give the brief to a dedicated cabinet minister. Enforcement of rights would be boosted by a new agency with the power to enter workplaces and bring prosecutions on behalf of staff, he added. Conservatives - 288 MPs Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"". He says he wants to leave with a deal, but is willing to exit without one to ensure Brexit goes ahead by the current deadline. SNP - 35 MPs The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum on Brexit, and if it were to get one, would support Remain. Liberal Democrats - 17 MPs The Lib Dems also want to stay in the EU and have another referendum to achieve their goal - to revoke Article 50 (the law that sees the UK having to leave the bloc). Democratic Unionist Party - 10 MPs The DUP has a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives, giving them their support in the Commons. They are backing the PM's plans to leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of October. The Independent Group for Change - 5 MPs This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour because of their positions on Brexit (as well as allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party). They back another referendum, or ""People's Vote"", and want the UK to remain in the EU. Plaid Cymru - 4 MPs The Welsh Party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting out in the referendum. They want a further referendum and to Remain. Green Party - 1 MP The party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, has been a vocal campaigner for another referendum and believes the UK should stay in the EU.

"President Trump jokes with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergei Kislyak The US extracted a high-level spy from inside Russia in 2017, reports say. Citing ""multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge"" of the operation,CNN reported,externalthat US intelligence feared the source's cover could be blown by US officials. The decision was made soon after a meeting in which President Trump unexpectedly shared classified US intelligence with Russian officials. Reports said the mole was the highest-level US source inside Russia. Reporting by CNN andthe New York Times,externalsaid the source was outside the inner circle of Russian leader President Putin but had regular access to Mr Putin and was even able to photograph documents on the leader's desk. How defectors come in from the cold Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered G20: Trump jokes to Putin about Russian meddling The covert source reportedly spied for the US for more than a decade as they rose through the ranks of the Russian government. According to the New York Times, the source was instrumental in the conclusion by US intelligence agencies in 2016 that Mr Putin had personally orchestrated Russia's interference in the US presidential election. The source's information was so sensitive that then-CIA director John Brennan prepared special sealed files for President Obama, rather than include it in the president's ordinary briefing, the Times report said. The CIA - the intelligence agency said to have run the mole - declined to comment on the apparent revelations. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said CNN's reporting was ""not only incorrect"" but had ""the potential to put lives in danger"". Russian media named the spy as former presidential administration official OlegÂ Smolenkov. The Kommersant newspaper said Mr Smolenkov went on holiday with his family to Montenegro in 2017 and disappeared, before a man with the same name and a woman with the same name as Mr Smolenkov's wife purchased a house in the US state of Virginia, near Washington DC. Russian reports said Mr Smolenkov had worked for Yury Ushakov, a senior aide to President Putin. Asked by the BBC on Tuesday about the reports, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Mr Smolenkov had worked for the presidential administration but denied that he had held a high-level position, adding that he had been sacked. Mr Peskov described the US media coverage of the reported extraction as ""pulp fiction"". Asked whether the Kremlin was concerned about Russian counter-intelligence, he said, ""Russian counter intelligence is working fine"". NBC news reported on Tuesday that it had visited the home in the Washington area it understood to belong to the exfiltrated agent, but the network said its correspondent, upon knocking on the door, was questioned by two men who approached in a car but declined to identify themselves. The CIA reportedly first tried to extract the mole soon after a now-infamous meeting between President Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and then-Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, at which Mr Trump was said to have shared classified operational details which could have exposed a US confidential source. Other officials present at the meeting reportedly realised the president's mistake and scrambled to inform the CIA and other intelligence agencies. But the Russian mole reportedly refused the initial extraction attempt, citing family concerns - a move which threw the CIA for a time into doubt over the source's trustworthiness. Months later, the CIA tried again and the source agreed to be exfiltrated. There was no suggestion on Tuesday that President Trump directly compromised the source in Russia, and reports said that widespread media speculation about US intelligence conclusions had contributed to the decision to extract the source. Last year, Russian operatives travelled to England and used a nerve agent in an assassination attempt against a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, who had spied for the British. And in 2006, Russian operatives killed a former intelligence officer, Alexander Litvinenko, in central London by poisoning his tea with radioactive material, according to British investigators.

The PM said ""loads of people"" wanted an agreement, but he was prepared to leave without one if ""absolutely necessary"". Parliament will not resume sitting until 14 October, three days before a crucial Brexit summit of EU leaders. The PM, who has met the leadership of Northern Ireland's DUP, said claims this was undemocratic were ""nonsense"". Amid unprecedented scenes in the Commons early on Tuesday, some MPs protested against the suspension with signs saying ""silenced"" while shouting: ""Shame on you."" Where do the parties now stand on Brexit? PM rejects NI-only backstop solution, says DUP Could no deal still happen on 31 October? But Mr Johnson rejected claims this was an affront to democracy, saying the opposition parties were given the chance of an election before the Brexit deadline on 31 October but had spurned it.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised a further referendum on Brexitwith a ""credible Leave option"" versus Remain if he wins the next general election - but the party is unlikely to commit to either option in its manifesto. The prime minister held an hour of talks with Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds in Downing Street. Mrs Foster, whose party has propped up the Conservative government since the 2017 election, issued a statement later indicating it would not support any revised version of Theresa May's Brexit agreement which separated Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. She said renewed talk of a so-called Northern Ireland-only backstop, which would see it remain in the customs union and be bound by EU rules for goods and animal products while the rest of the UK was not, would be ""unacceptable"".

Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""A sensible deal, between the United Kingdom and European Union which respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, is the best way forward for everyone,"" she said. ""History teaches us that any deal relating to Northern Ireland which cannot command cross community support is doomed to failure. That is why the Northern Ireland backstop is flawed. ""During today's meeting, the prime minister confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland."" This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Monday? The Irish border has proved a key sticking point in attempts to agree a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The government has indicated it could support harmonised rules for the agriculture and food sector to prevent the need for any sanitary and other health checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But it has distanced itself from reports that plans for a single EU-UK customs territory in the current withdrawal agreement - rejected three times by MPs - could be replaced with a specific Northern Ireland only ""backstop"" arrangement. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Where might room for backstop compromise lie? Brexit: All you need to know Although official negotiations with the EU have yet to restart, the bloc's new trade commissioner said it was positive the UK seemed prepared to ""accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK"".

During the five-week suspension, parties will hold their annual conferences but no debates, votes or committee scrutiny sessions will take place. Boris Johnson will not face Prime Minister's Questions until the period is over and his scheduled questioning by the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday has been cancelled. Sarah Wollaston, the Lib Dem chair of the committee, said the PM had gone back on earlier ""reassurances"" that he would appear,telling BBC's Newsnight,externalshe was ""appalled"" that he was ""running away from scrutiny"". Parliament's suspension means MPs will not get a third chance to vote for an early election until they return, meaning a poll would not be possible until November at the earliest.

"Hundreds of thousands of people in England are getting hooked on prescription drugs, health chiefs fear. A Public Health England review looked at the use of strong painkillers, antidepressants and sleeping tablets - used by a quarter of adults every year. It found that at the end of March 2018 half of people using these drugs had been on them for at least 12 months. Officials said long-term use on such a scale could not be justified and was a sign of patients becoming dependent. The hell of my prescription drug withdrawal The prescription drug flooding the UK Why opioids are such an American problem PHE medical director Prof Paul Cosford said he was worried. ""These medicines have many vital clinical uses and can make a big difference to people's quality of life."" But he added there were too many cases where patients were using them for longer than ""clinically"" appropriate - where the drugs would have simply stopped working effectively or where the risks could outweigh the benefits. ""We need to make sure people are helped to access alternative treatments,"" he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors did not like prescribing medication long-term, but were sometimes left with no choice. ""What it indicates is the severe lack of alternatives."" NHS England said investment was being made in services such as talking therapies and so-called social prescribing, which includes exercise classes and arts-based activities, that could be more appropriate. Katie was addicted to painkillers for 10 years after having her appendix out in hospital and then being misdiagnosed - she was suffering from endometriosis that was not spotted. At one point, she was taking 24 painkillers a day. ""I became a recluse. I put on weight. ""I chose taking painkillers over going out with my friends. ""It affected my relationships."" She said for years she did not get any help, until she was sent to the Bridge Project, a charity in Bradford that works with people with drugs problems. With their support, including counselling, she managed to wean herself off painkillers and has not taken them since the end of last year. ""There are some hard days. But I have got my life back now."" Five classes of medicines were included in the review - asked for by government amid concern that large numbers of people were misusing prescription drugs. They were: Antidepressants Opioid painkillers for acute pain and injury (excluding use in cancer patients) Gabapentinoids (used to treat epilepsy, anxiety and nerve-related pain) Benzodiazepines (mostly prescribed for anxiety) Z-drugs (sleeping tablets) The number of prescriptions being issued has been rising for some time - partly because of the ageing population - although there are signs their use is slowing. To assess the levels of dependency, PHE officials analysed patient data to find out exactly how many people were taking these drugs outside of hospitals and for how long. Half of people who were using the drugs in March 2018 had been on them for a year or more with about a quarter having used them for at least three years. Rates of prescribing were higher in deprived areas and among women. How long each drug should be used varies. Opioid-based painkillers should only be used for short periods so the fact that there were 1.2 million people on them for at least a year - 540,000 of whom had been taking them for at least three years - was extremely worrying, PHE said. Antidepressants by comparison take some time to become fully effective so it is not surprising to find people using them for a long time. But there were nearly 1 million people using them who had been on them for at least three years, which rang alarm bells, PHE said. Officials said the scale of that long-term use suggested those with mild-to-moderate depression may have become dependent on them. For the other drugs, there was only a minority of cases where long-term use was appropriate, PHE said. Prof John Read, of the British Psychological Society, said the findings were ""alarming"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the report should act as a ""wake-up call"". ""I refuse to let this escalate to the level seen in the US."" PHE said patients should not simply stop taking their drugs. Instead, they are urging patients to speak to their GP, who are being told to do more to review the use of these medications and seek alternative solutions. Doctors say any attempt to tackle dependency needs to involve a gradual reduction in use and dosage. Alternatives such as talking therapies can be used instead of antidepressants, while linking people in with social activities, such as arts groups, can help reduce isolation and depression and tailored activity programmes and physio may be used to tackle pain. PHE said it was not clear if this scale of long-term use of prescription drugs was causing harm - although each drug does have side-effects, including weight gain and placing stress on the heart, kidney and lungs. But they said long-term use meant tolerance could build up and treatments could stop being effective or require patients to up the doses they were taking, while any reduction in use could lead to withdrawal symptoms. The misuse of prescription drugs - and in particular opioid-based painkillers - is a major problem in the US. Prescription rates have risen sharply since the late 1990s - and there are signs attempts to crack down on this have driven people into the illegal market for drugs. Deaths from opioid overdoses have more than doubled in the past decade in the US. PHE said what is being seen in England is not yet on that scale. Prescription rates are four times lower in England than the US and deaths from overdoses have not increased at such a rate. In fact, PHE said opioid prescriptions were also lower than in many other European nations. ""We want to get on top of this now before we see the problems that have been seen elsewhere,"" Prof Cosford added.

"President Trump jokes with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergei Kislyak The US extracted a high-level spy from inside Russia in 2017, reports say. Citing ""multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge"" of the operation,CNN reported,externalthat US intelligence feared the source's cover could be blown by US officials. The decision was made soon after a meeting in which President Trump unexpectedly shared classified US intelligence with Russian officials. Reports said the mole was the highest-level US source inside Russia. Reporting by CNN andthe New York Times,externalsaid the source was outside the inner circle of Russian leader President Putin but had regular access to Mr Putin and was even able to photograph documents on the leader's desk. How defectors come in from the cold Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered G20: Trump jokes to Putin about Russian meddling The covert source reportedly spied for the US for more than a decade as they rose through the ranks of the Russian government. According to the New York Times, the source was instrumental in the conclusion by US intelligence agencies in 2016 that Mr Putin had personally orchestrated Russia's interference in the US presidential election. The source's information was so sensitive that then-CIA director John Brennan prepared special sealed files for President Obama, rather than include it in the president's ordinary briefing, the Times report said. The CIA - the intelligence agency said to have run the mole - declined to comment on the apparent revelations. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said CNN's reporting was ""not only incorrect"" but had ""the potential to put lives in danger"". Russian media named the spy as former presidential administration official OlegÂ Smolenkov. The Kommersant newspaper said Mr Smolenkov went on holiday with his family to Montenegro in 2017 and disappeared, before a man with the same name and a woman with the same name as Mr Smolenkov's wife purchased a house in the US state of Virginia, near Washington DC. Russian reports said Mr Smolenkov had worked for Yury Ushakov, a senior aide to President Putin. Asked by the BBC on Tuesday about the reports, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Mr Smolenkov had worked for the presidential administration but denied that he had held a high-level position, adding that he had been sacked. Mr Peskov described the US media coverage of the reported extraction as ""pulp fiction"". Asked whether the Kremlin was concerned about Russian counter-intelligence, he said, ""Russian counter intelligence is working fine"". NBC news reported on Tuesday that it had visited the home in the Washington area it understood to belong to the exfiltrated agent, but the network said its correspondent, upon knocking on the door, was questioned by two men who approached in a car but declined to identify themselves. The CIA reportedly first tried to extract the mole soon after a now-infamous meeting between President Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and then-Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, at which Mr Trump was said to have shared classified operational details which could have exposed a US confidential source. Other officials present at the meeting reportedly realised the president's mistake and scrambled to inform the CIA and other intelligence agencies. But the Russian mole reportedly refused the initial extraction attempt, citing family concerns - a move which threw the CIA for a time into doubt over the source's trustworthiness. Months later, the CIA tried again and the source agreed to be exfiltrated. There was no suggestion on Tuesday that President Trump directly compromised the source in Russia, and reports said that widespread media speculation about US intelligence conclusions had contributed to the decision to extract the source. Last year, Russian operatives travelled to England and used a nerve agent in an assassination attempt against a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, who had spied for the British. And in 2006, Russian operatives killed a former intelligence officer, Alexander Litvinenko, in central London by poisoning his tea with radioactive material, according to British investigators.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""We will commit to a public vote"" Jeremy Corbyn has promised a further referendum on Brexit with a ""credible Leave option"" versus Remain if his party wins the next general election. He said Labour was ""ready"" for the campaign, but its ""priority"" was to stop a no-deal Brexit. Its manifesto will promise to reach a better Brexit deal, but is not expected to commit to either Leave or Remain. Some senior party figures - close Corbyn allies - say they will campaign to stay in the EU in any circumstances. They include shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who have both said remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal. Union leaders want Leave on the ballot and met Mr Corbyn earlier to discuss the issue. What would the parties do about Brexit? Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Corbyn: PM shifting power to wealthy Watson: Labour's hunt for Brexit 'reconciliation' The BBCs political correspondent, Iain Watson, said senior Labour figures had been arguing that backing Remain would recover ground lost to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats in recent elections. Pro-Remain Labour activists are also hoping the party's conference later this month will commit the leadership to backing Remain under all circumstances. But, while Labour-affiliated unions - including Unite, who are one of the party's biggest backers - would rather stay in the EU than have no deal, they believe a Corbyn government should offer voters a choice in a referendum between a negotiated deal and Remain. Speaking to the TUC conference in Brighton on Tuesday, he said: ""Our priority is first to stop no-deal and then to trigger a general election. ""No one can trust the word of a prime minister who is threatening to break the law to force through no deal. ""So a general election is coming, but we won't allow Johnson to dictate the terms."" He added: ""We're ready for that election. We're ready to unleash the biggest people-powered campaign we've ever seen. ""And in that election we will commit to a public vote with a credible option to leave and the option to remain."" The basis of Labour's election policy on Brexit became clear today. Jeremy Corbyn agreed with Labour's significant funders - the affiliated trade unions - that if elected, the party would negotiate a new Brexit deal and put that to a referendum, along with the option to remain. But the party will not say which option it would back during a general election. So, during an imminent campaign, the leadership will be unable to tell voters if a future Labour government would advocate coming out or staying in the EU. The Labour leader has rejected calls from senior figures in the party and grassroots activists to campaign explicitly to Remain during the election, amid fears votes and seats will be lost to the Lib Dems. Today's union meeting was described as a senior Labour source as ""decisive"" in determining policy because the unions are formally represented on the committee which draws up the manifesto, so have huge influence over it. Labour insiders hope to confine any disagreements on Brexit to a referendum, but sources admit the election campaign will be difficult to manage, as some shadow cabinet members have said they'd personally campaign to Remain even against a Labour deal. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Corbyn also promised to ""put power in the hands of workers"", pledging a future Labour government would enact ""the biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen."" If elected, Labour would set up a specific government department for employment rights, he said, and give the brief to a dedicated cabinet minister. Enforcement of rights would be boosted by a new agency with the power to enter workplaces and bring prosecutions on behalf of staff, he added. Conservatives - 288 MPs Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"". He says he wants to leave with a deal, but is willing to exit without one to ensure Brexit goes ahead by the current deadline. SNP - 35 MPs The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum on Brexit, and if it were to get one, would support Remain. Liberal Democrats - 17 MPs The Lib Dems also want to stay in the EU and have another referendum to achieve their goal - to revoke Article 50 (the law that sees the UK having to leave the bloc). Democratic Unionist Party - 10 MPs The DUP has a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives, giving them their support in the Commons. They are backing the PM's plans to leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of October. The Independent Group for Change - 5 MPs This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour because of their positions on Brexit (as well as allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party). They back another referendum, or ""People's Vote"", and want the UK to remain in the EU. Plaid Cymru - 4 MPs The Welsh Party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting out in the referendum. They want a further referendum and to Remain. Green Party - 1 MP The party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, has been a vocal campaigner for another referendum and believes the UK should stay in the EU.

"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

"Taylor Swift tried to sue Microsoft over a chatbot which posted racist messages on Twitter, the president of the tech company has revealed. Taylor's lawyers made a move on Microsoft in 2016, according to a new biography by its boss Brad Smith. She was unhappy with the name of its chatbot Tay, meant to interact with 18 to 24-year-olds online, because it was similar to hers. If you don't remember TayTweets, it's the Twitter chatbot that turned racist. TayTweets was controlled by artificial intelligence and was designed to learn from conversations held on social media. But shortly after Tay was launched, ittweeted to say it supported genocideand didn't believe the holocaust happened - among other things. Microsoft issued an apology andtook Tay offlineafter less than 18-hours of offensive conversations on Twitter. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Taylor Swift's political views do not align... as he sums up in this video Taylor Swift's legal action wasn't about what the chatbot had said online, but instead about the similarity to her own name. ""I was on vacation when I made the mistake of looking at my phone during dinner,"" Brad Smith writes in his new book, Tools and Weapons,reports the Guardian.,external Brad Smith is the president of Microsoft ""An email had just arrived from a Beverly Hills lawyer who introduced himself by telling me: 'We represent Taylor Swift, on whose behalf this is directed to you.' ""'The name Tay, as I'm sure you must know, is closely associated with our client',"" he adds. ""No, I actually didn't know, but the email nonetheless grabbed my attention."" He says the lawyer argued that the name Tay violated federal and state laws and ""created a false and misleading association between the popular singer and our chatbot"". Taylor and her legal team are pretty strict on people who come too close to the singer and her intellectual property rights. Her name, signature and initials are already trademarks and in 2015 she attempted to trademark lyrics from her album, 1989. Just before the record was released she successfully filed to make sayings like""this sick beat"" and ""nice to meet you, where you been"" trademarks.

"A Labour government would introduce the biggest extension of workers' rights ever seen in the UK, including a new department to protect workers' rights, party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. He told the TUC conference the aim was to deliver better wages, greater security and give workers more of a say in how their workplaces are run. He pledged to stand up for the majority who do the work and pay their taxes. ""Not the few at the top who hoard the wealth and dodge their taxes,"" he said. Addressing the conference in Brighton, Mr Corbyn said Labour would appoint a secretary of state for employment rights and a workers' protection agency to enforce rights, standards and protections so that every job was a ""good job"". ""If you're a worker with a boss who makes you work extra hours for no pay or forces you into dangerous situations, you deserve a government that's on your side and ready to step in to support you,"" he said. He added that workers would be offered security, dignity, fair pay and rights in the workplace under minimum standards set through collective bargaining. The Labour leader also repeated an earlier party pledge to repeal the2016 Trade Union Act,external, which made strikes illegal unless at least half of eligible union members take part in the ballot. Other new policies would include: Introducing a statutory real living wage of Â£10 an hour by 2020 for all workers aged 16 or over. (The government's ""National Living Wage"" for 25-year-olds and over, is currently Â£8.21 an hour) Banning unpaid internships Ending zero-hour contracts by requiring employers to give all workers a contract reflecting their fixed and regular hours Mr Corbyn was greeted by delegates at the TUC conference Mr Corbyn told delegates: ""The next Labour government will bring about the biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen. We will put power in the hands of workers. ""For 40 years, the share of the cake going to workers has been getting smaller and smaller. ""It's no coincidence that the same period has seen a sustained attack on the organisations that represent workers - trade unions. ""We have witnessed a deliberate, decades-long transfer of power away from working people. ""The consequences are stark for all workers, whether members of a trade union or not. Pay is lower than it was a decade ago in real terms. ""Labour is on the side of the people in the real battle against the born-to-rule establishment that [Boris] Johnson represents."" Mr Corbyn's speech also brought clarification on Labour's position on Brexit, with him promising a further referendum with a ""credible Leave option"" if Labour wins the next general election. He told the conference an general election was coming, but Labour would not allow Mr Johnson to dictate the terms. ""And in that election we will commit to a public vote with a credible option to leave and the option to remain.""

The couple also faces over $100,000 in overdraft fees, having purchased an SUV and other goods, police say. The affidavit says the couple admitted knowing the money was not theirs. Mr and Mrs Williams, 36 and 35 respectively, have been charged with theft and receiving stolen property. They have been released on bail.

"This video can not be played Sir Geoffrey Boycott told Today he 'couldn't give a toss' about knighthood criticism Geoffrey Boycott has said he ""couldn't give a toss"" about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood in her resignation honours list. Domestic abuse charities and Labour said the honour should be removed from the ex-cricketer, who wasconvicted of beating his girlfriend in 1998.,external Boycott, who has always denied the assault, later questioned why the issue had been raised by the media. Mrs May's list of 57 names was made up of mostly political figures. Every departing prime minister can draw up a resignation honours list. Mrs May announced her resignation in June after failing to get support for the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated for the UK to leave the EU. Which notable people have lost knighthoods? Guide to the Honours What's the difference between OBE, MBE and CBE? The former prime minister showed her love of cricket with knighthoods for Boycott and fellow formerEngland captain Andrew Strauss. Boycott was fined Â£5,000 and given a three-month suspended sentence in 1998 after being convicted of beating his then-girlfriend Margaret Moore in a French Riviera hotel. During the trial, the court heard Boycott pinned Miss Moore down and punched her 20 times in the face before checking out and leaving her to pay the bill. Boycott denied the allegations, saying Miss Moore had slipped after flying into a rage when he refused to marry her. Mrs May, who introduced a landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to Parliament earlier this year, was accused of sending a ""dangerous message"" by Women's Aid's co-acting chief executive Adina Claire. She said the honour ""should be taken away"" from Boycott, adding that it sent ""completely the wrong message"" to survivors of domestic abuse. This video can not be played Women's Aid co-leader Adina Claire says the knighthood sends 'a terrible message' Asked about the criticism from Women's Aid by presenter Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Boycott responded: ""I don't give a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago so you can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it."" The 78-year-old, who is part of the BBC's cricket commentary team for the current Ashes series, added: ""It's very difficult to prove your innocence in another country, in another language.

He told BBC's Look North Yorkshire: ""Is that what interviewing is about - is it always to ask difficult questions? Shouldn't it be just a nice day for me? ""I said I don't give a toss about her [Ms Claire from Woman's Aid], not domestic violence. That's not something anyone should feel good about."" A spokesperson for the Today programme said the question was ""entirely appropriate... given the concerns raised about Geoffrey Boycott's knighthood by Women's Aid and others"". Boycott scored 8,114 runs in 108 Tests for England from 1964 to 1982 The shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, joined the call for Boycott's knighthood to be rescinded. ""Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister's favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is,"" she said, adding that the whole system needed ""radically overhauling"". And former Spice Girl Melanie Browntweeted,externalthat Boycott was ""a disgrace to Yorkshire"", saying the ""perpetrators of domestic abuse shouldn't be held up as heroes EVER"". The Woman's Trust charity said it was ""disappointed"" to see Boycott included in the honour's list because it either suggested that, despite his conviction, he was believed over the survivor, or his fame meant it did not matter.

Restoration projects could protect vulnerable communities from storms and boost fisheries' productivity Water:Protecting water supplies - and making sure that water's not being wasted - will be vital in a changing climate Each of these investments, the commission says, would contribute to what they call a ""triple dividend""- avoiding future losses, generating positive economic gains through innovation, and delivering social and environmental benefits. It is that dividend that the report has valued at $7.1tn (Â£5.7tn). Plant experts in Uganda are improving agricultural livelihoods in the country by introducing farmers to crop varieties with better drought and disease resistance Commenting on the report's findings, Mr Ban said climate change ""doesn't respect borders"".

"This video can not be played Sir Geoffrey Boycott told Today he 'couldn't give a toss' about knighthood criticism Geoffrey Boycott has said he ""couldn't give a toss"" about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood in her resignation honours list. Domestic abuse charities and Labour said the honour should be removed from the ex-cricketer, who wasconvicted of beating his girlfriend in 1998.,external Boycott, who has always denied the assault, later questioned why the issue had been raised by the media. Mrs May's list of 57 names was made up of mostly political figures. Every departing prime minister can draw up a resignation honours list. Mrs May announced her resignation in June after failing to get support for the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated for the UK to leave the EU. Which notable people have lost knighthoods? Guide to the Honours What's the difference between OBE, MBE and CBE? The former prime minister showed her love of cricket with knighthoods for Boycott and fellow formerEngland captain Andrew Strauss. Boycott was fined Â£5,000 and given a three-month suspended sentence in 1998 after being convicted of beating his then-girlfriend Margaret Moore in a French Riviera hotel. During the trial, the court heard Boycott pinned Miss Moore down and punched her 20 times in the face before checking out and leaving her to pay the bill. Boycott denied the allegations, saying Miss Moore had slipped after flying into a rage when he refused to marry her. Mrs May, who introduced a landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to Parliament earlier this year, was accused of sending a ""dangerous message"" by Women's Aid's co-acting chief executive Adina Claire.

"Hundreds of thousands of people in England are getting hooked on prescription drugs, health chiefs fear. A Public Health England review looked at the use of strong painkillers, antidepressants and sleeping tablets - used by a quarter of adults every year. It found that at the end of March 2018 half of people using these drugs had been on them for at least 12 months. Officials said long-term use on such a scale could not be justified and was a sign of patients becoming dependent. The hell of my prescription drug withdrawal The prescription drug flooding the UK Why opioids are such an American problem PHE medical director Prof Paul Cosford said he was worried. ""These medicines have many vital clinical uses and can make a big difference to people's quality of life."" But he added there were too many cases where patients were using them for longer than ""clinically"" appropriate - where the drugs would have simply stopped working effectively or where the risks could outweigh the benefits. ""We need to make sure people are helped to access alternative treatments,"" he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors did not like prescribing medication long-term, but were sometimes left with no choice. ""What it indicates is the severe lack of alternatives."" NHS England said investment was being made in services such as talking therapies and so-called social prescribing, which includes exercise classes and arts-based activities, that could be more appropriate. Katie was addicted to painkillers for 10 years after having her appendix out in hospital and then being misdiagnosed - she was suffering from endometriosis that was not spotted. At one point, she was taking 24 painkillers a day. ""I became a recluse. I put on weight. ""I chose taking painkillers over going out with my friends. ""It affected my relationships."" She said for years she did not get any help, until she was sent to the Bridge Project, a charity in Bradford that works with people with drugs problems. With their support, including counselling, she managed to wean herself off painkillers and has not taken them since the end of last year. ""There are some hard days. But I have got my life back now."" Five classes of medicines were included in the review - asked for by government amid concern that large numbers of people were misusing prescription drugs. They were: Antidepressants Opioid painkillers for acute pain and injury (excluding use in cancer patients) Gabapentinoids (used to treat epilepsy, anxiety and nerve-related pain) Benzodiazepines (mostly prescribed for anxiety) Z-drugs (sleeping tablets) The number of prescriptions being issued has been rising for some time - partly because of the ageing population - although there are signs their use is slowing. To assess the levels of dependency, PHE officials analysed patient data to find out exactly how many people were taking these drugs outside of hospitals and for how long. Half of people who were using the drugs in March 2018 had been on them for a year or more with about a quarter having used them for at least three years. Rates of prescribing were higher in deprived areas and among women. How long each drug should be used varies. Opioid-based painkillers should only be used for short periods so the fact that there were 1.2 million people on them for at least a year - 540,000 of whom had been taking them for at least three years - was extremely worrying, PHE said. Antidepressants by comparison take some time to become fully effective so it is not surprising to find people using them for a long time. But there were nearly 1 million people using them who had been on them for at least three years, which rang alarm bells, PHE said. Officials said the scale of that long-term use suggested those with mild-to-moderate depression may have become dependent on them. For the other drugs, there was only a minority of cases where long-term use was appropriate, PHE said. Prof John Read, of the British Psychological Society, said the findings were ""alarming"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the report should act as a ""wake-up call"". ""I refuse to let this escalate to the level seen in the US."" PHE said patients should not simply stop taking their drugs. Instead, they are urging patients to speak to their GP, who are being told to do more to review the use of these medications and seek alternative solutions. Doctors say any attempt to tackle dependency needs to involve a gradual reduction in use and dosage. Alternatives such as talking therapies can be used instead of antidepressants, while linking people in with social activities, such as arts groups, can help reduce isolation and depression and tailored activity programmes and physio may be used to tackle pain. PHE said it was not clear if this scale of long-term use of prescription drugs was causing harm - although each drug does have side-effects, including weight gain and placing stress on the heart, kidney and lungs. But they said long-term use meant tolerance could build up and treatments could stop being effective or require patients to up the doses they were taking, while any reduction in use could lead to withdrawal symptoms. The misuse of prescription drugs - and in particular opioid-based painkillers - is a major problem in the US. Prescription rates have risen sharply since the late 1990s - and there are signs attempts to crack down on this have driven people into the illegal market for drugs. Deaths from opioid overdoses have more than doubled in the past decade in the US. PHE said what is being seen in England is not yet on that scale. Prescription rates are four times lower in England than the US and deaths from overdoses have not increased at such a rate. In fact, PHE said opioid prescriptions were also lower than in many other European nations. ""We want to get on top of this now before we see the problems that have been seen elsewhere,"" Prof Cosford added.

"A Labour government would introduce the biggest extension of workers' rights ever seen in the UK, including a new department to protect workers' rights, party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. He told the TUC conference the aim was to deliver better wages, greater security and give workers more of a say in how their workplaces are run. He pledged to stand up for the majority who do the work and pay their taxes. ""Not the few at the top who hoard the wealth and dodge their taxes,"" he said. Addressing the conference in Brighton, Mr Corbyn said Labour would appoint a secretary of state for employment rights and a workers' protection agency to enforce rights, standards and protections so that every job was a ""good job"". ""If you're a worker with a boss who makes you work extra hours for no pay or forces you into dangerous situations, you deserve a government that's on your side and ready to step in to support you,"" he said. He added that workers would be offered security, dignity, fair pay and rights in the workplace under minimum standards set through collective bargaining. The Labour leader also repeated an earlier party pledge to repeal the2016 Trade Union Act,external, which made strikes illegal unless at least half of eligible union members take part in the ballot. Other new policies would include: Introducing a statutory real living wage of Â£10 an hour by 2020 for all workers aged 16 or over. (The government's ""National Living Wage"" for 25-year-olds and over, is currently Â£8.21 an hour) Banning unpaid internships Ending zero-hour contracts by requiring employers to give all workers a contract reflecting their fixed and regular hours Mr Corbyn was greeted by delegates at the TUC conference Mr Corbyn told delegates: ""The next Labour government will bring about the biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen. We will put power in the hands of workers. ""For 40 years, the share of the cake going to workers has been getting smaller and smaller. ""It's no coincidence that the same period has seen a sustained attack on the organisations that represent workers - trade unions. ""We have witnessed a deliberate, decades-long transfer of power away from working people. ""The consequences are stark for all workers, whether members of a trade union or not. Pay is lower than it was a decade ago in real terms. ""Labour is on the side of the people in the real battle against the born-to-rule establishment that [Boris] Johnson represents."" Mr Corbyn's speech also brought clarification on Labour's position on Brexit, with him promising a further referendum with a ""credible Leave option"" if Labour wins the next general election. He told the conference an general election was coming, but Labour would not allow Mr Johnson to dictate the terms. ""And in that election we will commit to a public vote with a credible option to leave and the option to remain."" But some senior party figures, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, have said they will campaign to stay in the EU under any circumstances - even if Labour negotiates its own deal.

"A majority of people thought it was OK for the brain to be hacked to help those with medical conditions but not for enhancement Devices that merge machines with the human brain need to be investigated, a study has said. In future, ""people could become telepathic to some degree"" and being able to read someone else's thoughts raises ethical issues, experts said. This could become especially worrying if those thoughts were shared with corporations. Commercial products should not come from ""a handful of companies"", they added In the study  - iHuman: Blurring Lines between Mind and Machine -  leading scientists at the UK's Royal Society lay out the opportunities and risks of brain-to-computer devices. Such interfaces refer to gadgets, either implanted in the body or worn externally, that stimulate activity in either the brain or nervous system. It looked at some of the future possibilities of neural technology, such as: the ability to beam a ""neural postcard"" to someone so they could see what you see even if they are not there people being able to converse without speaking through access to each other's thoughts people being able to simply download new skills As part of the report, scientists asked the public what they thought of such interfaces and found strong support for their use in allowing patients to recover from injury or a medical condition. But there was far less support for using such devices to enhance functions such as memory or physical strength in healthy people. Exoskeletons that allow humans to work and play for longer Would you hack your own body? Among the risks highlighted by the report was the idea of thoughts or moods being accessed by big corporations as well as the bigger question about whether such devices fundamentally change what it means to be human. Dr Tim Constandinou, director of the next generation neural Interfaces (NGNI) Lab, at Imperial College London and co-chair of the report, said: ""By 2040 neural interfaces are likely to be an established option to enable people to walk after paralysis and tackle treatment-resistant depression, they may even have made treating Alzheimer's disease a reality. ""While advances like seamless brain-to-computer communication seem a much more distant possibility, we should act now to ensure our ethical and regulatory safeguards are flexible enough for any future development. ""In this way we can guarantee these emerging technologies are implemented safely and for the benefit of humanity."" The report recommends: a national investigation of the ethical issues presented by neural interfaces to address what data should be collected, how it is kept safe and the acceptability of merging machines and humans creation of a neural interface ecosystem to encourage industry and universities to innovate and collaborate in the field the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to trial new ways to bring such products to market, and to prevent a monopoly by big tech firms In July,Elon Musk announced that his firm Neuralinkwas applying to start human trials in the US, with electrodes inserted into the brains of patients with paralysis. AndFacebook is supporting researchthat aims to create a headset with the ability to transcribe words at a rate of 100 per minute, just by thinking. In the US it is estimated that 60,000 spinal-cord stimulators are implanted annually and around the world some 400,000 people have benefited from cochlear implants. Thousands of people with Parkinson's disease and similar conditions have been treated with deep brain stimulation, and artificial pancreases and wireless heart monitors are also common.

"The RMT Union represents 10,000 workers on the London Underground Trade unions suspended a threat of strike action on the London Underground last week after successful talks with Transport for London (TfL). There has not been a strike on the Tube during 2019 but have industrial relations improved since Sadiq Khan took over as Mayor of London from Boris Johnson three years ago? Figures obtained by the BBC show that in the past 11 financial years, since Mr Johnson took over as mayor from Ken Livingstone, there have been more than 36,000 days lost to strike action. The number of days lost is so high because TfL counts ""one day lost for every member of staff missing"" and it has led one academic to describe the London Underground as ""a museum of bad industrial relations"". Various disputes over issues includingticket office closures, job cuts, new rotas, employee dismissals and theintroduction of the Night Tubehave resulted in 68 individual dates of strike action since April 2008. The London School of Economics's Prof Tony Travers explained these industrial rows resembled ""trigger points"" that each mayor would aim to avoid in order to prevent any big strikes. ""These trigger points are usually something new,"" he said. ""These include the Night Tube, Olympics or working Boxing Day. ""Unions have long used the Underground as good leverage when trying to get better pay because of the monopoly that it serves."" More than 7,000 days were lost to strike action over four dates in early 2014 Between April 2008 and May 2012, during Mr Johnson's first spell as Mayor of London, 12,523 shifts were lost to strike action - despite him trying tonegotiate no-strike deals with the Tube unions. Figures showed a further 19,689 working days were lost while he was mayor during his second term between May 2012 and May 2016. In his 2016 Mayor of London election campaign Mr Khan pledged to ""reduce the number of days lost to strike action,external"" and he has seen 3,824 shifts lost to strike days during his time at City Hall. As Mayor of London Boris Johnson called for strikes to be made illegal unless 50% of staff in a workplace took part in a ballot While there have been significantly fewer working days lost to strikes under Mr Khan, there have been 25 dates of industrial action in his three years as mayor, compared with 33 across the whole eight years Mr Johnson was in office. ""Under Sadiq there have been fewer days lost,"" Prof Travers said. ""But the entire record for Tube strikes is particularly dire."" Commuter gets Â£27k for 'possible pigeon poo slip' 'Alarming' numbers of Tube users fainting 'Poor training and fatigue' behind open Tube doors TfL said the effect of any strike was dependent on the nature of the dispute, the number of unions involved and where the strike had been called. The figures included strikes that affected either the whole Tube network or just part of it. Nearly 70 periods of strike action have been taken by various unions since April 2008 A spokesman for the Mayor of London said strike action had ""reduced"" under Mr Khan because he ""listens to the concerns of workers"". However, Conservative London Assembly member Keith Prince defended Mr Johnson's record, instead accusing Mr Khan of having a ""worse strikes record (than) any of his predecessors"". According to the TfL data, strike action was predominantly taken by the RMT union, which has about 10,000 members employed on the Tube, and saw workers walk out on 34 occasions. Transport for London says it deploys additional staff on strike days Aslef, which represents 2,456 Tube drivers, took 13 dates of strike action, while Unite had eight disputes which led to industrial action. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) walked out on two occasions over ""employee terms and conditions"". Aslef's Finn Brennan said his union had ""regular meetings between transport unions, Mr Khan and his team"". He added: ""Aslef uses these meetings to highlight issues that go beyond the remit of the machinery meetings with employers and to encourage a more reasonable attitude on matters we have raised with the company.""

House of LordsParliament There are three members of the Royal Commission in the Lords tonight to begin the prorogation ceremony, because the leader of Labour in the Lords, and the leader of the Lib Dems are boycotting it. The act of proroguing or suspending Parliament is marked by
a traditional ceremony in the House of Lords. This begins with an announcement on behalf of the Queen,
read by the Leader of the House. A Royal Commission made up of five peers â usually made up of the leader and
deputy leader of the Lords, the Lord Speaker, the shadow leader of the Lords
and the convener of crossbench peers â then enter the Chamber dressed in
parliamentary robes. They instruct Black Rod, a senior officer in the Lords,
to summon the House of Commons. Black Rod then heads to the Commons where, as is
customary, the door is slammed shut in his or her face. After knocking three times with his ebony rod, the door is
opened and MPs proceed to the Lords. When MPs arrive, there is
a ceremonial greeting from the Royal Commission, who doff their hats, with
representatives of the Commons bowing in return. The Clerk of the Crown
then announces the names of Acts to be given royal assent, declaring âLa Reyne
le veultâ â Norman French for âThe Queen wishes itâ, after each Act. The achievements of the government are reviewed and back in the Commons, MPs traditionally file out of the Chamber and shake the Speaker's hand. Whether many of them are still awake at this early hour of the morning is another question... House of CommonsParliament Now the main business of the day has finished, preparations are being made for the formal move to prorogue - suspend - Parliament. House of CommonsParliament Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the government and the way the prime minister is operating is a ""disgrace"". ""The one thing the prime minister did not say was that he was going to obey the law of this country,"" the Labour leader says. ""He did not say he acknowledged or accepted three votes that have taken place in this Parliament,"" he adds. He urged Boris Johnson to reflect on the decision to shut down the Commons.   House of CommonsParliament Boris Johnson is accusing opposition MPs of thinking they know better than the British public, after his motion calling for a general election was defeated. ""They want the British prime minister to go to a vital negotiation without the power to walk away,"" he says. House of CommonsParliament The government has been defeated on a motion pushing for an early general election because not enough MPs supported the PMâs call. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Acts, Boris Johnson needed the support of two-thirds of
MPs - at least 434 - to trigger an early poll. But only 293 MPs voted for an
election â with 46 against. Weâll find out how many MPs abstained on the
motion later. House of CommonsParliament MPs are voting on the motion put forward by the government, that there should be an early general election. Results will come at about 00:30 BST.
