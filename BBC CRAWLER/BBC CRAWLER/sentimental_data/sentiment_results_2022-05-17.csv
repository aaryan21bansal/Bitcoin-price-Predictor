"The RAC said UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over Â£1.80 a litre on Monday The government has raised concerns that petrol retailers are not passing on the recent cut in fuel duty, after diesel prices hit another record high. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told petrol bosses the competition regulator is monitoring the situation. However, petrol retailers said their costs had remained high. The Petrol Retailers Association said margins were ""often not enough to cover operating costs"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak implemented the 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in March to reduce the price of fuel for motorists. Fuel duty cut by 5p a litre to help motorists How much will the fuel duty cut on petrol save you? Diesel prices reach record of over Â£1.80 a litre In a letter to the industry, the business secretary said the public was ""rightly expressing concern about the pace of the increase in prices at the forecourt"". He said people were frustrated that the fuel duty cut ""does not appear to have been passed through to forecourt prices in any visible or meaningful way"". ""It is also unacceptable that different locations even within the same retail chain have widely different prices,"" he wrote. Mr Kwarteng said his officials recently engaged the Competition and Markets Authority about the issue, as a result of ""perceived intransigence to date"". ""I have been reassured that they will not hesitate to use their powers to act against petrol stations if there is evidence that they are infringing competition or consumer law,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng complained that ""different locations even within the same retail chain have widely different prices"" UK diesel pricesrose to a record of just over Â£1.80 a litreon Monday, the RAC said. After the previous record of Â£1.79 in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks. The RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were Â£1.66 a litre on average. It said retailers are taking an average profit of 2p per litre more than before the chancellor's 5p duty cut. But Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said comparing pump prices against wholesale prices ""only gives a partial picture"". Once ""additional expenses"" such as storage and delivery costs are taken into account alongside the ""volatility of product prices"", retailers' margins are ""often not enough to cover operating costs"", he said. He added that if the government wanted to lower pump prices, it should reduce fuel duty by more than 5p. ""5p per litre did not represent a substantial enough cut to ease the burden of rising prices on motorists,"" he said. ""While the chancellor was announcing it, oil prices rose and effectively cancelled out the reduction. In addition to this,  sales volumes of petrol and diesel are still not back to their pre-pandemic levels. ""Supermarkets and independent fuel retailers are competing vigorously with each other on the thinnest of margins."" The row follows a warning that supermarkets have also not passed on the fuel duty cut and falls in wholesale fuel prices. The RAC motoring group does not believe the top four supermarkets - Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco - are doing enough to help customers cut their fuel bills. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""Despite operating just a fifth of petrol stations in the UK, the big supermarkets are responsible for around half of all fuel sales so how they choose to price petrol and diesel has a huge impact on what drivers end up paying."" Retailers make shocking petrol profit, says RAC Drivers cut back on journeys as fuel costs bite He added: ""When wholesale fuel prices fall dramatically it can be enormously frustrating for drivers when pump prices don't start coming down. It normally takes one retailer to effectively 'fire the starting gun' and cut its prices in order for others to follow. ""We know that the biggest retailers tend to be reluctant to reflect falling wholesale prices at the pumps day-to-day, yet they seem to pass on increases quickly when wholesale prices are rising. This can often be to the detriment of drivers."" The RAC believes that supermarkets often wait for long sustained drops in wholesale prices before they cut their forecourt prices. If they cut the retail price too soon and then the wholesale price rises again, they will be forced to reintroduce a higher price which looks bad to customers, according to the motoring organisation. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: ""We understand that the cost of living is a real challenge for many households and we are committed to helping our customers as much as we can. ""We lowered prices the day the chancellor announced fuel cuts so that our customers could benefit as soon as possible."" Morrisons said it took the full 5p from its prices at 6pm on the day of the chancellor's announcement. Asda and Tesco have not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.

"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visit a memorial to the victims of Saturday's mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York US President Joe Biden has condemned white supremacy as ""a poison running through our body politic"" during a visit to Buffalo, New York. Ten black people were killed at a supermarket in the city on Saturday in what is believed to be a racially motivated hate crime. The suspect, 18, identified himself as a fascist and white nationalist in a document posted online. Mr Biden on Tuesday said the young man belonged to ""a hateful minority"". After meeting families impacted by the shooting, he eulogised the victims for their ""individual lives of love, service and community that speak to the bigger story of who we are as Americans"". ""White supremacy will not have the last word,"" he said. Local officials say the alleged attacker drove more than 320 km (200 miles) to deliberately seek out an area with a high black population. He would have continued to target other such areas if he had not been stopped, according to investigators. In his so-called manifesto, he referenced ""white genocide"" and ""white replacement"" conspiracy theories to explain his resentment towards minority groups. In the rambling screed, he also identified politically as being on the ""authoritarian left"". Black Buffalo residents tell of grief and fear How far-right killers are radicalised online Dallas salon shooting investigated as hate crime The president accused the shooter of giving into ""a hateful, perverse ideology rooted in fear and racism"". This video can not be played Parents of US mass shooting victim search for solutions Making mention of the deadly far-right extremist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 - the incident he says persuaded him to run for office again - he warned that America's democracy was ""in danger like it hasn't been in my lifetime"". ""Hate and fear have been given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America but don't understand America,"" Mr Biden said. ""I call on all Americans to reject the lie and I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and profit. We cannot remain silent."" President Biden's main objective in visiting Buffalo was to be a consoler in chief of sorts. He has suffered profound loss in his own life. His first wife and 13-year-old daughter were killed in a car crash and later in life he lost one of his sons to brain cancer. He told the families that one day the memory of their loved one would bring a smile to their face before it brought a tear to their eye. Still, while the people here say they appreciate the sympathy and prayers, they want action. President Biden can offer little new on that front, and he admitted as much on Air Force One as he returned to Washington. On gun control and banning assault weapons, he said he would try to convince Congress but it would be very difficult. On domestic terrorism, he said there were enough laws on the books and that the country just needed to ""look in the mirror and face the reality."" Mr Biden held individual meetings with grieving families and also visited the makeshift memorial outside the Tops grocery store that was the site of Saturday's rampage. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told media that the president had ""seemed very moved by what he saw in the community"" and he was hopeful for more action on gun control. The president was joined on Tuesday's trip by First Lady Jill Biden, New York's Democratic senators and other top officials.

"The government has introduced legislation that aims to draw a line under the Northern Ireland Troubles by dealing with so-called legacy issues. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill runs to almost 100 pages. It is an attempt to deal with more than 1,000 unsolved killings. A central element involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations run by a new information recovery body. Bereaved families can request investigations, as can the government and others. The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) will be headed by a judicial figure appointed by the government. It would be operational for five years. A panel within the ICRIR will be responsible for deciding if a perpetrator qualifies for immunity. Troubles legacy plan looks toward South Africa What led to Northern Ireland's conflict? The draft legislation states it must be granted if an individual gives an account judged to be ""true to the best of (their) knowledge and belief"". Once granted, it cannot be revoked. In last week's Queen's Speech, the government announced it was changing its original proposal from last July, which would have ended all Troubles-era prosecutions - effectively an across the board amnesty. After a legacy bill failed to materialise in the last parliamentary term, the government has moved at pace. It is only a week since the Queen's Speech and, by the look of it, there is to be no more talking. Axing the idea of a blanket amnesty has done little to gain support from either victims' groups or political parties. The overall package, they argue, remains exclusively UK designed with no buy-in in Northern Ireland. One opponent told me things have now entered ""wreck the bill territory"". It remains to be seen what amendments may emerge in Parliament, but the government has the numbers. The legislation will almost certainly face legal challenge around whether investigations meet standards of effectiveness. The government has said the plan ""complies fully"" with international human rights obligations, but some victims' families are already geared up to challenge it. The legislation will prevent future inquests and civil actions related to the Troubles. Civil claims which already existed on or before the day of the bill's introduction will be allowed to continue, as will inquests which have reached substantive hearing stage a year after the bill, or by the time the ICRIR becomes operational. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said victims and military veterans were being let down by the current system Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill would help society look forward. ""This is a very difficult area and it can be very painful for people,"" Mr Lewis told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""One of the challenges is the current system isn't working for people. That's very clear."" He said the legislation would ""give people a reason to come forward and a motivation to come forward that at the moment simply doesn't exist"". Asked if people under investigation or facing charges could then give information in exchange for immunity, Mr Lewis said: ""The independent body would take the view on if people have engaged in the right way and shared their information."" Kenny Donaldson said the justice offered by the bill was only ""tokenistic"" The Northern Ireland secretary also announced the government's intention to commission an official history relating to the Troubles, conducted by independent historians. Underpinned by ""unprecedented access to the UK documentary record"", he said this would provide an in-depth examination of the ""government's policy towards Northern Ireland during the conflict"". The government has previously indicated that the legacy legislation would not be rushed through Parliament under accelerated passage. It could take many months to become law. Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United, said members of his 12,500-strong group were ""unhappy that justice, in many ways, is being taken off the table"". ""It's being left on in a tokenistic and symbolic fashion, but not with any real teeth,"" he said. Campaigner Mark Kelly, whose 12-year-old sister Carol Ann was killed by a plastic bullet fired by a soldier in Belfast in 1981, said the government's proposals still amounted to an amnesty. ""They can paint it and colour it whatever way they like, but what they're trying to do is tell British soldiers that: 'No matter what you did in the north of Ireland, not only will there be no investigations into it,"" he said. Michelle O'Neill accused the government of trying to ""pull down the shutters on family campaigns for truth and justice"" Alan McBride, from victims' group the Wave Trauma Centre, said while the new proposals were better than the previous blanket amnesty, he was ""not so sure it is a huge improvement"". ""You could also probably argue that was a negotiation tactic from the British government in that they put out something so ridiculous and abhorrent that whatever they were seen to do would always be an improvement to that,"" he added. Victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose 22-year-old son Raymond Jr, was murdered by the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), in 1997, described the proposals as ""disgraceful and disgusting"". However, Veterans Commissioner Danny Kinahan has given the bill a cautious welcome after months consulting with several veterans' support groups. ""What they really want is the chance to be able to still pursue justice; still follow the rule of law,"" he said. ""And the changes we've got - which is why I say cautiously welcome - seem to be doing that, in that we're going to have a really, robust panel system which will dig down in for families so they can find out who blew them up, who shot them, who caused the harm."" Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill accused the government of trying to ""pull down the shutters on hundreds of family campaigns for truth and justice"". In atweet,external, she said: ""Prioritising the demands of their state forces over families is unjust and cruel. I stand with the families."" Gavin Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, said his party would be studying the detail of this bill but added they would ""continue to be a voice for innocent victims"". ""If this bill undermines access to justice for innocent victims then it will be a further corruption of justice,"" he said. The Alliance party's deputy leader, Stephen Farry, told his Twitter followers the new legislation ""lacks legitimacy and credibility"". ""This revised Bill has not been designed in conjunction with NI political parties or more crucially with victims' groups,"" hetweeted,external. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattietweeted,external""there can be no amnesty, no immunity from prosecution for acts resulting in death or injury regardless if it happened in UK or beyond"". Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood said it was a ""dereliction of duty"" for the government to push ahead with the legislation. ""The people who will lose the most from this new process are those who have already paid the worst price for the failure to deal with the legacy of our past,"" he added.

"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) said the government's pledge was a good start A government pledge to legislate on the Northern Ireland Protocol is ""a good start"", but not enough to entice the DUP to restore Stormont, its party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said. The party has blocked the establishment of the NI Assembly and the governing executive of ministers in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements. On Monday, the UK foreign secretary outlined plans to change the protocol. However, Sinn FÃ©in said the legislation proposal would break international law. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland have argued the protocol, which protects free trade across the Irish land border between the UK and the EU, has undermined Northern Ireland's place in the UK. How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government wanted to end the ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" which had been added to the movement of some goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. She said it would help resolve ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", but would not scrap the protocol. The proposed bill would include the removal of regulatory barriers to goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland and introduce a new dual regulatory regime, which would allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards. In response, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald described the UK as behaving like a ""rogue state"" at a time when ""government and progress"" had been blocked at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in was returned as Northern Ireland's largest party after the 5 May assembly election. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in Northern Ireland on Monday to meet with the five main parties, however, he was accused ofproviding a lack of detail on the government's plansto deal with the protocol. On Tuesday, he said the proposed changes amount to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". ""I think there are good common sensical solutions."" Sir Jeffrey, whose party campaigned for Brexit, said he hoped to see progress on the government's bill in ""days and weeks, not months"". He repeated his stance that ""actions speak louder than words"" with regard whether the move would satisfy the DUP's demands sufficiently for the party to re-enter government in Northern Ireland. government. Northern Ireland's devolved government cannot operate without cross-community support of both nationalists and unionists. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, vice-president of the European Commission, said the EU would respond to the move with ""all measures at its disposal"", adding that it wanted a ""positive and stable relationship with the United Kingdom"". ""This relationship must be based on the full respect of the legally binding commitments that the two sides have made to one another,"" he said. At a Dublin business dinner on Tuesday night, Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said: ""The fact that the UK government is talking openly about breaching international law is a matter of concern."" Mr Varadkar said the British government had not reciprocated the flexibility shown by the EU on the protocol and its actions were ""breeding mistrust in EU capitals"". Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK's action could damage trust and ""will serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". The UK and the EU have been engaged in months of talks, without resolution, to deal with concerns about how the protocol has operated. A number of mitigation measures have been in place since the agreement was signed to spare Northern Ireland from some of the checks on goods. Liz Truss and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ have held negotiations on an agreed outcome to deal with the protocol Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie described the government's pledge as ""a step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". ""I regret that we have got to this point, but this circular conversation cannot continue without conclusion,"" he continued. Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, said the proposed action was unwanted and unwarranted. ""Indeed, it may prove to be counterproductive and destructive. Much of the rationale cited by the government is disingenuous."" Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the majority of citizens in Northern Ireland supported the protocol. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Eastwood questioned how it would be possible to ""trust this government again"" if it brings forward legislation. The business community in Northern Ireland has also reacted to the statement by the foreign secretary in the Commons. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) director in Northern Ireland, Angela McGowan, said ""the last thing"" businesses want is further uncertainty. ""Now more than ever, flexibility and compromise are needed from both sides to reach lasting trade solutions, securing peace and prosperity,"" she outlined. This video can not be played Garden centre owner John Shannon explains how the protocol has affected his business ""With good political will a landing zone can undoubtedly be found so that Great Britain-Northern Ireland trade flows are smoothed."" Peter Somerton, managing director of the transport and freight company McCulla, said the checks are the smallest and final part of the process in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Rather, the preparation of documentation has placed the greatest demand on his business, he told the BBC. Peter Somerton said dozens of certificates are needed to move some goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland ""The complexity of the shipments and the complexity of the legislation simply creates that much bureaucracy that for a single pallet of ready meals for palliative care patients or a fishing load requires tens and tens and tens of certificates just to move,"" Mr Somerton said. The Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group said it would study the detail of the government's plan, but added ""anything other than a negotiated outcome is sub-optimal"". Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the body would have engagement with ministers in London on the statement this week. The election of a Speaker in the assembly and the establishment of the executive ""needs to happen immediately"", he continued.

"Consumer confidence in Northern Ireland fell sharply in the first quarter of 2022 as inflation hit household finances, a Danske Bank survey has suggested. The latest survey was carried out in the second half of March with 1,003 people. More than 40% of people expected their financial position to worsen over the next year. Only 18% believe their finances will be in a better position in 12 months. In comparison a survey conducted in the final quarter of 2021 found at that time only 26% of people expected their financial position to deteriorate in the year ahead. In terms of spending, 38% of respondents said they expected to spend less on expensive items over the next year, compared with 26% who anticipated spending more. However, there is a broad expectation that the jobs market recovery will be sustained. Why are prices rising so quickly? NI economy 'performs solidly' but pressure builds When asked about job security, 13% of people expected to become more secure in their jobs, while 61% expected no change in job security and only 8% thought their job security would worsen. Danske Bank chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""In Northern Ireland and the wider UK, consumer spending accounts for a considerable proportion of economic activity and is therefore an important driver of economic growth. ""Inflation has already increased sharply and is likely to rise even higher in the months ahead, exerting a further squeeze on consumer spending."" The UK main rate of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, stood at 7% in March but is expected to rise higher when the April statistics are released this week. The director of one of NI's biggest food companies says consumers are yet to see ""the full force of food inflation"" Last week, two of Northern Ireland's biggest food companies warned consumers toexpect further price rises this year. Food production inputs like fuel, fertiliser and animal feed have experienced rapid inflation over the last year. Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan said only about half of that inflation had been passed to consumers. That was echoed by Justin Coleman, director at Moy Park, which is one of Europe's biggest chicken producers. ""I don't think the full force of food inflation has hit retail shelves yet,"" he said.

"Liverpool are on 89 points after 37 Premier League matches, with leaders Manchester City on 90 Liverpool have taken the Premier League title race down to the final day of the season by coming from behind to win at Southampton. Jurgen Klopp's side knew defeat would hand the title to Manchester City - while even a draw would effectively end the challenge because of their inferior goal difference. And it looked as if Liverpool might have a struggle on their hands when Nathan Redmond gave Southampton a 13th-minute lead with a curling right-foot shot beyond Alisson. Liverpool, with nine changes from the side that won the FA Cup by beating Chelsea on penalties at Wembley on Saturday, once again showed their resilience and reserves of strength as Takumi Minamino levelled before half-time with a thumping drive against the club where he spent a spell on loan last season. The pressure built after the break and Liverpool took a deserved lead after 67 minutes when Joel Matip sent an instinctive looping header over Saints' keeper Alex McCarthy. City will still retain their title with victory over Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium but Liverpool have pushed them all the way again and ensured the fight will go down to the wire. Southampton v Liverpool as it happened, plus reaction and analysis Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer Visit our Southampton page Go straight to all the best Liverpool content This video can not be played Southampton 1-2: Jurgen Klopp praises 'unbelievable' Liverpool performance Liverpool were under pressure going into this game - and not just because they could not afford a slip. Manager Klopp had to make a host of changes because of tired legs following that gruelling FA Cup final win and also had to contend with injuries to major figures Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. This was a test of the nerve as well as the depth of Liverpool's squad and, as at Aston Villa last week when they also fell behind, an examination of their ability to survive adversity and demonstrate powers of recovery. All the tests were passed in convincing style as Liverpool dominated once they had recovered from shock of Redmond's outstanding goal. In the absence of Salah and Sadio Mane, and with Luis Diaz on the bench, Roberto Firmino gave an outstanding display of touch and intelligent running, putting in a tireless shift that earned him a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. Ibrahima Konate has proved to be an outstanding signing and he was once again a tower of strength in defence, ensuring Liverpool did not miss Van Dijk - his defensive partner Matip scoring the winner with what looked almost like a reflex action header, albeit a highly effective one. The only blot on Liverpool's night was an injury to the luckless Joe Gomez, who fell awkwardly under a touchline challenge and limped off disconsolately at half-time with the consoling arm of goalkeeper Alisson around his shoulder. Klopp delivered his tradition triple fist pump in front of Liverpool's travelling fans at the final whistle. He will know City are still in pole position and have the title's destiny in their own hands but all Liverpool could do was put them through a final-day test and this was mission accomplished. This video can not be played Southampton 1-2 Liverpool: Defeat by Liverpool 'frustrating' - Ralph Hasenhuttl Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl was hoping for a vibrant display from his side after feeling the full force of fan discontent following their 3-0 defeat at Brentford last time out. The Austrian faced chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'sacked in the morning' during the dismal defeat in west London on 7 May. This was a tame response, ending as he led his team around a largely deserted stadium on a lap of appreciation after the final whistle. Saints had the boost of that early lead but never carried the air of a team confident it would be maintained. Liverpool confirmed their obvious superiority while the home side looked nervous, especially when playing out from the back, where they played themselves into trouble on several occasions.

Here's a recap of the day's key developments: As we reported earlier, Ukrainians are marking Vyshyvanka Day - a celebration of Ukrainian folk culture, particularly the wearing of traditional embroidered shirts. Here are some images taken as people came out to celebrate, despite the continuing war in the country. The designs on some vyshyvankas have meanings such as hope, fertility and protection Children were among those who gathered in Lviv Once traditionally white, vyshyankas are now made in a wide range of colours This performance took place in the western city of Lviv Sewing lessons were on offer in Odesa Three refugee sisters, together with friends and their host, marked the occasion with a giant shirt in Cambridge in the UK A famous cat from Kharkiv who raised thousands for Ukrainian animal shelters through his Instagram account has been given a prestigious award for his efforts. Stepan, who has 1.3 million followers, was given the World Influencers and Bloggers Award during a ceremony at Cannes Film Festival in France on 18 May.

Russian forces have ""completely destroyed"" the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said,in a late night video address,external. He also accused Moscow of carrying out ""senseless bombardments"" as it intensified its offensive in the region. Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after pulling back its forces from near the capital Kyiv. ""In the Donbas, the occupiers are trying to exert even more
pressure,"" Zelensky says. ""It is hell there - and that is not an exaggeration,""
he adds. Read more on why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments: International support:  War crimes trial:  Steelworks evacuation: You can readour round-up of all the day's developments here. Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information. This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers blow up a bridge connecting cities in the Luhansk region Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's National Guard released a video it said shows the destruction of a bridge connecting Sievierodonetsk to Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. The special operation between Ukraine's security forces aims to slow down the advance of Russian troops in the Luhansk region. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the images. We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many. The Deputy Commander of the Azov unit, Sviatoslav Palamar hasposted a video message on Telegram,,externalin which he says: âGlory to Ukraine! It is day 85 of the war. The leadership and I are on the premises of the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation happening, details of which I am not going to share. I thank the whole world and Ukraine for the support. I will be seeing you.â It is not clear what the operation he refers to is. We will bring you more information if it becomes available. Russia says more than 1,700 fighters from the plant have been taken to Russian-controlled areas since Monday. You canread about what has been happening to them here. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and
strategically. We thank our allies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine. You can read our correspondent Sarah Rainsford'sstory on the trial here. Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post. At least eight houses have been damaged and rescuers were unable to reach places on fire for two hours because of the shelling, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visit a memorial to the victims of Saturday's mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York US President Joe Biden has condemned white supremacy as ""a poison running through our body politic"" during a visit to Buffalo, New York. Ten black people were killed at a supermarket in the city on Saturday in what is believed to be a racially motivated hate crime. The suspect, 18, identified himself as a fascist and white nationalist in a document posted online. Mr Biden on Tuesday said the young man belonged to ""a hateful minority"". After meeting families impacted by the shooting, he eulogised the victims for their ""individual lives of love, service and community that speak to the bigger story of who we are as Americans"". ""White supremacy will not have the last word,"" he said. Local officials say the alleged attacker drove more than 320 km (200 miles) to deliberately seek out an area with a high black population. He would have continued to target other such areas if he had not been stopped, according to investigators. In his so-called manifesto, he referenced ""white genocide"" and ""white replacement"" conspiracy theories to explain his resentment towards minority groups. In the rambling screed, he also identified politically as being on the ""authoritarian left"". Black Buffalo residents tell of grief and fear How far-right killers are radicalised online Dallas salon shooting investigated as hate crime The president accused the shooter of giving into ""a hateful, perverse ideology rooted in fear and racism"". This video can not be played Parents of US mass shooting victim search for solutions Making mention of the deadly far-right extremist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 - the incident he says persuaded him to run for office again - he warned that America's democracy was ""in danger like it hasn't been in my lifetime"". ""Hate and fear have been given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America but don't understand America,"" Mr Biden said. ""I call on all Americans to reject the lie and I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and profit. We cannot remain silent."" President Biden's main objective in visiting Buffalo was to be a consoler in chief of sorts. He has suffered profound loss in his own life. His first wife and 13-year-old daughter were killed in a car crash and later in life he lost one of his sons to brain cancer. He told the families that one day the memory of their loved one would bring a smile to their face before it brought a tear to their eye. Still, while the people here say they appreciate the sympathy and prayers, they want action. President Biden can offer little new on that front, and he admitted as much on Air Force One as he returned to Washington. On gun control and banning assault weapons, he said he would try to convince Congress but it would be very difficult. On domestic terrorism, he said there were enough laws on the books and that the country just needed to ""look in the mirror and face the reality."" Mr Biden held individual meetings with grieving families and also visited the makeshift memorial outside the Tops grocery store that was the site of Saturday's rampage. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told media that the president had ""seemed very moved by what he saw in the community"" and he was hopeful for more action on gun control. The president was joined on Tuesday's trip by First Lady Jill Biden, New York's Democratic senators and other top officials.

In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine. You can read our correspondent Sarah Rainsford'sstory on the trial here. Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post. At least eight houses have been damaged and rescuers were unable to reach places on fire for two hours because of the shelling, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government has introduced legislation that aims to draw a line under the Northern Ireland Troubles by dealing with so-called legacy issues. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill runs to almost 100 pages. It is an attempt to deal with more than 1,000 unsolved killings. A central element involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations run by a new information recovery body. Bereaved families can request investigations, as can the government and others. The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) will be headed by a judicial figure appointed by the government. It would be operational for five years. A panel within the ICRIR will be responsible for deciding if a perpetrator qualifies for immunity. Troubles legacy plan looks toward South Africa What led to Northern Ireland's conflict? The draft legislation states it must be granted if an individual gives an account judged to be ""true to the best of (their) knowledge and belief"". Once granted, it cannot be revoked. In last week's Queen's Speech, the government announced it was changing its original proposal from last July, which would have ended all Troubles-era prosecutions - effectively an across the board amnesty. After a legacy bill failed to materialise in the last parliamentary term, the government has moved at pace. It is only a week since the Queen's Speech and, by the look of it, there is to be no more talking. Axing the idea of a blanket amnesty has done little to gain support from either victims' groups or political parties. The overall package, they argue, remains exclusively UK designed with no buy-in in Northern Ireland. One opponent told me things have now entered ""wreck the bill territory"". It remains to be seen what amendments may emerge in Parliament, but the government has the numbers. The legislation will almost certainly face legal challenge around whether investigations meet standards of effectiveness. The government has said the plan ""complies fully"" with international human rights obligations, but some victims' families are already geared up to challenge it. The legislation will prevent future inquests and civil actions related to the Troubles. Civil claims which already existed on or before the day of the bill's introduction will be allowed to continue, as will inquests which have reached substantive hearing stage a year after the bill, or by the time the ICRIR becomes operational. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said victims and military veterans were being let down by the current system Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill would help society look forward. ""This is a very difficult area and it can be very painful for people,"" Mr Lewis told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""One of the challenges is the current system isn't working for people. That's very clear."" He said the legislation would ""give people a reason to come forward and a motivation to come forward that at the moment simply doesn't exist"". Asked if people under investigation or facing charges could then give information in exchange for immunity, Mr Lewis said: ""The independent body would take the view on if people have engaged in the right way and shared their information."" Kenny Donaldson said the justice offered by the bill was only ""tokenistic"" The Northern Ireland secretary also announced the government's intention to commission an official history relating to the Troubles, conducted by independent historians. Underpinned by ""unprecedented access to the UK documentary record"", he said this would provide an in-depth examination of the ""government's policy towards Northern Ireland during the conflict"". The government has previously indicated that the legacy legislation would not be rushed through Parliament under accelerated passage. It could take many months to become law. Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United, said members of his 12,500-strong group were ""unhappy that justice, in many ways, is being taken off the table"". ""It's being left on in a tokenistic and symbolic fashion, but not with any real teeth,"" he said. Campaigner Mark Kelly, whose 12-year-old sister Carol Ann was killed by a plastic bullet fired by a soldier in Belfast in 1981, said the government's proposals still amounted to an amnesty. ""They can paint it and colour it whatever way they like, but what they're trying to do is tell British soldiers that: 'No matter what you did in the north of Ireland, not only will there be no investigations into it,"" he said. Michelle O'Neill accused the government of trying to ""pull down the shutters on family campaigns for truth and justice"" Alan McBride, from victims' group the Wave Trauma Centre, said while the new proposals were better than the previous blanket amnesty, he was ""not so sure it is a huge improvement"". ""You could also probably argue that was a negotiation tactic from the British government in that they put out something so ridiculous and abhorrent that whatever they were seen to do would always be an improvement to that,"" he added. Victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose 22-year-old son Raymond Jr, was murdered by the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), in 1997, described the proposals as ""disgraceful and disgusting"". However, Veterans Commissioner Danny Kinahan has given the bill a cautious welcome after months consulting with several veterans' support groups. ""What they really want is the chance to be able to still pursue justice; still follow the rule of law,"" he said. ""And the changes we've got - which is why I say cautiously welcome - seem to be doing that, in that we're going to have a really, robust panel system which will dig down in for families so they can find out who blew them up, who shot them, who caused the harm."" Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill accused the government of trying to ""pull down the shutters on hundreds of family campaigns for truth and justice"". In atweet,external, she said: ""Prioritising the demands of their state forces over families is unjust and cruel. I stand with the families."" Gavin Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, said his party would be studying the detail of this bill but added they would ""continue to be a voice for innocent victims"". ""If this bill undermines access to justice for innocent victims then it will be a further corruption of justice,"" he said. The Alliance party's deputy leader, Stephen Farry, told his Twitter followers the new legislation ""lacks legitimacy and credibility"". ""This revised Bill has not been designed in conjunction with NI political parties or more crucially with victims' groups,"" hetweeted,external. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattietweeted,external""there can be no amnesty, no immunity from prosecution for acts resulting in death or injury regardless if it happened in UK or beyond"". Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood said it was a ""dereliction of duty"" for the government to push ahead with the legislation. ""The people who will lose the most from this new process are those who have already paid the worst price for the failure to deal with the legacy of our past,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government wants a negotiated settlement with the EU Liz Truss has said a new law would be introduced to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary insisted the bill would be legal under international law. Boris Johnson's government agreed the trade deal - which governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - with the European Union in 2019 after the Brexit vote. But a row over its impact on trade has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to join the power-sharing administration until reforms are made to the deal, which it says treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. In Parliament, Ms Truss said the proposed law would not scrap the deal but make limited changes, such as freeing the movement of UK-made goods from ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and regulatory barriers. But in response to Ms Truss's statement, the EU said it would ""need to respond with all measures at its disposal"" if the UK went ahead with the legislation. Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the unilateral action from the UK was ""damaging to trust"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland And Labour said the government should abide by the deal it signed, and work with the EU ""to find practical solutions to these problems"" rather than altering the deal unilaterally. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed the UK government's proposed legislation and said his party would take ""cautious"" steps to re-engage with power sharing in Northern Ireland as it progresses. This video can not be played Stephen Doughty asks if the government did not understand its Brexit agreement or if it ""intended to break it all along"". Ms Truss told MPs in response to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". She said the UK's preference remained a negotiated solution with the EU in consultation with its negotiator Maros Sefcovic, who has been invited to London for more talks. If a resolution cannot be reached, the UK would take steps to ""cement provisions"" that are working in the protocol, while ""fixing those elements that aren't"". ""The government is clear that proceeding with our legislation is consistent with our obligations under international law,"" she said. She said the bill would: Propose ""green"" and ""red"" lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ensure goods moving and staying in the UK are""freed of unnecessary bureaucracy""if they are not destined for the EU Remove regulatory barriersto goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland Allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards ina new dual regulatory regime Give the UK governmentpower to decide on tax and spend policiesacross the whole of the UK Addressissues related to governance, ""bringing the protocol in line with international norms"" Elections to Northern Ireland's Assembly on 5 May resulted in a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in. The party said the UK government was letting the DUP ""hold society to ransom"" after Mr Johnson met all political parties in Northern Ireland on Monday. Legislative solution on NI protocol needed - PM How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic said the European Commission ""stands ready to continue discussions with the UK government to identify joint solutions within the framework of the protocol"". ""Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the Protocol as announced today by the UK government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal,"" Mr Sefcovic added. ""Our overarching objective is to find joint solutions within the framework of the Protocol."" The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning What the foreign secretary is proposing would be a big change. It would mean Northern Ireland operating under a dual system for trade in goods rather than following EU rules. That's certainly more than a few tweaks. The government argues that an ""ambitious"" plan is now needed to safeguard peace and democracy. But it's not as if it inherited this problem; it negotiated the deal. It's pretty clear that many MPs are deeply unhappy with the idea of the UK now making one-sided changes and going back on an international agreement. The government insists it's acting within the law; it has promised to set out its legal position, although it's very unlikely we'll ever see the detailed legal advice behind it. Despite all of this, nothing will actually change immediately. Legislation would take time to pass through Parliament and hasn't even been published yet. Significantly, neither the EU nor the UK has walked away from negotiations and both say that's really how they want to settle this. Following Ms Truss's statement, some MPs - including Conservative Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Northern Ireland select committee - suggested the legislation would violate the protocol and breach international law. But Ms Truss assured MPs the legislation would not and said ""we will set out the legal position in due course"". Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse.

"Liverpool are on 89 points after 37 Premier League matches, with leaders Manchester City on 90 Liverpool have taken the Premier League title race down to the final day of the season by coming from behind to win at Southampton. Jurgen Klopp's side knew defeat would hand the title to Manchester City - while even a draw would effectively end the challenge because of their inferior goal difference. And it looked as if Liverpool might have a struggle on their hands when Nathan Redmond gave Southampton a 13th-minute lead with a curling right-foot shot beyond Alisson. Liverpool, with nine changes from the side that won the FA Cup by beating Chelsea on penalties at Wembley on Saturday, once again showed their resilience and reserves of strength as Takumi Minamino levelled before half-time with a thumping drive against the club where he spent a spell on loan last season. The pressure built after the break and Liverpool took a deserved lead after 67 minutes when Joel Matip sent an instinctive looping header over Saints' keeper Alex McCarthy. City will still retain their title with victory over Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium but Liverpool have pushed them all the way again and ensured the fight will go down to the wire. Southampton v Liverpool as it happened, plus reaction and analysis Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer Visit our Southampton page Go straight to all the best Liverpool content This video can not be played Southampton 1-2: Jurgen Klopp praises 'unbelievable' Liverpool performance Liverpool were under pressure going into this game - and not just because they could not afford a slip. Manager Klopp had to make a host of changes because of tired legs following that gruelling FA Cup final win and also had to contend with injuries to major figures Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. This was a test of the nerve as well as the depth of Liverpool's squad and, as at Aston Villa last week when they also fell behind, an examination of their ability to survive adversity and demonstrate powers of recovery. All the tests were passed in convincing style as Liverpool dominated once they had recovered from shock of Redmond's outstanding goal. In the absence of Salah and Sadio Mane, and with Luis Diaz on the bench, Roberto Firmino gave an outstanding display of touch and intelligent running, putting in a tireless shift that earned him a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. Ibrahima Konate has proved to be an outstanding signing and he was once again a tower of strength in defence, ensuring Liverpool did not miss Van Dijk - his defensive partner Matip scoring the winner with what looked almost like a reflex action header, albeit a highly effective one. The only blot on Liverpool's night was an injury to the luckless Joe Gomez, who fell awkwardly under a touchline challenge and limped off disconsolately at half-time with the consoling arm of goalkeeper Alisson around his shoulder. Klopp delivered his tradition triple fist pump in front of Liverpool's travelling fans at the final whistle. He will know City are still in pole position and have the title's destiny in their own hands but all Liverpool could do was put them through a final-day test and this was mission accomplished. This video can not be played Southampton 1-2 Liverpool: Defeat by Liverpool 'frustrating' - Ralph Hasenhuttl Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl was hoping for a vibrant display from his side after feeling the full force of fan discontent following their 3-0 defeat at Brentford last time out. The Austrian faced chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'sacked in the morning' during the dismal defeat in west London on 7 May. This was a tame response, ending as he led his team around a largely deserted stadium on a lap of appreciation after the final whistle. Saints had the boost of that early lead but never carried the air of a team confident it would be maintained. Liverpool confirmed their obvious superiority while the home side looked nervous, especially when playing out from the back, where they played themselves into trouble on several occasions. Southampton lie in 15th place, nearing the end of the season in which moments of promise were eventually overshadowed by disappointment. This is exactly where they finished last season and they have to win at Leicester City on Sunday to equal last term's points tally. Now Hasenhuttl will hope to keep hold of star man James Ward-Prowse this summer and get some much-needed financial backing from the club's new owners, the company backed by Serb media mogul Dragan Solak.

"Franklin Graham is the son of late preacher Billy Graham Mark Drakeford said he ""regrets"" that a US evangelist will appear at a conference centre which is partly owned by the Welsh government. Franklin Graham - who called gay marriage a ""sin"" - is due to bring his God Loves You Tour to ICC Wales, in Newport, on Saturday. But the first minister said the decision to go ahead was the responsibility of the venue. The centre is jointly owned by Welsh ministers and the Celtic Manor resort. It cancelled an appearance by Mr Graham, who is the son ofthe late preacher Billy Graham, in 2020 because of his views on homosexuality. ICC Wales said it had received assurances from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association that Mr Graham ""will not be speaking out against anyone, or any group of people"". Mr Graham said he was ""not coming to Wales to speak against anyone"". Mayor wants preacher's ads removed from city buses Franklin Graham rejects tour 'hate speech' claims In the Senedd, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""Mr Graham may be entitled to his homophobic beliefs but he is surely not entitled to be provided with a stage to air them at a convention centre that is 50% owned by the Welsh government."" He asked whether it sent out a message from Wales that ""homophobia and hate are somehow still acceptable"". The first minister said: ""I regret the fact that the event to which Adam Price referred is going ahead, but the decision is not one for the Welsh government. ""We do not run that centre and it's for those who are responsible for it to make those decisions. ""I'm sorry to see a person of those views given a platform to express them here in Wales and they absolutely do not reflect anything the Welsh government would be prepared to endorse or sanction.""

He said the Welsh government was working on a plan that ""aims to make us a genuinely LGBTQ+ friendly nation"". In a statement Mr Graham said: ""I'm not coming to Wales to speak against anyone, I'm coming to share a message of God's love. He added it was ""deeply concerning that public officials who are elected to represent their entire community would describe the traditional views that Christians have held for over a thousand years in Wales as 'hate'"". A spokesman for ICC Wales said it had ""received assurance from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) that the content of the God Loves You Tour - UK will not breach any UK laws and that the Reverend Franklin Graham will not be speaking out against anyone, or any group of people, and that his message will be one of God's love and non-discriminatory.""

Thank you Kay for all that you gave us. I cannot believe you've gone."" Doctor Who and It's A Sin writer Russell T Davies posted a tribute,externalon Instagram, saying: ""I adored her. She taught me so much. And she was hilarious... I think of her always when I'm writing."" The Syndicate and Waterloo Road actressKym Marsh tweeted,external: ""I am so so sad to hear of the passing of Kay Mellor. I had the pleasure of working with Kay briefly last year and it was an absolute honour. A huge talent, a huge personality a wonderful lady. She will be missed. Our thoughts are with her family and friends."" Former Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley described Mellor as""the best boss to work for"",,externalwhile Coronation Street's Antony Cotton noted that she""was a real trailblazer for women"".,external ITV's Band of Gold, which ran from 1995 to 1997 was considered a ground-breaking drama, bringing to life the lives of a group of sex workers in Bradford as they tried to take on police and gangsters in a bid to run their own street business. It gave Hollywood actress Samantha Morton one of her first major roles, later going on to star in films such as Minority Report opposite Tom Cruise. She also played Alpha in The Walking Dead. BBC One drama The Syndicate is about five members of a lottery syndicate who get a big win. Each of the four series featured a different group of people and setting, including a supermarket and a hospital. Mellor said she was inspired to write the drama because of ""the times we are living in, where people are desperate and holding on to the dream of winning the lottery as the only solution available"". The first series aired in 2012 and starred Timothy Spall and Gavin and Stacey actress Joanna Page. Series four came out last year. Asked about the setting of that first series being Leeds, Mellor said: ""I think it's vital that the north of England is represented in mainstream drama, not just soap opera. For me personally northern dramas have a different feeling because it feels like these are my people, this is the world I know, this is the world I grew up in. ""That's not to say that I don't watch and enjoy British dramas that are set in the south of England. I just think that geographically there needs to be equality and England exists outside of London."" Mellor - pictured here in the late 1990s - has been a mentor for many writers in the industry Mellor once told BBC Leeds: ""I am Leeds born and bred, and the city, both architecturally and socially, feeds my creativity. ""That's why I don't live in London. When people ask me why I don't live down there I always say, 'Why should I?' I would feel like a fish out of water."" Mellor's writing career began at Granada TV writing for long-running soap Coronation Street. She also wrote for Channel 4 soap Brookside. She went on to write Children's Ward with former Coronation Street writing colleague Paul Abbott before penning the dramas she made her name with series such as Band of Gold. Mellor was also an actress, starring in her own adaptation of Jane Eyre in 1997 and Gifted (2003). She also penned A Passionate Woman, based on the story of her own mother's doomed affair with a Polish fairground worker. The play was turned into a two-part BBC drama starring Billie Piper and Sue Johnston. In 2017, Mellor turned Fat Friends into a stage musical which toured the UK the following year. She also adapted Band of Gold, which toured the UK in 2019 but ended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mellor appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2017 and chose The Beautiful South's Perfect 10, the Fat Friends theme tune, as one of her sound tracks, saying ""every time I heard that I used to get excited and get butterflies"". She explained: ""It was such a lovely time of my life, it was a drama that was really important to me because I thought I had something to say about weight and body image.""

"Residents with views of the Brecon Beacons are worried about the ""frightening"" environmental impact of a new water treatment plant plan. Welsh Water wants to buy about 100 acres of farmland in Pontsarn, near Merthyr Tydfil, for the new plant. Residents will meet on Tuesday to discuss their concerns about the impact it may have on the environment. Welsh Water said the site is the most appropriate, and public consultation is under way. Water back on after contamination warning Water bills to rise almost 7% for some in Wales Swimmers warned over river sewage and pollution Fran Bevan, a member of the group campaigning against the project, said it ""hurts her heart"" that the plans were even being considered. ""Pontsarn has always been our go to place to get into our beautiful countryside,"" she said, adding: ""People are just devastated that they would even consider outing the site here. ""It hurts my heart that they would even consider building this site, the impact it's going to have on the environment is frightening."" Ms Bevan said communication with Welsh Water has been ""very poor"", and she felt a decision had already been reached before the public was consulted. ""They say that they will help to stop the impact on us, I can't see how they will do that with an industrial site in the middle of our beautiful countryside,"" she added. Welsh Water says the site is preferred because it's near the existing water network and its high elevation Angela Simms bought her house in Pontsarn 10 years ago because of the view. Her home is on the edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park and overlooks acres of green space. But she is disappointed with Welsh Water's decision to build a new water treatment site opposite and in an area popular with walkers. ""Of course it's really important that people get good quality water. People pay their water bills so that's what they expect, but at what cost?"" she asked. ""We're all talking about the environment. ""We're all more aware of our environment and how important it is to us and it doesn't seem that Welsh Water are in line with those conversations about looking after what we've got and protecting what we've got for the next generation,"" Ms Simms said. Welsh Water's treatment facilities nearby in Pontsticill, Llwyn-on and Cantref need modernising, according to the company, but it currently has no room to do so. Although some of the cleaning process will begin at those sites, water would then be transported via pipelines to the proposed site in Pontsarn for further treatment, according to plans. It said the work needed to be carried out so that more than 1.4 million customers across south Wales can continue to receive a reliable supply of clean water. In April about 150 people staged a protest next to the farm where the company hopes to develop its new facility. Campaigners hope many more local residents will attend the public meeting at Cefn Coed rugby club on Tuesday to discuss the plans. The proposed works will be built adjacent to a nature reserve which is considered a Site of Special Scientific Interest Concerns have been raised about the impact the works will have on green space to the north of Merthyr as well as the effect it could have on an area which is popular with tourists. The proposed facility will also be built adjacent to a nature reserve which is considered a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Chairperson of Protect Pontsarn Community Group Frances Bevan said: ""Around Merthyr Tydfil there are many brownfield sites that they could use. ""How they could even consider putting something in this area, we just can't grasp. The general feeling is 'no'. ""This isn't a nimby [not in my backyard] project because one of the other sites they originally chose was in a disused quarry, which is also in our area. So we're not against Welsh Water developing in our area, we just don't want it here."" In a statement, Welsh Water said: ""A number of sites in the area were considered for the works and each carefully assessed for their suitability. ""The preferred site is considered the most appropriate for a number of reasons including proximity to the existing water network, proximity to Llwyn-on, Cantref and Pontsticill reservoirs and its high elevation which minimises the energy needed to pump water to customers, therefore keeping its carbon emissions low. ""We are currently reviewing the comments received to assess how these can be incorporated into the plans for the works. The next step will be for us to hold the statutory consultation with the local community ahead of us submitting the planning application to the local authority. ""During the statutory consultation process, we will again engage with the local community and provide them with opportunities to come and view our plans and provide feedback.""

"Elon Musk has said his $44bn deal to buy Twitter may be in jeopardy due to a disagreement over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform. Mr Musk tweeted that the deal ""cannot move forward"" unless Twitter backs up its claims that less than 5% of daily users are fake or spam accounts. Twitter hasdefended its figures, adding that Mr Musk waived rights to ""due diligence"" to clinch the deal. The spat has raised doubts about the takeover. Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away. Mr Musk agreed the $44bn (Â£34.5bn) deal to buy Twitter with its board in April, but last week Mr Musk said the deal was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts. He has continued to press the issue in tweets and public appearances, while also hinting that he could seek a lower price. On Tuesday, Mr Musk said Twitter boss Parag Agrawal had ""publicly refused to show proof"" that fewer than 5% of its accounts were fake, and said the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Mr Agrawal does show proof. Mr Musk's tweet then appeared to be deleted. The billionaire, who also runs carmaker Tesla, has put the number of fake accounts at 20% or more. Elon Musk has doubled down on his position that his deal to buy the social network is on ice while the actual amount of spambots and accounts operating on it is investigated. Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has hit back, and tempers are flaring. When the richest man in the world replies to one of your tweets with just one symbol, the poo emoji, well, I suppose at least you know you've got his attention. I long ago gave up trying to read the mind of Elon Musk but let's indulge in a moment of speculation. He's making a big deal about fake accounts. Is it a convenient peg on which to hang a renegotiation? His initial $44bn offer for the firm was considerably higher than its current stock suggests. He moved swiftly and aggressively, perhaps even impulsively. To fund it, he's already had to sell a chunk of shares in one of his other companies, the electric car firm Tesla, and that in turn made a dent in the value of that company as it made other investors nervous. If either party in the Twitter deal walks away now, there's a $1bn termination fee. That may sound like small change to a multi-billionaire - although Mr Musk maintains he is asset-rich rather than cash-rich - but it perhaps gives him leverage to successfully shave a few billion off the offer price, because $1bn is not small change to Twitter and its shareholders. However, Mr Musk might be right to question Twitter's worth. If it really isn't bloated with spam, then perhaps it has less potential to be made great again, a phrase that may sound familiar given that he has already indicated that he would like to re-instate former US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump, by the way, has so far declined the invitation. Mr Musk and Mr Agrawal have been publicly debating the spambot figures on Twitter but relations appear to have soured. On Monday, Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the the firm's spam reporting with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure. Mr Musk has said he is concerned that advertisers on Twitter don't know what they are paying for. ""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" he wrote. After putting his offer on hold Mr Musk told a conference in Miami on Monday that ""you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed"". He said that a deal is ""not out of the question"" at a different price but added: ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow."" Twitter has said it is committed to completing the deal at the agreed price. In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, it told shareholders that Mr Musk's apparent eagerness to get the deal done, even without ordinary research into the business, set him apart from any other potential suitors. ""Other potential [buyers] would require substantial due diligence, creating a delay and risk to reaching the signing of such a potential transaction,"" it said. Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He said ""there is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users"". Researchers have estimated that anywhere from 4% to 20% or more of the millions of Twitter profiles are fake. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 8% down at $37.39, sowing doubts that Mr Musk would go ahead with his acquisition at the agreed price. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it ""looks increasingly likely that Elon Musk is positioning to renegotiate a sharply lower price tag for Twitter or even try and pull the pin on the deal"". She said that establishing the number of real users on Twitter is considered ""vital to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site"". ""The volatility which has hit tech stocks and contributed to a sharp decline in Twitter's valuation is also highly likely to be part of the equation,"" Ms Streeter said, adding that Mr Musk is ""clearly rueing the timing of his rash offer to pay $44bn for the social network"".

"The UK government pledges a law to change parts of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU on Northern Ireland Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the bill will ease trade and insists it will not break international law But the government is facing criticism, with many MPs questioning the legality of the plan In Brussels, EU negotiators say they have significant concerns and warn they could retaliate But Boris Johnson defends his government, saying: ""We don't want to nix it, we want to fix it"" Special trade arrangements - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - were needed after the UK left the EU But they have resulted in delays and price rises as goods arriving in Northern Ireland require paperwork Political institutions in Northern Ireland are at a standstill because of the issue but the majority of elected NI assembly members accept the protocol Edited by Emma Owen That's it from the live team on the protocol for today - as ever, any major developments will be found on the news home page -here. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Mary O'Connor, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott and Grainne Connolly. The editor was Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. This video can not be played Liz Truss Commons' statement on Northern Ireland Protocol We're winding up now after a long day of coverage on the complex issue of trade between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the EU. Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"There are more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% between January and March, its lowest for almost 50 years, as job openings rose to a new high of 1.3 million. However, wages, excluding bonuses, failed to keep pace with rising prices, a problem expected to intensify because of growing food and fuel costs. The figures show ""a mixed picture"" said the Office for National Statistics. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, said: ""Despite employment continuing to rise, today's figures underline the challenges facing workers who are seeing inflation eat away at their living standards."" The data showed that there was a rise in the number of people moving from economic inactivity - classed as those aged 16-64 who haven't been working or seeking a job - into employment. At the same time, people moving from job-to-job also reached a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", said the ONS. ""Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,"" he added. ""However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high."" Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise The situation is ""a nightmare"", said Buddy Love, who along with his wife Kate runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset. Mr Love said it has taken him six weeks and Â£2,000 worth of job adverts to find a new chef for his kitchen - and in the end it was word of mouth that delivered the right candidate rather than any advertisement. Buddy Love runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset ""I don't know where these people are,"" said Mr Love, adding that he had offered a good starting salary of Â£36,000 and perks such as free accommodation to entice the right person. Luckily, a Romanian couple, who had previously worked in the UK, will soon take up the role as a job share, freeing Mr Love from the kitchen so he can focus on his main job of ""developing the business and making sure it grows"". Pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.2% between January and March but failed to keep up with the rising cost of living - which hit 7% in March and is expected to go higher. It meant that pay, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, and excluding bonuses, dropped by 1.2% - the biggest fall since 2013. Some sectors such as construction and financial services benefitted from bonus payments as firms put up pay to recruit staff, the ONS said. This saw total pay, which includes bonuses, rise by 7% between January and March, keeping pace with rising prices. Mr Morgan said: ""Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms."" It is a tale of three jobs markets told in these figures. The unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in almost half a century is a testament to the full recovery from the losses in the pandemic and the protections put in place over the past two years. For many millions in employment however pay, when adjusted for surging inflation, fell by the biggest amount for over 9 years and that is set to get worse. And then for businesses seeking workers - those vacancies reached a new record of close to 1.3 million. This is a reflection of a reduction in the size of the workforce, from post-Brexit worker rules, older workers retiring during the pandemic and a rise in long term sickness. So considering the hit from the pandemic, these are a very good set of figures, looking backwards. But they don't yet, except in the real earnings figures, show the impact of the ongoing inflationary economic squeeze. Indeed, such is the extent of the hit to consumer spending power, the Bank of England and others see the economy heading into recessionary territory and unemployment starting to rise by hundreds of thousands. The Government hopes that as many of the remaining jobless can be squeezed into these vacancies. The fear is that this situation is overtaken by the dark inflationary clouds Pay has been failing to keep up with the cost of living for some months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and Ukraine war. Official data on Wednesday is expected to show another sharp rise in the cost of living for April, reflecting last month's hike in the energy price cap. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch is set to leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year and the jobs market slowing down. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it's reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared."" But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""These figures confirm families are facing a cost of living nightmare, with wages failing to keep up with soaring energy bills and food prices."" Looking ahead, Jake Finney, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said the jobless rate could begin to tick higher. ""We expect that unemployment could start to rise towards the end of this year, as headwinds from the war in Ukraine reduce demand for labour. ""The delayed impact is because the labour market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy"".

"Franklin Graham is the son of late preacher Billy Graham Mark Drakeford said he ""regrets"" that a US evangelist will appear at a conference centre which is partly owned by the Welsh government. Franklin Graham - who called gay marriage a ""sin"" - is due to bring his God Loves You Tour to ICC Wales, in Newport, on Saturday. But the first minister said the decision to go ahead was the responsibility of the venue. The centre is jointly owned by Welsh ministers and the Celtic Manor resort. It cancelled an appearance by Mr Graham, who is the son ofthe late preacher Billy Graham, in 2020 because of his views on homosexuality. ICC Wales said it had received assurances from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association that Mr Graham ""will not be speaking out against anyone, or any group of people"". Mr Graham said he was ""not coming to Wales to speak against anyone"". Mayor wants preacher's ads removed from city buses Franklin Graham rejects tour 'hate speech' claims In the Senedd, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""Mr Graham may be entitled to his homophobic beliefs but he is surely not entitled to be provided with a stage to air them at a convention centre that is 50% owned by the Welsh government."" He asked whether it sent out a message from Wales that ""homophobia and hate are somehow still acceptable"". The first minister said: ""I regret the fact that the event to which Adam Price referred is going ahead, but the decision is not one for the Welsh government. ""We do not run that centre and it's for those who are responsible for it to make those decisions. ""I'm sorry to see a person of those views given a platform to express them here in Wales and they absolutely do not reflect anything the Welsh government would be prepared to endorse or sanction."" Both politicians paid tribute to Jake Daniels, 17, who came out as the UK'sonly openly gay active male professional footballer, with Mr Drakeford calling him ""a very courageous young man"". He said the Welsh government was working on a plan that ""aims to make us a genuinely LGBTQ+ friendly nation"". In a statement Mr Graham said: ""I'm not coming to Wales to speak against anyone, I'm coming to share a message of God's love. He added it was ""deeply concerning that public officials who are elected to represent their entire community would describe the traditional views that Christians have held for over a thousand years in Wales as 'hate'"". A spokesman for ICC Wales said it had ""received assurance from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) that the content of the God Loves You Tour - UK will not breach any UK laws and that the Reverend Franklin Graham will not be speaking out against anyone, or any group of people, and that his message will be one of God's love and non-discriminatory.""

"Some of the poorest households in England and Wales are struggling to access council tax rebates to help offset their soaring energy bills, a charity has warned. National Energy Action said those who did not pay council tax by direct debit were affected, with many facing long waits for the Â£150 payouts. Councils say they are struggling to administer the rebates at short notice. But the government said they should make the payouts without further delay. Councils were expected to start paying the Â£150 rebates from April, when the energy price cap went up by Â£693 for the average household, leaving many struggling to pay their bills. All rebates must be paid by September, the government says. 'Rising prices harder on money than the pandemic' Confusion over council tax rebate timing How high could my energy bills go? However, the BBC looked at the websites of the 331 billing authorities in England and Wales responsible for administering the rebates and found a clear split in timings of payments for those who pay their council tax by direct debit and those who do not. This is because direct debit payments are far easier to process, due to local authorities already having the name and banking details of the household. The problem, says National Energy Action, is that it is typically the poorest households that do not pay council tax by direct debit - either because they do not have a bank account or because they manage their finances on a more ad hoc basis. ""There are serious concerns that those with the greatest need will be least able to access the money,"" said chief executive Adam Scorer. Chris O'Keefe and his friend John worry it will be hard to access the rebate As of the end of May, more than 280 English and Welsh councils said payments should have been made directly into people's bank accounts. However, the vast majority of councils said customers who did not pay by direct debit were likely to be contacted over the coming weeks, by email or by post, and urged to make an application online or over the telephone. Only 15 councils said they were already mailing out Post Office vouchers to non-direct debit households for them to exchange for cash. The Post Office say that scheme is a quick and secure way to get Â£150 into the hands of the most vulnerable, particularly those who don't have bank accounts. Homes in council bands A to D should receive the rebate There is a Disabled Band Reduction discount if your home is in bands A to E Those who pay council tax by direct debit will receive the reduction automatically If not, your council should contact you and may ask you to complete an online form, but extra support for those who struggle with that should be available If you don't hear from your council, contact them to check how you can claim the rebate. You should contact them before the end of September when the scheme closes If this is the case, your council may ask for bank details, but take care for scams and do not give any passwords You canfind your council on the government website,external Extra support in paying energy bills may also be available for vulnerable households. TheCitizens Advice website has more details,external Source: Citizens Advice The Lighthouse Project is a community hub set up to tackle poverty in Middleton, Greater Manchester. At its weekly coffee morning at the local shopping centre, there was a lot of confusion about the rebate. The town sits under Rochdale Borough Council, where over a third of residents do not pay council tax by direct debit. ""I think it's unfair,"" said Chris O'Keefe who pays his council tax weekly. ""Just because you don't pay by direct debit, it shouldn't mean you're not a priority. We should all be treated the same."" Chris and his friend John, who was sitting next to him, both live with a disability and say that keeping on top of their entitlements through the council's website or over the phone is already pretty tricky. Accessing the rebate is likely to be hard, they think. Carole Mboe did not know about the rebate at all Carole Mboe did not know about the rebate at all and worried that many people would not know how to apply online. ""Many people just do not have the computer skills,"" she said. Lianne Walker has learning difficulties and would struggle with a letter from the council. ""Either I'd get my neighbour to read it for me or I'd take it to my sister,"" she said. ""I'd be paranoid and all stressed and I might burst out crying."" But 90-year-old Rosemary Donnelly has already received her payment because she pays by direct debit, and has been telling her friends at the local lunch club to look out for it. ""Â£150 will make a lot of difference, because to some people it's an awful lot of money,"" she said. Rochdale Borough Council is processing 50,000 direct debit rebates and has just started to mail out letters to the other 30,000 locals who won't be paid automatically. Neil Emmott, who leads the council, said central government probably did not understand how complicated the process would be in many areas. ""I think governments sat in London don't always necessarily know what's taking place,"" he said. ""It's not fair, but give me an alternative way to do this?"" He added: ""The most vulnerable need this payment, and we are getting our skates on to get payments to those people as soon as possible."" But other councils have found it more straightforward. Just 90 miles away in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin Council has already processed 95% of its rebates, regardless of how residents pay their council tax bill. Cllr Rae Evans, who leads on finance and customer service in the area, said the council's experience of handling grant funding during the pandemic had helped it get on the front foot by investing in its website and app and pushing residents to pay by direct debit. ""We are immensely aware of the financial pressures that our residents and businesses are under,"" she said. ""We could see this coming earlier in the year, so it was thinking ahead that allowed us to be in the right place at the right time."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the energy rebate scheme in February Payment systems for the rebate vary across the nations of the UK. The BBC contacted 32 billing authorities in Scotland. 25 responded to confirm that the Â£150 is not rebated but instead credited onto the council tax bill, making monthly payments lower for the forthcoming financial year. Those exempt from paying council tax in Scotland can apply for a cheque. The government in Northern Ireland has received a proportionate amount of money which will go into their central funds. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said the rebate has been ""a significant task and not without its challenges"". ""Many residents who are signed up to direct debit will have already started to receive their rebate,"" a spokesperson said. ""Some councils have begun making payments this month to allow software to be fully tested and to ensure April direct debit payments are not recalled and many are now also focusing on contacting those eligible who do not pay their council tax by direct debit."" The LGA added that many local authorities had additional schemes in place for locals struggling with their energy bills. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said they expected local councils to start making payments without further delay. ""Direct debit is the quickest and easiest way to pay council tax, and the best way for most people to get the rebate. But councils have a range of options for people who don't pay by direct debit."" A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households. ""This includes a tax cut of over Â£330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt.""

"There are more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% between January and March, its lowest for almost 50 years, as job openings rose to a new high of 1.3 million. However, wages, excluding bonuses, failed to keep pace with rising prices, a problem expected to intensify because of growing food and fuel costs. The figures show ""a mixed picture"" said the Office for National Statistics. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, said: ""Despite employment continuing to rise, today's figures underline the challenges facing workers who are seeing inflation eat away at their living standards."" The data showed that there was a rise in the number of people moving from economic inactivity - classed as those aged 16-64 who haven't been working or seeking a job - into employment. At the same time, people moving from job-to-job also reached a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", said the ONS. ""Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,"" he added. ""However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high."" Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise The situation is ""a nightmare"", said Buddy Love, who along with his wife Kate runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset. Mr Love said it has taken him six weeks and Â£2,000 worth of job adverts to find a new chef for his kitchen - and in the end it was word of mouth that delivered the right candidate rather than any advertisement. Buddy Love runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset ""I don't know where these people are,"" said Mr Love, adding that he had offered a good starting salary of Â£36,000 and perks such as free accommodation to entice the right person. Luckily, a Romanian couple, who had previously worked in the UK, will soon take up the role as a job share, freeing Mr Love from the kitchen so he can focus on his main job of ""developing the business and making sure it grows"". Pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.2% between January and March but failed to keep up with the rising cost of living - which hit 7% in March and is expected to go higher. It meant that pay, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, and excluding bonuses, dropped by 1.2% - the biggest fall since 2013. Some sectors such as construction and financial services benefitted from bonus payments as firms put up pay to recruit staff, the ONS said. This saw total pay, which includes bonuses, rise by 7% between January and March, keeping pace with rising prices. Mr Morgan said: ""Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms."" It is a tale of three jobs markets told in these figures. The unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in almost half a century is a testament to the full recovery from the losses in the pandemic and the protections put in place over the past two years. For many millions in employment however pay, when adjusted for surging inflation, fell by the biggest amount for over 9 years and that is set to get worse. And then for businesses seeking workers - those vacancies reached a new record of close to 1.3 million. This is a reflection of a reduction in the size of the workforce, from post-Brexit worker rules, older workers retiring during the pandemic and a rise in long term sickness. So considering the hit from the pandemic, these are a very good set of figures, looking backwards. But they don't yet, except in the real earnings figures, show the impact of the ongoing inflationary economic squeeze. Indeed, such is the extent of the hit to consumer spending power, the Bank of England and others see the economy heading into recessionary territory and unemployment starting to rise by hundreds of thousands. The Government hopes that as many of the remaining jobless can be squeezed into these vacancies. The fear is that this situation is overtaken by the dark inflationary clouds Pay has been failing to keep up with the cost of living for some months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and Ukraine war. Official data on Wednesday is expected to show another sharp rise in the cost of living for April, reflecting last month's hike in the energy price cap. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch is set to leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year and the jobs market slowing down. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it's reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared."" But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""These figures confirm families are facing a cost of living nightmare, with wages failing to keep up with soaring energy bills and food prices."" Looking ahead, Jake Finney, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said the jobless rate could begin to tick higher. ""We expect that unemployment could start to rise towards the end of this year, as headwinds from the war in Ukraine reduce demand for labour. ""The delayed impact is because the labour market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy"".

"This video can not be played Offering lessons in school for free will give all children in Wales the same opportunities Singer Bronwen Lewis has welcomed new government plans to give all primary school pupils in Wales half a term's tuition by a musician. She said one-to-one music tuition is ""absolutely key"". Children will also have free access to a musical instrument from September as part of the new plan. Wales' education minister says music funding will triple from Â£1.5m to Â£4.5m a year for the next three years. The Welsh government has said children from low-income families and those with additional learning needs will be given priority. BBC teach: Free Primary School Music Resources Prioritising wellbeing essential, inspector says 'Boring' poems and books put students off Welsh Singer Bronwen Lewis says one-to-one lessons are key in music education Staff at St Joseph's Cathedral Primary School, Swansea, said playing instruments was already benefitting pupils' ""happiness and creativity"". Year Six pupil Rebecca, who goes to St David's Catholic Primary, said she loved to learn new instruments with friends. Year Six pupil Rebecca - who enjoys playing the ukulele - said it helps her relax ""I like playing instruments with my friends. Music brings people together, it's almost like a way of communicating,"" Rebecca added. ""It's fun to learn new songs and it helps me relax."" Welsh languagesinger and songwriter Bronwen Lewisthinks the changes will benefit children. When she was younger, the only one-to-one lessons Brownen could get were in a brass band, the singer from from the Dulais Valley, Neath Port Talbot, says. ""That wasn't something I was interested in. I was really interested in piano and guitar. ""They just didn't have the resources to be ale to teach as many children as they wanted one to one,"" she added. The additional funding for one-to-one teaching was ""brilliant"", the singer said. ""One-to-one tuition is just absolutely key when it comes to music."" ""Learning an instrument was a formative part of my upbringing and a lack of money should not be a barrier to any young person who wants to learn to play music,"" said First Minister Mark Drakeford. All children in Wales should be supported to ""play a full part"" in Wales' ""strong tradition"" of musical ensembles, he added. The plan includes a new national instrument and equipment library to be shared across Wales. The Welsh government said its ambition is for all children aged three to 16 to be offered a free instrument to practice with at school and at home - allowing children from households who might not be able to afford one to take part. Teacher Bethan Mari Williams praised the mental health benefits for children of playing music Bethan Mari Williams, teacher at St Joseph's said the school was already seeing benefit of the additional services. ""We hope it will help children get the chance to play different instruments than they normally would not have the opportunity to play outside school,"" she said. ""It also helps with mental health, especially after the last two years. There's a strong correlation between playing instruments, happiness and creativity, so hopefully it will also help the children's wellbeing. ""Some children who perhaps don't shine at academic subjects really do with the creative subjects. ""In our school we have a lot of diverse cultures and different languages, but music is one language that they can all perform together, which really helps."" Mr Miles said the cost of an instrument can be a barrier to some pupils Education minister Jeremy Miles said the money would ensure Wales continued to produce and nurture new talent. ""Anyone who has had the opportunity to learn an instrument at school will know how fantastic it is, the opportunities it brings and how it teaches important qualities such as self-reliance and being part of a team,"" he said.

"Franklin Graham is the son of late preacher Billy Graham Mark Drakeford said he ""regrets"" that a US evangelist will appear at a conference centre which is partly owned by the Welsh government. Franklin Graham - who called gay marriage a ""sin"" - is due to bring his God Loves You Tour to ICC Wales, in Newport, on Saturday. But the first minister said the decision to go ahead was the responsibility of the venue. The centre is jointly owned by Welsh ministers and the Celtic Manor resort. It cancelled an appearance by Mr Graham, who is the son ofthe late preacher Billy Graham, in 2020 because of his views on homosexuality. ICC Wales said it had received assurances from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association that Mr Graham ""will not be speaking out against anyone, or any group of people"". Mr Graham said he was ""not coming to Wales to speak against anyone"". Mayor wants preacher's ads removed from city buses Franklin Graham rejects tour 'hate speech' claims In the Senedd, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""Mr Graham may be entitled to his homophobic beliefs but he is surely not entitled to be provided with a stage to air them at a convention centre that is 50% owned by the Welsh government."" He asked whether it sent out a message from Wales that ""homophobia and hate are somehow still acceptable"". The first minister said: ""I regret the fact that the event to which Adam Price referred is going ahead, but the decision is not one for the Welsh government. ""We do not run that centre and it's for those who are responsible for it to make those decisions. ""I'm sorry to see a person of those views given a platform to express them here in Wales and they absolutely do not reflect anything the Welsh government would be prepared to endorse or sanction."" Both politicians paid tribute to Jake Daniels, 17, who came out as the UK'sonly openly gay active male professional footballer, with Mr Drakeford calling him ""a very courageous young man"". He said the Welsh government was working on a plan that ""aims to make us a genuinely LGBTQ+ friendly nation"". In a statement Mr Graham said: ""I'm not coming to Wales to speak against anyone, I'm coming to share a message of God's love. He added it was ""deeply concerning that public officials who are elected to represent their entire community would describe the traditional views that Christians have held for over a thousand years in Wales as 'hate'"". A spokesman for ICC Wales said it had ""received assurance from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) that the content of the God Loves You Tour - UK will not breach any UK laws and that the Reverend Franklin Graham will not be speaking out against anyone, or any group of people, and that his message will be one of God's love and non-discriminatory.""

"This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government wants a negotiated settlement with the EU Liz Truss has said a new law would be introduced to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary insisted the bill would be legal under international law. Boris Johnson's government agreed the trade deal - which governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - with the European Union in 2019 after the Brexit vote. But a row over its impact on trade has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to join the power-sharing administration until reforms are made to the deal, which it says treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. In Parliament, Ms Truss said the proposed law would not scrap the deal but make limited changes, such as freeing the movement of UK-made goods from ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and regulatory barriers. But in response to Ms Truss's statement, the EU said it would ""need to respond with all measures at its disposal"" if the UK went ahead with the legislation. Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the unilateral action from the UK was ""damaging to trust"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland And Labour said the government should abide by the deal it signed, and work with the EU ""to find practical solutions to these problems"" rather than altering the deal unilaterally. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed the UK government's proposed legislation and said his party would take ""cautious"" steps to re-engage with power sharing in Northern Ireland as it progresses. This video can not be played Stephen Doughty asks if the government did not understand its Brexit agreement or if it ""intended to break it all along"". Ms Truss told MPs in response to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". She said the UK's preference remained a negotiated solution with the EU in consultation with its negotiator Maros Sefcovic, who has been invited to London for more talks. If a resolution cannot be reached, the UK would take steps to ""cement provisions"" that are working in the protocol, while ""fixing those elements that aren't"". ""The government is clear that proceeding with our legislation is consistent with our obligations under international law,"" she said. She said the bill would: Propose ""green"" and ""red"" lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ensure goods moving and staying in the UK are""freed of unnecessary bureaucracy""if they are not destined for the EU Remove regulatory barriersto goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland Allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards ina new dual regulatory regime Give the UK governmentpower to decide on tax and spend policiesacross the whole of the UK Addressissues related to governance, ""bringing the protocol in line with international norms"" Elections to Northern Ireland's Assembly on 5 May resulted in a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in. The party said the UK government was letting the DUP ""hold society to ransom"" after Mr Johnson met all political parties in Northern Ireland on Monday. Legislative solution on NI protocol needed - PM How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic said the European Commission ""stands ready to continue discussions with the UK government to identify joint solutions within the framework of the protocol"". ""Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the Protocol as announced today by the UK government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal,"" Mr Sefcovic added. ""Our overarching objective is to find joint solutions within the framework of the Protocol."" The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning What the foreign secretary is proposing would be a big change. It would mean Northern Ireland operating under a dual system for trade in goods rather than following EU rules. That's certainly more than a few tweaks. The government argues that an ""ambitious"" plan is now needed to safeguard peace and democracy. But it's not as if it inherited this problem; it negotiated the deal. It's pretty clear that many MPs are deeply unhappy with the idea of the UK now making one-sided changes and going back on an international agreement. The government insists it's acting within the law; it has promised to set out its legal position, although it's very unlikely we'll ever see the detailed legal advice behind it. Despite all of this, nothing will actually change immediately. Legislation would take time to pass through Parliament and hasn't even been published yet. Significantly, neither the EU nor the UK has walked away from negotiations and both say that's really how they want to settle this. Following Ms Truss's statement, some MPs - including Conservative Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Northern Ireland select committee - suggested the legislation would violate the protocol and breach international law. But Ms Truss assured MPs the legislation would not and said ""we will set out the legal position in due course"". Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse.

"There are more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% between January and March, its lowest for almost 50 years, as job openings rose to a new high of 1.3 million. However, wages, excluding bonuses, failed to keep pace with rising prices, a problem expected to intensify because of growing food and fuel costs. The figures show ""a mixed picture"" said the Office for National Statistics. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, said: ""Despite employment continuing to rise, today's figures underline the challenges facing workers who are seeing inflation eat away at their living standards."" The data showed that there was a rise in the number of people moving from economic inactivity - classed as those aged 16-64 who haven't been working or seeking a job - into employment. At the same time, people moving from job-to-job also reached a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", said the ONS. ""Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,"" he added. ""However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high."" Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise The situation is ""a nightmare"", said Buddy Love, who along with his wife Kate runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset. Mr Love said it has taken him six weeks and Â£2,000 worth of job adverts to find a new chef for his kitchen - and in the end it was word of mouth that delivered the right candidate rather than any advertisement. Buddy Love runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset ""I don't know where these people are,"" said Mr Love, adding that he had offered a good starting salary of Â£36,000 and perks such as free accommodation to entice the right person. Luckily, a Romanian couple, who had previously worked in the UK, will soon take up the role as a job share, freeing Mr Love from the kitchen so he can focus on his main job of ""developing the business and making sure it grows"". Pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.2% between January and March but failed to keep up with the rising cost of living - which hit 7% in March and is expected to go higher. It meant that pay, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, and excluding bonuses, dropped by 1.2% - the biggest fall since 2013. Some sectors such as construction and financial services benefitted from bonus payments as firms put up pay to recruit staff, the ONS said. This saw total pay, which includes bonuses, rise by 7% between January and March, keeping pace with rising prices. Mr Morgan said: ""Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms."" It is a tale of three jobs markets told in these figures. The unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in almost half a century is a testament to the full recovery from the losses in the pandemic and the protections put in place over the past two years. For many millions in employment however pay, when adjusted for surging inflation, fell by the biggest amount for over 9 years and that is set to get worse. And then for businesses seeking workers - those vacancies reached a new record of close to 1.3 million. This is a reflection of a reduction in the size of the workforce, from post-Brexit worker rules, older workers retiring during the pandemic and a rise in long term sickness. So considering the hit from the pandemic, these are a very good set of figures, looking backwards. But they don't yet, except in the real earnings figures, show the impact of the ongoing inflationary economic squeeze. Indeed, such is the extent of the hit to consumer spending power, the Bank of England and others see the economy heading into recessionary territory and unemployment starting to rise by hundreds of thousands. The Government hopes that as many of the remaining jobless can be squeezed into these vacancies. The fear is that this situation is overtaken by the dark inflationary clouds Pay has been failing to keep up with the cost of living for some months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and Ukraine war. Official data on Wednesday is expected to show another sharp rise in the cost of living for April, reflecting last month's hike in the energy price cap. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch is set to leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year and the jobs market slowing down. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it's reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared."" But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""These figures confirm families are facing a cost of living nightmare, with wages failing to keep up with soaring energy bills and food prices."" Looking ahead, Jake Finney, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said the jobless rate could begin to tick higher. ""We expect that unemployment could start to rise towards the end of this year, as headwinds from the war in Ukraine reduce demand for labour. ""The delayed impact is because the labour market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy"".

"Some of the poorest households in England and Wales are struggling to access council tax rebates to help offset their soaring energy bills, a charity has warned. National Energy Action said those who did not pay council tax by direct debit were affected, with many facing long waits for the Â£150 payouts. Councils say they are struggling to administer the rebates at short notice. But the government said they should make the payouts without further delay. Councils were expected to start paying the Â£150 rebates from April, when the energy price cap went up by Â£693 for the average household, leaving many struggling to pay their bills. All rebates must be paid by September, the government says. 'Rising prices harder on money than the pandemic' Confusion over council tax rebate timing How high could my energy bills go? However, the BBC looked at the websites of the 331 billing authorities in England and Wales responsible for administering the rebates and found a clear split in timings of payments for those who pay their council tax by direct debit and those who do not. This is because direct debit payments are far easier to process, due to local authorities already having the name and banking details of the household. The problem, says National Energy Action, is that it is typically the poorest households that do not pay council tax by direct debit - either because they do not have a bank account or because they manage their finances on a more ad hoc basis. ""There are serious concerns that those with the greatest need will be least able to access the money,"" said chief executive Adam Scorer. Chris O'Keefe and his friend John worry it will be hard to access the rebate As of the end of May, more than 280 English and Welsh councils said payments should have been made directly into people's bank accounts. However, the vast majority of councils said customers who did not pay by direct debit were likely to be contacted over the coming weeks, by email or by post, and urged to make an application online or over the telephone. Only 15 councils said they were already mailing out Post Office vouchers to non-direct debit households for them to exchange for cash. The Post Office say that scheme is a quick and secure way to get Â£150 into the hands of the most vulnerable, particularly those who don't have bank accounts. Homes in council bands A to D should receive the rebate There is a Disabled Band Reduction discount if your home is in bands A to E Those who pay council tax by direct debit will receive the reduction automatically If not, your council should contact you and may ask you to complete an online form, but extra support for those who struggle with that should be available If you don't hear from your council, contact them to check how you can claim the rebate. You should contact them before the end of September when the scheme closes If this is the case, your council may ask for bank details, but take care for scams and do not give any passwords You canfind your council on the government website,external Extra support in paying energy bills may also be available for vulnerable households. TheCitizens Advice website has more details,external Source: Citizens Advice The Lighthouse Project is a community hub set up to tackle poverty in Middleton, Greater Manchester. At its weekly coffee morning at the local shopping centre, there was a lot of confusion about the rebate. The town sits under Rochdale Borough Council, where over a third of residents do not pay council tax by direct debit. ""I think it's unfair,"" said Chris O'Keefe who pays his council tax weekly. ""Just because you don't pay by direct debit, it shouldn't mean you're not a priority. We should all be treated the same."" Chris and his friend John, who was sitting next to him, both live with a disability and say that keeping on top of their entitlements through the council's website or over the phone is already pretty tricky. Accessing the rebate is likely to be hard, they think. Carole Mboe did not know about the rebate at all Carole Mboe did not know about the rebate at all and worried that many people would not know how to apply online. ""Many people just do not have the computer skills,"" she said. Lianne Walker has learning difficulties and would struggle with a letter from the council. ""Either I'd get my neighbour to read it for me or I'd take it to my sister,"" she said. ""I'd be paranoid and all stressed and I might burst out crying."" But 90-year-old Rosemary Donnelly has already received her payment because she pays by direct debit, and has been telling her friends at the local lunch club to look out for it. ""Â£150 will make a lot of difference, because to some people it's an awful lot of money,"" she said. Rochdale Borough Council is processing 50,000 direct debit rebates and has just started to mail out letters to the other 30,000 locals who won't be paid automatically. Neil Emmott, who leads the council, said central government probably did not understand how complicated the process would be in many areas. ""I think governments sat in London don't always necessarily know what's taking place,"" he said. ""It's not fair, but give me an alternative way to do this?"" He added: ""The most vulnerable need this payment, and we are getting our skates on to get payments to those people as soon as possible."" But other councils have found it more straightforward. Just 90 miles away in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin Council has already processed 95% of its rebates, regardless of how residents pay their council tax bill. Cllr Rae Evans, who leads on finance and customer service in the area, said the council's experience of handling grant funding during the pandemic had helped it get on the front foot by investing in its website and app and pushing residents to pay by direct debit. ""We are immensely aware of the financial pressures that our residents and businesses are under,"" she said. ""We could see this coming earlier in the year, so it was thinking ahead that allowed us to be in the right place at the right time."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the energy rebate scheme in February Payment systems for the rebate vary across the nations of the UK. The BBC contacted 32 billing authorities in Scotland. 25 responded to confirm that the Â£150 is not rebated but instead credited onto the council tax bill, making monthly payments lower for the forthcoming financial year. Those exempt from paying council tax in Scotland can apply for a cheque. The government in Northern Ireland has received a proportionate amount of money which will go into their central funds. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said the rebate has been ""a significant task and not without its challenges"". ""Many residents who are signed up to direct debit will have already started to receive their rebate,"" a spokesperson said. ""Some councils have begun making payments this month to allow software to be fully tested and to ensure April direct debit payments are not recalled and many are now also focusing on contacting those eligible who do not pay their council tax by direct debit."" The LGA added that many local authorities had additional schemes in place for locals struggling with their energy bills. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said they expected local councils to start making payments without further delay. ""Direct debit is the quickest and easiest way to pay council tax, and the best way for most people to get the rebate. But councils have a range of options for people who don't pay by direct debit."" A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households. ""This includes a tax cut of over Â£330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt.""

"A new app has been launched by the UK government to prevent people falling victim to online approaches by foreign spies. MI5 says it has seen 10,000 UK nationals targeted by fake social media profiles on sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. The spies are seeking to lure people into passing on sensitive information. The Think Before You Link app will help people spot suspicious approaches. Spies have long approached people with access to sensitive information, but the online world has allowed this to happen at huge scale and at distance. There is no longer a need to sidle up to someone at a conference or over a coffee when you can use a fake profile online to lure them into a conversation. Initially those approached may be asked for less sensitive information before a line is crossed. The government has released a series of case studies illustrating how people have been approached by spies seeking sensitive information. In one, an unnamed former civil servant with security clearances was approached online over a professional networking site, and then travelled to a foreign country for meetings. Over a six-month period, they were provided with a ""covert communications system"" and asked to provide sensitive government information. That case is used as an example of the growing threat of online approaches by foreign spies. In another example, a serving security-cleared civil servant was approached by someone pretending to be from a think tank. Because they appeared to have a shared contact, the civil servant assumed the profile was genuine, despite some doubts. That led to a series of messages and the offer of a business consultancy. The number of these approaches has increased significantly, officials say, with MI5 spotting 10,000 people across society being approached last year. Ken McCallum, director general of MI5, said, ""Foreign spies are actively working to build relationships with those working in government, in high-tech business and in academia. ""The Think Before You Link app supports those who may be receiving disguised approaches, helping them to conduct their own digital due diligence before accepting unknown contacts online."" Although not mentioned directly, China is often described as being behind many of these campaigns. The app is primarily aimed at government officials and those in sensitive industries, but everyone will be able to download it for free from today. Designed with the help of behavioural scientists, the app prompts users with a series of questions to help assess if someone who has approached them might be fake. This includes being on the look-out for flattery or offers which appear too good to be true. According to the app's website,external, users will even be able to earn ""trophies and certificates which can be shared with their security team"". The app also includes an inbuilt reverse image search to spot pictures which may be re-used from other sites, since this is often a hallmark of fake identities. The user's responses will be analysed to say whether a profile is high, medium or low-risk. If it is medium or high, they will be recommended to report it. The app doesn't access a database of spies and can't provide a definitive answer, but is designed to highlight the risks. The app is unlikely to be effective against the most sophisticated spies who will use real rather than fake identities. And in the future, the ability to spot fake spies may become harder, as states employ artificial intelligence and more effective ""deep fakes"" to manufacture identities. The app is the latest move from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure's (CPNI) Think Before You Link campaign. Fake profiles are being created on an ""industrial scale"", according to Steve Barclay, lead Minister for Cyber Security: ""It is therefore crucial that we do all we can to protect ourselves and our information, ensuring those who we connect with online are who they say they are. This new app will be an important tool in that endeavour.""

It would mean Northern Ireland operating under a dual system for trade in goods rather than following EU rules. That's certainly more than a few tweaks. The government argues that an ""ambitious"" plan is now needed to safeguard peace and democracy. But it's not as if it inherited this problem; it negotiated the deal. It's pretty clear that many MPs are deeply unhappy with the idea of the UK now making one-sided changes and going back on an international agreement. The government insists it's acting within the law; it has promised to set out its legal position, although it's very unlikely we'll ever see the detailed legal advice behind it. Despite all of this, nothing will actually change immediately. Legislation would take time to pass through Parliament and hasn't even been published yet. Significantly, neither the EU nor the UK has walked away from negotiations and both say that's really how they want to settle this. Following Ms Truss's statement, some MPs - including Conservative Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Northern Ireland select committee - suggested the legislation would violate the protocol and breach international law. But Ms Truss assured MPs the legislation would not and said ""we will set out the legal position in due course"". Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse.

"Actress, screenwriter and director Kay Mellor has died aged 71, it has been announced. A spokesman for her TV production company, Rollem Productions, confirmed ""with profound sadness"" that she died on Sunday. She was known for creating and writing the ITV series Fat Friends - which helped launch James Corden's career. Mellor also wrote comedy and drama series such as The Syndicate, Girlfriends and Band of Gold. A Rollem Productions spokesman said: ""It is with profound sadness that we announce the untimely and sudden passing of our beloved friend, mentor and colleague Kay Mellor on Sunday 15 May 2022. ""We have lost a phenomenal talent and a true luminary. We ask that you please respect the privacy of the family and friends at this time."" Kay Mellor: A Leeds woman through and through Mellor began her career writing plays, worked on Coronation Street and created the award-winning children's drama Children's Ward. She also wrote BBC One's women's football series Playing The Field and in 2010 received an OBE. Mellor was made an OBE in 2016 Fat Friends aired from 2000-2005 and gave a young Corden his first major acting role. It also starred Ruth Jones, Sheridan Smith and Alison Steadman. The BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, paid tribute to Kay Mellor following her death, saying she was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the news. ""Kay was an outstanding writer and the creative force behind many of the nation's best-loved television dramas,"" Moore said. ""She wrote with such heart, humanity, humour and passion with strong female characters often taking centre stage."" Writing on Instagram, Corden said:,external""[Mellor] was the most generous, kind and loving person. An exceptionally gifted writer. She changed my life when she cast me in Fat Friends on ITV. She saw something in me that no one had before that point. ""She gave so many people their first chances. I have the fondest memories of being on set with her. She will be missed by so many. My thoughts are with her family and friends at this time."" West Yorkshire mayorTracy Brabin paid tribute on Twitter,external, writing: ""Just dreadful news & difficult to take in. Sending all our love from everyone in West Yorkshire to Kay's family, friends & colleagues. ""Our voice of the North, she put working class characters at the centre of her brilliant compassionate, moving & funny stories. Such a loss."" Sir Lenny Henry, who starred in The Syndicate, tweeted,external: ""I was saddened to hear that Kay Mellor has died. I was lucky to work with her on the Syndicate and found her to be incredibly creative, funny and instinctive. ""She knew what she wanted and knew how to get the best from us as actors. She will be missed. Condolences to her family."" Mellor's daughter Gaynor (left) is an actress and has starred in Coronation Street and several of her mum's dramas Gavin and Stacey writer Ruth Jones told the PA news agency: ""She was a great mentor to me when I first started writing - and always hugely encouraging of new writers - a real testament to the idea of paying it forward. ""Her series Fat Friends was a massive turning point in my career and I will be eternally grateful to her for what she did for me. ""British television has lost one of its greats. Thank you Kay for all that you gave us. I cannot believe you've gone."" Doctor Who and It's A Sin writer Russell T Davies posted a tribute,externalon Instagram, saying: ""I adored her. She taught me so much. And she was hilarious... I think of her always when I'm writing."" The Syndicate and Waterloo Road actressKym Marsh tweeted,external: ""I am so so sad to hear of the passing of Kay Mellor. I had the pleasure of working with Kay briefly last year and it was an absolute honour. A huge talent, a huge personality a wonderful lady. She will be missed. Our thoughts are with her family and friends."" Former Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley described Mellor as""the best boss to work for"",,externalwhile Coronation Street's Antony Cotton noted that she""was a real trailblazer for women"".,external ITV's Band of Gold, which ran from 1995 to 1997 was considered a ground-breaking drama, bringing to life the lives of a group of sex workers in Bradford as they tried to take on police and gangsters in a bid to run their own street business. It gave Hollywood actress Samantha Morton one of her first major roles, later going on to star in films such as Minority Report opposite Tom Cruise. She also played Alpha in The Walking Dead. BBC One drama The Syndicate is about five members of a lottery syndicate who get a big win. Each of the four series featured a different group of people and setting, including a supermarket and a hospital. Mellor said she was inspired to write the drama because of ""the times we are living in, where people are desperate and holding on to the dream of winning the lottery as the only solution available"". The first series aired in 2012 and starred Timothy Spall and Gavin and Stacey actress Joanna Page. Series four came out last year. Asked about the setting of that first series being Leeds, Mellor said: ""I think it's vital that the north of England is represented in mainstream drama, not just soap opera. For me personally northern dramas have a different feeling because it feels like these are my people, this is the world I know, this is the world I grew up in. ""That's not to say that I don't watch and enjoy British dramas that are set in the south of England. I just think that geographically there needs to be equality and England exists outside of London."" Mellor - pictured here in the late 1990s - has been a mentor for many writers in the industry Mellor once told BBC Leeds: ""I am Leeds born and bred, and the city, both architecturally and socially, feeds my creativity. ""That's why I don't live in London. When people ask me why I don't live down there I always say, 'Why should I?' I would feel like a fish out of water."" Mellor's writing career began at Granada TV writing for long-running soap Coronation Street. She also wrote for Channel 4 soap Brookside. She went on to write Children's Ward with former Coronation Street writing colleague Paul Abbott before penning the dramas she made her name with series such as Band of Gold. Mellor was also an actress, starring in her own adaptation of Jane Eyre in 1997 and Gifted (2003). She also penned A Passionate Woman, based on the story of her own mother's doomed affair with a Polish fairground worker. The play was turned into a two-part BBC drama starring Billie Piper and Sue Johnston. In 2017, Mellor turned Fat Friends into a stage musical which toured the UK the following year. She also adapted Band of Gold, which toured the UK in 2019 but ended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mellor appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2017 and chose The Beautiful South's Perfect 10, the Fat Friends theme tune, as one of her sound tracks, saying ""every time I heard that I used to get excited and get butterflies"". She explained: ""It was such a lovely time of my life, it was a drama that was really important to me because I thought I had something to say about weight and body image.""

"The UK government pledges a law to change parts of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU on Northern Ireland Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the bill will ease trade and insists it will not break international law But the government is facing criticism, with many MPs questioning the legality of the plan In Brussels, EU negotiators say they have significant concerns and warn they could retaliate But Boris Johnson defends his government, saying: ""We don't want to nix it, we want to fix it"" Special trade arrangements - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - were needed after the UK left the EU But they have resulted in delays and price rises as goods arriving in Northern Ireland require paperwork Political institutions in Northern Ireland are at a standstill because of the issue but the majority of elected NI assembly members accept the protocol Edited by Emma Owen That's it from the live team on the protocol for today - as ever, any major developments will be found on the news home page -here. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Mary O'Connor, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott and Grainne Connolly. The editor was Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. This video can not be played Liz Truss Commons' statement on Northern Ireland Protocol We're winding up now after a long day of coverage on the complex issue of trade between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the EU. Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government wants a negotiated settlement with the EU Liz Truss has said a new law would be introduced to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary insisted the bill would be legal under international law. Boris Johnson's government agreed the trade deal - which governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - with the European Union in 2019 after the Brexit vote. But a row over its impact on trade has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to join the power-sharing administration until reforms are made to the deal, which it says treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. In Parliament, Ms Truss said the proposed law would not scrap the deal but make limited changes, such as freeing the movement of UK-made goods from ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and regulatory barriers. But in response to Ms Truss's statement, the EU said it would ""need to respond with all measures at its disposal"" if the UK went ahead with the legislation. Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the unilateral action from the UK was ""damaging to trust"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland And Labour said the government should abide by the deal it signed, and work with the EU ""to find practical solutions to these problems"" rather than altering the deal unilaterally. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed the UK government's proposed legislation and said his party would take ""cautious"" steps to re-engage with power sharing in Northern Ireland as it progresses. This video can not be played Stephen Doughty asks if the government did not understand its Brexit agreement or if it ""intended to break it all along"". Ms Truss told MPs in response to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". She said the UK's preference remained a negotiated solution with the EU in consultation with its negotiator Maros Sefcovic, who has been invited to London for more talks. If a resolution cannot be reached, the UK would take steps to ""cement provisions"" that are working in the protocol, while ""fixing those elements that aren't"". ""The government is clear that proceeding with our legislation is consistent with our obligations under international law,"" she said. She said the bill would: Propose ""green"" and ""red"" lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ensure goods moving and staying in the UK are""freed of unnecessary bureaucracy""if they are not destined for the EU Remove regulatory barriersto goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland Allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards ina new dual regulatory regime Give the UK governmentpower to decide on tax and spend policiesacross the whole of the UK Addressissues related to governance, ""bringing the protocol in line with international norms"" Elections to Northern Ireland's Assembly on 5 May resulted in a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in.

Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse.

"The UK government pledges a law to change parts of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU on Northern Ireland Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the bill will ease trade and insists it will not break international law But the government is facing criticism, with many MPs questioning the legality of the plan In Brussels, EU negotiators say they have significant concerns and warn they could retaliate But Boris Johnson defends his government, saying: ""We don't want to nix it, we want to fix it"" Special trade arrangements - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - were needed after the UK left the EU But they have resulted in delays and price rises as goods arriving in Northern Ireland require paperwork Political institutions in Northern Ireland are at a standstill because of the issue but the majority of elected NI assembly members accept the protocol Edited by Emma Owen That's it from the live team on the protocol for today - as ever, any major developments will be found on the news home page -here. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Mary O'Connor, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott and Grainne Connolly. The editor was Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. This video can not be played Liz Truss Commons' statement on Northern Ireland Protocol We're winding up now after a long day of coverage on the complex issue of trade between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the EU. Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hana was worried for her own health when she sought abortion care - and was left feeling tricked When Hana found out she was pregnant, she knew she wanted to have an abortion - but her search for a clinic on Google led her to an anti-abortion centre, set on talking her out of her decision. In many US states, BBC News has seen misleading websites advertising these clinics appearing high up in Google search results - and Facebook adverts with inaccurate medical advice - while genuine abortion providers are having their ads rejected and accounts restricted. Advice centres, such as the one visited by Hana - a 19-year-old living in the north-eastern US state of Massachusetts - are often run by Christian organisations. They may offer some medical services such as pregnancy tests and ultrasounds - but some of their online promotion falsely suggests they also provide pregnancy-termination services. It wasn't until Hana was walking down the centre's corridor, lined with posters comparing the procedure to murder, that it began to dawn on her this was not the abortion clinic she believed it to be. Hana describes herself as a ""nerdy researcher"", studying a health-related course at college - but nothing about the clinic's website tipped her off to the service it actually provides. The home page says: ""Take control - start with a free abortion consultation."" And in a tab labelled: ""Get care,"" it lists the types of abortion (medical and surgical) that can be performed during different trimesters of pregnancy, under the heading: ""You just found out you're pregnant and want to know your options."" Once there, Hana says, she was told, inaccurately, abortions were linked to infertility and breast cancer - and having had a Covid-19 vaccine, she might lose the pregnancy anyway, making abortion unnecessary,despite the evidence suggesting vaccinated people are no more likely to miscarryand, in fact, better protected against the risks of pre-term and still birth associated with Covid. She was also pressured to view the ultrasound scan against her wishes. ""What kind of mother doesn't want to see a picture of their child?"" asked the person attending to her. Hana was left feeling deceived and betrayed. The Human Coalition, an anti-abortion group providing marketing for the centre and more than 40 others, told BBC News: ""We find in our work, most abortion-determined women do not desire an abortion, they desire help. ""We're here to empower women by filling that gap - connecting women to the care and support they want, to choose life."" Google displays adverts above search results for certain terms. Advertisers bid to have their ads appear first, Google says, although the order should also be determined by ""relevance"" and ""overall quality"". But, Whitney Chinogwenya, of MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly Marie Stopes international) says, this creates a ""battle of budgets"", with regulated abortion clinics competing with anti-abortion clinics or unregulated pill providers for ad space on specific search terms. Several large global abortion providers have also told BBC News they regularly have their online material referring to abortion censored without explanation, including having YouTube channels suspended, social-media accounts restricted and Facebook and Google ads rejected. In 2019, having been criticised for hosting misleading adverts, Google tried to crack down on abortion-advice clinics, which are most common in the US but can also be found across Europe (including the UK), Africa and Latin America. In the US, UK and Ireland, anyone running an ad mentioning abortion must first apply for a certificate. Ads from advice clinics not offering abortions can still run but will be given a disclaimer the advertiser ""does not provide abortions"". Hana says she did not see this disclaimer. It appears in very small font underneath the search headline and description. Sarah Eagan, a researcher for campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate, questions whether Google should be taking money at all for anti-abortion ads that target keywords used by people actively seeking terminations. The CCDH has also found anti-abortion ads promoting unproven medicines remaining on Facebook. And at the other end of the spectrum, the researchers found Google's autocomplete function suggesting ineffective do-it-yourself abortion methods. Kelly, like Hana, says she was given inaccurate medical information as she struggled to find an affordable and safe way to terminate her pregnancy in her home state of Texas. What is Roe v Wade ruling on abortion? What happens if Roe v Wade is overturned Kelly said she clicked on the clinic's website in desperation, knowing she couldn't afford a doctor. Between jobs and without insurance, she could not afford ""an actual doctor's visit"" so searched for affordable clinics. Finding her way to an anti-abortion centre, Kelly says she was frightened with warnings she could ""bleed out"" and risk her life but not given the context medical abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Kelly feels promoting free pregnancy tests targets low-income women. The centre appears to be using organic search, not adverts, making it more complicated to regulate. It says its website clearly states: ""We do not refer or perform abortions,"" adding it provides ""free services annually to over 5,000 minority poor under-served single mothers"". Two drugs are used for a medical abortion - misoprostol and mifepristone Eventually, Kelly was prescribed termination drugs - just hours before she passed the 12-week limit for a safe medical abortion. But Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C, the organisation that helped Kelly access these abortion pills, says its online material is routinely ""disallowed for violating community standards"" on Facebook, Instagram and Google. Google says it has clear policies governing abortion-related ads, some determined by local laws and regulations. Some of the posts and channels flagged by BBC News had been removed in error and since reinstated, it said. Facebook said it had restored a small number of incorrectly rejected ads for abortion providers.

move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Here are some images taken as people came out to celebrate, despite the continuing war in the country. The designs on some vyshyvankas have meanings such as hope, fertility and protection Children were among those who gathered in Lviv Once traditionally white, vyshyankas are now made in a wide range of colours This performance took place in the western city of Lviv Sewing lessons were on offer in Odesa Three refugee sisters, together with friends and their host, marked the occasion with a giant shirt in Cambridge in the UK A famous cat from Kharkiv who raised thousands for Ukrainian animal shelters through his Instagram account has been given a prestigious award for his efforts. Stepan, who has 1.3 million followers, was given the World Influencers and Bloggers Award during a ceremony at Cannes Film Festival in France on 18 May. Money raised during the event will be spent on helping those who suffered during the war in Ukraine, its organisers said. Stepan's owner, Anna, said the pair escaped from the north-eastern Ukrainian city in March and crossed the border into Poland before being evacuated to France, where their fundraising efforts continue.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information. This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers blow up a bridge connecting cities in the Luhansk region Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's National Guard released a video it said shows the destruction of a bridge connecting Sievierodonetsk to Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. The special operation between Ukraine's security forces aims to slow down the advance of Russian troops in the Luhansk region. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the images. We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many. The Deputy Commander of the Azov unit, Sviatoslav Palamar hasposted a video message on Telegram,,externalin which he says: âGlory to Ukraine! It is day 85 of the war. The leadership and I are on the premises of the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation happening, details of which I am not going to share. I thank the whole world and Ukraine for the support. I will be seeing you.â It is not clear what the operation he refers to is. We will bring you more information if it becomes available. Russia says more than 1,700 fighters from the plant have been taken to Russian-controlled areas since Monday. You canread about what has been happening to them here. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT.

Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post.

"There are more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% between January and March, its lowest for almost 50 years, as job openings rose to a new high of 1.3 million. However, wages, excluding bonuses, failed to keep pace with rising prices, a problem expected to intensify because of growing food and fuel costs. The figures show ""a mixed picture"" said the Office for National Statistics. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, said: ""Despite employment continuing to rise, today's figures underline the challenges facing workers who are seeing inflation eat away at their living standards."" The data showed that there was a rise in the number of people moving from economic inactivity - classed as those aged 16-64 who haven't been working or seeking a job - into employment. At the same time, people moving from job-to-job also reached a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", said the ONS. ""Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,"" he added. ""However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high."" Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise The situation is ""a nightmare"", said Buddy Love, who along with his wife Kate runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset. Mr Love said it has taken him six weeks and Â£2,000 worth of job adverts to find a new chef for his kitchen - and in the end it was word of mouth that delivered the right candidate rather than any advertisement. Buddy Love runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset ""I don't know where these people are,"" said Mr Love, adding that he had offered a good starting salary of Â£36,000 and perks such as free accommodation to entice the right person. Luckily, a Romanian couple, who had previously worked in the UK, will soon take up the role as a job share, freeing Mr Love from the kitchen so he can focus on his main job of ""developing the business and making sure it grows"". Pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.2% between January and March but failed to keep up with the rising cost of living - which hit 7% in March and is expected to go higher. It meant that pay, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, and excluding bonuses, dropped by 1.2% - the biggest fall since 2013. Some sectors such as construction and financial services benefitted from bonus payments as firms put up pay to recruit staff, the ONS said. This saw total pay, which includes bonuses, rise by 7% between January and March, keeping pace with rising prices. Mr Morgan said: ""Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms."" It is a tale of three jobs markets told in these figures. The unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in almost half a century is a testament to the full recovery from the losses in the pandemic and the protections put in place over the past two years. For many millions in employment however pay, when adjusted for surging inflation, fell by the biggest amount for over 9 years and that is set to get worse. And then for businesses seeking workers - those vacancies reached a new record of close to 1.3 million. This is a reflection of a reduction in the size of the workforce, from post-Brexit worker rules, older workers retiring during the pandemic and a rise in long term sickness. So considering the hit from the pandemic, these are a very good set of figures, looking backwards. But they don't yet, except in the real earnings figures, show the impact of the ongoing inflationary economic squeeze. Indeed, such is the extent of the hit to consumer spending power, the Bank of England and others see the economy heading into recessionary territory and unemployment starting to rise by hundreds of thousands. The Government hopes that as many of the remaining jobless can be squeezed into these vacancies. The fear is that this situation is overtaken by the dark inflationary clouds Pay has been failing to keep up with the cost of living for some months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and Ukraine war. Official data on Wednesday is expected to show another sharp rise in the cost of living for April, reflecting last month's hike in the energy price cap. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch is set to leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year and the jobs market slowing down. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it's reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared."" But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""These figures confirm families are facing a cost of living nightmare, with wages failing to keep up with soaring energy bills and food prices."" Looking ahead, Jake Finney, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said the jobless rate could begin to tick higher. ""We expect that unemployment could start to rise towards the end of this year, as headwinds from the war in Ukraine reduce demand for labour. ""The delayed impact is because the labour market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy"".

"This video can not be played I am ready to be myself - Daniels It shouldn't matter - and to many, it won't. After all, it's 2022, and the idea that a footballer's sexuality should be newsworthy will seem, to most people, bizarre. ""Good luck to him, and let him play"" - right? ButJake Daniels' decision to speak publicly about the fact he's gayis a watershed moment, both for him personally and for British football as a whole. Why? Because you have to go back more than 30 years, to the time of Justin Fashanu, to find the last time that an active male professional footballer in the UK felt comfortable enough to come out. The men's game has changed significantly since then. Josh Cavallo, Thomas Hitzlsperger and Thomas Beattie have all shared their stories as gay men in the sport; gay and bisexual men play regularly at a grassroots level; and it's hard to find a club in the English game that doesn't have its own LGBTQ+ supporters' club. Yet for all that progress, not a single man playing professionally in the English game has felt comfortable enough to come out since Fashanu - until now. With just a few simple words, Daniels has changed the game. For the first time in three decades, gay football fans can tune into a men's match in England and see someone like them on the pitch. Gay players can do the same, including those who aren't out yet but may, as a direct result of Daniels' decision, feel able to share their story. And gay men who felt excluded from the game because of their sexuality may hear Daniels' words and be tempted to be give the sport another chance. Don't be mistaken - there are still issues that football needs to address when it comes to making LGBTQ+ people feel welcome in it. Daniels' decision to come out won't address the issue of homophobic chanting on the terraces, or alter the sort of policies that see major tournaments awarded to countries that criminalise LGBTQ+ people, or impact on any of the other structural and institutional issues that can make gay people feel like the game isn't for them. But those, perhaps, are conversations for another day. Football is more open, more inclusive and more welcoming today than it was yesterday, all because Daniels has felt comfortable enough to be himself. And that, truly, is something to be celebrated. 5 Minutes On: Jake Daniels - will he change football? 'Football is ready' to accept gay players - Blackpool academy director Daniels 'brave & inspiring' - non-league boss who advised him Download, listen & subscribe to The LGBT Sport Podcast on BBC Sounds Lauren Moss, BBC News LGBT and identity correspondent There's no overstating what a huge moment this is for the game and the LGBT community, especially with such a young player making this announcement at the very start of his career. On this issue, football is a long way behind the rest of society and other sports, including the women's game, where there were 40 openly gay, lesbian and bisexual players at the 2019 World Cup. Rugby got there a couple of years ago, so did cricket and athletics. So why such a difference? Homophobia is still a big problem, with the type of language that can be used on the pitch and in the stands often brushed off as ""banter"". Charities and many clubs have been campaigning for a change in attitude for years, all the way down to a grassroots level. This is the first sign that football is finally catching up. For players and fans, increased visibility and representation will be a massive stride towards inclusivity and maybe even inspire others. After former Hull City academy player Thomas Beattie announced in 2020 that he was gay, hesupported Australia's Josh Cavallo,who in October 2021 became the only current top-flight male professional footballer to come out. American midfielder Collin Martin, who now plays for San Diego Loyal in the US second tier,came out in 2018.,external So now there are three openly gay male professional footballers. Is a stigma being broken down? Support for Daniels from his team-mates, his club and their fans could play a significant part in that process.

"Hana was worried for her own health when she sought abortion care - and was left feeling tricked When Hana found out she was pregnant, she knew she wanted to have an abortion - but her search for a clinic on Google led her to an anti-abortion centre, set on talking her out of her decision. In many US states, BBC News has seen misleading websites advertising these clinics appearing high up in Google search results - and Facebook adverts with inaccurate medical advice - while genuine abortion providers are having their ads rejected and accounts restricted. Advice centres, such as the one visited by Hana - a 19-year-old living in the north-eastern US state of Massachusetts - are often run by Christian organisations. They may offer some medical services such as pregnancy tests and ultrasounds - but some of their online promotion falsely suggests they also provide pregnancy-termination services. It wasn't until Hana was walking down the centre's corridor, lined with posters comparing the procedure to murder, that it began to dawn on her this was not the abortion clinic she believed it to be. Hana describes herself as a ""nerdy researcher"", studying a health-related course at college - but nothing about the clinic's website tipped her off to the service it actually provides. The home page says: ""Take control - start with a free abortion consultation."" And in a tab labelled: ""Get care,"" it lists the types of abortion (medical and surgical) that can be performed during different trimesters of pregnancy, under the heading: ""You just found out you're pregnant and want to know your options."" Once there, Hana says, she was told, inaccurately, abortions were linked to infertility and breast cancer - and having had a Covid-19 vaccine, she might lose the pregnancy anyway, making abortion unnecessary,despite the evidence suggesting vaccinated people are no more likely to miscarryand, in fact, better protected against the risks of pre-term and still birth associated with Covid. She was also pressured to view the ultrasound scan against her wishes. ""What kind of mother doesn't want to see a picture of their child?"" asked the person attending to her. Hana was left feeling deceived and betrayed. The Human Coalition, an anti-abortion group providing marketing for the centre and more than 40 others, told BBC News: ""We find in our work, most abortion-determined women do not desire an abortion, they desire help. ""We're here to empower women by filling that gap - connecting women to the care and support they want, to choose life."" Google displays adverts above search results for certain terms. Advertisers bid to have their ads appear first, Google says, although the order should also be determined by ""relevance"" and ""overall quality"". But, Whitney Chinogwenya, of MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly Marie Stopes international) says, this creates a ""battle of budgets"", with regulated abortion clinics competing with anti-abortion clinics or unregulated pill providers for ad space on specific search terms. Several large global abortion providers have also told BBC News they regularly have their online material referring to abortion censored without explanation, including having YouTube channels suspended, social-media accounts restricted and Facebook and Google ads rejected. In 2019, having been criticised for hosting misleading adverts, Google tried to crack down on abortion-advice clinics, which are most common in the US but can also be found across Europe (including the UK), Africa and Latin America. In the US, UK and Ireland, anyone running an ad mentioning abortion must first apply for a certificate. Ads from advice clinics not offering abortions can still run but will be given a disclaimer the advertiser ""does not provide abortions"". Hana says she did not see this disclaimer. It appears in very small font underneath the search headline and description. Sarah Eagan, a researcher for campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate, questions whether Google should be taking money at all for anti-abortion ads that target keywords used by people actively seeking terminations. The CCDH has also found anti-abortion ads promoting unproven medicines remaining on Facebook. And at the other end of the spectrum, the researchers found Google's autocomplete function suggesting ineffective do-it-yourself abortion methods. Kelly, like Hana, says she was given inaccurate medical information as she struggled to find an affordable and safe way to terminate her pregnancy in her home state of Texas. What is Roe v Wade ruling on abortion? What happens if Roe v Wade is overturned Kelly said she clicked on the clinic's website in desperation, knowing she couldn't afford a doctor. Between jobs and without insurance, she could not afford ""an actual doctor's visit"" so searched for affordable clinics. Finding her way to an anti-abortion centre, Kelly says she was frightened with warnings she could ""bleed out"" and risk her life but not given the context medical abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Kelly feels promoting free pregnancy tests targets low-income women. The centre appears to be using organic search, not adverts, making it more complicated to regulate. It says its website clearly states: ""We do not refer or perform abortions,"" adding it provides ""free services annually to over 5,000 minority poor under-served single mothers"". Two drugs are used for a medical abortion - misoprostol and mifepristone Eventually, Kelly was prescribed termination drugs - just hours before she passed the 12-week limit for a safe medical abortion. But Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C, the organisation that helped Kelly access these abortion pills, says its online material is routinely ""disallowed for violating community standards"" on Facebook, Instagram and Google. Google says it has clear policies governing abortion-related ads, some determined by local laws and regulations. Some of the posts and channels flagged by BBC News had been removed in error and since reinstated, it said. Facebook said it had restored a small number of incorrectly rejected ads for abortion providers.

"""Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson says Turkey's president has restated his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining Nato - just hours after they said they would seek membership. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the two Nordic nations should not bother sending delegations to convince Turkey, a key Nato member, of their bids. He is angered by what he sees as their willingness to host Kurdish militants. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. On Monday, Sweden said Europe was living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move by Finland and Sweden to join the 30-member military alliance did not threaten Moscow directly - but stressed that any expansion of military infrastructure would trigger a response from the Kremlin. How do you join Nato? Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? Russia's invasion not going to plan, Nato says At a news conference on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkey opposed the Finnish and the Swedish bids to join Nato, describing Sweden as a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. ""Neither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisation. How can we trust them?"" the Turkish president said. Turkey accuses the two Nordic nations of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. All member states must agree that a new country can join Nato, therefore Sweden and Finland require Turkey's support in their bid to join the military alliance. Mr Erdogan said Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother going to Ankara, Turkey's capital, to convince it to approve their Nato bid. His government has also pledged to block applications from countries that have imposed sanctions on it. In 2019, both Nordic nations slapped an arms embargo on Ankara afterits incursion into Syria. Speaking in parliament in Helsinki on Monday, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was surprised by Turkey's stance, but added that his government was not interested in ""bargaining"" with Mr Erdogan. Finland formally announced its bid to join Nato last week. It was joined by neighbour Sweden on Saturday in a move that will end the Scandinavian country's centuries-long military non-alignment. ""Nato will strengthen Sweden, Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a briefing on Monday. She said Europe was now living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,"" Ms Andersson told lawmakers during a debate in Stockholm, also on Monday. She said a formal application could be handed in within several days and would be synchronised with Finland. Nato has signalled its willingness to admit the two new members. On Tuesday, Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde signed the formal application to join Nato However, Ms Andersson stressed that Sweden did not want permanent Nato bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. Norway, Denmark and Iceland - all Nato members - immediately said they were ready to support Sweden and Finland by all means necessary if they came under attack. The UK, also a Nato member, has already given security guarantees to Sweden and Finlandto cover the transition period. Monday's announcement by Sweden came asNato began one of its biggest exercises in the Baltic region, involving some 15,000 troops.Named ""Hedgehog"", the drills in Estonia involve 10 countries, including Finland and Sweden. For Finland and Sweden to join Nato, all 30 existing members must say yes. But for now, one is saying no. President Erdogan says he won't agree to admit countries which apply sanctions on Turkey. Sweden suspended arms sales to Turkey three years ago, following Ankara's military intervention in Syria. And according to the official Turkish news agency, both Finland and Sweden have rejected dozens of requests to extradite Kurdish militants who Turkey describes as terrorists. Both countries are sending delegations to Ankara to try and solve the problem, but President Erdogan says they shouldn't bother. He seems determined to extract a price for his precious vote. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he was confident that Finland and Sweden would both join, despite Turkish objections. The issue is likely to dominate discussions between Mr Blinken and his Turkish opposite number in Washington on Wednesday. Having encouraged the two Nordic countries to apply, Washington won't want to let them down at the 11th hour. Do you live in Finland or Sweden?  What are your thoughts about possible Nato expansion?

"The government has introduced legislation that aims to draw a line under the Northern Ireland Troubles by dealing with so-called legacy issues. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill runs to almost 100 pages. It is an attempt to deal with more than 1,000 unsolved killings. A central element involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations run by a new information recovery body. Bereaved families can request investigations, as can the government and others. The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) will be headed by a judicial figure appointed by the government. It would be operational for five years. A panel within the ICRIR will be responsible for deciding if a perpetrator qualifies for immunity. Troubles legacy plan looks toward South Africa What led to Northern Ireland's conflict? The draft legislation states it must be granted if an individual gives an account judged to be ""true to the best of (their) knowledge and belief"". Once granted, it cannot be revoked. In last week's Queen's Speech, the government announced it was changing its original proposal from last July, which would have ended all Troubles-era prosecutions - effectively an across the board amnesty. After a legacy bill failed to materialise in the last parliamentary term, the government has moved at pace. It is only a week since the Queen's Speech and, by the look of it, there is to be no more talking. Axing the idea of a blanket amnesty has done little to gain support from either victims' groups or political parties. The overall package, they argue, remains exclusively UK designed with no buy-in in Northern Ireland. One opponent told me things have now entered ""wreck the bill territory"". It remains to be seen what amendments may emerge in Parliament, but the government has the numbers. The legislation will almost certainly face legal challenge around whether investigations meet standards of effectiveness. The government has said the plan ""complies fully"" with international human rights obligations, but some victims' families are already geared up to challenge it. The legislation will prevent future inquests and civil actions related to the Troubles. Civil claims which already existed on or before the day of the bill's introduction will be allowed to continue, as will inquests which have reached substantive hearing stage a year after the bill, or by the time the ICRIR becomes operational. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said victims and military veterans were being let down by the current system Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill would help society look forward. ""This is a very difficult area and it can be very painful for people,"" Mr Lewis told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""One of the challenges is the current system isn't working for people. That's very clear."" He said the legislation would ""give people a reason to come forward and a motivation to come forward that at the moment simply doesn't exist"". Asked if people under investigation or facing charges could then give information in exchange for immunity, Mr Lewis said: ""The independent body would take the view on if people have engaged in the right way and shared their information."" Kenny Donaldson said the justice offered by the bill was only ""tokenistic"" The Northern Ireland secretary also announced the government's intention to commission an official history relating to the Troubles, conducted by independent historians. Underpinned by ""unprecedented access to the UK documentary record"", he said this would provide an in-depth examination of the ""government's policy towards Northern Ireland during the conflict"". The government has previously indicated that the legacy legislation would not be rushed through Parliament under accelerated passage. It could take many months to become law. Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United, said members of his 12,500-strong group were ""unhappy that justice, in many ways, is being taken off the table"". ""It's being left on in a tokenistic and symbolic fashion, but not with any real teeth,"" he said. Campaigner Mark Kelly, whose 12-year-old sister Carol Ann was killed by a plastic bullet fired by a soldier in Belfast in 1981, said the government's proposals still amounted to an amnesty. ""They can paint it and colour it whatever way they like, but what they're trying to do is tell British soldiers that: 'No matter what you did in the north of Ireland, not only will there be no investigations into it,"" he said. Michelle O'Neill accused the government of trying to ""pull down the shutters on family campaigns for truth and justice"" Alan McBride, from victims' group the Wave Trauma Centre, said while the new proposals were better than the previous blanket amnesty, he was ""not so sure it is a huge improvement"". ""You could also probably argue that was a negotiation tactic from the British government in that they put out something so ridiculous and abhorrent that whatever they were seen to do would always be an improvement to that,"" he added. Victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose 22-year-old son Raymond Jr, was murdered by the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), in 1997, described the proposals as ""disgraceful and disgusting"". However, Veterans Commissioner Danny Kinahan has given the bill a cautious welcome after months consulting with several veterans' support groups. ""What they really want is the chance to be able to still pursue justice; still follow the rule of law,"" he said. ""And the changes we've got - which is why I say cautiously welcome - seem to be doing that, in that we're going to have a really, robust panel system which will dig down in for families so they can find out who blew them up, who shot them, who caused the harm.""

"The UK government pledges a law to change parts of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU on Northern Ireland Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the bill will ease trade and insists it will not break international law But the government is facing criticism, with many MPs questioning the legality of the plan In Brussels, EU negotiators say they have significant concerns and warn they could retaliate But Boris Johnson defends his government, saying: ""We don't want to nix it, we want to fix it"" Special trade arrangements - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - were needed after the UK left the EU But they have resulted in delays and price rises as goods arriving in Northern Ireland require paperwork Political institutions in Northern Ireland are at a standstill because of the issue but the majority of elected NI assembly members accept the protocol Edited by Emma Owen That's it from the live team on the protocol for today - as ever, any major developments will be found on the news home page -here. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Mary O'Connor, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott and Grainne Connolly. The editor was Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. This video can not be played Liz Truss Commons' statement on Northern Ireland Protocol We're winding up now after a long day of coverage on the complex issue of trade between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the EU. Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"""Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson says Turkey's president has restated his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining Nato - just hours after they said they would seek membership. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the two Nordic nations should not bother sending delegations to convince Turkey, a key Nato member, of their bids. He is angered by what he sees as their willingness to host Kurdish militants. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. On Monday, Sweden said Europe was living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move by Finland and Sweden to join the 30-member military alliance did not threaten Moscow directly - but stressed that any expansion of military infrastructure would trigger a response from the Kremlin. How do you join Nato? Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? Russia's invasion not going to plan, Nato says At a news conference on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkey opposed the Finnish and the Swedish bids to join Nato, describing Sweden as a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. ""Neither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisation. How can we trust them?"" the Turkish president said. Turkey accuses the two Nordic nations of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. All member states must agree that a new country can join Nato, therefore Sweden and Finland require Turkey's support in their bid to join the military alliance. Mr Erdogan said Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother going to Ankara, Turkey's capital, to convince it to approve their Nato bid. His government has also pledged to block applications from countries that have imposed sanctions on it. In 2019, both Nordic nations slapped an arms embargo on Ankara afterits incursion into Syria. Speaking in parliament in Helsinki on Monday, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was surprised by Turkey's stance, but added that his government was not interested in ""bargaining"" with Mr Erdogan. Finland formally announced its bid to join Nato last week. It was joined by neighbour Sweden on Saturday in a move that will end the Scandinavian country's centuries-long military non-alignment. ""Nato will strengthen Sweden, Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a briefing on Monday. She said Europe was now living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,"" Ms Andersson told lawmakers during a debate in Stockholm, also on Monday. She said a formal application could be handed in within several days and would be synchronised with Finland. Nato has signalled its willingness to admit the two new members. On Tuesday, Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde signed the formal application to join Nato However, Ms Andersson stressed that Sweden did not want permanent Nato bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. Norway, Denmark and Iceland - all Nato members - immediately said they were ready to support Sweden and Finland by all means necessary if they came under attack. The UK, also a Nato member, has already given security guarantees to Sweden and Finlandto cover the transition period. Monday's announcement by Sweden came asNato began one of its biggest exercises in the Baltic region, involving some 15,000 troops.Named ""Hedgehog"", the drills in Estonia involve 10 countries, including Finland and Sweden. For Finland and Sweden to join Nato, all 30 existing members must say yes. But for now, one is saying no. President Erdogan says he won't agree to admit countries which apply sanctions on Turkey. Sweden suspended arms sales to Turkey three years ago, following Ankara's military intervention in Syria. And according to the official Turkish news agency, both Finland and Sweden have rejected dozens of requests to extradite Kurdish militants who Turkey describes as terrorists. Both countries are sending delegations to Ankara to try and solve the problem, but President Erdogan says they shouldn't bother. He seems determined to extract a price for his precious vote. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he was confident that Finland and Sweden would both join, despite Turkish objections. The issue is likely to dominate discussions between Mr Blinken and his Turkish opposite number in Washington on Wednesday. Having encouraged the two Nordic countries to apply, Washington won't want to let them down at the 11th hour. Do you live in Finland or Sweden?  What are your thoughts about possible Nato expansion?

to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland says the statement from the UK foreign secretary is a ""step towards fixing the protocol in a pragmatic way"". Doug Beattie says his party has been clear since 2019 that there should be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, if those goods are remaining in Northern Ireland. âWhat is clear to me is that the EU needs to change its mandate,"" Beattie says. ""I believe that MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ understands and accepts the landing zone, but I sense the hurdles are other member states. ""I appealed to him directly in Brussels in March to move on trade before the election as what would come afterwards would be toxic."" Helen CattPolitical correspondent The government says it believes it is but it isn't yet spelling out how or why. There is a long-standing policy of not discussing internal government legal advice - but the legality is a major point of concern. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has promised to set out the legal position ""in due course"". Expect lots more pressure from MPs to make sure that happens.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"There are more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% between January and March, its lowest for almost 50 years, as job openings rose to a new high of 1.3 million. However, wages, excluding bonuses, failed to keep pace with rising prices, a problem expected to intensify because of growing food and fuel costs. The figures show ""a mixed picture"" said the Office for National Statistics. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, said: ""Despite employment continuing to rise, today's figures underline the challenges facing workers who are seeing inflation eat away at their living standards."" The data showed that there was a rise in the number of people moving from economic inactivity - classed as those aged 16-64 who haven't been working or seeking a job - into employment. At the same time, people moving from job-to-job also reached a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", said the ONS. ""Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,"" he added. ""However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high."" Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise The situation is ""a nightmare"", said Buddy Love, who along with his wife Kate runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset. Mr Love said it has taken him six weeks and Â£2,000 worth of job adverts to find a new chef for his kitchen - and in the end it was word of mouth that delivered the right candidate rather than any advertisement. Buddy Love runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset ""I don't know where these people are,"" said Mr Love, adding that he had offered a good starting salary of Â£36,000 and perks such as free accommodation to entice the right person. Luckily, a Romanian couple, who had previously worked in the UK, will soon take up the role as a job share, freeing Mr Love from the kitchen so he can focus on his main job of ""developing the business and making sure it grows"". Pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.2% between January and March but failed to keep up with the rising cost of living - which hit 7% in March and is expected to go higher. It meant that pay, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, and excluding bonuses, dropped by 1.2% - the biggest fall since 2013. Some sectors such as construction and financial services benefitted from bonus payments as firms put up pay to recruit staff, the ONS said. This saw total pay, which includes bonuses, rise by 7% between January and March, keeping pace with rising prices. Mr Morgan said: ""Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms."" It is a tale of three jobs markets told in these figures. The unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in almost half a century is a testament to the full recovery from the losses in the pandemic and the protections put in place over the past two years. For many millions in employment however pay, when adjusted for surging inflation, fell by the biggest amount for over 9 years and that is set to get worse. And then for businesses seeking workers - those vacancies reached a new record of close to 1.3 million. This is a reflection of a reduction in the size of the workforce, from post-Brexit worker rules, older workers retiring during the pandemic and a rise in long term sickness. So considering the hit from the pandemic, these are a very good set of figures, looking backwards. But they don't yet, except in the real earnings figures, show the impact of the ongoing inflationary economic squeeze. Indeed, such is the extent of the hit to consumer spending power, the Bank of England and others see the economy heading into recessionary territory and unemployment starting to rise by hundreds of thousands. The Government hopes that as many of the remaining jobless can be squeezed into these vacancies. The fear is that this situation is overtaken by the dark inflationary clouds Pay has been failing to keep up with the cost of living for some months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and Ukraine war. Official data on Wednesday is expected to show another sharp rise in the cost of living for April, reflecting last month's hike in the energy price cap. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch is set to leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year and the jobs market slowing down. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it's reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared."" But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""These figures confirm families are facing a cost of living nightmare, with wages failing to keep up with soaring energy bills and food prices."" Looking ahead, Jake Finney, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said the jobless rate could begin to tick higher. ""We expect that unemployment could start to rise towards the end of this year, as headwinds from the war in Ukraine reduce demand for labour. ""The delayed impact is because the labour market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy"".

"The UK government pledges a law to change parts of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU on Northern Ireland Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the bill will ease trade and insists it will not break international law But the government is facing criticism, with many MPs questioning the legality of the plan In Brussels, EU negotiators say they have significant concerns and warn they could retaliate But Boris Johnson defends his government, saying: ""We don't want to nix it, we want to fix it"" Special trade arrangements - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - were needed after the UK left the EU But they have resulted in delays and price rises as goods arriving in Northern Ireland require paperwork Political institutions in Northern Ireland are at a standstill because of the issue but the majority of elected NI assembly members accept the protocol Edited by Emma Owen That's it from the live team on the protocol for today - as ever, any major developments will be found on the news home page -here. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Mary O'Connor, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott and Grainne Connolly. The editor was Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. This video can not be played Liz Truss Commons' statement on Northern Ireland Protocol We're winding up now after a long day of coverage on the complex issue of trade between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the EU. Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to
bring certainty and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland."" Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent It's households and businesses who may pay the price for
plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy
arbitration process. But that
would ultimately allow the EU to impose tariffs on British goods. It may
target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to
change the Northern Ireland Protocol if it canât reach an agreement with the
European Union. Asked how the UK could change a treaty that it had signed up
to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it
and weâre going to work with European partners to do it.â He dismissed idea of a trade war with the EU saying he didn't think it was likely.

plans to override the protocol â if it triggers a trade war. The Trade and Co-operation
Agreement (or part of it) could be scrapped by the EU unilaterally â but that
requires notice of up to a year, and a lengthy

target politically sensitive products for tariffs â salmon from Scotland for
example, or items originating in some so-called âRed Wallâ seats . However, tariffs imposed on
British goods equals higher bills for European customers. The UK might theoretically react
to any retaliation by imposing tariffs of its own. Those would make it even
harder for European producers to compete in the UK - and the higher prices for
their goods would squeeze British household budgets further . If they contemplate such action,
policymakers know it may have a high economic and political price tag. Boris Johnson with London Mayor Sadiq Khan on one of London's new Elizabeth line trains Speaking on a visit to Paddington Station in West London, the prime minister defends the governmentâs plans to

to, Johnson says: âThe higher duty for the UK government in international law is
to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and thatâs the thing we have
to look to.â He said the changes amount to âgetting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade - and I
think there are good common sensical solutions"". âLetâs fix it â we donât want to nix it, we want to fix it

"Actress, screenwriter and director Kay Mellor has died aged 71, it has been announced. A spokesman for her TV production company, Rollem Productions, confirmed ""with profound sadness"" that she died on Sunday. She was known for creating and writing the ITV series Fat Friends - which helped launch James Corden's career. Mellor also wrote comedy and drama series such as The Syndicate, Girlfriends and Band of Gold. A Rollem Productions spokesman said: ""It is with profound sadness that we announce the untimely and sudden passing of our beloved friend, mentor and colleague Kay Mellor on Sunday 15 May 2022. ""We have lost a phenomenal talent and a true luminary. We ask that you please respect the privacy of the family and friends at this time."" Kay Mellor: A Leeds woman through and through Mellor began her career writing plays, worked on Coronation Street and created the award-winning children's drama Children's Ward. She also wrote BBC One's women's football series Playing The Field and in 2010 received an OBE. Mellor was made an OBE in 2016 Fat Friends aired from 2000-2005 and gave a young Corden his first major acting role. It also starred Ruth Jones, Sheridan Smith and Alison Steadman. The BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, paid tribute to Kay Mellor following her death, saying she was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the news. ""Kay was an outstanding writer and the creative force behind many of the nation's best-loved television dramas,"" Moore said. ""She wrote with such heart, humanity, humour and passion with strong female characters often taking centre stage."" Writing on Instagram, Corden said:,external""[Mellor] was the most generous, kind and loving person. An exceptionally gifted writer. She changed my life when she cast me in Fat Friends on ITV. She saw something in me that no one had before that point. ""She gave so many people their first chances. I have the fondest memories of being on set with her. She will be missed by so many.

Mellor's daughter Gaynor (left) is an actress and has starred in Coronation Street and several of her mum's dramas Gavin and Stacey writer Ruth Jones told the PA news agency: ""She was a great mentor to me when I first started writing - and always hugely encouraging of new writers - a real testament to the idea of paying it forward. ""Her series Fat Friends was a massive turning point in my career and I will be eternally grateful to her for what she did for me. ""British television has lost one of its greats.

I had the pleasure of working with Kay briefly last year and it was an absolute honour. A huge talent, a huge personality a wonderful lady. She will be missed. Our thoughts are with her family and friends."" Former Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley described Mellor as""the best boss to work for"",,externalwhile Coronation Street's Antony Cotton noted that she""was a real trailblazer for women"".,external ITV's Band of Gold, which ran from 1995 to 1997 was considered a ground-breaking drama, bringing to life the lives of a group of sex workers in Bradford as they tried to take on police and gangsters in a bid to run their own street business. It gave Hollywood actress Samantha Morton one of her first major roles, later going on to star in films such as Minority Report opposite Tom Cruise. She also played Alpha in The Walking Dead. BBC One drama The Syndicate is about five members of a lottery syndicate who get a big win. Each of the four series featured a different group of people and setting, including a supermarket and a hospital. Mellor said she was inspired to write the drama because of ""the times we are living in, where people are desperate and holding on to the dream of winning the lottery as the only solution available"". The first series aired in 2012 and starred Timothy Spall and Gavin and Stacey actress Joanna Page. Series four came out last year. Asked about the setting of that first series being Leeds, Mellor said: ""I think it's vital that the north of England is represented in mainstream drama, not just soap opera. For me personally northern dramas have a different feeling because it feels like these are my people, this is the world I know, this is the world I grew up in. ""That's not to say that I don't watch and enjoy British dramas that are set in the south of England. I just think that geographically there needs to be equality and England exists outside of London."" Mellor - pictured here in the late 1990s - has been a mentor for many writers in the industry Mellor once told BBC Leeds: ""I am Leeds born and bred, and the city, both architecturally and socially, feeds my creativity. ""That's why I don't live in London. When people ask me why I don't live down there I always say, 'Why should I?' I would feel like a fish out of water."" Mellor's writing career began at Granada TV writing for long-running soap Coronation Street. She also wrote for Channel 4 soap Brookside. She went on to write Children's Ward with former Coronation Street writing colleague Paul Abbott before penning the dramas she made her name with series such as Band of Gold. Mellor was also an actress, starring in her own adaptation of Jane Eyre in 1997 and Gifted (2003). She also penned A Passionate Woman, based on the story of her own mother's doomed affair with a Polish fairground worker. The play was turned into a two-part BBC drama starring Billie Piper and Sue Johnston. In 2017, Mellor turned Fat Friends into a stage musical which toured the UK the following year. She also adapted Band of Gold, which toured the UK in 2019 but ended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mellor appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2017 and chose The Beautiful South's Perfect 10, the Fat Friends theme tune, as one of her sound tracks, saying ""every time I heard that I used to get excited and get butterflies"". She explained: ""It was such a lovely time of my life, it was a drama that was really important to me because I thought I had something to say about weight and body image.""

"The UK government pledges a law to change parts of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU on Northern Ireland Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the bill will ease trade and insists it will not break international law But the government is facing criticism, with many MPs questioning the legality of the plan In Brussels, EU negotiators say they have significant concerns and warn they could retaliate But Boris Johnson defends his government, saying: ""We don't want to nix it, we want to fix it"" Special trade arrangements - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - were needed after the UK left the EU But they have resulted in delays and price rises as goods arriving in Northern Ireland require paperwork Political institutions in Northern Ireland are at a standstill because of the issue but the majority of elected NI assembly members accept the protocol Edited by Emma Owen That's it from the live team on the protocol for today - as ever, any major developments will be found on the news home page -here. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Mary O'Connor, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Jennifer Scott and Grainne Connolly. The editor was Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien and Rob Corp. This video can not be played Liz Truss Commons' statement on Northern Ireland Protocol We're winding up now after a long day of coverage on the complex issue of trade between Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the EU. Here's a summary: What did the UK foreign secretary say?  What did the EU say?  What has the reaction been in Northern Ireland?  What else was said?  Are the UK's plans legal?  You can read more detail on all of this in our main story.  Reality Check As you'll no doubt know by now, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced plans to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland protocol - the Brexit deal the prime minister negotiated and signed. We've been checking over what Ms Truss - and other members of the government - have been saying about the protocol, and you can read about what's been said on taxation, medicines, polling, and the flow of trade,here. Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies ask... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Kenneth Langton and Steve Davies have the same query - can goods coming to NI from the mainland simply be shipped directly to Northern Irish ports, and the same for goods destined for the Republic of Ireland? The issue for the EU is that the protocol means Northern Ireland is effectively still part of its single market for goods. That means once products have arrived in Northern Ireland they are not subject to any further checks or controls if they move on into the Republic of Ireland or any other EU countries. So even if the intention is that those products stay in Northern Ireland, the EU still wants some assurance that they meet its standards in case they do move across the open border. One possible change to the protocol is a light-touch system for Great Britain goods which are clearly going to be consumed in Northern Ireland. While the EU, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have all expressed support for something like this, technical talks between the EU and UK have so far not been able to agree on how it should operate in practice. The UK has suggested the EU is too wedded to a âzero-riskâ approach which would still means lots of additional paperwork on GB-NI trade. John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Nigel Newton asks why food exports to Northern Ireland can't just be labelled to show they arenât for use in the EU, only NI? There is already some labelling, but the EU would like more and the UK acknowledges that it this would have to be a part of any light touch arrangements which remove checks. Currently there is ""pallet-level"" labelling: effectively a sticker which says: ""These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Irelandâ. But that doesnât appear on individual packages bought by consumers. The EU says that labels should already be applied to individual meat products which are covered by a so-called grace period, meaning normal EU restrictions on those goods are not being applied. The UK acknowledges that, if border checks are removed, there would need to be ""appropriate labelling requirements so that goods could only be sold in the UK"". B Carey asks... John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor We've been taking some questions from readers, and the first comes from B Carey, who asks if it's true that the cost of movinggoods to NI has gone up by 27% due to the protocol. The protocol undoubtedly makes it more difficult and expensive to move goods to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, particularly food products. There are paperwork and checks which simply werenât required before. But there is no definitive figure on how much transport costs have increased on average. The 27% figure comes from the Road Haulage Association (RHA). The RHA told the BBC this was not based on a formal survey but comes from information provided by NI hauliers, predominately larger operators. The RHA said there were variations in the additional costs, depending on what is being carried, with the highest costs for those regularly carrying food products. When Liz Truss laid out the government's proposals for simplifying trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK earlier, she suggested goods could be separated into two channels - one red and one green. The idea is that a so-called
green channel would be for goods arriving from Great Britain that are not going to leave Northern Ireland.
These would not need to be checked against EU laws, because they are staying in
the UK. A red channel would be for items
needing full checks because they are heading across the border into Ireland,
and the EU. The UK says this system would
remove trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU has previouslysuggested,externalan âexpress laneâ
for goods staying in Northern Ireland. But the UK said the plans would
make things worse. Read more on thathere. How many times have you heard the words ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" today? We've had a really good go at summarising it for you, but there's a chance you might (possibly) want to take a look
for yourself - if only to get an idea of just how detailed it is. If so,here it
is,external- the actual wording thrashed out between the UK and the EU as
part of the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. It sets out how the two sides
aimed to avoid Irish border checks while respecting the EUâs single market and
Northern Irelandâs position in the UK. As youâd
expect from a legal document like this, the language is pretty formal - and if you've already closed that page down, you can
read a digested guidehere.  We've spoken to a number of businesses in Northern Ireland to get an idea of how the protocol works for them. You can read the full articlehere, but we've pulled out two stories, to illustrate how it can affect trade. Andrew Lynas runs Lynas food service in County Londonderry which delivers to more than 5,000 catering customers in Northern Ireland. He says they have had to employ two people specifically to deal with protocol-related paperwork and find alternative suppliers. ""We've probably had to say goodbye to about 20 different suppliers, "" he says. ""We've been able to find some alternatives on the island, and some in Europe but for some we haven't been able to find alternatives."" Meanwhile Eamon McKey, chief operating officer with Deli Lites, a food to go service based in County Down, says 70% of its business is delivered to the Republic of Ireland. The prospect of a hard border on the island of Ireland was the company's ""greatest concern"". ""We welcomed the protocol as resolving the land border issue for us,"" he says. Mr McKey believes more people are now shopping locally. Glyn Roberts, the Chief Executive of Retail NI, says ""an agreed co-designed solution"" involving both the UK government and the EU is needed to solve the issues raised by the protocol. Retail NI is the representative body for the independent retail and wholesale sector in Northern Ireland. âThe local business community needs certainty and stability and not ongoing disputes on the protocol,"" he says. ""The election of NI Assembly Speaker and establishment of the Executive needs to happen immediately - It is unacceptable that we have no effective government during this cost of living and doing business crisis."" As we've been reporting, the Democratic Unionist Party has been refusing to join Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration until its objections to the protocol are dealt with. So how has the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland reacted to today's plans?  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and his colleagues Claire Hanna and Mathew O'Toole met the PM on Monday Adam FlemingChief political correspondent The foreign secretary hasn't published legislation to override the Northern Ireland
Protocol today. She has just set out the government's intention to bring it
forward if negotiations with the EU don't get anywhere. If/when the draft
law finally appears it will have to go through all the same stages as a normal
piece of legislation, which could take months. Time will have to be found in
the parliamentary calendar. And it will face stiff opposition in the House of
Lords. It could be amended as it goes through the House of Commons. So there's plenty
of space for more talks with the EU. And the DUP could continue to oppose the
protocol and refuse to join the power-sharing government for at least another
six months, because that's how long the political parties have until fresh
elections would be required. And under the
Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to decide whether to continue or
axe the Protocol in 2024 so the debate will carry on then, too. None of this will
happen quickly. Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EUâs reaction to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trussâs announcement is far from unexpected. If the UK takes unilateral
action, it will respond, it says, with ""all the measures at its disposal"". The
first course of action would not be the much talked-about trade war with the
UK. That would hit EU economies hard too. Instead, Brussels will wait and see
what the protocol-changing legislation promised by Truss actually looks
like - for now thatâs not yet clear - and if the government really puts that
legislation into practice. If so, legal action will likely be the EUâs first
move. Thatâs a long, drawn-out process. To up the pressure on the UK, EU
diplomats have also discussed the possibility of targeted tariffs on industries
most affecting Conservative party MPs and their constituencies. If forced to
take tough action, Brussels says it wonât hesitate. The EU insists the practical problems arising from the protocol (for example, the number of checks on goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern
Ireland) can be changed if the EU and UK sit down together. The UK government
hasn't yet explored full EU flexibilities, it says. Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered a statement to the Commons on the government's plans to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. Here's a brief recap of what we learned:  Ireland's foreign minister has warned the UK that making unilateral changes to the Northern Ireland protocol it agreed with the EU would be ""damaging to trust"". In a statement following UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' speech, Simon Coveney says he ""deeply regrets"" the decision to introduce the law, saying it will ""serve only to make it more challenging to find solutions
to the genuine concerns that people in Northern Ireland have about how the protocol is being implemented"". He says it also of ""great concern"" that the move comes just after the election in Northern Ireland where people ""have chosen their elected representatives and want to get the executive
back up and running"". Coveney adds: ""[The EU] have been consistent in their readiness to work with the UK to reach
agreement on pragmatic and flexible solutions. ""Jointly agreed solutions are the only sustainable way forward to

"This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government wants a negotiated settlement with the EU Liz Truss has said a new law would be introduced to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary insisted the bill would be legal under international law. Boris Johnson's government agreed the trade deal - which governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - with the European Union in 2019 after the Brexit vote. But a row over its impact on trade has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to join the power-sharing administration until reforms are made to the deal, which it says treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. In Parliament, Ms Truss said the proposed law would not scrap the deal but make limited changes, such as freeing the movement of UK-made goods from ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and regulatory barriers. But in response to Ms Truss's statement, the EU said it would ""need to respond with all measures at its disposal"" if the UK went ahead with the legislation. Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the unilateral action from the UK was ""damaging to trust"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland And Labour said the government should abide by the deal it signed, and work with the EU ""to find practical solutions to these problems"" rather than altering the deal unilaterally. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed the UK government's proposed legislation and said his party would take ""cautious"" steps to re-engage with power sharing in Northern Ireland as it progresses. This video can not be played Stephen Doughty asks if the government did not understand its Brexit agreement or if it ""intended to break it all along"". Ms Truss told MPs in response to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". She said the UK's preference remained a negotiated solution with the EU in consultation with its negotiator Maros Sefcovic, who has been invited to London for more talks. If a resolution cannot be reached, the UK would take steps to ""cement provisions"" that are working in the protocol, while ""fixing those elements that aren't"". ""The government is clear that proceeding with our legislation is consistent with our obligations under international law,"" she said. She said the bill would: Propose ""green"" and ""red"" lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ensure goods moving and staying in the UK are""freed of unnecessary bureaucracy""if they are not destined for the EU Remove regulatory barriersto goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland Allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards ina new dual regulatory regime Give the UK governmentpower to decide on tax and spend policiesacross the whole of the UK Addressissues related to governance, ""bringing the protocol in line with international norms"" Elections to Northern Ireland's Assembly on 5 May resulted in a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in. The party said the UK government was letting the DUP ""hold society to ransom"" after Mr Johnson met all political parties in Northern Ireland on Monday. Legislative solution on NI protocol needed - PM How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic said the European Commission ""stands ready to continue discussions with the UK government to identify joint solutions within the framework of the protocol"". ""Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the Protocol as announced today by the UK government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal,"" Mr Sefcovic added. ""Our overarching objective is to find joint solutions within the framework of the Protocol."" The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning What the foreign secretary is proposing would be a big change. It would mean Northern Ireland operating under a dual system for trade in goods rather than following EU rules. That's certainly more than a few tweaks. The government argues that an ""ambitious"" plan is now needed to safeguard peace and democracy. But it's not as if it inherited this problem; it negotiated the deal. It's pretty clear that many MPs are deeply unhappy with the idea of the UK now making one-sided changes and going back on an international agreement. The government insists it's acting within the law; it has promised to set out its legal position, although it's very unlikely we'll ever see the detailed legal advice behind it. Despite all of this, nothing will actually change immediately. Legislation would take time to pass through Parliament and hasn't even been published yet. Significantly, neither the EU nor the UK has walked away from negotiations and both say that's really how they want to settle this. Following Ms Truss's statement, some MPs - including Conservative Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Northern Ireland select committee - suggested the legislation would violate the protocol and breach international law. But Ms Truss assured MPs the legislation would not and said ""we will set out the legal position in due course"". Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

"This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government wants a negotiated settlement with the EU Liz Truss has said a new law would be introduced to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary insisted the bill would be legal under international law. Boris Johnson's government agreed the trade deal - which governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - with the European Union in 2019 after the Brexit vote. But a row over its impact on trade has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to join the power-sharing administration until reforms are made to the deal, which it says treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. In Parliament, Ms Truss said the proposed law would not scrap the deal but make limited changes, such as freeing the movement of UK-made goods from ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and regulatory barriers. But in response to Ms Truss's statement, the EU said it would ""need to respond with all measures at its disposal"" if the UK went ahead with the legislation. Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the unilateral action from the UK was ""damaging to trust"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland And Labour said the government should abide by the deal it signed, and work with the EU ""to find practical solutions to these problems"" rather than altering the deal unilaterally. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed the UK government's proposed legislation and said his party would take ""cautious"" steps to re-engage with power sharing in Northern Ireland as it progresses. This video can not be played Stephen Doughty asks if the government did not understand its Brexit agreement or if it ""intended to break it all along"". Ms Truss told MPs in response to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". She said the UK's preference remained a negotiated solution with the EU in consultation with its negotiator Maros Sefcovic, who has been invited to London for more talks. If a resolution cannot be reached, the UK would take steps to ""cement provisions"" that are working in the protocol, while ""fixing those elements that aren't"". ""The government is clear that proceeding with our legislation is consistent with our obligations under international law,"" she said. She said the bill would: Propose ""green"" and ""red"" lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ensure goods moving and staying in the UK are""freed of unnecessary bureaucracy""if they are not destined for the EU Remove regulatory barriersto goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland Allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards ina new dual regulatory regime Give the UK governmentpower to decide on tax and spend policiesacross the whole of the UK Addressissues related to governance, ""bringing the protocol in line with international norms"" Elections to Northern Ireland's Assembly on 5 May resulted in a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in. The party said the UK government was letting the DUP ""hold society to ransom"" after Mr Johnson met all political parties in Northern Ireland on Monday. Legislative solution on NI protocol needed - PM How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic said the European Commission ""stands ready to continue discussions with the UK government to identify joint solutions within the framework of the protocol"". ""Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the Protocol as announced today by the UK government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal,"" Mr Sefcovic added. ""Our overarching objective is to find joint solutions within the framework of the Protocol."" The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning What the foreign secretary is proposing would be a big change. It would mean Northern Ireland operating under a dual system for trade in goods rather than following EU rules. That's certainly more than a few tweaks. The government argues that an ""ambitious"" plan is now needed to safeguard peace and democracy. But it's not as if it inherited this problem; it negotiated the deal. It's pretty clear that many MPs are deeply unhappy with the idea of the UK now making one-sided changes and going back on an international agreement. The government insists it's acting within the law; it has promised to set out its legal position, although it's very unlikely we'll ever see the detailed legal advice behind it. Despite all of this, nothing will actually change immediately. Legislation would take time to pass through Parliament and hasn't even been published yet. Significantly, neither the EU nor the UK has walked away from negotiations and both say that's really how they want to settle this. Following Ms Truss's statement, some MPs - including Conservative Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Northern Ireland select committee - suggested the legislation would violate the protocol and breach international law. But Ms Truss assured MPs the legislation would not and said ""we will set out the legal position in due course"". Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse.

"There are more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% between January and March, its lowest for almost 50 years, as job openings rose to a new high of 1.3 million. However, wages, excluding bonuses, failed to keep pace with rising prices, a problem expected to intensify because of growing food and fuel costs. The figures show ""a mixed picture"" said the Office for National Statistics. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank at Lancaster University, said: ""Despite employment continuing to rise, today's figures underline the challenges facing workers who are seeing inflation eat away at their living standards."" The data showed that there was a rise in the number of people moving from economic inactivity - classed as those aged 16-64 who haven't been working or seeking a job - into employment. At the same time, people moving from job-to-job also reached a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", said the ONS. ""Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the labour market,"" he added. ""However, job vacancies are still rising, reaching yet another record high."" Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise The situation is ""a nightmare"", said Buddy Love, who along with his wife Kate runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset. Mr Love said it has taken him six weeks and Â£2,000 worth of job adverts to find a new chef for his kitchen - and in the end it was word of mouth that delivered the right candidate rather than any advertisement. Buddy Love runs the Flying Fish pub, restaurant and hotel in Somerset ""I don't know where these people are,"" said Mr Love, adding that he had offered a good starting salary of Â£36,000 and perks such as free accommodation to entice the right person. Luckily, a Romanian couple, who had previously worked in the UK, will soon take up the role as a job share, freeing Mr Love from the kitchen so he can focus on his main job of ""developing the business and making sure it grows"". Pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.2% between January and March but failed to keep up with the rising cost of living - which hit 7% in March and is expected to go higher. It meant that pay, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, and excluding bonuses, dropped by 1.2% - the biggest fall since 2013. Some sectors such as construction and financial services benefitted from bonus payments as firms put up pay to recruit staff, the ONS said. This saw total pay, which includes bonuses, rise by 7% between January and March, keeping pace with rising prices. Mr Morgan said: ""Continued strong bonuses in some sectors such as construction and especially finance mean that total pay is continuing to grow faster than prices on average, but underlying regular earnings are now falling sharply in real terms."" It is a tale of three jobs markets told in these figures. The unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in almost half a century is a testament to the full recovery from the losses in the pandemic and the protections put in place over the past two years. For many millions in employment however pay, when adjusted for surging inflation, fell by the biggest amount for over 9 years and that is set to get worse. And then for businesses seeking workers - those vacancies reached a new record of close to 1.3 million. This is a reflection of a reduction in the size of the workforce, from post-Brexit worker rules, older workers retiring during the pandemic and a rise in long term sickness. So considering the hit from the pandemic, these are a very good set of figures, looking backwards. But they don't yet, except in the real earnings figures, show the impact of the ongoing inflationary economic squeeze. Indeed, such is the extent of the hit to consumer spending power, the Bank of England and others see the economy heading into recessionary territory and unemployment starting to rise by hundreds of thousands. The Government hopes that as many of the remaining jobless can be squeezed into these vacancies. The fear is that this situation is overtaken by the dark inflationary clouds Pay has been failing to keep up with the cost of living for some months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and Ukraine war. Official data on Wednesday is expected to show another sharp rise in the cost of living for April, reflecting last month's hike in the energy price cap. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch is set to leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year and the jobs market slowing down. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I understand that these are anxious times for people, but it's reassuring that fewer people are out of work than was previously feared."" But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""These figures confirm families are facing a cost of living nightmare, with wages failing to keep up with soaring energy bills and food prices."" Looking ahead, Jake Finney, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said the jobless rate could begin to tick higher. ""We expect that unemployment could start to rise towards the end of this year, as headwinds from the war in Ukraine reduce demand for labour. ""The delayed impact is because the labour market tends to lag behind the rest of the economy"".
