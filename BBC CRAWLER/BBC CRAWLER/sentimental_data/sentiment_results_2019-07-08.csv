"Up to three-quarters of civil servants shifted to emergency Brexit preparation duties before the original 29 March deadline have since been stood down, data obtained by BBC Newsnight shows. However, hundreds of Whitehall staff now face being reassigned again to get ready for the new 31 October exit date. Civil service experts say it shows the damage being done to the normal work of government by the moving of the date. The data was unearthed by a series of Freedom of Information (FoI) requests. ""This 'hokey cokey' of staff moves is clearly going to damage some of the other work of the civil service,"" said Joe Owen, of the Institute for Government. ""Everyone that moves is leaving behind a day job, requires new training and may have little experience of the area they move to. ""If we do leave without a deal, it's far from clear how many more moves would be needed and at what point those gaps that have been left would be filled."" Lord Kerslake, who was head of the civil service between 2011 and 2014, told Newsnight the number of movements was ""quite extraordinary"" considering the relative size of the departments. ""It is a testament to the leadership of the civil service that they managed to pull this off,"" he said. ""However, the disruptive effect will have been significant and will have added to the general Westminster and Whitehall paralysis as a consequence of Brexit."" A cabinet office spokesperson said: ""The civil service is delivering the government's commitment to leaving the EU alongside other priorities. We are equipping ourselves with the right people and skills across departments to make this happen."" Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? Hammond vows to oppose 'Â£90bn no-deal hit' Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said on 4 July that he was preparing to increase the numbers of staff working on no-deal preparations after the summer. And, three days earlier, Conservative leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt said he could cancel civil servants' summer holidays to prepare for no deal. ""All government departments will be expected to act on the basis that we are leaving without a deal on 31 October,"" said Mr Hunt. ""All August leave will be cancelled unless I receive a signed letter from the relevant permanent secretary saying that preparations in his or her department are on time and on track."" The data obtained by Newsnight shows that 257 staff from the Ministry of Defence were moved to other departments before 29 March. Of those, 255 have since returned to their previous posts. At the Business Department, 532 were moved internally for no-deal Brexit work, of which 403 have since ""returned to their previous responsibilities"". The Department for Work and Pensions sent 127 people to other departments, of which 125 have returned. The Treasury said: ""It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the number of civil servants involved in contingency planning for no deal at any one time."" The Home Office did not provide any information as it said the cost exceeded the statutory Â£600 FoI request limit. In total, the data showed 691 civil servants were moved internally and 664 were moved externally. Of that 1355 total, 1036 were recorded as having returned to their regular duties - around 75%. In February, John Manzoni, permanent secretary to the cabinet office, told the Public Accounts Committee that it was not simple to move civil servants from one department to another as part of no-deal preparations. ""That is like moving employer, because it often is moving employer. The terms and conditions are different in departments. This is a change of employer. It is like leaving one job and starting another job,"" he said.

"Unite boss Len McCluskey helped orchestrate the agreement Trade union leaders have reached a common position on Brexit following a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn. The bosses of Labour's five-biggest affiliated unions back a referendum on any deal agreed by the Tory government or a no-deal exit from the EU. They are calling for voters to be given the option to remain in the EU and expect Labour to formally back remain. If Labour wins power in a general election, they want a ""confirmatory vote"" on any new deal negotiated. However, Labour's stance in a referendum campaign in these circumstances would ""depend on the deal negotiated"". Mr Corbyn has faced calls to move policy in a more pro-EU direction. Ex-Brexit chief: We should worry about no deal Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour Deputy leader Tom Watson and other leading figures have called for an unambiguously pro-Remain stance amid criticism that confusion over Labour's message contributed to its poor performance in last month's European parliament elections. Mr Watson welcomed Monday's agreement as a ""step in the right direction"" but said his party should not be supporting any form of Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In a document seen by the BBC, Unite, Unison, the GMB, CWU and Usdaw appear to have moved towards the position advocated by Mr Watson and others by saying that ""remain"" should be an option on the ballot paper, and Labour should campaign for it. In the event of a snap election and a Labour victory, they would expect the new government to negotiate a deal to leave the EU - a position favoured by the Unite union. However the deal should be put to a confirmatory vote - a position favoured by Unison and the GMB - and in this scenario ""remain"" should also be an option on the ballot paper. Mr Corbyn, who pledged to consult the unions before any change in position, has previously said he would be prepared to back a referendum on any Brexit deal put to Parliament. The text of the document agreed by Labour's five largest affiliated unions But Mr Corbyn has not guaranteed either to campaign for the UK to stay in the EU or confirmed that this would even be an option on the ballot paper. The Conservatives said Labour had ""no interest in delivering on the referendum result"" of 2016. ""Labour promised to respect the Brexit vote, but rerunning the referendum and backing remain would be an attempt to frustrate Brexit and ignore the democratic mandate to deliver it,"" a spokesman said. The agreement by the biggest Labour-supporting unions is significant. The document sets out two scenarios. In the first, there would be a Conservative negotiated deal - or no deal - which Labour would oppose. Under these circumstances, the unions say Labour should press for a referendum - something which in effect reflects Jeremy Corbyn's current position. But the unions also say not only should ""remain"" be an option in any referendum, but that the party should also campaign for it. This is the position which Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and others - including the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer - have been pressing the Labour leader to adopt following the loss of votes to the avowedly Remain parties at the European elections. Significantly, voices on the left too, such as the shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis and some supporters of Momentum, have also been pushing in this direction. It was thought, though, that the Unite leader Len McCluskey would hold out against campaigning to remain - but he has shifted. The second scenario, though, offers some comfort for Mr McCluskey and Labour MPs in Leave areas. If there is a snap election, and Labour forms the next government, then the unions would still expect a Brexit deal to be negotiated. This deal would be put to the people, but with remain as an alternative. That should keep most of the party's Remainers on side, though they will want guarantees (that so far these have been spoken about privately not publicly) they would not be prevented from campaigning against a Labour deal and for remain. But other Remainers are more sceptical. They say that Labour should just ditch the idea of attempting to get a Brexit deal at all. And they worry that any election campaign would be dominated by media questions to Labour MPs on whether they would be prepared to vote against any deal negotiated by their own government. But the mere fact the unions have made a decision will put fire in the belly of shadow chancellor John McDonnell and some other shadow ministers who have been pushing for Labour to clarify its policy swiftly, before an new Conservative leader is in place. The question is whether Labour's shadow cabinet officially follows suit on Tuesday - but a potential obstacle to a shift in position has been removed today and makes a policy change all the more likely.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt traded jibes in a feisty debate on ITV Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have clashed on Brexit and UK relations with Donald Trump in a lively and occasionally bad-tempered TV debate. Mr Hunt accused his rival of not being willing to ""put his neck on the line"" by saying he would quit as PM if he did not hit the 31 October deadline. Mr Johnson said he admired his rival's ability ""to change his mind"" so often - a dig at the fact Mr Hunt voted Remain. Mr Johnson declined to condemn Mr Trump for his response tothe emails row. He refused to confirm whether he would keep the UK's top diplomat in the US, Sir Kim Darroch, in his post until his scheduled retirement in December, afterMr Trump said he was no longer prepared to deal with him. The US president has lambasted Sir Kim, and criticised Theresa May, after the diplomat described the White House as ""inept and dysfunctional"" in leaked cables. While stressing the value of the ""special relationship"" with the US, Mr Johnson insisted that only he, as prime minister, would take ""important and politically sensitive"" decisions such as who should represent the UK in the US. As it happened: Leaders debate Johnson v Hunt fact-checked Tory leadership: Compare the candidates During the first head-to-head debate of the leadership campaign, the two clashed over their different Brexit strategies, political styles and why they were best equipped to be prime minister. The exchanges were pointed and personal in nature at times, with former Mayor of London Mr Johnson dismissing his opponent's ""managerial"" style of politics and accusing him of flip-flopping on certain issues. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said the UK needed a leader not a ""newspaper columnist"" - a reference to his rival's work for the Daily Telegraph. He joked that he admired Mr Johnson's ""ability to answer the question"", adding: ""He puts a smile on your face and you forget what the question was, a great quality for a politician but not necessarily a prime minister."" After an opening speech from each contender, the foreign secretary immediately went on the attack over Brexit, pressing his rival on whether he would quit Downing Street if he failed to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He said by failing to answer the question, Mr Johnson - who previously said the deadline was a ""do or die"" issue for him - showed he was motivated by personal ambition not leadership. ""It is not do or die,"" Mr Hunt said. ""It is Boris in Number 10 that matters."" Accusing his rival of not being straight with the electorate, he said: ""Being prime minister is about telling people what they need to hear, not just what they want to hear."" Mr Johnson, in turn, said it was clear his rival was ""not absolutely committed"" to the deadline himself, branding him ""defeatist"". He urged Mr Hunt to guarantee that Brexit would happen by Christmas, adding that the EU would not take a ""papier mache deadline"" seriously. What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? And how does Boris Johnson's record compare? Do the people choosing the next PM think like you? ""If we are going to have a 31 October deadline, we must stick to it,"" he said. ""The EU will understand we are ready and will give us the deal we need. ""I don't want to hold out to the EU the prospect that they might encourage my resignation by refusing to agree a deal. ""I think it is extraordinary we should be telling the British electorate we are willing to kick the can down the road. ""I would like to know how many more days my opponent would be willing to delay."" Both men have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal, but Mr Johnson has been far more relaxed about the impact that could have. Bid to make no deal more difficult scrapes through Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? What would no deal look like? Mr Hunt suggested his rival was ""minimising the risk of a no-deal Brexit"" and ""peddling optimism"", but Mr Johnson said the UK had had a ""bellyful of defeatism"" and the UK could look forward to a bright future outside the EU. The pair also disagreed over whether they might be prepared to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit - so-called prorogation. While Mr Hunt categorically ruled this out, Mr Johnson said he would ""not take anything off the table"". Both teams will leave Salford content with their candidates' performance. The gaffe prone former foreign secretary avoided slipping on any banana skins, and managing not to commit on some of the more controversial issues before him. And the current foreign secretary managed to land his blows on his opponent. There was perhaps though no jaw dropper, no moment that turned this race upside down. Mr Johnson arrived the favourite and leaves in the same position. Mr Hunt turned up keen to show that he is ready to use sharp elbows to scrap and to make himself heard with attacks on his rival that are a contrast to his normal careful style. Their respective status as the front runner and challenger may not have changed. Yet while Jeremy Hunt may not, from this performance alone, manage to stop Boris Johnson's journey to No 10, he has at least shown that if he gets there, he is likely to face a very tricky time. Read more from Laura On the escalating diplomatic row with the US, Mr Hunt said the president's criticism of Sir Kim Darroch had been ill-judged and he would, if he became PM, not be forced into recalling the diplomat early. He also took issue with Mr Trump for saying the prime minister had failed to listen to his advice and been made to look ""foolish"" over Brexit. ""His comments about Theresa May were unacceptable and I don't think he should have made them,"" he said, remarks which prompted audience applause. Mr Johnson said the US president had been ""dragged into a British political debate"" not of his making, but did suggest his outburst on Twitter - in which he called Sir Kim a ""pompous fool"" - had ""not necessarily been the right thing to do"". While civil servants must be able to give confidential advice, he declined to comment on Sir Kim's future, only asking Mr Hunt to rule out ""extending his term out of sympathy"". Both men have been criticised for making uncosted spending promises and offers of tax cuts during the campaign. Mr Hunt sought to make capital out of Mr Johnson's pledge to give a tax cut to higher earners by raising the threshold at which people pay 40% tax from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. ""It was a mistake, tax cuts for the rich,"" he said. ""I have spent my life trying to persuade people that we are not the party of the rich."" Mr Johnson defended what he said was a ""package"" of measures to reduce the tax burden for both low and middle earners and which he said would boost the economy. The show, entitled Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate, was hosted by journalist Julie Etchingham in front of a studio audience of 200 people at MediaCityUK in Salford. It took place as 160,000 or so party members get the chance to vote by post on who should succeed Theresa May. The winner and next PM will be revealed on 23 July - it will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members.

"This video can not be played 'I was imagining the cancers cells were growing' Chemotherapy sessions for patients at Northern Ireland's main cancer centre are being cancelled because it does not operate on bank holidays. Approximately 780 patients at the Belfast Cancer Centre had treatments in April and May cancelled. Some patients had their treatment rescheduled, but others did not. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said it tried to rearrange appointments for some patients but it was not always possible. The trust, which runs the centre at Belfast City Hospital, prioritises rescheduling patients who have cancer which has not spread (primary cancer). This means some patients with cancer which has spread (secondary cancer) do not have their cancelled appointments rescheduled and miss them altogether. The trust said it was aware of the ""anxiety and inequity"" felt by patients affected by bank holiday closures. Chemotherapy for 304 patients will be interrupted in July and August. This is an issue that affects all chemotherapy patients across Northern Ireland. For a system to be operating at full capacity, it also requires staff working in laboratories and pharmacies. All these members of staff are contractually given leave on bank holidays. Sinead Joyce, 48, who has terminal cancer, fears she was not given a fair chance as a ""patient hit with bank holidays"". The mother of two, from Belfast, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. She had several cycles of chemotherapy at the centre, which is attended by approximately 400 chemotherapy patients from across Northern Ireland every week. Patients offered chemotherapy are given a set day they will receive it. Ms Joyce was allocated Mondays on a weekly basis, but this meant her sessions on bank holiday Mondays were cancelled. She said she pleaded with staff to reschedule the cancelled sessions. Ms Joyce had several cycles of chemotherapy at the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre ""I didn't want to miss out,"" she said. ""I was worried and imagining that the cells were growing and spreading and I was not getting my medicine into me. ""I don't know if it made a difference, but I do wonder."" Ms Joyce said she became particularly anxious about missing sessions during a chemotherapy trial starting in March, which offered her a final chance to extend her life. The trial was for an initial 12-week period with the potential for it to be extended if it had a positive effect. She was distraught when she realised she would miss three of the 12 treatments due to St Patrick's Day, Easter Monday and May Day. Ms Joyce said the chemotherapy trial was eventually stopped when scans showed her tumours had grown. ""Every bank holiday I asked to be rescheduled, but was told no. Physically, they said there was nowhere they could put me. ""There was no pharmacy and there were no nurses - it was not possible. ""They said there was nothing to suggest that missing a treatment makes a difference."" Ms Joyce said she was shocked to realise patients whose cancer had spread, like her, were not given the same opportunity to reschedule treatment as people whose cancer was confined to where it first developed. Her story was one of several brought to BBC News NI by patients distressed about disruption to their chemotherapy regime. The Belfast Trust said it tried to reschedule appointments for some patients, but that this was not always possible due to what it described as ""capacity"". It said it received four formal complaints about the issue in the past year, although it is understood more patients have complained informally. A spokesperson said the trust tried to reschedule chemotherapy sessions for patients with cancer which had not spread (primary cancer) - where a cure was ""potentially achievable""  - in the same week as their missed session, or the following week. It said this was because of ""some clinical evidence"" that supported delivering ""the planned dose of chemotherapy on schedule"". It said rescheduling was based on capacity and therefore delays happened ""across the spectrum of diseases and treatment intentions"". But the spokesperson added that patients whose cancer had spread (secondary cancer patients) were not rescheduled to receive their treatment in the same week because of ""less evidence"". BBC News NI has spoken to a number of patients who did not have their treatment rescheduled at all. Christmas Day and New Year's Day are the only days treated as bank holidays for chemotherapy services in Scotland. In Wales, two of the three regional cancer service providers open on all bank holidays except Christmas Day. The third - Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board - does not provide chemotherapy services on bank holidays, but said all patients were accommodated in the days leading up to, or immediately following, a bank holiday to minimise the impact on treatment. A spokesperson said the health board was exploring ways of providing chemotherapy services on Easter and May bank holidays in 2020. NHS England was unable to respond to the query although it is understood services vary across trust areas. The Belfast Trust said it ""recognised that patients would prefer to receive planned chemotherapy"" on bank holidays but that this would require ""substantive service investment"". The spokesperson added: ""There are significant capacity challenges which the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre faces in treating all our patients in a timely manner and we very much regret that some patients experience deferred treatment which is not what we would wish to happen. ""We continue to do everything we can to minimise waiting times for patients and to explore how we can improve the situation for patients whose treatment falls on a public holiday."" The Western Health and Social Care Trust also offers chemotherapy treatment to about 400 patients each month at the North West Cancer Centre in Londonderry. A spokesperson for the Western Trust said: ""Chemotherapy is currently not delivered on bank holidays, however, patients are prioritised (as clinically appropriate) to receive their treatment earlier if required.""

"Instagram believes its new anti-bullying tool, which prompts users to pause and consider what they are saying, could help curb abuse on the platform. It will also soon offer the targets of bullying the ability to restrict interactions with users who are causing them distress. Instagram has been under pressure to deal with its bullying problem after high profile cases,including the suicide of British teenager Molly Russell. In a blog post,external, the firmâs chief executive Adam Mosseri said his firm âcould do moreâ on the issue. ""We can do more to prevent bullying from happening on Instagram, and we can do more to empower the targets of bullying to stand up for themselves,â Mr Mosseri wrote. ""These tools are grounded in a deep understanding of how people bully each other and how they respond to bullying on Instagram, but theyâre only two steps on a longer path.â âRethinkâ Instagram said it was using artificial intelligence to recognise when text resembles the kind of posts that are most often reported as inappropriate by users. In one example, a person types âyou are so ugly and stupidâ, only to be interrupted with a notice saying: âAre you sure you want to post this? Learn moreâ. If the user taps âlearn moreâ, a notice informs: âWe are asking people to rethink comments that seem similar to others that have been reported.â Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017 The user can ignore the message and post anyway, but Instagram said in early tests that ""we have found that it encourages some people to undo their comment and share something less hurtful once they have had a chance to reflect.â The tool is being rolled out to English-speaking users at first, with plans to eventually make it available globally, Instagram told the BBC. Restricted The company said it will soon roll out an additional tool, called Restrict, designed to help teens filter abusive comments without resorting to blocking others - a blunt move that could have repercussions in the real world. ""Weâve heard from young people in our community that theyâre reluctant to block, unfollow, or report their bully because it could escalate the situation, especially if they interact with their bully in real life,â Mr Mosseri said. ""Some of these actions also make it difficult for a target to keep track of their bullyâs behaviour.â Once a user has been restricted, their comments will appear only to themselves. Crucially, a restricted person will not know they have been restricted. ""You can choose to make a restricted personâs comments visible to others by approving their comments,â Mr Mosseri explained. ""Restricted people wonât be able to see when youâre active on Instagram or when youâve read their direct messages.â âNo excuseâ Bullying on social media, particularly Instagram, was brought into tragic focus earlier this year. The father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life, said distressing content about depression and suicide on Instagram were partly responsible for his daughter's death. In April, the British government published itsOnline Harms white paper,external, a policy proposal that sought tighter controls on technology firms. It suggests the creation of an independent regulator to direct ways in which firms should deal with all manner of abuse, including bullying. The paper was met with a mixed response, withsome questioning its efficacy, and fears it could be overreaching,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Instagram boss Adam Mosseri discussed its anti-bullying plans in an interview in June At Facebookâs recent developer conference, Mr Mosseri said a key focus of Instagram - which Facebook owns - is to tackle the bullying issue. âItâs really encouraging to see that the new feature has been rolled out,â said Alex Holmes, deputy chief executive of the Anti-Bullying at the Diana Award, and a long-time anti-bullying advocate. The group has received some funding from Facebook for real-world anti-bullying initiatives in schools. Mr Holmes told the BBC he felt social media firms could still do more to actively teach users about decent behaviour. ""If you are under 18, you should have to go through awareness building when you sign up,â he said. ""I think it would be a pretty simple thing, for the first five minutes, to go through.

"Primark founder and chairman Arthur Ryan has died after a short illness, the budget fashion chain has announced. Mr Ryan established the High Street retailer as Penneys in 1969 in his hometown of Dublin in Ireland. Fifty years on, the chain has expanded to over 350 stores in 11 countries across Europe and the US. Primark chief executive Paul Marchant said 83-year-old Mr Ryan had been ""a true real retail pioneer"" and a ""gifted retailer and a visionary leader"". ""He innovated and was never complacent, despite many successes. He challenged us all to be the best we can be,"" he said. Mr Ryan ran the company for four decades as chief executive and 10 years ago, he gave up his day-to-day control of the firm to become chairman instead. But Mr Marchant said Mr Ryan had remained ""deeply connected"" to the business and had continued to regularly visit stores and walk the shop floor. The chain is still known as Penneys in Ireland, but was renamed when it expanded to the UK to avoid legal issues with US department store chain JC Penney, which had trademarked the name. Mr Ryan started the chain after being tasked by the wealthy Weston family to open a discount clothes retailer. Crowds were handed balloons as they ran into a new Primark store in Birmingham earlier this year Primark has expanded rapidly in recent years, continuing to thrive in what has been a tough environment for many of its rivals.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" Police have been urged to open a criminal investigation into the leak of diplomatic emails which described the Trump administration as ""inept"". Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, told MPs he made the request in a letter to the Met Police. The government has already launched an internal inquiry, saying it ""utterly deplores"" the publication of the memos. US President Donald Trumprenewed his attack on the UK ambassador,Sir Kim Darroch, whose comments were leaked. In a string oftweets,externalabout the UK, he said the US ""will no longer deal with him"", as well as making critical comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and her approach to Brexit. Mr Trump's comments come after No 10 said the prime minister had ""full faith"" in the UK ambassador in Washington following the leak. Inquiry launched into 'inept Trump' leaked emails May has 'full faith' in UK's Washington ambassador Emails from the UK's ambassador,leaked to the Mail on Sunday,,externalsaid Mr Trump's White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and ""divided"". The prime minister's spokesman said it was ""the job of ambassadors to provide honest and unvarnished opinions"" but Mrs May ""does not agree with the assessment"". He added: ""The leak is absolutely unacceptable and, as you would expect, contact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe that it is unacceptable."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan told the House of Commons police could be involved if evidence of wrongdoing over the breach of confidentiality was found. ""The most important focus is to establish who is responsible for this despicable leak,"" he said. Sir Kim Darroch said the White House is ""uniquely dysfunctional"" Earlier, Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC the leak was ""unprofessional, unethical and unpatriotic"", adding that whoever released the emails had ""maliciously"" undermined the defence and security relationship with the US. ""I hope if we can identify the individual, either the full force of internal discipline - or if necessary the law - will be brought to bear because this sort of behaviour has no place in public life,"" he said. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Sir Kim had been ""betrayed"" and ""hung out to dry even though his only crime was to tell the truth"". She added:  ""He told the truth about Donald Trump and that was because it was his job."" This video can not be played Emily Thornberry responds to Sir Kim Darroch leak By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just imagine if every heavily encrypted report to Whitehall from all UK ambassadors overseas was instantly available on your mobile. The candour would cease immediately and they'd become ultra-bland and useless as a tool in policy-making. So, damage in this case is considerable. There will be a large number of potential suspects. Diplomatic telegrams are seen by scores, often hundreds of people - ministers and officials - across several departments. That is to ensure grown-up and private conversations can be had based on large amounts of source material. Of course, there is damage to relations between the UK and the Trump White House too. Mr Trump likes to dish out insults and criticism (remember his frequent belittling of Theresa May over Brexit, and his all out verbal attacks on the mayor of London) but he is pretty thin-skinned when the verbal arrows are aimed at him. The one person who is not under suspicion in London is Sir Kim himself. After all, as his current political master, Mr Hunt, has made clear, he was just doing his job. As the Foreign Office launched an investigation into the source ofthe leak to the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Trump told reporters in New Jersey: ""We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well. ""So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother."" In the emails, the UK ambassador to Washington said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" Sir Kim questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned the US president should not be written off. Dating from 2017 to the present day, the leaked emails said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"". Although theMueller investigation later found allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia were not proven, Sir Kim's emails said ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt reacts to the UK ambassador's leaked emails about US President Donald Trump Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and the UK leaves the EU by 31 October, ""people like"" Sir Kim would ""not be around"". Asked about speculation that he might take on the diplomatic role, Mr Farage said: ""I don't think I'm the right man for the job"", adding that he was ""not a diplomat"". However, he said he ""could be very useful"" when dealing with the US administration. Sir Kim is the British ambassador to the US, which means he represents the Queen and UK government interests in the US. Born in South Stanley, County Durham in 1954, he attended Durham University where he read zoology. During a 42-year diplomatic career, he has specialised in national security issues and European Union policy. In 2007, Sir Kim served in Brussels as UK permanent representative to the EU. He was the prime minister's national security adviser between 2012 and 2015, dealing with issues such as the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Russian annexation of Crimea, the nuclear threat from Iran and the collapse of government authority in Libya. He became ambassador to the US in January 2016, a year before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.

"Unite boss Len McCluskey helped orchestrate the agreement Trade union leaders have reached a common position on Brexit following a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn. The bosses of Labour's five-biggest affiliated unions back a referendum on any deal agreed by the Tory government or a no-deal exit from the EU. They are calling for voters to be given the option to remain in the EU and expect Labour to formally back remain. If Labour wins power in a general election, they want a ""confirmatory vote"" on any new deal negotiated. However, Labour's stance in a referendum campaign in these circumstances would ""depend on the deal negotiated"". Mr Corbyn has faced calls to move policy in a more pro-EU direction. Ex-Brexit chief: We should worry about no deal Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour Deputy leader Tom Watson and other leading figures have called for an unambiguously pro-Remain stance amid criticism that confusion over Labour's message contributed to its poor performance in last month's European parliament elections. Mr Watson welcomed Monday's agreement as a ""step in the right direction"" but said his party should not be supporting any form of Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In a document seen by the BBC, Unite, Unison, the GMB, CWU and Usdaw appear to have moved towards the position advocated by Mr Watson and others by saying that ""remain"" should be an option on the ballot paper, and Labour should campaign for it. In the event of a snap election and a Labour victory, they would expect the new government to negotiate a deal to leave the EU - a position favoured by the Unite union. However the deal should be put to a confirmatory vote - a position favoured by Unison and the GMB - and in this scenario ""remain"" should also be an option on the ballot paper. Mr Corbyn, who pledged to consult the unions before any change in position, has previously said he would be prepared to back a referendum on any Brexit deal put to Parliament. The text of the document agreed by Labour's five largest affiliated unions But Mr Corbyn has not guaranteed either to campaign for the UK to stay in the EU or confirmed that this would even be an option on the ballot paper. The Conservatives said Labour had ""no interest in delivering on the referendum result"" of 2016. ""Labour promised to respect the Brexit vote, but rerunning the referendum and backing remain would be an attempt to frustrate Brexit and ignore the democratic mandate to deliver it,"" a spokesman said. The agreement by the biggest Labour-supporting unions is significant. The document sets out two scenarios. In the first, there would be a Conservative negotiated deal - or no deal - which Labour would oppose. Under these circumstances, the unions say Labour should press for a referendum - something which in effect reflects Jeremy Corbyn's current position. But the unions also say not only should ""remain"" be an option in any referendum, but that the party should also campaign for it. This is the position which Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and others - including the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer - have been pressing the Labour leader to adopt following the loss of votes to the avowedly Remain parties at the European elections. Significantly, voices on the left too, such as the shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis and some supporters of Momentum, have also been pushing in this direction. It was thought, though, that the Unite leader Len McCluskey would hold out against campaigning to remain - but he has shifted. The second scenario, though, offers some comfort for Mr McCluskey and Labour MPs in Leave areas. If there is a snap election, and Labour forms the next government, then the unions would still expect a Brexit deal to be negotiated. This deal would be put to the people, but with remain as an alternative. That should keep most of the party's Remainers on side, though they will want guarantees (that so far these have been spoken about privately not publicly) they would not be prevented from campaigning against a Labour deal and for remain. But other Remainers are more sceptical. They say that Labour should just ditch the idea of attempting to get a Brexit deal at all. And they worry that any election campaign would be dominated by media questions to Labour MPs on whether they would be prepared to vote against any deal negotiated by their own government. But the mere fact the unions have made a decision will put fire in the belly of shadow chancellor John McDonnell and some other shadow ministers who have been pushing for Labour to clarify its policy swiftly, before an new Conservative leader is in place. The question is whether Labour's shadow cabinet officially follows suit on Tuesday - but a potential obstacle to a shift in position has been removed today and makes a policy change all the more likely.

"Deutsche Bank has made the first of the 18,000 job cuts announced on Sunday as part of a radical reorganisation. Staff working in share trading in London, New York and Tokyo were told that their jobs were going. In London, some staff stayed away from work after being told their passes would stop working at 11:00. A spokesperson said the aim of the changes, which will shrink its investment banking business, was to make the bank ""leaner and stronger"". Deutsche Bank is yet to specify the details of the job cuts, but it will pull out of activities related to trading shares, much of which takes place in London and New York. Deutsche Bank's equities business in Asia is managed out of Hong Kong, but a spokesperson declined to comment on the impact the bank reorganisation would have on job numbers in Asia. German banking giants abandon merger talks Deutsche Bank raided over money laundering With almost 8,000 staff, Deutsche Bank is one of the biggest employers in the City of London. Outside the bank's London HQ staff have been seen speaking on their phones - with some visibly upset - just hours after arriving at work. Some workers have been sent home while others are still waiting to find out whether their jobs are at risk. BBC business correspondent Andy Verity reports from Deutsche Bank's London HQ In a bar near the huge, banana-shaped building that is Deutsche Bank's London headquarters, some of the bank's employees are having a drink. Some work for the share trading businesses that Deutsche Bank is now shutting down. They told me that around 800 people in London work for those operations. ""It's not an easy market right now. People aren't falling over themselves to hire more traders,"" one glum-looking former employee told me. Aside from those who buy and sell shares or the derivatives based on them, staff at Deutsche still don't know if they'll be casualties of the cull. ""They haven't told us,"" one told me. ""It's all done on a need-to-know basis."" Don't you need to know? ""We'd like to know. But if we're not being told, hopefully that means we're ok."" ""We will retain a significant presence here and remain a close partner to our UK clients and to international institutions that want to access the London market,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement on Monday. In a conference call, Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing declined to give regional breakdowns of the job cuts, but confirmed that the process of informing those affected had already begun. He described the job losses as ""painful but unavoidable to ensure Deutsche Bank's long-term success"". Shares in Deutsche Bank were down more than 5% on Monday as investors reacted to the shake-up. Deutsche Bank said it would cut its global workforce to 74,000 by 2022, part of a reorganisation that will cost the company â¬7.4bn ($8.3bn; Â£6.6bn) over the next three years. It will also report a second-quarter loss of â¬2.8bn, partly due to the costs of the shake-up. Deutsche Bank's Christian Sewing says the bank must compete with the best A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: ""We have decided to focus our resources on businesses where clients need us most. ""We are setting up a dedicated corporate bank specialising in the financing and treasury products the world's companies need to support trade and investment around the globe. ""Deutsche Bank will remain an international bank. That's what our clients need."" Basically, they buy and sell shares on behalf of clients and companies. Transactions may include buybacks, when a company wants to repurchase its own stock as a way of returning money to shareholders, or rights issues, when a company needs to raise cash on the capital markets. This sector of banking, the equities business, is one area in which Deutsche Bank has decided it is just not competitive enough. Mr Sewing told journalists on Monday that the aim was to create ""a bank that competes to win"". He added: ""If we can't compete with the best, we won't be in the game."" The reorganisation of the business follows the failure of merger talks with rival Commerzbank in April. The German government had supported the tie-up, hoping it would create a national champion in the banking industry. However, both banks concluded that the deal was too risky, fearing the costs of combining might have outweighed the benefits. Deutsche Bank has been struggling for years with the decline of its investment bank and has made several attempts to revamp its business. The latest plan, the most ambitious so far, has already prompted the resignation of one top executive. On Friday, the bank announced that its head of investment banking, Garth Ritchie, was leaving. Certainly hundreds, possibly thousands. The businesses Deutsche Bank is exiting or cutting back are predominantly based in New York and London so it seems very likely the axe will fall harder in the UK and US than in Germany. The bank is cutting 20% of its global workforce and the bank has nearly 8,000 people in the UK. That arithmetic gets you into the thousands quite easily. Does it mean we are in the foothills of another financial crisis? No. This is a problem specific to Deutsche Bank, which expanded rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. When the financial crisis hit it was slow to respond by cutting its business back to a more sustainable size. It is paying the price for that now Readmore from Simon here What do the Deutsche layoffs mean for the UK?

"Eight men and four women were arrested Twelve people have been arrested amid concerns that unscrupulous landlords have stolen welfare benefits from homeless people. Lancashire Constabulary suspect vulnerable tenants have been forced to hand over their Universal Credit and bank cards in return for accommodation. ""This means they never see or have ownership of the money they are entitled to,""  said police. The suspects are wealthy individuals who own properties in Blackburn. Raids took place at seven locations in Blackburn Fifty police officers were involved in dawn raids at seven locations in Blackburn as part of Operation Cactus. They arrested eight men and four women, aged between 20 and 59. Detectives said they believed vulnerable people with drug and alcohol issues may have been coerced into signing over their benefits to the person or people they rent their property from. Det Supt Mark Vaughton said: ""The alarm bells started ringing as soon as we found the fact that the occupants of those premises don't have their bank cards, don't have access to their Universal Credit, and as a result it's leaving them short financially. ""Some of those individuals have had to turn to crime as a result of that exploitation."" People were detained in seven police raids across Blackburn Police are also investigating allegations that some of the suspects have fraudulently claimed a total of Â£500,000 in disability benefits. A number of alleged victims have already contacted the police but officers believe there may be more and urged people, or their relatives, to come forward. The investigation, operated by the force's East Lancashire exploitation team, is being carried out with support from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Insurance Fraud Bureau. Det Sgt Stu Peall from the exploitation team said: ""We appreciate that you may feel apprehensive, concerned or scared to make contact.

"Alishia Curry said she was persuaded to apply for an emergency loan before being defrauded A minister is urgently investigating how a woman was duped by an online loan company that pocketed her benefits. Mother-of-three Alishia Curry said instead of processing her details for a loan, the firm submitted a Universal Credit request in her name which led to regular payments being stopped. Ms Curry, from Buxton, Derbyshire, said she lost about Â£1,000 in one month and has had to miss meals to save money. Work and pensions minister Justin Tomlinson said he would investigate. He said he was treating the case ""as a matter of urgency"". Ms Curry, who is pregnant with her fourth child, said she applied for an emergency loan to replace her cooker. She said she searched online for a loan and entered in details to make an application, and when she was called back they took personal and financial details that were then used to claim benefits. High Peak MP Ruth George said the mother was left with no access to money for the next month When her existing benefits did not come through Ms Curry learned she had been signed up for Universal Credit without her knowledge but with the funds going into someone else's bank account. Since this happened she has lost about Â£1,000 in income support and child tax credits which were stopped once her Universal Credit application went through. She said she had been advised to use a food bank or borrow money. Ms Curry said she did not know which company used her details to make the application, which was approved by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), even though she never met anyone in person. ""Surely they should have asked me to go down for a face-to-face [meeting] or something before they verified that account,"" she said. ""I've had to miss meals just to feed the kids. It's depressing."" Labour MP for High Peak Ruth George has been backing Ms Curry and warned people on benefits to be careful of sharing their details. Ms George said the DWP had insisted the claim was valid as their records showed Ms Curry had been given her advance payment. She said the case ""raises serious questions for the future"", and urged anyone on benefits to ""be very careful about what information they give to people"". The DWP said it could not comment until Mr Tomlinson's team had concluded its investigation. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" Police have been urged to open a criminal investigation into the leak of diplomatic emails which described the Trump administration as ""inept"". Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, told MPs he made the request in a letter to the Met Police. The government has already launched an internal inquiry, saying it ""utterly deplores"" the publication of the memos. US President Donald Trumprenewed his attack on the UK ambassador,Sir Kim Darroch, whose comments were leaked. In a string oftweets,externalabout the UK, he said the US ""will no longer deal with him"", as well as making critical comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and her approach to Brexit. Mr Trump's comments come after No 10 said the prime minister had ""full faith"" in the UK ambassador in Washington following the leak. Inquiry launched into 'inept Trump' leaked emails May has 'full faith' in UK's Washington ambassador Emails from the UK's ambassador,leaked to the Mail on Sunday,,externalsaid Mr Trump's White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and ""divided"". The prime minister's spokesman said it was ""the job of ambassadors to provide honest and unvarnished opinions"" but Mrs May ""does not agree with the assessment"". He added: ""The leak is absolutely unacceptable and, as you would expect, contact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe that it is unacceptable."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan told the House of Commons police could be involved if evidence of wrongdoing over the breach of confidentiality was found. ""The most important focus is to establish who is responsible for this despicable leak,"" he said. Sir Kim Darroch said the White House is ""uniquely dysfunctional"" Earlier, Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC the leak was ""unprofessional, unethical and unpatriotic"", adding that whoever released the emails had ""maliciously"" undermined the defence and security relationship with the US. ""I hope if we can identify the individual, either the full force of internal discipline - or if necessary the law - will be brought to bear because this sort of behaviour has no place in public life,"" he said. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Sir Kim had been ""betrayed"" and ""hung out to dry even though his only crime was to tell the truth"". She added:  ""He told the truth about Donald Trump and that was because it was his job."" This video can not be played Emily Thornberry responds to Sir Kim Darroch leak By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just imagine if every heavily encrypted report to Whitehall from all UK ambassadors overseas was instantly available on your mobile. The candour would cease immediately and they'd become ultra-bland and useless as a tool in policy-making. So, damage in this case is considerable. There will be a large number of potential suspects. Diplomatic telegrams are seen by scores, often hundreds of people - ministers and officials - across several departments. That is to ensure grown-up and private conversations can be had based on large amounts of source material. Of course, there is damage to relations between the UK and the Trump White House too. Mr Trump likes to dish out insults and criticism (remember his frequent belittling of Theresa May over Brexit, and his all out verbal attacks on the mayor of London) but he is pretty thin-skinned when the verbal arrows are aimed at him. The one person who is not under suspicion in London is Sir Kim himself. After all, as his current political master, Mr Hunt, has made clear, he was just doing his job. As the Foreign Office launched an investigation into the source ofthe leak to the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Trump told reporters in New Jersey: ""We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well. ""So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother."" In the emails, the UK ambassador to Washington said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" Sir Kim questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned the US president should not be written off. Dating from 2017 to the present day, the leaked emails said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"". Although theMueller investigation later found allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia were not proven, Sir Kim's emails said ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt reacts to the UK ambassador's leaked emails about US President Donald Trump Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and the UK leaves the EU by 31 October, ""people like"" Sir Kim would ""not be around"". Asked about speculation that he might take on the diplomatic role, Mr Farage said: ""I don't think I'm the right man for the job"", adding that he was ""not a diplomat"". However, he said he ""could be very useful"" when dealing with the US administration. Sir Kim is the British ambassador to the US, which means he represents the Queen and UK government interests in the US. Born in South Stanley, County Durham in 1954, he attended Durham University where he read zoology. During a 42-year diplomatic career, he has specialised in national security issues and European Union policy. In 2007, Sir Kim served in Brussels as UK permanent representative to the EU. He was the prime minister's national security adviser between 2012 and 2015, dealing with issues such as the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Russian annexation of Crimea, the nuclear threat from Iran and the collapse of government authority in Libya.

"Jeffrey Epstein is accused of running a vast network of underage girls Wealthy US financier and friend of the powerful Jeffrey Epstein has appeared in a New York court charged with running ""a vast network"" of underage girls for sex. Appearing in dark-blue jail clothing on Monday, Epstein pleaded not guilty. The indictment alleges he enticed minors to visit his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. According to the charges, the girls, some as young as 14, were given hundreds of dollars for sex acts. He faces one count of sex trafficking and one of sex trafficking conspiracy. Who is Jeffrey Epstein? The 66-year-old hedge fund manager was arrested on Saturday at Teterboro Airport after arriving from France on his private jet. Epstein will remain in jail until his bail hearing on 11 July. The indictment alleges Epstein knew his victims were under 18. Often they would be invited to carry out a massage nude before being subjected to sexual abuse, it says. The accused ""also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused"", the document alleges. He conspired with others ""including employees and associates"" who helped schedule encounters at his Manhattan mansion and Palm Beach residence, it is alleged. Epstein has maintained that he believed the girls were at least 18 and that the encounters were consensual. At a news conference, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, said a police raid on Epstein's Manhattan property resulted in the seizure of what appeared to be photos of naked girls. He said that Epstein presented a flight risk and he would recommend the defendant remain in custody pending trial. Mr Berman appealed to anyone who may have been a victim or have information to come forward. ""The alleged behaviour shocks the conscience,"" he said. ""And while the alleged conduct is from a number of years ago it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims. They deserve their day in court."" This video can not be played Geoffrey Berman: ""If you believe you are a victim of this man... we want to hear from you."" Epstein was once a friend of Prince Andrew, former US President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump. Bill Clinton has issued a statement saying he ""knows nothing about the terrible crimes"". He travelled on ""a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane"" and had a meeting with him in 2002, the statement said. But Mr Clinton said he has ""not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade"". In a 2002 profile in the New York magazine,external, Mr Trump refers to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"". ""He's a lot of fun to be with,"" he said. ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" Epstein was previously accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls between 1999 and 2007. But he reached a plea deal to avoid federal sex trafficking charges in the case. He instead pleaded guilty in 2008 to lesser Florida state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. He spent 13 months in jail and registered as a sex offender, avoiding a possible life sentence. Epstein has a residence in Palm Beach Earlier this year, a Florida judge ruled that federal prosecutors broke the law by not informing Epstein's victims of the plea deal at the time. Judge Kenneth Marra is currently deciding whether the non-prosecution agreement that protected Epstein from the more serious charges should still stand. Following the ruling, the White House said it was also ""looking into"" Labour Secretary Alexander Acosta's role in the plea deal, which he approved in his previous role as a US attorney. Epstein in December deprived his alleged victims of the chance to testify against him for the first timeby reaching a last-minute agreement to settle a civil lawsuit. As a young man, New York-born Epstein taught mathematics and physics at Manhattan's private Dalton School. He moved into finance in 1976, working as an options trader for investment banking company Bear Stearns. Within four years, he was made a limited partner. He then went on to found his own financial management firm J Epstein & Co, reportedly managing the assets of clients with more than $1bn (Â£798m) in net worth. In 1996, he changed his company's name to The Financial Trust Co and based it in the US Virgin Islands for tax purposes. His lavish lifestyle, along with the secrecy surrounding his client list and other details of his business, earned Epstein a reputation as a mysterious moneyman. One Wall Street insider described him to New York Magazine in 2002 as a ""Gatsbyesque figure"".,external Epstein reportedly had a mural commissioned in his home depicting himself in prison. ""That's me, and I had this painted because there is always the possibility that could be me again,"",externalR Couri Hay, a public relations specialist who visited Epstein at home three months ago, told the New York Times Epstein had said. Along with his wealth and high-profile friends, Epstein built a reputation as a philanthropist. In 2003, he hit headlines for making a $30m donation to Harvard University for the founding of a mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics programme. Reports of his current wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. According to Florida court records, cited by NBC News,Epstein also maintains properties in the US Virgin Islands, Paris and Mexico.,external Epstein alleged victims urged to come forward.

"Convincing fakes of audio are easier to generate than video spoofs A security firm says deepfaked audio is being used to steal millions of pounds. Symantec said it had seen three cases of seemingly deepfaked audio of different chief executives used to trick senior financial controllers into transferring cash. Deepfakes use artificial intelligence to create convincing fake footage. The AI system could be trained using the ""huge amount"" of audio the average chief executive would have innocently made available, Symantec said. Corporate videos, earning calls, media appearances as well as conference keynotes and presentations would all be useful for fakers looking to build a model of someone's voice, chief technology officer Dr Hugh Thompson said. ""The model can probably be almost perfect,"" he said. A deepfake of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg was widely shared on the social network And they had used background noise to cleverly mask the least convincing syllables and words. ""Really,"" said Dr Thompson, ""who would not fall for something like that?"" Dr Alexander Adam, a data scientist at AI specialist Faculty, said it would take a substantial investment of time and money to produce good audio fakes. 'Training the models costs thousands of pounds,"" he said. ""This is because you need a lot of compute power and the human ear is very sensitive to a wide range of frequencies, so getting the model to sound truly realistic takes a lot of time."" Typically, he said, hours of good quality audio was needed to help capture the rhythms and intonation of a target's speech patterns.

"Urban climber George King, 19, was spotted on the side of the skyscraper on Monday A free-climber has scaled The Shard, one of the tallest buildings in Europe. Urban climber George King, 19, was spoken to by police after the stunt - at about 05:15 BST - but not arrested. Onlookers posted footage of Mr King, who made the ascent without ropes or suction cups in 45 minutes. Previous climbers of the 310-metre (1,017ft) London skyscraper include YouTuber CassOnline, who climbed from the public viewing platform to the apex in 2017. In an Instagram post Mr King said he spent months planning and training for the climb. In 2013, a group of Greenpeace activists alsoscaled the Southwark building to protest against oil drilling in the Arctic. The previous year, The Shard secured a High Court injunction againstAlain Robert, the climber nicknamed the French Spiderman, to stop him attempting to scale it. Bond set explosion 'not formally investigated' Vinnie Jones's wife Tanya dies after long illness 'How my dad helped start a race revolution' A spokesman for Real Estate Management, the asset management company that operates The Shard, said: ""We dealt with an incident at The Shard earlier this morning involving a member of the public who climbed the building. The man was spoken to by police after the stunt but not arrested ""The person was safely apprehended and detained by police. Some areas around the base of The Shard that were closed to the public as a safety precaution have now been partially re-opened. ""Public safety and the security of the people who live, work and visit The Shard and the surrounding area is of paramount importance to us. ""Fortunately no-one was hurt by this dangerous activity and we will be assisting the police with their investigation."" People have taken to social media to voice their amusement and concerns over the climb. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Certainly hundreds, possibly thousands. The businesses Deutsche Bank is exiting or cutting back are predominantly based in New York and London so it seems very likely the axe will fall harder in the UK and US than in Germany. The bank is cutting 20% of its global workforce and the bank has nearly 8,000 people in the UK. That arithmetic gets you into the thousands quite easily. No. This is a problem specific to Deutsche Bank. In the 1990s and 2000s, Deutsche tried to gatecrash into the premier league of investment banking. It spent heavily on recruiting teams of merger and acquisition specialists as well as traders in shares and bonds. The chief executive acknowledged it was spread too thinly, getting into all banking businesses many of which it lacked expertise and scale in. When the financial crisis hit it was slow to respond by cutting its business back to a more sustainable size. It is paying the price for that now. It's not great news. Apart from the brutality of giving people hours to clear their desks - the decision by Deutsche to shut down its share trading division will mean less activity taking place here, less money being paid to UK based employees and so lower tax receipts for the Exchequer. Until we know how the job losses break down geographically it's hard to estimate how big an impact we will see. But given there are 350,000 working in the city of London, the loss of 1,000 to 2,000 workers will not be hugely significant. The real damage may be to confidence. Although others will snap up morsels from Deutsche's vacated table (Barclays thinks this is a real opportunity as the last European investment bank standing), how much of the business will stay in London?  At a time when the prospect of Brexit has seen people and capital leak out of the UK to other centres in Europe, there must be some risk that the activity Deutsche was doing in London will be done elsewhere. A financial centre like London is like a coral reef - an entwined ecosystem of banking, legal, accounting and insurance elements which feed off each other. It took centuries to build and can't be killed off easily but that doesn't mean it can't suffer from erosion and that you can't chip a sizeable chunk off. That's what today's Deutsche move feels like - a bit of the reef has died.

"Eight men and four women were arrested Twelve people have been arrested amid concerns that unscrupulous landlords have stolen welfare benefits from homeless people. Lancashire Constabulary suspect vulnerable tenants have been forced to hand over their Universal Credit and bank cards in return for accommodation. ""This means they never see or have ownership of the money they are entitled to,""  said police. The suspects are wealthy individuals who own properties in Blackburn. Raids took place at seven locations in Blackburn Fifty police officers were involved in dawn raids at seven locations in Blackburn as part of Operation Cactus. They arrested eight men and four women, aged between 20 and 59. Detectives said they believed vulnerable people with drug and alcohol issues may have been coerced into signing over their benefits to the person or people they rent their property from. Det Supt Mark Vaughton said: ""The alarm bells started ringing as soon as we found the fact that the occupants of those premises don't have their bank cards, don't have access to their Universal Credit, and as a result it's leaving them short financially. ""Some of those individuals have had to turn to crime as a result of that exploitation."" People were detained in seven police raids across Blackburn Police are also investigating allegations that some of the suspects have fraudulently claimed a total of Â£500,000 in disability benefits. A number of alleged victims have already contacted the police but officers believe there may be more and urged people, or their relatives, to come forward. The investigation, operated by the force's East Lancashire exploitation team, is being carried out with support from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Insurance Fraud Bureau. Det Sgt Stu Peall from the exploitation team said: ""We appreciate that you may feel apprehensive, concerned or scared to make contact. But it is really important that you tell us what has happened.""

"Jeffrey Epstein is accused of running a vast network of underage girls Wealthy US financier and friend of the powerful Jeffrey Epstein has appeared in a New York court charged with running ""a vast network"" of underage girls for sex. Appearing in dark-blue jail clothing on Monday, Epstein pleaded not guilty. The indictment alleges he enticed minors to visit his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. According to the charges, the girls, some as young as 14, were given hundreds of dollars for sex acts. He faces one count of sex trafficking and one of sex trafficking conspiracy. Who is Jeffrey Epstein? The 66-year-old hedge fund manager was arrested on Saturday at Teterboro Airport after arriving from France on his private jet. Epstein will remain in jail until his bail hearing on 11 July. The indictment alleges Epstein knew his victims were under 18. Often they would be invited to carry out a massage nude before being subjected to sexual abuse, it says. The accused ""also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused"", the document alleges. He conspired with others ""including employees and associates"" who helped schedule encounters at his Manhattan mansion and Palm Beach residence, it is alleged. Epstein has maintained that he believed the girls were at least 18 and that the encounters were consensual. At a news conference, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, said a police raid on Epstein's Manhattan property resulted in the seizure of what appeared to be photos of naked girls. He said that Epstein presented a flight risk and he would recommend the defendant remain in custody pending trial. Mr Berman appealed to anyone who may have been a victim or have information to come forward. ""The alleged behaviour shocks the conscience,"" he said. ""And while the alleged conduct is from a number of years ago it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims. They deserve their day in court."" This video can not be played Geoffrey Berman: ""If you believe you are a victim of this man... we want to hear from you."" Epstein was once a friend of Prince Andrew, former US President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump. Bill Clinton has issued a statement saying he ""knows nothing about the terrible crimes"". He travelled on ""a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane"" and had a meeting with him in 2002, the statement said. But Mr Clinton said he has ""not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade"". In a 2002 profile in the New York magazine,external, Mr Trump refers to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"". ""He's a lot of fun to be with,"" he said. ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" Epstein was previously accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls between 1999 and 2007. But he reached a plea deal to avoid federal sex trafficking charges in the case. He instead pleaded guilty in 2008 to lesser Florida state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. He spent 13 months in jail and registered as a sex offender, avoiding a possible life sentence. Epstein has a residence in Palm Beach Earlier this year, a Florida judge ruled that federal prosecutors broke the law by not informing Epstein's victims of the plea deal at the time. Judge Kenneth Marra is currently deciding whether the non-prosecution agreement that protected Epstein from the more serious charges should still stand. Following the ruling, the White House said it was also ""looking into"" Labour Secretary Alexander Acosta's role in the plea deal, which he approved in his previous role as a US attorney. Epstein in December deprived his alleged victims of the chance to testify against him for the first timeby reaching a last-minute agreement to settle a civil lawsuit. As a young man, New York-born Epstein taught mathematics and physics at Manhattan's private Dalton School. He moved into finance in 1976, working as an options trader for investment banking company Bear Stearns. Within four years, he was made a limited partner. He then went on to found his own financial management firm J Epstein & Co, reportedly managing the assets of clients with more than $1bn (Â£798m) in net worth. In 1996, he changed his company's name to The Financial Trust Co and based it in the US Virgin Islands for tax purposes.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" Theresa May has ""full faith"" in the UK ambassador who criticised the Trump administration in leaked emails but she does not agree with his assessment. The PM's spokesman added that the leak was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and No 10 had made contact with the White House. Sir Kim Darroch, the UK's ambassador in Washington, described Donald Trump's administration as ""inept"" in emails. A senior Conservative MP has asked the Metropolitan Police to open a criminal investigation into the leak. The US president responded to Sir Kim's comments by saying ""we're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well"". The prime minister's spokesman said it was ""the job of ambassadors to provide honest and unvarnished opinions"" but Mrs May ""does not agree with the assessment"". ""The leak is absolutely unacceptable and, as you would expect, contact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe that it is unacceptable,"" he added. Inquiry launched into 'inept Trump' leaked emails The chairman of the foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, told the House of Commons on Monday he had written to Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to ask for a criminal investigation. ""I have asked her for reassurance that all necessary resources will be made available to ensure that the source of this leak is determined as a priority,"" he said. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan responded by saying a cross-government investigation would be ""comprehensive"" and the police ""could be involved"" if there was evidence of criminality. Sir Kim Darroch said the White House is ""uniquely dysfunctional"" Trade secretary Liam Fox told the BBC the leak was ""unprofessional, unethical and unpatriotic"", adding that whoever released the emails had ""maliciously"" undermined the defence and security relationship with the US. ""I hope if we can identify the individual, either the full force of internal discipline - or if necessary the law - will be brought to bear because this sort of behaviour has no place in public life,"" he said. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Sir Kim had been ""betrayed"" and ""hung out to dry even though his only crime was to tell the truth"". She added:  ""He told the truth about Donald Trump and that was because it was his job."" This video can not be played Emily Thornberry responds to Sir Kim Darroch leak By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just imagine if every heavily encrypted report to Whitehall from all UK ambassadors overseas was instantly available on your mobile. The candour would cease immediately and they'd become ultra-bland and useless as a tool in policy-making. So, damage in this case is considerable. There will be a large number of potential suspects. Diplomatic telegrams are seen by scores, often hundreds of people - ministers and officials - across several departments. That is to ensure grown-up and private conversations can be had based on large amounts of source material. Of course, there is damage to relations between the UK and the Trump White House too. Mr Trump likes to dish out insults and criticism (remember his frequent belittling of Theresa May over Brexit, and his all out verbal attacks on the mayor of London) but he is pretty thin-skinned when the verbal arrows are aimed at him. The one person who is not under suspicion in London is Sir Kim himself. After all, as his current political master, Mr Hunt, has made clear, he was just doing his job. As the Foreign Office launched an investigation into the source ofthe leak to the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Trump told reporters in New Jersey: ""We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well. ""So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother."" In the emails, the UK ambassador to Washington said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" Sir Kim questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned the US president should not be written off. Dating from 2017 to the present day, the leaked emails said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"". Although theMueller investigation later found allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia were not proven, Sir Kim's emails said ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt reacts to the UK ambassador's leaked emails about US President Donald Trump Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and the UK leaves the EU by 31 October, ""people like"" Sir Kim would ""not be around"". Asked about speculation that he might take on the diplomatic role, Mr Farage said: ""I don't think I'm the right man for the job"", adding that he was ""not a diplomat"". However, he said he ""could be very useful"" when dealing with the US administration. Sir Kim is the British ambassador to the US, which means he represents the Queen and UK government interests in the US. Born in South Stanley, County Durham in 1954, he attended Durham University where he read zoology. During a 42-year diplomatic career, he has specialised in national security issues and European Union policy. In 2007, Sir Kim served in Brussels as UK permanent representative to the EU. He was the prime minister's national security adviser between 2012 and 2015, dealing with issues such as the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Russian annexation of Crimea, the nuclear threat from Iran and the collapse of government authority in Libya. He became ambassador to the US in January 2016, a year before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.

"This video can not be played Philip Rycroft, who resigned after 18 months as the Brexit boss, told the BBC no deal was ""fraught with risk"" Everyone should worry about no deal, the civil servant who was, until March, head of the Brexit department has said. Philip Rycroft, who resigned after 18 months, told the BBC's Panorama no deal was ""fraught with risk"". And NI police said no deal could help recruitment for paramilitary groups. Both the candidates in the race to replace Theresa May as prime minister - Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson - have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said there was ""no reason at all"" why new negotiations with the EU could not be completed in ""the next three months"". But the EU has repeatedly refused to re-open negotiations. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March but this date was delayed after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May's deal. Currently, Brexit is set to take place on 31 October. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, immediately coming out of the single market and customs union and institutions like law enforcement body Europol. Those against say it would damage the economy, especially industries like farming, and cause widespread disruption, but some politicians insist problems could be quickly overcome. The government says it has been preparing for almost three years to minimise that disruption and to provide people and businesses with information they need to get ready. The UK would leave the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help trade between EU members Checks at UK-EU borders could cause bottlenecks at ports No deal also means immediately leaving EU institutions, such as the European Court of Justice Many politicians and businesses say no deal would damage the economy. Others say the risks are exaggerated No-deal Brexit: All you need to know In his first broadcast interview since stepping down as permanent secretary at the Brexit department, Mr Rycroft said the planning operation for exiting the EU was ""an unprecedented situation"" and ""the biggest exercise across government over the last few decades"". He told Panorama: ""This has been an extraordinary exercise to which the civil service is responding brilliantly wellâ¦ The planning I think is in good shape, absolutelyâ¦ but of course what that doesn't mean is that there won't be an impact from Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, because that is a very major change and it would be a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship."" ""The rational outcome over the next few months is to get a deal because that is overwhelmingly in the economic interest of both the EU and the UK."" Brexit: What's the plan for no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? How the Brexit timetable could unfold Mr Rycroft continued: ""It's not in the UK's interest to have no deal, it's not in the EU's interest to have a no deal. ""I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown."" But Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said no deal was the ""ultimate fall back"" and needed to be prepared for ""so that our partners are convinced that this is a deadly serious negotiation"". ""We have got three months to do this with a fresh approach,"" he said. ""We need some alternative arrangements for Northern Ireland - some of that technology is already in place - we need the right to exit the backstop if the negotiations fail, we need some improvements to the political declaration. ""These aren't the biggest things, but what they do require is some optimism and ambition and above all some energy. ""We will have a fresh team, a fresh prime minister and there is no reason at all why this can't be done in the next three months."" A line of lorries seen in Kent during a trial of how routes from major ferry terminals will cope in case of a no-deal Brexit In the event of a no-deal Brexit, additional checks on goods being delivered across the UK-EU border could result in delays on the roads - especially around the Port of Dover in Kent, which handles 17% of the UK's goods trade. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said working with the government to prepare for no deal had been ""a frustrating process"". He said: ""We have no clarity of the processes  - what's actually going to happen on day one."" Mr Burnett told Panorama that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had left him a voicemail expressing his disappointment after the RHA issued a press release following a private briefing. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know In response, Mr Grayling said the haulage industry had been heavily involved in EU preparatory work and would continue to be so. ""It is obviously disappointing when someone issues a press release on the back of what was a private working group to discuss how we best approach both a deal and a no deal,"" he told the BBC. ""But we have continued to meet and engage with them."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland also told the BBC of its concern at the impact on security of a no-deal Brexit. There are fears that one could lead to the introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - a situation Sinn Fein has said would lead to further calls for a referendum on Irish unification. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs told Panorama: ""We know that the New IRA and other groups continue to recruit people and we believe that Brexit provides an opportunity for them to encourage people to recruit."" But he added that, despite their worries, to date the PSNI had not seen ""any upsurge"" in violence or recruitment being driven by Brexit. Can 'alternative arrangements' secure Brexit deal? How the PM hopefuls view Brexit and the border Mr Mairs also expressed fears price differences on the border could create ""new opportunities"" for criminal gangs, claiming: ""We would see, traditionally, connections between some of those groups and more violent groups. ""The potential impact of a no deal on the economy in Northern Ireland is significant, and that would, in our view, present potentially significant security concerns."" The handling of Brexit has been the key issue in the Conservative leadership race. Frontrunner Mr Johnson has said the UK should prepare ""confidently and seriously"" for a no-deal Brexit, but believes the chances of it happening are ""one million to one against"". He has said he will try to get a new deal negotiated with the EU, but has promised to leave the EU with or without one on 31 October. His rival, Mr Hunt, also wants to change the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May and thinks this can be achieved by the end of October. He has said he is prepared to delay Brexit beyond that date, if there is a prospect of getting a deal. If not, he would be prepared to leave without one but with ""a heavy heart"". Meanwhile MPs opposed to no deal are seeking ways to block such an outcome. Tory MP and ex-minister Sam Gyimah says there are ""30 plus"" Conservative MPs who would vote to block a no-deal Brexit.

"British Airways's boss has apologised for what he says was a sophisticated breach of the firm's security systems, and has promised compensation. Alex Cruz told the BBC that hackers carried out a ""sophisticated, malicious criminal attack"" on its website. The airline said personal and financial details of customers making or changing bookings had been compromised. About 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details. ""We are 100% committed to compensate them, period,"" Mr Cruz told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are committed to working with any customer who may have been financially affected by this attack, and we will compensate them for any financial hardship that they may have suffered."" BA said the breach took place between 22:58 BST on 21 August and 21:45 BST on 5 September.  Shares in BA parent group IAG closed 1.4% lower on Friday. Mr Cruz also told the Today programme: ""We're extremely sorry. I know that it is causing concern to some of our customers, particularly those customers that made transactions over BA.com and app. ""We discovered that something had happened but we didn't know what it was [on Wednesday evening]. So overnight, teams were trying to figure out the extent of the attack. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated ""The first thing was to find out if it was something serious and who it affected or not. The moment that actual customer data had been compromised, that's when we began immediate communication to our customers."" BA said all customers affected by the breach had been contacted on Thursday night.  The breach only affects people who bought tickets during the timeframe provided by BA, and not on other occasions. Mr Cruz added: ""At the moment, our number one purpose is contacting those customers that made those transactions to make sure they contact their credit card bank providers so they can follow their instructions on how to manage that breach of data."" The airline has taken out adverts apologising for the breach in Friday's newspapers. By Simon Read, business reporter What data was stolen? ""It was name, email address, credit card information - that would be credit card number, expiration date and the three digit [CVV] code on the back of the credit card,"" said BA boss Mr Cruz. BA insists it did not store the CVV numbers.  This is prohibited under international standards set out by the PCI Security Standards Council. Since BA said the attackers also managed to obtain CVV numbers, security researchers have speculated that the card details were intercepted, rather than harvested from a BA database. How did hackers get in? It isn't totally clear how hackers boarded BA's website and app - but cyber-security experts have some suggestions. How did hackers get into British Airways? What could the hackers do with the data? Once fraudsters have your personal information, they may be able to access your bank account, or open new accounts in your name, or use your details to make fraudulent purchases. They could also sell on your details to other crooks. What do I need to do? If you've been affected, you should change your online passwords. Then monitor your bank and credit card accounts keeping an eye out for any dodgy transactions. Also be very wary of any emails or calls asking for more information to help deal with the data breach: crooks often pose as police, banks or, in this instance they could pretend to be from BA. Will my booking be affected? BA says none of the bookings have been hit by the breach.  It said it has contacted all those affected to alert them to the problem with their data, but booked flights should go ahead. Will there be compensation for me? If you suffer any financial loss or hardship, the airline has promised to compensate you. Jorg Herrera, from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, received an email from BA last night having booked tickets with the airline last month. ""I have six cards linked to my BA account,"" he told the BBC. ""I have no idea how much of my information has been stolen. ""I will have to go to each of my credit card providers, cancel the cards, and all the direct debits, etc, related to those cards. This will take a long time, something I have to do with no help from BA. ""This whole thing is terribly concerning and really annoying."" BA could potentially face fines from the Information Commissioner's Office, which is looking into the breach. Rachel Aldighieri, managing director of the Direct Marketing Association, said: ""British Airways has a duty to ensure their customer data is always secure. They need to show that they have done everything possible to ensure such a breach won't happen again. ""The risks go far beyond the fines regulators can issue - albeit that these could be hefty under the new [EU data protection] GDPR regime."" Under GDPR, fines can be up to 4% of annual global revenue. BA's total revenue in the year to 31 December 2017 was Â£12.226bn, so that could be a potential maximum of Â£489m. The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre also confirmed they were assessing the incident. This is not the first customer relations problem to affect the airline in recent times. In July, BA apologised afterIT issues caused dozens of flights in and out of Heathrow Airport to be cancelled. The month before,more than 2,000 BA passengers had their tickets cancelledbecause the prices were too cheap. And in May 2017, problems with BA's IT systems led to thousands of passengers having their plans disrupted, afterall flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were cancelled. ""It does not indicate that the information systems are the most robust in the airline industry,"" Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, told the BBC. However, he does not think BA will be affected in the long term by the breach. ""The airline has immense strength. Notably it's holding a majority of slots at Heathrow, and an enviable safety record, so while this is embarrassing and will potentially cost tens of millions of pounds to resolve, it's more like another flesh wound for BA, rather than anything serious.""

"Deutsche Bank has made the first of the 18,000 job cuts announced on Sunday as part of a radical reorganisation. Staff working in share trading in London, New York and Tokyo were told that their jobs were going. In London, some staff stayed away from work after being told their passes would stop working at 11:00. A spokesperson said the aim of the changes, which will shrink its investment banking business, was to make the bank ""leaner and stronger"". Deutsche Bank is yet to specify the details of the job cuts, but it will pull out of activities related to trading shares, much of which takes place in London and New York. Deutsche Bank's equities business in Asia is managed out of Hong Kong, but a spokesperson declined to comment on the impact the bank reorganisation would have on job numbers in Asia. German banking giants abandon merger talks Deutsche Bank raided over money laundering With almost 8,000 staff, Deutsche Bank is one of the biggest employers in the City of London. Outside the bank's London HQ staff have been seen speaking on their phones - with some visibly upset - just hours after arriving at work. Some workers have been sent home while others are still waiting to find out whether their jobs are at risk. BBC business correspondent Andy Verity reports from Deutsche Bank's London HQ In a bar near the huge, banana-shaped building that is Deutsche Bank's London headquarters, some of the bank's employees are having a drink. Some work for the share trading businesses that Deutsche Bank is now shutting down. They told me that around 800 people in London work for those operations. ""It's not an easy market right now. People aren't falling over themselves to hire more traders,"" one glum-looking former employee told me. Aside from those who buy and sell shares or the derivatives based on them, staff at Deutsche still don't know if they'll be casualties of the cull. ""They haven't told us,"" one told me. ""It's all done on a need-to-know basis."" Don't you need to know? ""We'd like to know. But if we're not being told, hopefully that means we're ok."" ""We will retain a significant presence here and remain a close partner to our UK clients and to international institutions that want to access the London market,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement on Monday. In a conference call, Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing declined to give regional breakdowns of the job cuts, but confirmed that the process of informing those affected had already begun. He described the job losses as ""painful but unavoidable to ensure Deutsche Bank's long-term success"". Shares in Deutsche Bank were down more than 5% on Monday as investors reacted to the shake-up. Deutsche Bank said it would cut its global workforce to 74,000 by 2022, part of a reorganisation that will cost the company â¬7.4bn ($8.3bn; Â£6.6bn) over the next three years. It will also report a second-quarter loss of â¬2.8bn, partly due to the costs of the shake-up. Deutsche Bank's Christian Sewing says the bank must compete with the best A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: ""We have decided to focus our resources on businesses where clients need us most. ""We are setting up a dedicated corporate bank specialising in the financing and treasury products the world's companies need to support trade and investment around the globe. ""Deutsche Bank will remain an international bank. That's what our clients need."" Basically, they buy and sell shares on behalf of clients and companies. Transactions may include buybacks, when a company wants to repurchase its own stock as a way of returning money to shareholders, or rights issues, when a company needs to raise cash on the capital markets. This sector of banking, the equities business, is one area in which Deutsche Bank has decided it is just not competitive enough. Mr Sewing told journalists on Monday that the aim was to create ""a bank that competes to win"". He added: ""If we can't compete with the best, we won't be in the game."" The reorganisation of the business follows the failure of merger talks with rival Commerzbank in April. The German government had supported the tie-up, hoping it would create a national champion in the banking industry. However, both banks concluded that the deal was too risky, fearing the costs of combining might have outweighed the benefits. Deutsche Bank has been struggling for years with the decline of its investment bank and has made several attempts to revamp its business. The latest plan, the most ambitious so far, has already prompted the resignation of one top executive. On Friday, the bank announced that its head of investment banking, Garth Ritchie, was leaving. Certainly hundreds, possibly thousands. The businesses Deutsche Bank is exiting or cutting back are predominantly based in New York and London so it seems very likely the axe will fall harder in the UK and US than in Germany. The bank is cutting 20% of its global workforce and the bank has nearly 8,000 people in the UK. That arithmetic gets you into the thousands quite easily. Does it mean we are in the foothills of another financial crisis? No. This is a problem specific to Deutsche Bank, which expanded rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s.

"Five people were injured in the crash A man has been charged after a van crashed into a group of people queuing to use a food bank. Five people were injured - two seriously - in the crash at Kirk Hallam Community Centre in Derbyshire on Friday morning.

"This video can not be played Greece's New Democracy celebrates election win in Athens Greece's new centre-right prime minister has vowed the country will ""proudly raise its head again"". After New Democracy's landslide victory on Sunday, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not fail to ""honour the hopes"" of the Greek people. The win comes four years after Alexis Tsipras's leftist Syriza party swept to power promising an end to austerity. But voters began to turn on Syriza after it accepted tough fiscal measures in return for an international bailout. Unemployment and a shrinking economy further damaged support. In the election, Mr Tsipras's Syriza came second, with just 31.53% of the vote so far, according toofficial figures released after almost all districts returned their results,external. Who is Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greece's new prime minister? Greek debt crisis: 'I wasn't paid for two years' New Democracy, meanwhile, has won 39.85% so far, which would give them an outright majority as the winner receives 50 extra seats in parliament. Mr Mitsotakis -  the son of former Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis - said the result gave him a strong mandate for change, but added he would be a prime minister for all, because Greeks were ""too few to stay divided"". This video can not be played Kyriakos Mitsotakis is sworn in as Greece's prime minister The prime minister, who was sworn in at a ceremony on Monday, has promised lower taxes, greater privatisation of public services and plans to renegotiate a deal with Greece's creditors that would allow more money to be reinvested in the country. ""I want to see this people prosper. I want to see the children who left to return,"" he told supporters. Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker congratulated Mr Mitsotakis on his ""clear victory"". Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens Back in 2015, Alexis Tsipras seemed like the figure of change. In his firebrand rallies, the left-wing populist vowed to tear up Greece's bailout programme and end austerity. But he hopelessly overpromised. Under pressure from the EU, capital controls on its banks and the threat of ""Grexit"" - departure from the euro - he was forced into a humiliating U-turn, signing up to a third, â¬89bn (Â£80bn; $100bn) bailout, and more austerity. His support base began to ebb away. As the Mitsotakis era begins, one of Europe's iconic leftist leaders of the past four years departs the stage. But he'll regroup in opposition and wait in the wings to seize on any misstep by Greece's new leader.

"This video can not be played 'I was imagining the cancers cells were growing' Chemotherapy sessions for patients at Northern Ireland's main cancer centre are being cancelled because it does not operate on bank holidays. Approximately 780 patients at the Belfast Cancer Centre had treatments in April and May cancelled. Some patients had their treatment rescheduled, but others did not. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said it tried to rearrange appointments for some patients but it was not always possible. The trust, which runs the centre at Belfast City Hospital, prioritises rescheduling patients who have cancer which has not spread (primary cancer). This means some patients with cancer which has spread (secondary cancer) do not have their cancelled appointments rescheduled and miss them altogether. The trust said it was aware of the ""anxiety and inequity"" felt by patients affected by bank holiday closures. Chemotherapy for 304 patients will be interrupted in July and August. This is an issue that affects all chemotherapy patients across Northern Ireland. For a system to be operating at full capacity, it also requires staff working in laboratories and pharmacies. All these members of staff are contractually given leave on bank holidays. Sinead Joyce, 48, who has terminal cancer, fears she was not given a fair chance as a ""patient hit with bank holidays"". The mother of two, from Belfast, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. She had several cycles of chemotherapy at the centre, which is attended by approximately 400 chemotherapy patients from across Northern Ireland every week. Patients offered chemotherapy are given a set day they will receive it. Ms Joyce was allocated Mondays on a weekly basis, but this meant her sessions on bank holiday Mondays were cancelled. She said she pleaded with staff to reschedule the cancelled sessions. Ms Joyce had several cycles of chemotherapy at the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre ""I didn't want to miss out,"" she said. ""I was worried and imagining that the cells were growing and spreading and I was not getting my medicine into me. ""I don't know if it made a difference, but I do wonder."" Ms Joyce said she became particularly anxious about missing sessions during a chemotherapy trial starting in March, which offered her a final chance to extend her life. The trial was for an initial 12-week period with the potential for it to be extended if it had a positive effect. She was distraught when she realised she would miss three of the 12 treatments due to St Patrick's Day, Easter Monday and May Day. Ms Joyce said the chemotherapy trial was eventually stopped when scans showed her tumours had grown. ""Every bank holiday I asked to be rescheduled, but was told no. Physically, they said there was nowhere they could put me. ""There was no pharmacy and there were no nurses - it was not possible. ""They said there was nothing to suggest that missing a treatment makes a difference."" Ms Joyce said she was shocked to realise patients whose cancer had spread, like her, were not given the same opportunity to reschedule treatment as people whose cancer was confined to where it first developed. Her story was one of several brought to BBC News NI by patients distressed about disruption to their chemotherapy regime. The Belfast Trust said it tried to reschedule appointments for some patients, but that this was not always possible due to what it described as ""capacity"". It said it received four formal complaints about the issue in the past year, although it is understood more patients have complained informally. A spokesperson said the trust tried to reschedule chemotherapy sessions for patients with cancer which had not spread (primary cancer) - where a cure was ""potentially achievable""  - in the same week as their missed session, or the following week. It said this was because of ""some clinical evidence"" that supported delivering ""the planned dose of chemotherapy on schedule"". It said rescheduling was based on capacity and therefore delays happened ""across the spectrum of diseases and treatment intentions"". But the spokesperson added that patients whose cancer had spread (secondary cancer patients) were not rescheduled to receive their treatment in the same week because of ""less evidence"". BBC News NI has spoken to a number of patients who did not have their treatment rescheduled at all. Christmas Day and New Year's Day are the only days treated as bank holidays for chemotherapy services in Scotland. In Wales, two of the three regional cancer service providers open on all bank holidays except Christmas Day. The third - Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board - does not provide chemotherapy services on bank holidays, but said all patients were accommodated in the days leading up to, or immediately following, a bank holiday to minimise the impact on treatment. A spokesperson said the health board was exploring ways of providing chemotherapy services on Easter and May bank holidays in 2020. NHS England was unable to respond to the query although it is understood services vary across trust areas. The Belfast Trust said it ""recognised that patients would prefer to receive planned chemotherapy"" on bank holidays but that this would require ""substantive service investment"". The spokesperson added: ""There are significant capacity challenges which the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre faces in treating all our patients in a timely manner and we very much regret that some patients experience deferred treatment which is not what we would wish to happen. ""We continue to do everything we can to minimise waiting times for patients and to explore how we can improve the situation for patients whose treatment falls on a public holiday."" The Western Health and Social Care Trust also offers chemotherapy treatment to about 400 patients each month at the North West Cancer Centre in Londonderry. A spokesperson for the Western Trust said: ""Chemotherapy is currently not delivered on bank holidays, however, patients are prioritised (as clinically appropriate) to receive their treatment earlier if required.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" Theresa May has ""full faith"" in the UK ambassador who criticised the Trump administration in leaked emails but she does not agree with his assessment. The PM's spokesman added that the leak was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and No 10 had made contact with the White House. Sir Kim Darroch, the UK's ambassador in Washington, described Donald Trump's administration as ""inept"" in emails. A senior Conservative MP has asked the Metropolitan Police to open a criminal investigation into the leak. The US president responded to Sir Kim's comments by saying ""we're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well"". The prime minister's spokesman said it was ""the job of ambassadors to provide honest and unvarnished opinions"" but Mrs May ""does not agree with the assessment"". ""The leak is absolutely unacceptable and, as you would expect, contact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe that it is unacceptable,"" he added. Inquiry launched into 'inept Trump' leaked emails The chairman of the foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, told the House of Commons on Monday he had written to Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to ask for a criminal investigation. ""I have asked her for reassurance that all necessary resources will be made available to ensure that the source of this leak is determined as a priority,"" he said. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan responded by saying a cross-government investigation would be ""comprehensive"" and the police ""could be involved"" if there was evidence of criminality. Sir Kim Darroch said the White House is ""uniquely dysfunctional"" Trade secretary Liam Fox told the BBC the leak was ""unprofessional, unethical and unpatriotic"", adding that whoever released the emails had ""maliciously"" undermined the defence and security relationship with the US. ""I hope if we can identify the individual, either the full force of internal discipline - or if necessary the law - will be brought to bear because this sort of behaviour has no place in public life,"" he said. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Sir Kim had been ""betrayed"" and ""hung out to dry even though his only crime was to tell the truth"". She added:  ""He told the truth about Donald Trump and that was because it was his job."" This video can not be played Emily Thornberry responds to Sir Kim Darroch leak By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just imagine if every heavily encrypted report to Whitehall from all UK ambassadors overseas was instantly available on your mobile. The candour would cease immediately and they'd become ultra-bland and useless as a tool in policy-making. So, damage in this case is considerable. There will be a large number of potential suspects. Diplomatic telegrams are seen by scores, often hundreds of people - ministers and officials - across several departments. That is to ensure grown-up and private conversations can be had based on large amounts of source material. Of course, there is damage to relations between the UK and the Trump White House too. Mr Trump likes to dish out insults and criticism (remember his frequent belittling of Theresa May over Brexit, and his all out verbal attacks on the mayor of London) but he is pretty thin-skinned when the verbal arrows are aimed at him. The one person who is not under suspicion in London is Sir Kim himself. After all, as his current political master, Mr Hunt, has made clear, he was just doing his job. As the Foreign Office launched an investigation into the source ofthe leak to the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Trump told reporters in New Jersey: ""We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well. ""So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother."" In the emails, the UK ambassador to Washington said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" Sir Kim questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned the US president should not be written off. Dating from 2017 to the present day, the leaked emails said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"". Although theMueller investigation later found allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia were not proven, Sir Kim's emails said ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt reacts to the UK ambassador's leaked emails about US President Donald Trump Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister and the UK leaves the EU by 31 October, ""people like"" Sir Kim would ""not be around"". Asked about speculation that he might take on the diplomatic role, Mr Farage said: ""I don't think I'm the right man for the job"", adding that he was ""not a diplomat"". However, he said he ""could be very useful"" when dealing with the US administration. Sir Kim is the British ambassador to the US, which means he represents the Queen and UK government interests in the US. Born in South Stanley, County Durham in 1954, he attended Durham University where he read zoology. During a 42-year diplomatic career, he has specialised in national security issues and European Union policy. In 2007, Sir Kim served in Brussels as UK permanent representative to the EU. He was the prime minister's national security adviser between 2012 and 2015, dealing with issues such as the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Russian annexation of Crimea, the nuclear threat from Iran and the collapse of government authority in Libya. He became ambassador to the US in January 2016, a year before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.

"British Airways will begin talks with its pilots on Monday to avert a potentially damaging summer strike. Pilots have rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which the airline says is ""fair and generous"". However, the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) argues that its members deserve a better offer, as BA has been making healthy profits. The two sides will meet at the conciliation service Acas. Pilots have until 22 July to vote in a strike ballot. If the vote is in favour and the Balpa calls a strike, it would have to give the airline two weeks' notice. That would make 5 August the earliest starting date for industrial action. Further strike dates announced at Highlands airports Why do airlines still mislay 25 million bags a year? Number of planes using British skies to reach all-time high It would be likely to cause severe disruption as Balpa represents around 90% of the airline's pilots and the strike would hit at one of the busiest times of the year. ""We urge Balpa to come to an agreement to protect hard-working families planning their summer breaks,"" the airline said in a statement. British Airways is part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns the Spanish carrier Iberia. Last year it reported a pre-tax profit of â¬3bn, up almost 9.8% on the previous year. British Airways contributed Â£1.96bn to that, up 8.7% on 2017. It also rewarded investors with a total dividend payout of â¬1.3bn. BA-owner IAG says it intends to buy a large number of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft Last monthIAG said it intendedto buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft. The planes would be used by IAG's airlines including British Airways, Vueling and Level. The deal, worth billions of dollars, was seen as a boost for Boeing which is trying to develop a software fix for 737 Max planes after two deadly crashes. All 737 Max planes were grounded in March after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed, killing 157 people.

"This video can not be played Greece's New Democracy celebrates election win in Athens As Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke to his cheering supporters after victory, he paused for a moment of reflection. ""I feel the spirit of my parents protecting me,"" he said. For Greece's new slick prime minister-elect, talk of his family is not just a personal issue. He is a scion of one of the country's most powerful political dynasties: his father, Konstantinos, was prime minister, his sister is a former foreign minister and his nephew is the new mayor of Athens. No other European country has the tradition of family politics like Greece. Centre-right regains power in Greece Mitsotakis and the return of a Greek dynasty Five things that matter in Greek election Young Greeks lean to conservatives for future That is one of the reasons behind its financial crisis - the culture of nepotism that plagued successive post-war governments. Kyriakos Mitsotakis's party has won an outright majority in the Greek parliament But Kyriakos Mitsotakis has deftly managed to present himself as a new face in spite of his heritage, reinvigorating a party swept from office in 2015 for embodying the corrupt old guard. Back then, Alexis Tsipras seemed like the figure of change. In his firebrand rallies, the left-wing populist vowed to tear up Greece's bailout programme and end austerity. He brought in a finance minister, the leather jacket-wearing, motorcycle-driving Yannis Varoufakis, who goaded the EU and made enemies in Brussels and Berlin. He led Greece into a referendum on rejecting Europe's budget cuts, despite warnings from its creditors that it was hurtling towards leaving the eurozone. Outgoing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (centre) will now try to regroup in opposition And he hopelessly overpromised. Under pressure from the EU, capital controls on its banks and the threat of ""Grexit"" - departure from the euro - he was forced into a humiliating U-turn, signing up to a third, â¬89bn (Â£80bn; $100bn) bailout, and more austerity. His support base began to ebb away. ""The fact that Tsipras managed to stay in power for four years despite breaking his pledges is a testimony to his political talent,"" says Professor George Pagoulatos of the Athens University of Economics. ""His party, Syriza, now carries an ideology so different from the policies he's applied that it's meaningless - the main thing holding the party together is Tsipras,"" Prof Pagoulatos says. ""We set the bar high - and we didn't reach it,"" admits Syriza's Dimitris Rapides Dimitris Rapides, a representative of Syriza in Brussels, agrees. ""I understand 100% why people are disappointed with the party,"" he tells me in a bustling Athens cafe. ""People had high expectations - we set the bar high - and we didn't reach it."" Yet Alexis Tsipras has achieved some success over his time in office: Unemployment, which peaked at 28% during the crisis, has edged down to 19% Greece has formally finished its bailout programme - though the country remains under strict supervision by its creditors Tourists are flocking back to Greek beaches, helping the economy return to modest growth last year And some of the 500,000 young minds who left during the crisis are beginning to return, spurred by start-ups and a feeling that Greece has turned a corner This video can not be played Why young people have suffered the most from Greeceâs economic collapse But Mr Tsipras also fell foul of scandal, seeming to break his ""people vs the elite"" rhetoric as he was pictured on a luxury yacht of a Greek shipowner last year - just weeks after mismanaging the response to deadly wildfires. ""Tsipras actually came up with very anti-European politics"", says Pavlos Eleftheriades, a New Democracy supporter who came back from the UK to vote. ""He reminds me of Nigel Farage [the leader of the Brexit party in the UK], even though one is left and one is right. This result is a victory for a European Greece and I'm very excited."" Mr Mitsotakis has promised tax cuts and job creation, with an agenda of privatisation and sound political management. He'll benefit from New Democracy being part of the largest bloc in the European Parliament, painting his victory as an end to Greece's populist experiment and a return to the political mainstream. ""He has a good chance of doing much of what he promises, with a more competent team around him,"" says Prof Pagoulatos. ""And his victory shows that populism is a cyclical phenomenon, more than a trend. ""When populists are tried in power, they face the same constraints of mainstream governments - and don't necessarily respond more successfully. In Greece's case, they were inept and brought the country to the brink of economic collapse."" The legacy of Alexis Tsipras is, indeed, to have shed the populist demagoguery that first swept him to power. And in concrete terms, his biggest foreign policy legacy is one which cost him support within his own country: to have reached a deal accepting Greece's northern neighbour under the name North Macedonia, ending a two decades-old dispute by Greeks who claim ownership over Macedonian identity. North Macedonia deal: Greek PM Tsipras in 'historic' visit Greek bailout crisis in 300 words How crisis helped Greeks open their eyes to mental illness That normalised relations between the two countries, but prompted cries - from Mr Mitsotakis among others - of betrayal. As the (young) Mitsotakis era begins, one of Europe's iconic leftist leaders of the past four years departs the stage. But he'll regroup in opposition and wait in the wings to seize on any misstep by Greece's new leader. This is by no means the last Greece will hear of Alexis Tsipras.

"The government has begun an inquiry into a leak of emails from the UK ambassador in Washington which deemed the Trump administration ""inept"". In the messages, Sir Kim Darroch said the White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and ""divided"" under Donald Trump. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the memos reflected Sir Kim's ""personal view"", not that of the UK government. President Trump said Sir Kim had ""not served the UK well"". Asked about the leak, he told reporters in New Jersey: ""We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well. ""So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother."" The Foreign Office said the leakto the Mail on Sunday,externalwas ""mischievous"", but did not deny the accuracy of the memos. A spokesperson confirmed a formal leak investigation would be launched. In the emails, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" He questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned the US president should not be written off. The UK ambassador in Washington says Trump needs ""simple, even blunt"" arguments Mr Hunt - who is fighting to become the next Conservative leader and prime minister - said while it was the UK ambassador's job to give ""frank opinions"", the memos expressed ""a personal view"". ""It is not the view of the British government, it's not my view,"" he said. ""We continue to think that under President Trump the US administration is not just highly effective but the best friend of Britain on the international stage."" Earlier, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said whoever was responsible for the leak must be prosecuted. ""Diplomats must be able to communicate securely with their governments,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. However, he defended Sir Kim, saying the job of the UK's ambassador is ""to represent the interests and wishes of the British people"" and not ""the sensibilities of the United States"". What we've learned from Trump's visit Trump blames 'airports' gaffe on teleprompter Although Sir Kim said Mr Trump was ""dazzled"" by his state visit to the UK in June, the ambassador warned that his administration will remain self-interested, adding: ""This is still the land of America First."" Differences between the US and the UK on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty might come to the fore as the countries seek to improve trading relations after Brexit, the memos said. To get through to the president, ""you need to make your points simple, even blunt"", he said. The leader of the Brexit party, Nigel Farage, has criticised Sir Kim for his comments, branding the ambassador ""totally unsuitable for the job"" and saying the ""sooner he is gone the better"".

However, Justice Secretary David Gauke said it was very important that ambassadors gave ""honest and unvarnished advice to their country"". He said: ""It is disgraceful that it's been leaked, but we should expect our ambassadors to tell the truth, as they see it."" In a message sent last month, Sir Kim branded US policy on Iran as ""incoherent, chaotic"". Mr Trump'spublicly stated reason for calling off an airstrike against Tehranwith 10 minutes to go - that it would cause 150 casualties - ""doesn't stand up"", Sir Kim said. Instead, he suggested the president was ""never fully on board"" and did not want to reverse his campaign promise not to involve the US in foreign conflicts. Sir Kim said it was ""unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon"" because ""this is a divided administration"". The leaked files date from 2017 to the present day, covering the ambassador's early impressions that media reports of ""vicious infighting and chaos"" in the White House were ""mostly true"". They also give an assessment of allegations about collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia, saying ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". Theinvestigation by Robert Mueller has since foundthose claims were not proven. A Foreign Office spokesman said the views of diplomats were ""not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government. But we pay them to be candid"". He said ministers and civil servants would handle this advice ""in the right way"" and ambassadors should be able to offer it confidentially. The UK embassy in Washington has ""strong relations"" with the White House and these would continue, despite ""mischievous behaviour"" such as this leak, the spokesman said.

"This video can not be played Philip Rycroft, who resigned after 18 months as the Brexit boss, told the BBC no deal was ""fraught with risk"" Everyone should worry about no deal, the civil servant who was, until March, head of the Brexit department has said. Philip Rycroft, who resigned after 18 months, told the BBC's Panorama no deal was ""fraught with risk"". And NI police said no deal could help recruitment for paramilitary groups. Both the candidates in the race to replace Theresa May as prime minister - Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson - have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said there was ""no reason at all"" why new negotiations with the EU could not be completed in ""the next three months"". But the EU has repeatedly refused to re-open negotiations. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March but this date was delayed after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May's deal. Currently, Brexit is set to take place on 31 October. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, immediately coming out of the single market and customs union and institutions like law enforcement body Europol. Those against say it would damage the economy, especially industries like farming, and cause widespread disruption, but some politicians insist problems could be quickly overcome. The government says it has been preparing for almost three years to minimise that disruption and to provide people and businesses with information they need to get ready. The UK would leave the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help trade between EU members Checks at UK-EU borders could cause bottlenecks at ports No deal also means immediately leaving EU institutions, such as the European Court of Justice Many politicians and businesses say no deal would damage the economy. Others say the risks are exaggerated No-deal Brexit: All you need to know In his first broadcast interview since stepping down as permanent secretary at the Brexit department, Mr Rycroft said the planning operation for exiting the EU was ""an unprecedented situation"" and ""the biggest exercise across government over the last few decades"". He told Panorama: ""This has been an extraordinary exercise to which the civil service is responding brilliantly wellâ¦ The planning I think is in good shape, absolutelyâ¦ but of course what that doesn't mean is that there won't be an impact from Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, because that is a very major change and it would be a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship."" ""The rational outcome over the next few months is to get a deal because that is overwhelmingly in the economic interest of both the EU and the UK."" Brexit: What's the plan for no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? How the Brexit timetable could unfold Mr Rycroft continued: ""It's not in the UK's interest to have no deal, it's not in the EU's interest to have a no deal. ""I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown."" But Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said no deal was the ""ultimate fall back"" and needed to be prepared for ""so that our partners are convinced that this is a deadly serious negotiation"". ""We have got three months to do this with a fresh approach,"" he said. ""We need some alternative arrangements for Northern Ireland - some of that technology is already in place - we need the right to exit the backstop if the negotiations fail, we need some improvements to the political declaration. ""These aren't the biggest things, but what they do require is some optimism and ambition and above all some energy. ""We will have a fresh team, a fresh prime minister and there is no reason at all why this can't be done in the next three months."" A line of lorries seen in Kent during a trial of how routes from major ferry terminals will cope in case of a no-deal Brexit In the event of a no-deal Brexit, additional checks on goods being delivered across the UK-EU border could result in delays on the roads - especially around the Port of Dover in Kent, which handles 17% of the UK's goods trade. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said working with the government to prepare for no deal had been ""a frustrating process"". He said: ""We have no clarity of the processes  - what's actually going to happen on day one."" Mr Burnett told Panorama that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had left him a voicemail expressing his disappointment after the RHA issued a press release following a private briefing. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know In response, Mr Grayling said the haulage industry had been heavily involved in EU preparatory work and would continue to be so. ""It is obviously disappointing when someone issues a press release on the back of what was a private working group to discuss how we best approach both a deal and a no deal,"" he told the BBC. ""But we have continued to meet and engage with them."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland also told the BBC of its concern at the impact on security of a no-deal Brexit. There are fears that one could lead to the introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - a situation Sinn Fein has said would lead to further calls for a referendum on Irish unification. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs told Panorama: ""We know that the New IRA and other groups continue to recruit people and we believe that Brexit provides an opportunity for them to encourage people to recruit."" But he added that, despite their worries, to date the PSNI had not seen ""any upsurge"" in violence or recruitment being driven by Brexit. Can 'alternative arrangements' secure Brexit deal? How the PM hopefuls view Brexit and the border Mr Mairs also expressed fears price differences on the border could create ""new opportunities"" for criminal gangs, claiming: ""We would see, traditionally, connections between some of those groups and more violent groups. ""The potential impact of a no deal on the economy in Northern Ireland is significant, and that would, in our view, present potentially significant security concerns."" The handling of Brexit has been the key issue in the Conservative leadership race. Frontrunner Mr Johnson has said the UK should prepare ""confidently and seriously"" for a no-deal Brexit, but believes the chances of it happening are ""one million to one against"". He has said he will try to get a new deal negotiated with the EU, but has promised to leave the EU with or without one on 31 October. His rival, Mr Hunt, also wants to change the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May and thinks this can be achieved by the end of October. He has said he is prepared to delay Brexit beyond that date, if there is a prospect of getting a deal. If not, he would be prepared to leave without one but with ""a heavy heart"". Meanwhile MPs opposed to no deal are seeking ways to block such an outcome. Tory MP and ex-minister Sam Gyimah says there are ""30 plus"" Conservative MPs who would vote to block a no-deal Brexit.
