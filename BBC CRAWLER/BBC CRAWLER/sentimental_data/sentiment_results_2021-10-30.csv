"Igor Kirillov (right) was given the Order of Honour by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 Igor Kirillov - the man known as the face and voice of the USSR for three decades - has died in Russia aged 89. Kirillov was Soviet TV's chief newsreader and announcer. With his trademark delivery - unhurried and calm - he informed viewers of the first sputnik in space, and delivered the communiquÃ©s of the Communist Party. He also anchored all major Soviet set-piece events: from Moscow's Red Square parades to communist congresses. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Soviet Union timeline Positive stories dominated Soviet news bulletins. Every year, to images of combine harvesters advancing through the fields, Igor Kirillov would declare the grain harvest a triumph. But did he believe it? ""For me the hardest thing of all was to believe what I was reading out,"" Igor Kirillov told me in an interview in 2011. ""Deep down I knew that the texts contained half-truths. But as a newsreader you had to convince yourself it was the complete truth. And I did. I persuaded myself that we really were building communism. That life really would get better. Any doubts I had I managed to overcome. If I hadn't then I wouldn't have been able to do my job."" The news wasn't always good. In the 1980s Soviet leaders got into the nasty habit of dying in rapid succession. It was a sombre Igor Kirillov who informed the country of their passing. It happened so often, in fact, that it sparked this famous Soviet joke: Igor Kirillov goes on air in a black tie and announces: ""Comrades, you're going to laugh, but another irreplaceable leader needs replacing."" He had trained as an actor. So how did he break into television? ""At the job interview, I played the guitar and sang,"" he told me. ""Then they asked me to read something out. Luckily the night before I'd memorised a copy of the newspaper Pravda. So I recited that, right off the top of my head. Afterwards as I was leaving the building, the chief stopped me. 'Where are you going?' he said. 'You've got the job and you're on air in two hours'."" The communist newscaster had other jobs, too. He presented Soviet TV's version of Top of the Pops. It was a little more Lenin than Paul McCartney. In 1985 he became a global chart-topper, with a little help from Sting, whose hit song Russians kicks off with Igor Kirillov's voice reading the news. By the late 1980s television news was changing around the world. Journalists were replacing professional announcers as newsreaders. The USSR was no exception.  Soviet TV revamped its nightly news. In came reportersâ¦ out went the ""dyktory"". In 1990, during a study year in Moscow, I interviewed Igor Kirillov for a university project. The Soviet Union's most famous announcer was having a difficult time. ""I read the news for 20 two years on the nightly news Vremya,"" he told me. ""Now they've decided not to use 'diktory'. There's a condescending, disdainful attitude now towards announcers."" He thought that journalists who became anchors delivered the news too fast. ""Russians don't like fast talking. They have their own way of conversing: in a calm, unhurried, thoughtful way. ""If TV news goes in one ear and out the other, our heads will be empty."" Allow YouTube content?

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg presses the PM over how he plans to remedy the fishing row Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged ""turbulence"" in the UK's relationship with France as the row over fishing rights escalates. After dozens of French boats were denied post-Brexit fishing licences for UK and Jersey waters, France threatened to block ports to British vessels. But Mr Johnson told the BBC the things that united the UK and France were more important than their divisions. The French president said the row wasa test of the UK's global credibility. France has said it will take ""targeted measures"" against the UK if the row over fishing licences is not resolved by Tuesday. Brexit Minister David Frost said the government was ""actively considering"" launching a legal process against France under the Brexit agreement, as a result of the ""threats"" from France. Lord Frost described language used by French Prime Minister Jean Castex as ""clearly very troubling and very problematic"" in the context of ongoing negotiations ""trying to solve many highly sensitive issues, including on the Northern Ireland Protocol"". His comments followed the emergence of a letter by Mr Castex, seen by the BBC, which said the EU must demonstrate in this dispute that there was ""more damage to leaving the EU than remaining there"". Writing on Twitter, Mr Frost said: ""We will continue to talk constructively to try to resolve all the differences between us, and we urge the EU and France to step back from rhetoric and actions that make this more difficult."" Pressed on how the UK would respond to the threats as the G20 group of major economies met, Mr Johnson told the BBC: ""We're going to get on and do the things that matter to both of us and make sure that we work together on tackling the big issues that face the world."" Referring to Mr Castex's letter, he acknowledged that ""there's some turbulence in the relationship"". What are the rules on fishing after Brexit? Who really owns UK fishing rights? Does the UK have 'bigger fish to fry'? ""If one of our partners decides to breach the Trade and Cooperation Agreement that we struck, that's a matter that we have to pursue,"" Mr Johnson said. The UK government suggested on Friday that France's threatened measures - such as blocking ports to UK boats, increasing checks on UK goods, boats and trucks, and even cutting energy supplies - would be a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The prime minister also suggested the UK was concerned France may be ""already in breach"" of the deal. Mr Johnson raised his concerns with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen over the ""rhetoric from the French government"" at a meeting at the G20 summit, the prime minister's office said. In a statement, a spokesman added: ""The prime minister stressed that the French threats are completely unjustified and do not appear to be compatible with the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement or wider international law."" Mr Macron and Mr Johnson are expected to have an informal meeting on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday. But asked if he felt the French behaviour was unacceptable, Mr Johnson told the BBC the priority for the UK and France was making progress on tackling climate change in talks at the G20 summit and at COP26 in Glasgow. Speaking from the Colosseum in Rome, he invoked the collapse of the Roman Empire as he said the world was ""absolutely conniving in our decline and fall"". ""What we want to do is to get the world to focus on the threat that humanity faces,"" he said. As a chronicler of Brexit back 'n' forths and brouhahas, I like to think I've seen quite a bit. But diplomacy via a Twitter thread of a Saturday afternoon still feels like a new one on me. Lord Frost's threat of legal action contains some pretty punchy language. But it is a counter threat to an existing threat from France, to make trade between the two countries harder from next week unless this row is resolved. And so a cranking up of the language, on both sides today, could yet prevent a cranking up of the action either side takes, rather than the opposite. Should the legal path end up being pursued, we're told both sides would appoint lawyers and it would become a tussle with the European Union rather than with France. And it could take rather a while. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president and chairman of the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the dispute concerned only about 40 boats, ""a drop of water in an ocean"". He said these boats had been unable to prove their history of fishing in British waters, as the UK required, either because they had been unable to take part in a monitoring survey or because the fisherman had replaced their boats with newer models. He said if sanctions were imposed by France, ""it will be terrible for both sides of the Channel, for you, for us, for the ports, for the fishermen in your country, for the fishermen in our country - and that's only for 40 little boats that are not allowed to fish in your country"". The dispute over fishing rights reignited last month when the UK rejected dozens of applications from French boats to fish in UK territorial waters post-Brexit. Under the trade deal, the EU and UK have agreed they will give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each others' waters for years. But there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed, leading to anger from France when applications were denied by the UK and Jersey. In May, French boats protested outside Jersey's port and France threatened to cut off the island's electricity supply over what it said were unfair terms. Read more about post-Brexit fishing rules Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron accused the UK of backpedalling on its Brexit commitments over the fishing row and over Northern Ireland. He told the Financial Times,externalit raised questions about the UK's reliability with the EU and with all of its partners. Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron greeted each other at the G20 summit in Rome, amid tensions over fishing rights ""Because when you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility,"" he said. As well as raising the possibility of retaliation, the UK government has said it could launch ""dispute settlement proceedings"" with the EU if France went ahead with ""unjustified"" measures.

"Greta Thunberg arrives at Glasgow's Central station Thousands of activists arrived in Scotland's largest city to make their climate change concerns known. They included Greta Thunberg who was mobbed as she arrived by train in Glasgow. The Swedish activist was surrounded by police, media and activists at the city's Central Station. Earlier, faith groups making pilgrimages to Glasgow converged in the city as protests build ahead of COP26 which starts on Sunday. Many had walked thousands of miles to join in a procession through the city centre. The event was an ""opening ceremony"" to a series of non-violent protests planned in Glasgow, and around the world, during the United Nations convention. Ms Thunberg travelled by train from London Euston, carrying a cardboard placard saying Fridays for Future, the name of the youth movement inspired by her school strikes in 2018. Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Hundreds of people from Extinction Rebellion (XR) Faith and pilgrimage groups converged at the McLennan Arch on Glasgow Green, where XR Scotland's ""Blue Rebels"" formed a guard of honour for them. The bells at St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Glasgow led a UK-wide toll from 18:00, offering a traditional warning to humanity to ""pay heed to the climate crisis"". Sturgeon urges COP26 protesters to respect Glasgow COP26 protesters planning high-impact disruption Climate summit venue becomes UN territory Those arriving in the city include Marcha Glasgow, a group of Spanish activists who took a ferry from Bilbao to Portsmouth to embark on a 30-day hike to Glasgow. Camino to COP26 members have walked from London and Bristol to Glasgow in just under two months. Young Christian Climate Network activists arrived in the city on Saturday after walking 1,200 miles from Cornwall. Ecumenical Pilgrimage for Climate Justice arrived in Glasgow from Poland, Sweden and Germany and Pilgrimage for COP26 has walked from Dunbar to Glasgow. Glasgow-based artists Zoe Walker and Neil Bromwich paraded the Serpent of Capitalism, a 30m (100ft) sculptural artwork alongside the pilgrimage groups. Alex Cochrane, of XR Glasgow, said: ""COP26 must end a growing crime against humanity by wealthy governments where the global south are sacrificed to bear the brunt of the global north's affluent, carbon-intensive lifestyles. ""We welcome the pilgrims of faith - and no faith - who are walking to COP26 to demand governments also walk the walk for the global south."" Yaz Ashmawi, of XR Pilgrim, said: ""Countries around the world are already suffering the consequences of our historic emissions in the west, and small island states like the Maldives will be submerged by rising seas if no immediate action is taken on the climate. ""As people of faith we have a spiritual duty of care to those who are less fortunate than us, so we have been using this walk to raise money for activists in financially disadvantaged countries that are already impacted, to empower them to join this conversation themselves.""

A group of indigenous leaders from North and South America were welcomed to Glasgow by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. She said that although Scotland did not have a place at the negotiating table, the Scottish government would help Minga Indigena get their message heard. ""As representatives of indigenous peoples and the Global South, they have an important message to convey on behalf of those least responsible for the global climate emergency, who are often first and most severely affected by its consequences,"" Ms Sturgeon said. Calfin Lafkenche, Mapuche leader from Patagonia, Chile, Minga IndÃ­gena said: ""We are the guardians of 70% of the world's biodiversity. It is everyone's task to reach an understanding and move to a new paradigm where all humanity protect nature. ""We need to face the greatest challenge in history together."" The group have so far been unable to bring all their representatives to Glasgow because of a shortage of accommodation in the city. Several members have been given accommodation by local people but organisers still hope to get access to a large property where more of them can stay together. Ocean Rebellion arrived early to stage its ""visual performances"" ahead of the summit Over the next two weeks about 30,000 people are expected to attend the climate conference. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, Scotland's most senior police officer, previously said his force would respond ""swiftly and robustly"" to protesters who tried to disrupt the event. He said the force - together with 7,000 officers from other parts of the UK who have been deployed to Scotland to help police COP26 - was ""ready for the challenges that lie ahead"". Dramatic protests from other groups have already begun in other parts of the city. Sing The Change brought choirs together in George Square to sing an arrangement of Louis Armstrong's  What A Wonderful World. Four XR protesters locked themselves to the Memorial Gates at the University of Glasgow on Friday to demand that the establishment adopt the Green New Deal - a climate strategy developed by students and staff at the university. Protestors want to raise awareness about trawling the ocean bed releasing carbon into the atmosphere Ocean Rebellion activists poured ""oil"" in front of Glasgow's Cop26 venue in protest ahead of the event. Andrew Darnton, an Ocean Rebellion activist and climate change researcher, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme his group had arrived in Glasgow early to get media coverage before the summit began, and had been warmly welcomed by the people of Glasgow. They use ""striking visual performances"", such as setting fire to their boats or pools of dead mermaids, to convey their message about blue carbon - how the seas store carbon. ""We are bringing people news about the state of the seas and the degradation of the oceans and pointing out how important that is in relation to getting any kind of meaningful progress on cutting carbon,"" Mr Darnton said. ""You can't do that without the seas."" He added: ""We'd like people simply to understand that you won't fix the climate crisis without attending to the ocean. ""Bottom trawling of the ocean, stirring up the ocean bed, produces more carbon in a year that the whole of aviation, the whole of flying, because the seas lock up so much carbon for us. They provide most of our breathable oxygen."" Rail companies worked together to bring young people, politicians and representatives from non-governmental organisations from Europe to Glasgow. Debates on sustainable travel were held during the journey to London. Passengers then travelled to Glasgow on a Pendolino clad with a new design to celebrate the Climate Train journey. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"This video can not be played Watch: 'Sometimes it feels like a war zone' Imagine trying to sleep in the glare of an erupting volcano, rattled by its tremors. Then imagine trying to do that in a cramped caravan, after your home was surrounded by lava or buried beneath it. This is the upturned reality for around 20 families, bedding down for another night in a back street in Los Llanos. They are just outside the exclusion zone on La Palma, in Spain's Canary Islands. They are the homeless of the six-week-old eruption, who cannot even dream of going home without being woken by the volcano's tremors and rumble. Survivors watch the eruption by night from their caravans Dacil Batista shares her small caravan with her partner and their two children, along with her mother-in-law and sister-in-law. ""I'm in despair,"" she tells me, ""because I don't know what's happening to my house."" ""We spent the first few nights staring at the volcano, trying to see what it was doing, but now it is kind of normal to have it there."" After all these weeks you'd expect deeper dismay, even anger. But Dacil is thankful for the food, clothes and toys from the local town hall and hopes to take her children home one day. Just across town, El Roque school has a new class. The children, cut off from their normal lessons, are now being taught in borrowed space using donated books. Their teacher, Christina Mederos, managed to grab the computers but not much else before Las Manchas school was abandoned to the lava. The walls of this temporary classroom have pictures of the erupting volcano drawn by children across the Canary Islands and sent here in support. Children's drawings of the eruption arrived from neighbouring islands Ten-year-old Rodrigo explains that he's now living with his grandmother: ""I thought it would end quickly but the volcano has destroyed houses."" Classmate Sergio describes the lava and the destruction done to the trees, landscape and his grandfather's house. He says the eruption ""is beautiful, but it does a lot of damage"". The children can't even play outside, Christina tells me, because the air and school yard are thick with ash. ""It was very emotional to come back [to school], because I really wanted to see the children. I didn't know how they felt about it all,"" she says. Covid rules suggest the windows should be open for ventilation, but volcanic ash and the risk of toxic gases mean they stay firmly closed. Masks and goggles are all in place before the children step outside. Scientists have come to La Palma, to monitor the lava, check for gases and analyse the newest rocks on Earth. Dr Matt Pankhurst of the Canary Islands Volcano Institute shows me the samples taken by poking a long stick into the lava and dropping it, steaming, into a bucket of cold water - live geology lessons in Earth's oldest processes. His main focus is the crystals held within the hardened lava. ""In principle, we can forecast volcanic eruptions like we do the weather,"" he explains. ""This is the best chance yet to link together the evidence in the rock with the pre-eruption signals, so we can know what's coming next time in much more detail."" It's the story of Earth's formation retold in a devastating act of renewal. On these islands life has always been built on the ruins of a previous eruption. La Palma volcano: Visual guide to what happened 'Miracle house' escapes Canary Islands lava Tourism also defines the Canary Islands. La Palma has been marketed as ""La isla bonita"" - the beautiful island. But unlike that Madonna song, this is no longer a Spanish lullaby. ""It was a disaster,"" says Basso Lanzone, who has run tours here for years. ""It changed everything on this side of the island - now they have nothing. No tourists were arriving because they were afraid of the volcano."" So Basso refocused his tours and brought 100 day-trippers from Tenerife to see the volcano. It's a rare possibility,"" says Anastasia, visiting from Ukraine. ""It's amazing, feeling nature, what it can do."" Mark Fordyce from Aberdeen was on holiday in Tenerife when he saw volcano trips advertised. ""I just thought it would be really interesting to come. I saw that the proceeds from this tour go towards relief for the families affected."" Around the main square of Los Llanos workers constantly sweep and clean as more volcanic ash falls. Architect Henry Garritano Perez lost both his home and studio to the lava when his village, Todoque, was destroyed. ""It wasn't a typical neighbourhood,"" he says, ""it was an extended family."" When the pretty little white church where Henry was married finally collapsed, many lost hope. But not Henry, still smiling through the dust. ""Even though my roots are under 15m of lava, they are in Todoque. The community has to be reborn."" When I ask how anyone could build on the scorched earth of such a disfigured landscape Henry remains upbeat. ""I saw that on Lanzarote [another of the Canary Islands] there are houses literally built on lava. That can be repeated here."" He's realistic, however, that it will be a year or more before the lava is cool enough to start reconstruction. Too long for Dacil Batista and the others whose world has shrunk to the size of a caravan - families uprooted and scattered across the island. Yet even here there is no sense of defeat. ""I could take my kids, my animals and we have a caravan to stay in - we're not on the streets,"" she says. There is a determination to adapt, cope and survive. But every day more people are affected by the impact of this eruption. Additional reporting by Lorna Acquah and Esperanza Claramunt.

"Emergency service crews were called to the scene on Saturday morning People have died following a major river rescue operation, the BBC has been told. It has been confirmed that one person was taken to hospital after being pulled from the River Cleddau. Town councillor Thomas Tudor called it a ""terrible tragedy"" and sent his sympathies ""to the families who have lost loved ones"". Police launched a search after reports that a group of people were in distress in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. Dyfed-Powys Police, firefighters, coastguard, ambulance crews and four helicopters were deployed to the stretch of the river at Quay Street about 09:00 BST. A floral tribute has been left at the scene A police spokeswoman said: ""A swift search of the river was launched, with 30 firefighters from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service working alongside Coastguard crews and helicopter support."" Det Ch Insp Jonathan Rees of Dyfed-Powys Police said he was not in a position to release further details at this time, but everyone had been accounted for and the search stood down. He said at present his priority was ensuring those involved, and their families, had been contacted and were receiving appropriate support. An investigation is under way into the circumstances. Mr Tudor said: ""Today a terrible tragedy unfolded on the River Cleddau in the Castle Ward of Haverfordwest. ""I would like to extend my sympathies to the families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy and I would like to thank the emergency services for their brave efforts in tackling this issue. ""I would also like to thank the staff from the Bristol Trader and Vaughans Radio who provided help and support for the emergency services during this difficult operation."" Emergency vehicles near the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest The Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed one patient was taken to the town's Withybush Hospital for treatment. Earlier Dyfed-Powys Police asked people to avoid the area around Quay Street. There is aflood alert,externalon rivers in the western Cleddau catchment area following heavy rain on Friday. Coastguard, police, firefighters and ambulance crews are at the scene The Met Office has issued awarning,externalfor more heavy rain across south Wales on Sunday. It comes after alandslide closed a roadin Gwynedd following torrential rain. The Severn rail tunnel between Wales and England wasforced to close on Friday evening due to flooding. In a statement, the RNLI said a crew was launched from nearby Angle to help with the search on Saturday morning, but has since been stood down. People in this tight-knit community are obviously upset and shocked at what happened here today. It's said the conditions in the river were dangerous at about 9 o'clock this morning. There had been a heavy and sudden downpour of rain which came amid warnings to be careful. There were dangerous and fast-flowing flood waters following heavy rain in the last few days. This has been an intensive operation with the emergency services called to the scene. They were brought in from a wide area to help in the effort. Yellow weather warnings for rain also remain in several parts of the country, including Glasgow, where the global COP26 climate summit is due to begin on Sunday. OnSaturday afternoon,external, seven flood warnings remained in place, meaning that flooding is expected, and 46 flood alerts, meaning that flooding remains likely. In Dartmoor, Devon, parts of the area received 125mm (4.9in) of rain in 48 hours - compared with an October average of 130mm (5.1in). It comes after a week of wet weather which saw disruption and destruction in northern areas including Cumbria and southern Scotland.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The Queen is ""on very good form"" The whole country wishes the Queen well, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, after she was advised by doctors to rest for two more weeks. On Friday, Buckingham Palace announced the monarch, 95, would not undertake official visits for a fortnight. It said she would continue with some light, desk-based duties and it was her ""firm intention"" to attend Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph on 14 November. The prime minister said ""the important thing"" was the Queen getting some rest. ""I spoke to Her Majesty, as I do every week, this week and she's on very good form,"" Mr Johnson said. ""She's just got to follow the advice of her doctors and get some rest and I think that's the important thing. ""The whole country wishes her well."" Who gives the Queen medical advice? Queen will miss COP26 climate summit In pictures: The Queen's busy October The Queen underwent preliminary medical checks in hospital on 20 October after cancelling a visit to Northern Ireland, having ""reluctantly"" accepted medical advice to rest for a few days. Her stay at London's King Edward VII's Hospital was her first overnight hospital stay in eight years. Although she resumed public engagements earlier this week, it was announced on Wednesday the Queen would not attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow as previously planned. Her planned address to delegates attending COP26 was recorded on Friday afternoon and will be played via video at the event. Other royals will still attend the summit. Friday's statement from Buckingham Palace said the Queen would continue to hold ""virtual audiences"" during the fortnight of rest, but said the monarch would not attend any official visits, including the Festival of Remembrance, held at the Royal Albert Hall on the evening before the Remembrance Sunday service. Royal correspondent Johnny Dymond said ""fatigue, not illness"" seemed to be the issue- with the message from Palace officials stressing the two weeks' rest was ""a sensible precaution"" for the 95-year-old. The Queen's absolute determination to attend the Remembrance Sunday service in Whitehall was ""notable"", he added. The Queen was seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service recently The sovereign had maintained a typically busy schedule this month, including hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on 19 October - but was recently seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service, the first time she has done so at a major event. Robert Hardman, author of Queen of the World, described the recent cancellations as a ""wake-up call that the Queen is 95"". ""She has been so dependable over the years, there has been this tendency just to assume she will keep turning up... and when she's not there it comes as a bit of a jolt,"" Mr Hardman told Radio 4's Today programme, He added the Remembrance service ""was one of the absolute central days in the Queen's calendar"", having  attended the Cenotaph more than anybody in its history. ""It's absolutely sacred to her. We all fervently hope that we are going to see her on her balcony,"" he added. DON'T FORGET!:Why do we turn the clocks back?

"Emergency service crews were called to the scene on Saturday morning People have died following a major river rescue operation, the BBC has been told. It has been confirmed that one person was taken to hospital after being pulled from the River Cleddau. Town councillor Thomas Tudor called it a ""terrible tragedy"" and sent his sympathies ""to the families who have lost loved ones"". Police launched a search after reports that a group of people were in distress in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. Dyfed-Powys Police, firefighters, coastguard, ambulance crews and four helicopters were deployed to the stretch of the river at Quay Street about 09:00 BST. A floral tribute has been left at the scene A police spokeswoman said: ""A swift search of the river was launched, with 30 firefighters from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service working alongside Coastguard crews and helicopter support."" Det Ch Insp Jonathan Rees of Dyfed-Powys Police said he was not in a position to release further details at this time, but everyone had been accounted for and the search stood down. He said at present his priority was ensuring those involved, and their families, had been contacted and were receiving appropriate support. An investigation is under way into the circumstances. Mr Tudor said: ""Today a terrible tragedy unfolded on the River Cleddau in the Castle Ward of Haverfordwest. ""I would like to extend my sympathies to the families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy and I would like to thank the emergency services for their brave efforts in tackling this issue. ""I would also like to thank the staff from the Bristol Trader and Vaughans Radio who provided help and support for the emergency services during this difficult operation."" Emergency vehicles near the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest The Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed one patient was taken to the town's Withybush Hospital for treatment. Earlier Dyfed-Powys Police asked people to avoid the area around Quay Street. There is aflood alert,externalon rivers in the western Cleddau catchment area following heavy rain on Friday. Coastguard, police, firefighters and ambulance crews are at the scene The Met Office has issued awarning,externalfor more heavy rain across south Wales on Sunday. It comes after alandslide closed a roadin Gwynedd following torrential rain. The Severn rail tunnel between Wales and England wasforced to close on Friday evening due to flooding. In a statement, the RNLI said a crew was launched from nearby Angle to help with the search on Saturday morning, but has since been stood down. People in this tight-knit community are obviously upset and shocked at what happened here today. It's said the conditions in the river were dangerous at about 9 o'clock this morning. There had been a heavy and sudden downpour of rain which came amid warnings to be careful. There were dangerous and fast-flowing flood waters following heavy rain in the last few days. This has been an intensive operation with the emergency services called to the scene. They were brought in from a wide area to help in the effort. Yellow weather warnings for rain also remain in several parts of the country, including Glasgow, where the global COP26 climate summit is due to begin on Sunday. OnSaturday afternoon,external, seven flood warnings remained in place, meaning that flooding is expected, and 46 flood alerts, meaning that flooding remains likely. In Dartmoor, Devon, parts of the area received 125mm (4.9in) of rain in 48 hours - compared with an October average of 130mm (5.1in). It comes after a week of wet weather which saw disruption and destruction in northern areas including Cumbria and southern Scotland.

"Greta Thunberg arrives at Glasgow's Central station Thousands of activists arrived in Scotland's largest city to make their climate change concerns known. They included Greta Thunberg who was mobbed as she arrived by train in Glasgow. The Swedish activist was surrounded by police, media and activists at the city's Central Station. Earlier, faith groups making pilgrimages to Glasgow converged in the city as protests build ahead of COP26 which starts on Sunday. Many had walked thousands of miles to join in a procession through the city centre. The event was an ""opening ceremony"" to a series of non-violent protests planned in Glasgow, and around the world, during the United Nations convention. Ms Thunberg travelled by train from London Euston, carrying a cardboard placard saying Fridays for Future, the name of the youth movement inspired by her school strikes in 2018.

""We welcome the pilgrims of faith - and no faith - who are walking to COP26 to demand governments also walk the walk for the global south."" Yaz Ashmawi, of XR Pilgrim, said: ""Countries around the world are already suffering the consequences of our historic emissions in the west, and small island states like the Maldives will be submerged by rising seas if no immediate action is taken on the climate.

A group of indigenous leaders from North and South America were welcomed to Glasgow by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. She said that although Scotland did not have a place at the negotiating table, the Scottish government would help Minga Indigena get their message heard. ""As representatives of indigenous peoples and the Global South, they have an important message to convey on behalf of those least responsible for the global climate emergency, who are often first and most severely affected by its consequences,"" Ms Sturgeon said. Calfin Lafkenche, Mapuche leader from Patagonia, Chile, Minga IndÃ­gena said: ""We are the guardians of 70% of the world's biodiversity. It is everyone's task to reach an understanding and move to a new paradigm where all humanity protect nature. ""We need to face the greatest challenge in history together."" The group have so far been unable to bring all their representatives to Glasgow because of a shortage of accommodation in the city. Several members have been given accommodation by local people but organisers still hope to get access to a large property where more of them can stay together. Ocean Rebellion arrived early to stage its ""visual performances"" ahead of the summit Over the next two weeks about 30,000 people are expected to attend the climate conference. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, Scotland's most senior police officer, previously said his force would respond ""swiftly and robustly"" to protesters who tried to disrupt the event. He said the force - together with 7,000 officers from other parts of the UK who have been deployed to Scotland to help police COP26 - was ""ready for the challenges that lie ahead"".

Andrew Darnton, an Ocean Rebellion activist and climate change researcher, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme his group had arrived in Glasgow early to get media coverage before the summit began, and had been warmly welcomed by the people of Glasgow. They use ""striking visual performances"", such as setting fire to their boats or pools of dead mermaids, to convey their message about blue carbon - how the seas store carbon. ""We are bringing people news about the state of the seas and the degradation of the oceans and pointing out how important that is in relation to getting any kind of meaningful progress on cutting carbon,"" Mr Darnton said. ""You can't do that without the seas."" He added: ""We'd like people simply to understand that you won't fix the climate crisis without attending to the ocean. ""Bottom trawling of the ocean, stirring up the ocean bed, produces more carbon in a year that the whole of aviation, the whole of flying, because the seas lock up so much carbon for us.

"Rome's G20 summit will set the tone for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, held immediately after Leaders of the world's 20 major economies have approved a global agreement that will see the profits of large businesses taxed at least 15%. It follows concern that multinational companies are re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. The pact was agreed by all the leaders attending the G20 summit in Rome. Climate change and Covid are also on the agenda of the summit, which is the leaders' first in-person gathering since the start of the pandemic. The G20 group - made up of 19 countries and the European Union - is short by two, however, with China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin choosing to appear via video link. The tax deal, which was proposed by the US, is expected to be officially adopted on Sunday, according to Reuters news agency, and will be enforced by 2023. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the historic agreement was a ""critical moment"" for the global economy and will ""end the damaging race to the bottom on corporate taxation"". She wrote on Twitter that US businesses and workers would benefit from the deal even though many US-based mega-companies would have to pay more tax. Allow Twitter content?

The G20 summit comes ahead of the much-anticipatedCOP26 summit on climate change in Glasgowwhich begins on Monday. What happens at the G20 may set the tone for COP26, with sharp divisions remaining between countries on their commitments to tackling climate change. Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi opened the two-day G20 summit with a message of unification, telling world leaders that ""going it alone is simply not an option. We must do all we can to overcome our differences"". There are increasingly dire warnings from experts for the future if urgent action is not taken to cut carbon emissions. Speaking to the BBC, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described climate change as ""the biggest threat to humanity"", saying it posed a ""risk to civilisation basically going backwards"". Simple guide to climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important However, he acknowledged that neither the G20 meeting nor COP26 would halt global warming, but could, if the right measures were taken, ""restrict the growth in the temperature of the planet"". According to Reuters news agency, a draft communiquÃ© outlines a promise from the G20 to work towards limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F), saying it ""will require meaningful and effective actions by all countries"". The draft also notes the need for ""developed countries to mobilise $100bn (Â£73bn) annually from public and private sources through to 2025 to address the needs of developing countries"" so they can tackle climate change - a promise richer countries have failed to keep since 2009, when it was initially pledged. Separately, the leaders of the US, Germany, France and UK met to discuss their ""grave and growing concern"" over Iran's nuclear activities. Iran is not part of the G20 forum. In a joint statement, the nations said that if Iran continued its nuclear advances,that would jeopardise the possibility of it returning to the 2015 nuclear deal,externalwith the US and economic sanctions being lifted. They urged Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi to ""change courseâ¦ to avoid a dangerous escalation"". Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Former US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, reinstating harsh sanctions against Iran. Since then Iran has increased its nuclear activities, violating much of the multi-national pact. Talks with Tehran - which have been stalled for months - are due to restart in November. The last few years have seen many countries looking after number one. They have made their own vaccines, they have put up trade barriers, they have put economic growth ahead of fixing the climate crisis. Mario Draghi's point is that this has to stop. The Italian PM is saying that if G20 leaders want to curb global warming, end vaccine inequity, and sort an economic recovery, they have to start thinking and acting more multilaterally. And that doesn't just mean coming to summits. It means - at times - putting wider global interests above narrow national imperatives. That is a big ask because it often involves challenging voters. So far not all world leaders seem ready to do that. There remain divisions over whether much wealthier nations are ready to cut carbon emissions, give more Covid vaccines to developing countries, and stabilise volatile energy prices. The G20 summit will produce many words. But what will matter are its actions, above all on climate change, for that will play a huge part in determining whether the COP26 summit in Glasgow succeeds or fails.

"The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,"" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit. The donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid. It came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access. Covax,externalwas created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations. The scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups. Its initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. Covax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. Ghana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. Since then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. Most doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada,which defended its request. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal. Countries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies. The US joined Covax after President Biden took office in January 2021 The UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply. G7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population. Six vaccines have been given ""emergency use authorisation"" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac. However, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. Moderna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its ""lowest-tiered price"", but most won't be available until 2022. Covax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. Covax supplied AstraZeneca Covid vaccines arriving in Madagascar in May 2021 Deliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials thererestricted exports to protect their own populationamid soaring infection rates. Theseare set to resume from October. Covax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. Representatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to ""accelerate their donation plans"", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covax says it is now expecting to hit its ""key milestone"" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. Why are vaccines being destroyed in Africa? Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? In total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide. However, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive. Covax aims to close that gap. ""With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,"" the WHO says on its website. But even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic. The WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected.

"Greta Thunberg arrives at Glasgow's Central station Thousands of activists arrived in Scotland's largest city to make their climate change concerns known. They included Greta Thunberg who was mobbed as she arrived by train in Glasgow. The Swedish activist was surrounded by police, media and activists at the city's Central Station. Earlier, faith groups making pilgrimages to Glasgow converged in the city as protests build ahead of COP26 which starts on Sunday. Many had walked thousands of miles to join in a procession through the city centre. The event was an ""opening ceremony"" to a series of non-violent protests planned in Glasgow, and around the world, during the United Nations convention. Ms Thunberg travelled by train from London Euston, carrying a cardboard placard saying Fridays for Future, the name of the youth movement inspired by her school strikes in 2018. Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Hundreds of people from Extinction Rebellion (XR) Faith and pilgrimage groups converged at the McLennan Arch on Glasgow Green, where XR Scotland's ""Blue Rebels"" formed a guard of honour for them. The bells at St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Glasgow led a UK-wide toll from 18:00, offering a traditional warning to humanity to ""pay heed to the climate crisis"". Sturgeon urges COP26 protesters to respect Glasgow COP26 protesters planning high-impact disruption Climate summit venue becomes UN territory Those arriving in the city include Marcha Glasgow, a group of Spanish activists who took a ferry from Bilbao to Portsmouth to embark on a 30-day hike to Glasgow. Camino to COP26 members have walked from London and Bristol to Glasgow in just under two months. Young Christian Climate Network activists arrived in the city on Saturday after walking 1,200 miles from Cornwall. Ecumenical Pilgrimage for Climate Justice arrived in Glasgow from Poland, Sweden and Germany and Pilgrimage for COP26 has walked from Dunbar to Glasgow. Glasgow-based artists Zoe Walker and Neil Bromwich paraded the Serpent of Capitalism, a 30m (100ft) sculptural artwork alongside the pilgrimage groups. Alex Cochrane, of XR Glasgow, said: ""COP26 must end a growing crime against humanity by wealthy governments where the global south are sacrificed to bear the brunt of the global north's affluent, carbon-intensive lifestyles. ""We welcome the pilgrims of faith - and no faith - who are walking to COP26 to demand governments also walk the walk for the global south."" Yaz Ashmawi, of XR Pilgrim, said: ""Countries around the world are already suffering the consequences of our historic emissions in the west, and small island states like the Maldives will be submerged by rising seas if no immediate action is taken on the climate. ""As people of faith we have a spiritual duty of care to those who are less fortunate than us, so we have been using this walk to raise money for activists in financially disadvantaged countries that are already impacted, to empower them to join this conversation themselves.""

A group of indigenous leaders from North and South America were welcomed to Glasgow by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. She said that although Scotland did not have a place at the negotiating table, the Scottish government would help Minga Indigena get their message heard. ""As representatives of indigenous peoples and the Global South, they have an important message to convey on behalf of those least responsible for the global climate emergency, who are often first and most severely affected by its consequences,"" Ms Sturgeon said. Calfin Lafkenche, Mapuche leader from Patagonia, Chile, Minga IndÃ­gena said: ""We are the guardians of 70% of the world's biodiversity. It is everyone's task to reach an understanding and move to a new paradigm where all humanity protect nature. ""We need to face the greatest challenge in history together."" The group have so far been unable to bring all their representatives to Glasgow because of a shortage of accommodation in the city. Several members have been given accommodation by local people but organisers still hope to get access to a large property where more of them can stay together. Ocean Rebellion arrived early to stage its ""visual performances"" ahead of the summit Over the next two weeks about 30,000 people are expected to attend the climate conference. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, Scotland's most senior police officer, previously said his force would respond ""swiftly and robustly"" to protesters who tried to disrupt the event. He said the force - together with 7,000 officers from other parts of the UK who have been deployed to Scotland to help police COP26 - was ""ready for the challenges that lie ahead"". Dramatic protests from other groups have already begun in other parts of the city. Sing The Change brought choirs together in George Square to sing an arrangement of Louis Armstrong's  What A Wonderful World. Four XR protesters locked themselves to the Memorial Gates at the University of Glasgow on Friday to demand that the establishment adopt the Green New Deal - a climate strategy developed by students and staff at the university. Protestors want to raise awareness about trawling the ocean bed releasing carbon into the atmosphere Ocean Rebellion activists poured ""oil"" in front of Glasgow's Cop26 venue in protest ahead of the event. Andrew Darnton, an Ocean Rebellion activist and climate change researcher, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme his group had arrived in Glasgow early to get media coverage before the summit began, and had been warmly welcomed by the people of Glasgow. They use ""striking visual performances"", such as setting fire to their boats or pools of dead mermaids, to convey their message about blue carbon - how the seas store carbon. ""We are bringing people news about the state of the seas and the degradation of the oceans and pointing out how important that is in relation to getting any kind of meaningful progress on cutting carbon,"" Mr Darnton said. ""You can't do that without the seas."" He added: ""We'd like people simply to understand that you won't fix the climate crisis without attending to the ocean. ""Bottom trawling of the ocean, stirring up the ocean bed, produces more carbon in a year that the whole of aviation, the whole of flying, because the seas lock up so much carbon for us. They provide most of our breathable oxygen."" Rail companies worked together to bring young people, politicians and representatives from non-governmental organisations from Europe to Glasgow. Debates on sustainable travel were held during the journey to London. Passengers then travelled to Glasgow on a Pendolino clad with a new design to celebrate the Climate Train journey. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"The virus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019 US intelligence agencies say they may never be able to identify the origins of Covid-19, but they have concluded it was not created as a biological weapon. In an updated assessment of where the virus began, the Office of the US Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said an animal-to-human transmission and a lab leak were both plausible hypotheses for how it spread. But there was not enough information to reach a definitive conclusion. China has criticised the report. The findings were published in a declassified report which is an update of a 90-day review that President Joe Biden's administration released in August. It said the intelligence community remains divided on the most likely origin of the virus. Four agencies assessed with ""low confidence"" it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus. But one agency said it had ""moderate confidence"" that the first human infection most likely was the result of a laboratory accident, probably involving experimentation or animal handling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The report also said Chinese officials were unaware of the existence of the virus before the initial outbreak of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan, in late 2019. But it said China was continuing to hinder the global investigation and to resist sharing information. IN CHARTS:Tracking the pandemic CONTEXT:How fast is worldwide progress on vaccines? Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise that the virus first passed to humans from animals. But earlier this year, US media reports suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from the Wuhab laboratory, perhaps through an accidental leak. In May, President Biden ordered intelligence officials to investigate the virus's origins, including the lab leak theory, which is rejected by China. This video can not be played Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more? Responding to the intelligence report, the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement to Reuters news agency: ""The US moves of relying on its intelligence apparatus instead of scientists to trace the origins of Covid-19 is a complete political farce. ""We have been supporting science-based efforts on origins tracing, and will continue to stay actively engaged. That said, we firmly oppose attempts to politicise this issue."" Around 240 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed around the world, with more than 4.9 million deaths.

""We've built this performance on hard work, discipline and keeping the ball away from our goal. Spaces will open up especially if you get the first goal. ""The first goal always decides how the game goes. ""We've got a hard week again. Champions League game then City. We've got to digest this one and be ready for Tuesday."" Does this result mean they can move on from the Liverpool game? ""Of course it doesn't. That's always going to be in the history books - one of the darkest days. A dark spot on our CV. But football becomes history so quickly. ""The experience of Edinson Cavani and Cristiano is massive. We need it. We can't hide. The week has been difficult for all the players. They really stuck at it. Exprience counts in situations like this.""

In the second half there were too many mistakes with the ball. ""With two or three passes [Manchester United] created chances and they scored two more goals.

"Mr Trudeau has pledged to compensate victims Canada says it will appeal against a court order to pay billions of dollars to compensate indigenous children who went through the child welfare system. Last month, a top court upheld a 2016 ruling that the government underfunded First Nations services compared with those for non-indigenous children. It ordered C$40,000 ($31,350; Â£23,340) payouts to each child who was in the on-reserve welfare system after 2006. The case has been a source of tension between campaigners and the government.

"Rome's G20 summit will set the tone for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, held immediately after Leaders of the world's 20 major economies have approved a global agreement that will see the profits of large businesses taxed at least 15%. It follows concern that multinational companies are re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. The pact was agreed by all the leaders attending the G20 summit in Rome. Climate change and Covid are also on the agenda of the summit, which is the leaders' first in-person gathering since the start of the pandemic. The G20 group - made up of 19 countries and the European Union - is short by two, however, with China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin choosing to appear via video link. The tax deal, which was proposed by the US, is expected to be officially adopted on Sunday, according to Reuters news agency, and will be enforced by 2023. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the historic agreement was a ""critical moment"" for the global economy and will ""end the damaging race to the bottom on corporate taxation"". She wrote on Twitter that US businesses and workers would benefit from the deal even though many US-based mega-companies would have to pay more tax. Allow Twitter content?

The G20 summit comes ahead of the much-anticipatedCOP26 summit on climate change in Glasgowwhich begins on Monday. What happens at the G20 may set the tone for COP26, with sharp divisions remaining between countries on their commitments to tackling climate change. Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi opened the two-day G20 summit with a message of unification, telling world leaders that ""going it alone is simply not an option. We must do all we can to overcome our differences"". There are increasingly dire warnings from experts for the future if urgent action is not taken to cut carbon emissions. Speaking to the BBC, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described climate change as ""the biggest threat to humanity"", saying it posed a ""risk to civilisation basically going backwards"". Simple guide to climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important However, he acknowledged that neither the G20 meeting nor COP26 would halt global warming, but could, if the right measures were taken, ""restrict the growth in the temperature of the planet"". According to Reuters news agency, a draft communiquÃ© outlines a promise from the G20 to work towards limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F), saying it ""will require meaningful and effective actions by all countries"". The draft also notes the need for ""developed countries to mobilise $100bn (Â£73bn) annually from public and private sources through to 2025 to address the needs of developing countries"" so they can tackle climate change - a promise richer countries have failed to keep since 2009, when it was initially pledged. Separately, the leaders of the US, Germany, France and UK met to discuss their ""grave and growing concern"" over Iran's nuclear activities. Iran is not part of the G20 forum. In a joint statement, the nations said that if Iran continued its nuclear advances,that would jeopardise the possibility of it returning to the 2015 nuclear deal,externalwith the US and economic sanctions being lifted. They urged Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi to ""change courseâ¦ to avoid a dangerous escalation"". Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Former US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, reinstating harsh sanctions against Iran. Since then Iran has increased its nuclear activities, violating much of the multi-national pact. Talks with Tehran - which have been stalled for months - are due to restart in November. The last few years have seen many countries looking after number one. They have made their own vaccines, they have put up trade barriers, they have put economic growth ahead of fixing the climate crisis. Mario Draghi's point is that this has to stop. The Italian PM is saying that if G20 leaders want to curb global warming, end vaccine inequity, and sort an economic recovery, they have to start thinking and acting more multilaterally. And that doesn't just mean coming to summits. It means - at times - putting wider global interests above narrow national imperatives. That is a big ask because it often involves challenging voters. So far not all world leaders seem ready to do that. There remain divisions over whether much wealthier nations are ready to cut carbon emissions, give more Covid vaccines to developing countries, and stabilise volatile energy prices. The G20 summit will produce many words. But what will matter are its actions, above all on climate change, for that will play a huge part in determining whether the COP26 summit in Glasgow succeeds or fails.

"The fishing row began after the UK and Jersey rejected dozens of licences for French boats to fish in their waters Emmanuel Macron has raised tensions with Britain by warning that the dispute over fishing rights is a test of the UK's global credibility. Mr Macrontold the Financial Times,externalthat UK backpedalling on Brexit commitments ""is not a big sign of... credibility"". It comes amid a UK-France dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights. PM Boris Johnson said the UK would do ""whatever is necessary to ensure UK interests"", and thathe fears the EU-UK trade agreementmay have been breached. The argument, which began when the UK and Jersey denied fishing licences to dozens of French boats last month, is essentially over how many French fishing boats are allowed to fish in UK waters. The French president - referring to the fishing row and disputes over Northern Ireland - spoke out ahead of the G20 summit in Rome, which sets the stage for the COP26 climate summit. Mr Macron said: ""Make no mistake, it is not just for the Europeans but all of their partners. ""Because when you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility."" Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? How serious is summoning the French ambassador? France has said it could stop UK boats landing in its ports if the row over licences is not resolved. On Friday, Brexit minister Lord Frost told the EU the government could launch ""dispute settlement proceedings"" if France went ahead with its threats over the fishing row. Threats to ""disrupt UK fisheries and wider trade, to threaten energy supplies... would put the European Union in breach of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement,"" No 10 said. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a letter that appears to show the French Prime Minister Jean Castex appealing to the EU to demonstrate there is ""more damage to leaving the EU than to remaining there"". The letter says it is necessary that the EU shows its ""total determination"" to get the UK to stick to the agreements it has made on fishing and to ""re-establish trust"". ""It is essential to clearly show to European public opinion that honouring the commitments entered into is not negotiable,"" it adds. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president and chairman of the ports of Calais and Boulogne, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the dispute concerned only about 40 boats, ""a drop of water in an ocean"". He said these boats had been unable to prove their history of fishing in British waters either because they had been unable to take part in a monitoring survey or because the fisherman had replaced their boats with newer models. If the French sanctions go ahead, ""it will be terrible for both sides of the Channel, for you, for us, for the ports, for the fishermen in your country, for the fishermen in our country - and that's only for 40 little boats that are not allowed to fish in your country"", he said. The view in the UK government is - privately - that this row has rather a lot to do with the fact France is in a tricky election cycle. They are not entirely surprised that a lot of political hay is being made out of this on the other side of the Channel. But this is something that has got to be sorted out - and the government is surprised by just how far France has gone in this row, particularly with some of the threats to disrupt cross-Channel trade in the run-up to Christmas. At that same time, Downing Street does not want to plunge into a huge row about this, it doesn't want to up the ante. Boris Johnson - who might even see Emmanuel Macron today - is likely to step through this quite carefully because, as he joked yesterday, the UK - with the climate summit in Glasgow coming up - has bigger fish to fry at the moment. France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to French boats, arguing it was a breach of the Brexit deal. The country then warned it would block British boats from landing their catches in some French ports next week and tighten checks on UK boats and trucks if the dispute was not resolved by Tuesday. On Friday morning, Environment Secretary George Eusticesaid if necessary the UK would respond in turn, saying ""two can play at that game"". The government also said it was considering launching ""dispute settlement proceedings"" with the EU if France went ahead with the ""unjustified measures"". Tensions escalated further whena British trawler was detained on Friday in Le Havreand another one fined. The French people are deeply attached to their fishing industry, suspicious of the British government, and share the general confusion about why some French boats are being given licences and others refused. They take at face value their own government's claim that it is all grossly unfair, and that the planned retaliation against the UK is simply a defence of the national interest. Which is not to say there aren't also worried voices urging caution. The big fish and seafood traders based in Boulogne-sur-Mer depend heavily on British produce either unloaded at the quayside or brought in by lorry. If those imports dry up, hundreds of jobs could be at stake - not to mention the valuable Christmas market for coquille saint-jacques and other shellfish.

" Looking for answers in the place where coronavirus started By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 In a small room, in a village on the outskirts of Wuhan, an elderly woman is chanting quietly and tapping out time on a table. Opposite her, another woman is crying softly. In early February, her 44-year-old brother died from coronavirus, and she cannot forgive herself. After the ceremony, Ms Wang - she doesn't want to use her full name - says that the shaman received a message from beyond the grave. Her brother, Wang Fei, had absolved her of any blame. “Feifei doesn't hold me responsible,” she says, referring to him by the name the family has used since childhood. “He was trying to comfort me and persuade me to accept his death.” Her brother died on a Covid ward, unable to see visitors; his last days lived out in a series of desperate text messages. “I feel so tired,” he wrote in one of them. “This disease has dragged on for too long.” Ms Wang’s guilt is a product of one of the cruellest aspects of this global pandemic – the enforced isolation of sufferers from their families. “I couldn’t go to the hospital to take care of him,” she tells me. “When I heard he’d died, I just couldn’t accept it. My family’s been broken into pieces.” She wants answers about her brother’s treatment - whether he was given proper care, and whether more could have been done to save him. But Ms Wang has been told by the police not to speak to the foreign media, and her choice to ignore that warning carries some risk. Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother One woman we arrange to interview arrives with plain-clothes policemen in pursuit. When she scrambles into our car, they block our way. We meet another man in the darkness on the banks of Wuhan’s East Lake. He tells us he’s been visited twice by the police for speaking out about the death of his father. For victims and journalists alike, asking questions about how and why the outbreak began in Wuhan, and whether it might have been better contained, is not easy. But at the epicentre of this global disaster, the need to ask questions is a necessity, not a choice. The day in mid-January when Wang Fei began to feel unwell, China's official death toll stood at just three. Today, more than 11 million people have been infected worldwide,at least 500,000 have died-  and the virus has forced the lockdown of entire economies. It is here where the virus was first discovered and the first attempts made to contain it. And it is here, too, where the search for its origin must begin, leading to perhaps the biggest question of them all, and one now at the heart of an escalating propaganda war between Washington and Beijing. Did the coronavirus  – as most scientists think – come from nature, or might it have leaked from a lab?  Ms Wang says her brother, who worked as a driver, hardly ever left Wuhan. Over the course of his 44 years, the central Chinese city grew from a declining industrial backwater into a booming international business and transport hub. But if Wang Fei’s life coincided with Wuhan’s extraordinary revival, then his final days ran in parallel with its descent into disaster. In early January, medics had begun to realise that the disease was highly infectious and wereimplementing their own hospital quarantine procedures. But instead of alerting the public, the authorities were silencing health workers. Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn colleagues to take precautions against infection, was reprimanded and made tosign a confession by the police. On the weekend of 18 January, with the authorities still insisting thedisease was not contagious, Wang Fei began to feel unwell. He went to hospital where he was given paracetamol for his fever and sent home. “They say there’s no human-to-human transmission, but the doctors are all wearing masks,” he told his sister. She can repeat the exact wording of the official reassurances, even now. “At that time, I was telling him that it is 'controllable and preventable,'” she says. “Only when I look back, I realise the government really didn't give enough warning. Now I know what he really needed was proper medical help. That’s what makes me feel guilty.” Mr Wang cancelled the family’s plans to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, which fell the following weekend. Instead he spent his days joining long queues outside hospitals. But with too many patients and not enough beds, he would return home exhausted. “He believed deeply that the country and government loved him,” Ms Wang says, “and that they would protect him.” On 23 January, Wuhan was put into lockdown. It was the world’s first, and became one of the longest and strictest attempts to contain the spread of the virus. But it came too late to prevent an estimated five million people leaving the city in the run-up to the national holiday. A few days later, his condition deteriorated and the family called for an ambulance. They were told there were more than 600 people ahead of them in the queue. Seven hours later he was finally admitted to hospital. Mr Wang found himself in a health system that was now totally overwhelmed. He texted his sister, complaining about the difficulty of getting staff to attend to his basic needs - such as help with drinking water. He continued to get worse. On 7 February Dr Li Wenliang, the doctor censored by the police, died in the same hospital. Mr Wang's spirits sank even lower. “If even a doctor can't survive,” he told his sister by text, “what chance have I got?” They are still silencing medics in Wuhan. Outside one hospital, we speak to a nurse who tells us about her experience on the front lines dealing with Covid-19 patients. Afterwards we exchange contact details and she cycles away. Two plain-clothes policemen, who have been watching us, emerge from the side of the street. They run alongside her with their hands on her handlebars, and bring her bike to a halt. I can see them speaking sternly to her, but by the time I catch up with them, they’ve let her go. She calls a few minutes later and asks us to delete the interview. For her safety we have no choice but to agree. The control of information, of course, has long been central to China’s system of government. In this case, it is central to the story. Wuhan’s lockdown was successful in eventually bringing the city’s outbreak under control, but China faces allegations,including from the US government, that delay and cover-up in the early stages made a global crisis inevitable. In the early stages of any disease outbreak, even days can make a big difference to the speed and scale of the spread. One studyhas suggested that if it had acted a week earlier, the number of cases in China could have been reduced by 66%. The authoritiesdeny the allegations. They insist that, in the face of a previously unknown disease, their response was swift and point out that it has been commended by theWorld Health Organization. The government is now comparing itself favourably to administrations in the West, even overtly mocking them for what it sees asa chaotic and confused response. And it is silencing those who mightchallenge that narrative. While the failings of democratic governments have been comprehensively exposed by a free press, there is no such scrutiny in China. This is a place where even trying to talk openly about your dead brother can bring you to the attention of the police. We put in requests to interview parliamentary delegates, senior health officials, academics and doctors - more than 20 people. None of our requests were granted. We sent questions to China’s health commission and its foreign and science ministries about the release of public information in the early days of the crisis. They went unanswered too. Wang Fei lived a short walk from a large market that became an early focus of the unfolding story. Despite its name, the Huanan Seafood Market is known to have had some trade in wild mammalssold there as delicacies. It is now closed. Initially, it was suspected to be ground zero for the outbreak, the place where the virusmade the leap from animals to humans. Sars-CoV-2 – as it has now been named - belongs to a family of coronaviruses named for their spikey or crown-like surfaces. A vast number of these viruses have been shown to becarried by bats. Some of them are thought to have the potential to infect humans, either when passeddirectly from a bat, or after first infecting another animal species – an intermediate host – that then comes intocontact with people. This is,one theory suggests, what triggered another coronavirus outbreak in China which first appeared in November 2002. The Sars coronavirus, now known as Sars CoV-1, is thought to have jumped from bats to humans via the civet cat - a small furry mammal sold in the markets of southern China. After the authorities failed to acknowledge the outbreak for several months, Sars went on to cause 774 deaths worldwide. Nearly two decades later, the very first cluster of Sars CoV-2 cases appeared in Mr Wang’s Wuhan neighbourhood. One study foundaround half of themhad a connection to the seafood market. It was no surprise then that there was widespread speculation the virus’s intermediate host might have been among theanimals on sale there. But this theory now appears to have beendismissed by China, following the testing of samples taken from various places inside the market. While traces of the virus were found, none were detected on any of the animal samples. Officials have concluded that the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. Most scientists remain convinced, though, that somewhere along the line, whether in a market or elsewhere, Sars-CoV-2 will have passed naturally froman animal to a human. They point to an increasing number ofsuch “spillover” eventsdriven by factors such as population growth and human encroachmenton natural habitats. Dr Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist from Hong Kong University who joined the Chinese National Health Commission fact-finding trip to Wuhan in January, says the “spillover” theory is the most favoured for the origin of this virus. This is not least, he says, because such events have happened so often before, from Sars CoV-1 to other avian-flu pandemics. “H5N1 was the first wake-up, then Sars, then H7N9 in the Yangtze Delta, and now Sars-CoV-2,” he tells me. “So, if you ask me what is the highest possibility – it’s that the virus is coming out from markets, markets that are selling wildlife.” And that’s why, he argues, the trade in wild animals should remain the focus of prevention efforts. “It is not easy to change culture, but we must,” he says. Finding the source of the virus is not just a question of academic interest. If Sars-CoV-2 has come from a reservoir of infection in a particular animal species, then of course, it could continue to pose the risk of new outbreaks. In mid-May, the World Health Organization passed a resolution calling for an international effort to trace the likely intermediate animal host. It has just announced it has been given permission to send ateam of investigators to China for this purpose. But scientists agree it maynot be an easy task. We sent a number of questions to the Chinese National Health Commission and the foreign and science ministries about the work already being done in this regard. We asked if any studies had begun to test various animal species that could have spread the virus. We received no answers to our questions. Outside the shuttered Huanan Seafood Market we’re stopped from filming. “I don’t care where you’re from,” a policeman tells me when I explain that I’m a foreign journalist. “China has done a lot to contain the virus. You need to promote positive energy.” As Wang Fei lay dying in hospital, another location in Wuhan, a 40-minute drive from the Huanan Seafood Market, was already becoming the focus of an altogether different theory. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was now at the centre of a growing storm of conspiracy theories, suspicions and allegations that the virus might have leaked from a lab. They have continued to this day. The WIV’s modernist, grey concrete and glass structure, set in a leafy campus with a small lake, is clearly visible from the adjacent road. When we arrive there, we are quickly surrounded by security guards who tell us it’s a sensitive area and call the police. The institute is the world’s leading authority in the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. Its researchers are led by star scientist Professor Shi Zhengli – known as “Bat Woman” to her colleagues because of her expertise. They have spent years collecting samples from live bats in remote Chinese caves. Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab One recent paper, co-authored by Professor Shi, gives details about hundreds of bat coronaviruses, many of them previously unpublished, unveiling justhow many have been gathered. The research has included the genetic modification of some of these viruses, including the construction of new, chimeric – or hybrid – viruses, in order to examine their potential to infect humans and, potentially, cause pandemics. It was Professor Shi who discovered and sequenced the genetic code of the nearest known relative of theSars CoV-1 virus, found inside a bat from a cave in China's Yunnan Province. Ever since the Sars CoV-1 outbreak, the fear of an even deadlier, more infectious spillover event has been the driving force behind Wuhan's coronavirus research. On 2 January, just three days after becoming aware of the new virus circulating in Wuhan, she also became the first tosequence Sars-Cov-2. Ironically, it is the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2 that has itself helped fuel the lab-leak theory. Some subsequent studies, includingone by Prof Shi, suggest that there is something different about its genome compared to other known coronaviruses of a similar type. Its spike proteins – the pointy bits of the “crown” that latch onto the cells of an infected host – seem to bind extremely well to human cells. While most viruses need time to adapt to a new host, Sars-CoV-2 appears to have been highly infectious from the beginning of the outbreak. One papercompared the new outbreak with the original Sars epidemic. It found that Sars-CoV-2 was already “pre-adapted” for human infection. The virus’ spike proteins also have a feature, unusual in Sars-type coronaviruses, known as a “furin cleavage site”. These arethought likelyto increase the efficiency with which the virus can penetrate the human cells, take them over and replicate inside them. It is this combination of factors – the WIV’s proximity to the outbreak, the kind of scientific work it was involved in, and the seemingly unusual nature of the virus itself – that have led to the highly controversial alternative to the natural “spillover” theory. Claims that the virus leaked from a lab first began to circulate on the Chinese internet in early February. There were unsubstantiated rumours the coronavirus may have passed from a lab-infected animal tothe local community, or that one of the WIV researchers may have themselvesbecome accidentally infected,  either with a natural virus collected from the wild, or a lab-made one. Conspiracy theories soon spread further afield, including claims in some foreign newspapers and websites that the virus may have beenan engineered “bio-weapon”. But none of the lab leak theories – animal virus, man-made virus, deliberate or accidental – have been backed up with any concrete proof, relying instead on conjecture and circumstantial evidence. A group of Indian researchers were some of the first to use the virus’ genome to hint at the possibility ofgenetic modification in a lab. But the paper was quicklydebunked and was withdrawn. However unusual the virus appeared to be, there was nothing to prove that its notable features could not have come directly from nature. In early February, Shi Zhengli herself took to social media in response. “I, Shi Zhengli, swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she wrote, adding that those who spread rumours should“shut their stinking mouths”. Meanwhile, Mr Wang was succumbing to some of the same notable qualities of the virus on which such theories were partly based. It was a pattern of decline now all too familiar to medics everywhere. His lungs were being ravaged by the pathogen, filling with fluid and white blood cells, and the oxygen in his blood was plummeting. “My heartbeat rate is 160 per min. My blood oxygen saturation is only 70. It’s killing me,” he texted his sister. The following day, on 8 February, he sent one last message. “Please save me,” it read, “I can see stars.” He died a few hours later.  On 30 April, the US president waded into the controversy. He was asked by a reporter: “Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?” “Yes, I have. Yes, I have,”Donald Trump replied. Other administration officials have weighed in, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blaming what he claimed was China’s“history of running sub-standard laboratories”. But despite the US saying to have “enormous evidence” for a lab leak, none has been provided. With the theory now central to an escalating geopolitical dispute between the US and China, critics of President Trump’s handling of the response at home see it as a sensationalist smokescreen todeflect domestic blame. Mindful that they could be drawn into a quagmire of conspiracy and propaganda, some scientists, however, believe that the lab leak question should not be dismissed out-of-hand. It relates, they say, to one of the major scientific debates of our time and it has implications not just for China but for the US government too. The work of the WIV, in collecting large numbers of bat coronaviruses and experimenting on them, has not been a lone venture. It has been part of a majorinternational effortfocused on the growing risk of spillover events and the threat of new, human pandemics. Some of Wuhan’s research has involved collaborations withUS scientistsand the backing of generous amounts ofUS funding. And its creation of chimeric viruses - the stitching together of parts of the genomes of different viruses to make new ones - uses an easily accessible technique commonplace in labs around the world. Such research has  been the subject of an intense disagreement between scientists about the benefits andrisks of such research. Supporters say it can help us to anticipate how viruses might emerge in the wild and has the potential to help with the development of medicines and vaccines. Those against, say it risks doing the exact opposite. Manipulating viruses – to make them more infectious or more deadly – could, they say, spark off a man-made pandemic with a lab-made virus. The risks might include lab workers becoming infected – perhaps unknowingly – when collecting virus samples from animals in the field, when handling animals kept in the lab, or when experimenting with live viruses. Since the Sars CoV-1 coronavirus outbreak, for example, there have been four separate leaks from labs studying that disease. Two of the incidents were at the National Institute of Virology inBeijing in 2004. During one of them, a researcher caught Sars after spending two weeks at the lab. She went on to infect her mother, who died, as well as a nurse, who in turn infected several other people. The coincidence of a new pandemic coronavirus appearing in the same city as a laboratory devoted to studying them is something that Prof Shi Zhengli appeared to initially acknowledge. When she learned of the outbreak at the end of December, her thoughts turned to the viruses stored in the institute's freezers. In an interview with Scientific American, she says she remembers thinking that if coronaviruses had sparked the pandemic:“Could they have come from our lab?” While the lab leak theory has smouldered away both online and in Washington political circles, it has largely beendismissed by scientists. It is a scientific consensus that has, in turn, fed into mainstream media coverage, with now wide acceptance that a natural, spillover event is the most probablecause of Sars-CoV-2. The dismissal is based not just on the fact that such spillovers have happened before, but on a key piece of evidence that has come from Prof Shi Zhengli herself. Concerned to rule out her lab’s involvement in the outbreak, according to the Scientific American interview, she began “frantically” searching the experimental records and samples already stored in her lab. HerFebruary paperreported what she said was the closest match she was able to find. A virus, which she named RaTG13, collected from a bat in 2013, showed a 96.2% similarity to Sars-CoV-2. Although that sounds close, the 3.8% genetic difference between the two would, estimates suggest, take decades of evolutionary change tooccur in nature. If Sars-CoV-2 had leaked from her collection of coronaviruses, the lab would have contained either Sars-CoV-2 itself, or something much, much closer related. “That really took a load off my mind,” Prof Shi told Scientific American. “I had not slept a wink for days.” But the evidence that has undoubtedly had the most bearing on the discussion about a possible lab leak was contained in a paper published in March in the medical journal,Nature Medicine. It has become widely accepted as proof that the virus was not made in a lab. The unusual features of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein discussed earlier – its high binding affinity to human cells and its furin cleavage site – must have, the authors argue, come from nature. Their evidence is partly based on the use of sophisticated computer modelling. If a scientist had used such models in advance, they argue, to analyse how strongly the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein might bind to human cells, the results would predict a far weaker bond than actually turns out to be the case. In other words, a computer would be unable to foresee the binding strength of the virus. Therefore, they argue, no scientist is likely to have set out to create it in a lab. Furthermore, they imply, to create Sars-CoV-2 in a lab, you’d need to start with a virus with a much closer genetic match than RaTG13, the distant ancestor found in the Wuhan freezer. A new virus cannot be made from a virus that does not exist. Far more likely, they say, that the virus picked up its notable features while circulating, undetected, in humans or animals for months or years before the outbreak. “We very carefully considered a potential link to the lab - we did not dismiss this possibility out of hand,” the paper’s lead author Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US tells me. “And it is clear - all the available data is fully consistent with a natural history of Sars-CoV-2. There is no scientific data showing any link to the lab. “Most theories considering a link to the lab are conspiracy theories,” he adds. “They are exceptionally disruptive to the efforts of getting Covid-19 under control and result in unnecessary human suffering.” Despite the wide acceptance of the conclusions reached by the Nature Medicine Paper, there are stillsome scientistswho refuse to see it as conclusive proof that the virus wasn’t manipulated in some way. Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide and Chairman and Research Director of Vaxine, a company leading Australia's search for a Covid-19 vaccine, believes that laboratory manipulation has to remain under consideration for being behind a possible explanation for Sars-CoV-2’s“surprising”ability to bind to human cells. And he rejects the argument that if it wasn’t pre-planned by a computer model, it didn’t happen. “In science a lot of things are done on the basis of give-it-a-go, and a lot of things happen completely by accident,” he tells me. “You know, a lot of Nobel prizes have been won on the basis of accidents.” Others referto Wuhan’spast experimentsin which genome segments from different viruses have been stitched together to investigate how spike proteins bind to human cells. And they point out that there is no way of knowing whether or not Wuhan does in fact have, among the hundreds of coronaviruses it has collected, anything closer in genetic make-up to Sars-CoV-2 than RaTG13. What’s more, RaTG13 is itself the subject of some speculation. The BBC has had it confirmed, from the researchers running a respectedChinese database, that it is the same virus as one that the WIV previously referred to as RaBatCov/4991inthis paper. There is no explanation for the change of name, but that 2016 paper makes it clear that the virus appears to be a new strain of Sars-type coronavirus. Professor Petrovsky says it would be odd if the WIV, given its interest in such viruses, hadn’t continued to work on it. But there is no more mention of it at all until this year, when RaBatCov/4991 re-emerged under its new name RaTG13 as the closest known relative of Sars-CoV-2. Professor Richard Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University in the US, says there is only one way to conclusively rule out any form of a lab leak. “A credible investigation would need unrestricted access by investigators to facilities, samples, records, and personnel, as well as unrestricted environmental sampling of facilities and serological sampling of personnel,” he tells me. The US government said in a statement in April that the intelligence community does not believe the virus was modified or created, but the government continues “to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of anaccident at a laboratory in Wuhan”. We put in a request to speak to Professor Shi Zhengli but it was turned down. We sent questions to the WIV asking whether any investigation had been carried out and, if not, whether they’d be willing to allow one. Again, there was no response. Wuhan’s lockdown lasted 76 days. Afraid that she might be infected, Ms Wang was too worried to join her mother at home, so stuck it out in the office, surviving on simple meals. She was joined by her brother’s 13-year-old daughter, while his widow, also infected with coronavirus, recovered in hospital. “I kept writing down memories of my brother,” Ms Wang tells me, “and then posted them on social media in order to ease my empty feelings and hopelessness.” After the lockdown was lifted on 8 April she emerged into a city that had, through an extraordinary collective effort and the forced ordeal of lockdown, vanquished the virus. Today, Wuhan is returning to life. But the signs of the lingering economic impact can still be seen. In one of the usually vibrant night-markets people are eating and socialising again, but many of the tables are empty. “Customer numbers are down by two-thirds,” one woman selling boiled frogs tells me. There are signs of something else here too. Early in the lockdown, in the chaos and confusion of that moment, the censorship controls appeared to briefly vanish. People vented their anger on social media about the perceived official failings, and their grief, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang. Today though, a different narrative has taken hold. “China united together to prevent the epidemic,” says another trader, selling yellow-croaker fish on sticks. “But you foreigners don’t know how to protect yourselves.” And the market customers appear to have absorbed yet another origin theory which has been promoted by Chinese state media andsome senior officials. “I think the virus came from the US,” one woman tells me. “In the early stage of the outbreak, US soldiers were visiting Wuhan. They left early in a chartered plane.” In the absence of independent evidence, politics and propaganda are filling the vacuum with both the US and China continuing to trade unsubstantiated allegations. And without it, it is impossible to answer the big questions. How might a spillover event be better contained next time? And how do we properly balance the benefits of the study of pandemic viruses, in a growing number ofvirology labs, against the risks? Scientists who support such work are convinced that Sars-CoV-2 is an incentive to redouble their efforts. “The mission must go on,” Professor Shi Zhengli says, with a plan to sample bat viruses on a much bigger scale. Something Professor Richard Ebright, from Rutgers, calls the“definition of insanity”. China has, under some diplomatic pressure, agreed to anindependent investigationinto the international response to the virus, although it is unclear what the remit will be, who will take part, and when it might happen. President Xi Jinping has stressed that it will have to wait until thepandemic is over. Meanwhile Ms Wang says she intends to continue to fight for answers about her brother’s death. She insists the warnings from the police to keep quiet won’t stop her. “I’m a law abiding citizen,” she says. She does not want us to publish her full name simply to minimise the risk of online abuse, not because she is trying to hide from the authorities. Sometimes it is in the individual stories that the true, global impact of the virus really hits home. Four months after Wang Fei died, Ms Wang has only just told her mother what really happened. The family, fearing she would be unable to bear the news, allowed her to believe her son was still in quarantine. In the end, they could hide it no longer. “For several days my mum couldn’t fall asleep,” Ms Wang tells me. “A woman born before the founding of our country can’t understand why such a tragedy can happen in modern times.”   ",Positive,0.81868154
"Mr Trudeau has pledged to compensate victims Canada says it will appeal against a court order to pay billions of dollars to compensate indigenous children who went through the child welfare system. Last month, a top court upheld a 2016 ruling that the government underfunded First Nations services compared with those for non-indigenous children. It ordered C$40,000 ($31,350; Â£23,340) payouts to each child who was in the on-reserve welfare system after 2006. The case has been a source of tension between campaigners and the government. The government has said it is not opposed to compensation, but that it had issues over the order's jurisdiction and how the money was to be divided.
