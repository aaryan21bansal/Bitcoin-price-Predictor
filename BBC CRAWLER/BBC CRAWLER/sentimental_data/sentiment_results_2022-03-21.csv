"Shelling by Russian forces has prevented civilians from being able to evacuate the besieged port city There seems to be no let-up to the horrors facing the southern city of Mariupol. Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin hasaccused Russian forces of trying to starve the besieged port into submission. Around 300,000 people are believed to be trapped there with supplies running out and aid blocked from entering. Residents have endured weeks of Russian bombardment with no power or running water. But Mr Gurin said there was no question of Mariupol surrendering, and a Monday morning deadline set by the Russians for the city to lay down its arms came and went. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner givesfour reasons why taking Mariupol is so important for Russia.

Witnesses says the blast at the shopping centre shook the whole city. Firefighters were seen trying to rescue people stranded beneath the rubble. The Retroville mall was opened just before the Covid-19 pandemic and boasted 250 shops, a multiplex cinema and a 3,000-space car park. Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko announced a curfew in the city from 2000 local time on Monday to 0700 local time on Wednesday. The city of Kherson has been under Russian control since the beginning of March. It is the largest city to be occupied by the invading forces since the offensive began. But it has seen daily anti-Russian protests by local residents, and media reports on Monday said several people had been injured after troops opened fire to disperse protesters. Footage shared on social media, verified by the BBC, also showed explosions which were reported to be stun grenades. This video can not be played WATCH: Russian forces open fire on protesters in the city of Kherson Dmytro Kotenko died near the southern city of Kherson and was buried in Lviv, safe for now from falling bombs The BBC's Joel Gunter uncoveredthe story of a young Ukrainian soldier killedin the early days of the invasion. Dmytro Kotenko, 21, was buried hundreds of miles from his family, who are stuck in the northern city of Sumy, cut off from the outside world. Kotenko's childhood friend Vadym Yarovenko was the one who broke the news to Kotenko's parents - it took him all night to work up the courage to make the call to tell them he had died. When he tried to call later about the funeral, the aerial bombardment of Sumy had worsened and the line would not connect. He kept trying but the line stayed dead. The sole mourner at his funeral, Yarovenko said it was the saddest thing he had ever experienced. ""I watched my friend being buried far from his home,"" he said. He hopes he can speak to Kotenko's parents again. And he says his will carry the memory of his friend as he waits for his own turn to fight on the frontline. Russia's stock market has partially resumed tradingafter a nearly month-long suspension because of the war. Only bonds issued by the Russian government can be traded as part of a phased re-opening of the market. Andrei Braginsky, a spokesman for the Moscow Exchange, said he hoped that trading in stocks would be able to start again soon. The invasion and sanctions imposed by Western governments are taking a toll on the Russian economy. Some supermarkets are rationing sales of basic goods such as salt and cooking oil. Reports from across the country suggest sugar and other staples are being restricted. However, deputy industry and trade minister Viktor Yevtukhov insists ""there is no problem with sugar"". Boris Romantschenko survived detention in four separate concentration camps between 1942 and 1945 Boris Romantschenko survived the Nazi Holocaust, spending time in Buchenwald and several other camps. But at the age of 96 he was killed by Russian shelling of his apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday. The Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, of which he was vice-president, announced the death on Monday, saying it was ""deeply disturbed"" by Mr Romantschenko's death. It said he had ""worked intensely on the memory of Nazi crimes"". ""We mourn the loss of a close friend. We wish his son and granddaughter, who brought us the sad news, a lot of strength in these difficult times,"" the foundation's statement added. Russian forces have been relentlessly shelling Kharkiv, which lies just 30 miles (50km) from the border, for over three weeks.

"People can no longer buy free-range eggs in the UK due to the length of time hens have been kept indoors following outbreaks of bird flu. The eggs in shops will be labelled as ""barn eggs"" due to birds being kept inside for more than 16 weeks. The country is experiencing its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza and measures are in place to prevent the virus from spreading. About 55% of all eggs produced in the UK are free-range, says the RSPCA. It means they come from birds that, during the daytime, enjoy unlimited access to outdoor pastures. Signs will be put in supermarkets to inform shoppers of the change from Monday, and free-range labelling will only return when hens are permitted to go outside again. Human case of bird flu detected in the UK Birds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian flu Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser at the National Farmers' Union, said the government's advice was that there was ""still a high level of risk"" to birds of catching flu. ""This is an incredibly difficult time for all bird owners and vigilance remains vital,"" she added. Ms Mahony said farmers were following ""stringent biosecurity measures"" and adapting hen houses to make birds more comfortable. Avian flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird, whether it is dead or alive Both ""barn"" and ""free range"" eggs meet the RSPCA's welfare standards, because the hens that lay them have freedom and space to move around, along with perches for roosting and nest boxes. The difference is that for barn hens, this all happens inside, whereas free-range hens can access to the outside through ""popholes"" - although bird flu restrictions have put a stop to this. The RSPCA says consumers buy more boxes of free range and barn eggs than those from caged hens. However, the charity says a large proportion of eggs used as ingredients in products like mayonnaise, cakes and sandwiches are still from hens kept in cages. It says such cages provide less than the size of an A4 piece of paper of space per bird and have limited facilities for perching, nesting and scratching and do not meet its welfare standards. The charity says about 35% of egg-laying hens are still kept in cages. Case numbers of the H5N1 strain of bird flu began rising in November last year. The virus - which is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks - was first discovered in North Yorkshire. It poses an extremely low risk to humans, according to the NHS, although several people have been infected around the world and a number have died. The outbreaks have resulted in the government enforcing an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone which made it a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK - whether they have pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard flock - to keep them indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures. Under such restrictions egg farmers have a 16-week ""grace period"" to maintain their free-range status, but this ended on Monday. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, assistant director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said shops and supermarkets would ""continue to support British farmers"". In a statement the government said it would work with farmers and retailers to implement the branding changings. A spokesman added: ""We are experiencing our largest ever outbreak of avian flu and housing measures remain in force to protect poultry and other birds from this highly infectious and unpleasant disease.""

"The UN Secretary General says the rush to use fossil fuels because of the war in Ukraine is ""madness"" and threatens global climate targets. The invasion of Ukraine has seen rapid rises in the prices of coal, oil and gas as countries scramble to replace Russian sources. But Antonio Guterres warns that these short-term measures might ""close the window"" on the Paris climate goals. He also calls on countries, including China, to fully phase out coal by 2040. UN climate panel to examine carbon removal EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas Can the energy crisis help the climate? In his first major speech on climate and energy since COP26, Mr Guterres makes no bones about the fact that the limited progress achieved in Glasgow is insufficient to ward off dangerous climate change. Mr Guterres says that the rush to find alternatives to Russian fuels is a threat to climate goals Scientists believe that keeping the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century is crucial to limiting the scale of damage from global warming. To keep that threshold alive, carbon output needs to be cut in half by the end of this decade.  Instead, as Mr Guterres points out, emissions are set to rise by 14%. ""The problem was not solved in Glasgow,"" Mr Guterres says, in a speech delivered at the Economist Sustainability Summit. ""In fact, the problem is getting worse."" The war in Ukraine threatens to make that situation even more problematic, he says. A really simple guide to climate change Europe and the UK and other countries are looking to cut their reliance on Russian oil and gas this year. Many areturning to coal,externalor imports ofliquefied natural gas,externalas alternative sources. But Mr Guterres warns this short-term approach heralds great danger for the climate. ""Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use,"" Mr Guterres said. Mining for coal may get a boost in the short term as countries seek alternative energy sources ""This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction."" Countries must ""accelerate the phase out of coal and all fossil fuels,"" and implement a rapid and sustainable energy transition. It is ""the only true pathway to energy security."" Mr Guterres says the solutions to the climate crisis mostly lie in the hands of the G20 group of richest nations, which produce around 80% of global emissions. While many of these countries have taken great steps to slash emissions by 2030, there are a ""handful of holdouts, such as Australia."" Coal must be banished, Mr Guterres says, with a full phase-out for richer nations by 2030, and 2040 for all others, including China. Coal ""is a stupid investment,"" according to the Secretary General, ""leading to billions in stranded assets."" Europe relies heavily on Russia for natural gas supplies and is seeking replacements He says the way forward is to build coalitions to help major emerging economies to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. He highlights the case of South Africa. During COP26 several countries including the UK, US and othersagreed to an $8.5bn financing programmeto end South Africa's reliance on coal. Mr Guterres says the pieces are coming together for similar coalitions in Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere. Money is one of the key problems in addressing the climate issue and Mr Guterres has called for a major ramping up in finance to help countries adapt to rising temperatures. He points out that right now, one person in three globally is not covered by early warning systems for disasters - in Africa six in ten people are not protected. In 2022, he argues, richer countries must finally make good on theirwell-worn promise to provide a $100bn a yearto the developing world. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"Many English councils have already said they intend to end their deals with the Russian energy giant The UK arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed into administration in the coming days, the BBC understands. Bloomberg,externalreported the government is preparing to step in and temporarily run Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd, which supplies thousands of organisations across the UK. Its clients include McDonald's, Siemens, hospitals and councils. It is understood the government is looking at all options and monitoring the situation closely. One possibility could be to put the company into special administration, where it is temporarily run on behalf of the government. Last November, the UK energy companyBulb was placed into special administration, with Â£1.7bn in government funds set aside to keep it trading. The company's UK retail operation does not sell gas from its parent company in Russia, but a number of companies and councils are thought to be trying to end their contracts with the company in protest at Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Gazprom itself has also been sanctioned by the UK government. English councils seek exit from Gazprom deals Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Shell to sell Russian investments due to Ukraine conflict Earlier this month, a number of councils in England told the BBC they were looking to end their Gazprom contracts as soon as possible. According to the public services data firm Tussell, UK public sector contracts amounted to Â£107m in total between 2016 and 2021. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also urged NHS trusts to stop using energy supplied by Gazprom. A government spokesperson would not be drawn on its plans for Gazprom's UK unit but said the UK ""was in no way"" dependent on Russian gas. ""Our highly diverse sources of gas supply and a diverse electricity mix ensures that households, businesses, and heavy industry get the energy they need,"" they said. ""We are aware that Gazprom Energy has a large presence in the non-domestic energy retail market. ""Gazprom's retail business continues to trade in the UK and customers should exercise their own commercial judgement with regards to energy supply contracts they have in place at the moment."" Gazprom has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for McDonald's said it was trying to exit its deal ""at the earliest opportunity"" while Siemens UK said it was looking at the terms of cancelling supply contracts with Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail. ""We support the severe and broad sanctions applied by western governments and are ensuring that we act in compliance with them,"" it said. How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

"Mariupol has become the most heavily bombed and damaged city in Ukraine's war with Russia - having suffered the brunt of sustained Russian attacks. It is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. But why? There are four main reasons why taking the port city would be such a strategic win for Russia - and a major blow for Ukraine. Geographically, the city of Mariupol occupies only a tiny area on the map but it now stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. General Sir Richard Barrons - former commander of UK Joint Forces Command - says capturing Mariupol is vital to Russia's war effort. ""When the Russians feel they have successfully concluded that battle, they will have completed a land bridge from Russia to Crimea and they will see this as a major strategic success."" If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline - cutting-off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. By holding out against advancing forces for the past three weeks, the defending Ukrainians have managed to preoccupy a large number of Russian troops. But that failure by Russia to secure a rapid capture of the city, has prompted Russian commanders to resort to a 21st Century version of mediaeval siege tactics. They have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying over 90% of the city. They have also cut off access to electricity, heating, fresh water, food and medical supplies - creating a man-made humanitarian catastrophe which Moscow now blames on Ukraine for refusing to surrender by an 05:00 deadline on Monday. A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of ""trying to starve Mariupol into surrender"". Ukraine has vowed to defend the city down to the last soldier. It may well come to that. Russian troops are slowly pushing into the centre and, in the absence of any kind of workable peace deal, Russia is now likely to intensify its bombardment - drawing little if any distinction between its armed defenders and the beleaguered civilian population which still numbers over 200,000. If, and when, Russia takes full control of Mariupol this will free up close to 6,000 of its troops - organised into 1,000-strong battalion tactical groups - to then go and reinforce other Russian fronts around Ukraine. There are a number of possibilities as to where they could be redeployed: to the north-east to join the battle to encircle and destroy Ukraine's regular armed forces fighting pro-Kremlin separatists in the Donbas region to the west to push towards Odesa, which would be Ukraine's last remaining major outlet to the Black Sea to the north-west towards the city of Dnipro Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion Mariupol has long-been a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea. With its deep berths, it is the biggest port in the Azov Sea region and home to a major iron and steel works. In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Ukrainian concrete defences on a beach by Mariupol port, 17 February For eight years now, since Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the city has been sandwiched uncomfortably between Russian forces on that peninsula and the pro-Kremlin separatists in the breakaway self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, named after the Sea of Azov which links Mariupol to the rest of the Black Sea. The Azov Brigade contains far-right extremists, historically including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has been a useful propaganda tool for Moscow, giving it a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Azov Battalion training camp at a former holiday resort near Mariupol, February 2019 If Russia manages to capture alive significant numbers of Azov Brigade fighters it is likely they will be paraded on Russian state-controlled media as part of the ongoing information war to discredit Ukraine and its government. The capture of Mariupol by Russia, if it happens, will be psychologically significant for both sides in this war. A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. For President Putin, for whom this war appears to be personal, there is a historical significance to all this. He sees Ukraine's Black Sea coastline as belonging to something called Novorossiya (New Russia) - Russian lands that date back to the 18th Century empire. Putin wants to revive that concept, ""rescuing Russians from the tyranny of a pro-western government in Kyiv"" as he sees it. Mariupol currently stands in the way of him achieving that aim. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow - not just militarily and economically - but also to the minds of the men and women fighting on the ground, defending their country. Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to the Russians after Kherson, a strategically much less important city that was barely defended. There is another morale aspect here and that is of deterrence. Digging graves by the roadside in Mariupol, 20 March Mariupol has put up fierce resistance - but look at the cost. The city is decimated, it lies largely in ruins. It will go down in history alongside Grozny and Aleppo, places that Russia eventually bombed and shelled into submission, reducing them to rubble. The message to other Ukrainian cities is stark - if you choose to resist like Mariupol did then you can expect the same fate. ""The Russians couldn't walk into Mariupol,"" says Gen Sir Richard Barrons, ""they couldn't drive in with their tanks, so they've pounded it to rubble. And that's what we should expect to see anywhere else that really matters to them.""

"State television showed rescuers racing to the crash site A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Flight tracking data suggested the plane lost height rapidly from its cruising altitude before plummeting to the ground. More than 600 emergency responders are said to be at the crash site. Firefighters reached the scene first and managed to extinguish a blaze in the hills caused by the crash. Footage taken by local villagers and shared on Chinese social media - and by state broadcasters - showed fire and smoke from the crash, with plane debris on the ground. Allow Twitter content?

Air safety and aviation standards in China have improved vastly in recent decades, following a series of accidents in the 1990s, and crashes such as this are now very rare.

Earlier, it greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and also changed its website to black and white in an apparent sign of mourning. As a precaution, China Eastern's entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets has been grounded. It took just two and a half minutes for an apparently normal flight to turn into a tragedy. The aircraft was a 737-800, a well-proven design first produced in the late 1990s. It is a workhorse of the aviation world, with thousands still in service. It has a strong safety record.

"State television showed rescuers racing to the crash site A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s.

"Shelling by Russian forces has prevented civilians from being able to evacuate the besieged port city A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of trying to starve the besieged port city of Mariupol into surrendering. Dmytro Gurin was speaking soon after Ukraine rejected a Russian deadline demanding Mariupol's defenders lay down their arms in exchange for safe passage out of the city. Mariupol is a key strategic target for the Russian military. Around 300,000 people are believed to be trapped there with supplies running out and aid blocked from entering. Residents have endured weeks of Russian bombardment with no power or running water. Mr Gurin said there was no question of Mariupol surrendering. ""Russians don't open humanitarian corridors, they don't let humanitarian convoys enter the city and we clearly see now that the goal of the Russians is to start to [create] hunger [in the city] to enforce their position in the diplomatic process,"" he said. ""If the city does not surrender, and the city will not surrender, they won't let people out. They won't let humanitarian convoys into the city."" Under the proposal, which Ukraine had until 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) to accept, Russian troops would have opened safe corridors out of Mariupol from 10:00 Moscow time, initially for Ukrainian troops and ""foreign mercenaries"" to disarm and leave the city. After two hours, Russian forces say they would then have allowed humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and other supplies to enter the city safely, once the de-mining of the roads was complete. But the deadline came and went. Should Russia capture Mariupol, it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. So far though, Mariupol's defenders have stood firm. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby,external ANALYSIS:Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wanted BATTLEFIELD:What have been Russia's military mistakes? WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the war,external There are mounting concerns about the humanitarian situation, with Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP from Mariupol, calling it ""hell on Earth"". Residents spend most of their time in shelters and basements as Russia continues its unrelenting attack on the city, from land, air and sea, officials say. Pictures show a city in ruins, with entire neighbourhoods devastated. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, estimated that over 80% of residential buildings had either been damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair. Bodies are being left in the streets as it is too dangerous to get them. Mr Gurin said teams were still unable to clean the rubble of a theatre which Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia last Wednesday. Hundreds of people are believed to remain trapped in the basement, which withstood the attack. Moscow denies targeting the building. ""The services cannot clean this rubble because the shelling never stops and bombing never stops. It's really dangerous,"" he said. He could not give an estimate on how many people had managed to flee the area as ""we don't have connection with Mariupol"". Since the war began, authorities say at least 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol although the true figure may be higher. Previous efforts to evacuate Mariupol's civilians have been blocked by Russian fire, although local authorities say that thousands have been able to leave in private vehicles. On Sunday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said 3,985 people had fled from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, adding that on Monday the government plans on sending about 50 buses to pick up further evacuees from the city. President Volodomyr Zelensky has said the Russian siege amounts to a ""war crime"". ""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" he said. ""They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers"".

"Unite workers are on strike in a dispute over pay The Unite union refused requests to exempt special school services from strike action, the Education Authority has claimed. The authority said the union declined requests it made on Wednesday 16 March and Monday 21 March. The Unite union has been contacted by BBC News NI for a response. Members ofUnite are taking action over a local government pay offer of 1.75%, which the union has called a ""real terms pay cut"". Unite is one of the largest public sector unions. The union said its members in councils, the Education Authority and the Housing Executive expressed overwhelming support for the industrial action in ballots. Gareth Scott, from Unite, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster the offer was ""totally inadequate"". ""These local authority workers have seen their pay cut in real terms by 22% in last 12 years,"" he added. ""Over the last two years, during the pandemic, they have been essential workers and now we have the cost of living crisis - the response from employers was to offer a meagre 1.75% increase."" This video can not be played We're not being offered a living wage' When asked if the union had considered making an exception for special schools, he said the problem lay with the employers. ""This could have been avoided by the employers making a fair and reasonable pay offer - something that goes a lot closer to meeting the cost of living,"" he said. ""Our members do not want to be on strike. But they have got to the point where they feel they have no alternative."" Some school transport, meals, council bin collections, leisure services and Housing Executive maintenance will be disrupted by the week-long action by over 2,000 Unite members. Some special schools are expected to be particularly affected by the unavailability of Education Authority transport as they rely heavily on the so-called yellow buses. Some classroom assistants in special schools who are members of Unite may also be on strike. But only one of 39 special schools - Glenveagh in Belfast - has said it cannot offer pupils face-to-face teaching ""due to lack of staffing"". The Education Authority, though, said it had asked on Wednesday 16 March for classroom assistants at Glenveagh to be exempt from the strike. It had also asked for yellow bus drivers in greater Belfast who transport wheelchair-using pupils to be allowed to continue to work. The strikes may cause some disruption to school meals The authority said that on Monday it had gone further and asked Unite to exempt all special school staff and bus drivers from the strike action. The Education Authority's director of human resources Clare Duffield told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra that Unite had been asked to ""protect"" special schools. ""It is very disappointing that children with special educational needs are having their normal routine disrupted,"" she said. ""And it's really disappointing that those requests have been rejected at this stage."" ""We have made the requests on a number of occasions and will continue to escalate those requests so that we can attempt to minimise the disruption throughout the week."" ""We absolutely respect the right of a trade union and their members to take lawful industrial action but it's very disappointing when that impact son the most vulnerable children and young people."" Ms Duffield said that around 100 out of over 2,000 EA bus routes had been affected by strike action on Monday but that pupils from special schools has been most affected.

"This video can not be played P&O Ferries 'ripped up employment rule book' Stena Line will put on two extra ferry services from Scotland to Northern Ireland from tomorrow, the UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. He told the Commons it would be of help to some retailers including Asda and Marks and Spencers. He said the company had already ""stepped up"" following the suspension of P&O routes last week. Up to 50 staff from Northern Ireland will be directly impacted by P&O's move to fire 800 workers last week. Mr Shapps said if it was confirmed that relative notice periods and consultations were not conducted before P&O staff were fired, then it would be a ""a matter for criminal prosecution and unlimited fines"". The Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has accused the firm of ""ripping up the employment rule book"". Mr Lyons said he did not believe P&O had acted within either the ""spirit or letter"" of employment law, a matter devolved to Northern Ireland. Officials are investigating potential remedies for breaches of the law. On Thursday, the companyfired about 800 of its workers, with about a quarter of the staff hearing the news via a pre-recorded video message. A private security firm was sent on board the vessel in Larne, County Antrim, which remains docked at the port, to remove staff. On Monday, P&O said its services, including the crossing from Larne to Cairnryan in Scotland, would be ""unable to run for the next few days"". ""For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves,"" the firm continued. It had been suggested at the time of the workforce announcement thatit could be a weekbefore the ferry service could resume. A protest was held against P&O's decision at the Port of Larne on Friday Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he raised the P&O situation during discussions with his counterparts in Scotland and Wales and the chief secretary to the treasury on Monday. He said there should be support for the workers who needed to be treated ""fairly"". ""We can't just be subject to the whim of company who decide to cut their costs and behave in an appalling manner to do that,"" Mr Murphy added. Allow Twitter content?

""P&O might want to hide behind the small print of maritime law... but the court of public opinion will not be so sympathetic,"" Mr Lyons told assembly members (MLAs) on Monday. ""We must send a strong message to all companies that might think of getting involved in a practice in this way."" On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said P&O's move had been ""awful"" and ""wrong"" and the governmentwould examine the legality of its actions. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Some of the dismissed workers and trade unionsheld a protestat Larne port on Friday. This video can not be played P&O workers 'have been treated appallingly' P&O has said its decision to fire workers was to secure the future viability of the business. It explained that required ""swift and significant changes now"". The company said it would update its Twitter account regularly to inform people of the operational situation. On Monday, Northern Ireland's Consumer Council said that following talks with P&O, travellers affected by the disruption could re-book their crossing with Stena Line andclaim expenses from P&O,external. The council's head of transport, Richard Williams, said people could also claim for additional expenditure, such as some hotel or mileage costs. ""Originally that wasn't going to be the case but they've accepted that because they can't provide the re-rerouting they normally would that people really have to book with Stena,"" he said. Mr Williams said it was common for mechanical issues to cause delays to ferry services but the P&O situation was one that was ""going on and on"". ""It is certainly an unusual situation which is causing real problems for passengers,"" he added. Mr Williams said the biggest issue was the employee situation but he warned the company faced ""financial repercussions"" to resolve customer issues also. Geraldine Sinclair, who was due to travel with P&O on Thursday to a family event in Scotland said she would never use the company again because of how they treated customers and staff, She told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster she needed to re-arrange transport and was told she would receive a refund. ""I don't think much of them but to be honest, it's the staff I feel sorry for. We've all been there with redundancies but certainly not like that,"" she said. Geraldine's husband Jim said he would avoid the company unless there was ""no viable alternative"". P&O has said its decision to fire workers was to secure the future viability of the business.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, husband Richard and daughter Gabriella shared a hug after she landed at RAF Brize Norton A relative of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says news of her return to the UK is ""absolutely mind-blowing"" after six years of being detained in Iran. The 43-year-old and another detainee, Anoosheh Ashoori, weremet at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours. Alex Loftus, cousin of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, said she did not think it had ""sunk in properly yet"". Mrs Loftus, from Warwickshire, added it had been ""so moving"" seeing the images of her being reunited with family. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori, 67, left Tehran on Wednesday after their release was secured following months of negotiations. Alex Loftus said she was ""absolutely over the moon"" after years of campaigning over Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release It marked the end of an ordeal that saw the British-Iranian national detained, after being accused in 2016 of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. She was sentenced to a further year in prison in April last year and a one-year travel ban on charges of propaganda against the government. Both Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori have consistently and vigorously denied allegations. Their release came after the UK settled a debt to Iran of almost Â£400m dating from the 1970s. Mrs Loftus, who lives near Southam, said a couple of years ago Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""made the very brave decision of sending"" her now seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, back home. The girl rushed to hug her mother after she touched down at Brize Norton. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released after the UK settled a near Â£400m debt to Iran Mrs Loftus added: ""She could then start having a normal sort of, well the British life that she was meant to have in the first place and go to school, be with her dad. ""Thankfully we now have Skype... [but] things like... giving Gabriella a kiss goodnight, walking her to school, things like that... she just missed out on."" The cousin said 3.7 million people had signed a Change.org petition and that there had been regular family meetings. ""We've been there so many times, that there's been hope,"" she said. ""I don't think any us were ever going to believe it until actually Naz was on that plane out of Iranian airspace.

"Shelling by Russian forces has prevented civilians from being able to evacuate the besieged port city A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of trying to starve the besieged port city of Mariupol into surrendering. Dmytro Gurin was speaking soon after Ukraine rejected a Russian deadline demanding Mariupol's defenders lay down their arms in exchange for safe passage out of the city. Mariupol is a key strategic target for the Russian military. Around 300,000 people are believed to be trapped there with supplies running out and aid blocked from entering. Residents have endured weeks of Russian bombardment with no power or running water. Mr Gurin said there was no question of Mariupol surrendering. ""Russians don't open humanitarian corridors, they don't let humanitarian convoys enter the city and we clearly see now that the goal of the Russians is to start to [create] hunger [in the city] to enforce their position in the diplomatic process,"" he said. ""If the city does not surrender, and the city will not surrender, they won't let people out. They won't let humanitarian convoys into the city."" Under the proposal, which Ukraine had until 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) to accept, Russian troops would have opened safe corridors out of Mariupol from 10:00 Moscow time, initially for Ukrainian troops and ""foreign mercenaries"" to disarm and leave the city. After two hours, Russian forces say they would then have allowed humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and other supplies to enter the city safely, once the de-mining of the roads was complete. But the deadline came and went. Should Russia capture Mariupol, it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. So far though, Mariupol's defenders have stood firm. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby,external ANALYSIS:Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wanted BATTLEFIELD:What have been Russia's military mistakes? WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the war,external There are mounting concerns about the humanitarian situation, with Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP from Mariupol, calling it ""hell on Earth"". Residents spend most of their time in shelters and basements as Russia continues its unrelenting attack on the city, from land, air and sea, officials say. Pictures show a city in ruins, with entire neighbourhoods devastated. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, estimated that over 80% of residential buildings had either been damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair. Bodies are being left in the streets as it is too dangerous to get them. Mr Gurin said teams were still unable to clean the rubble of a theatre which Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia last Wednesday. Hundreds of people are believed to remain trapped in the basement, which withstood the attack. Moscow denies targeting the building. ""The services cannot clean this rubble because the shelling never stops and bombing never stops. It's really dangerous,"" he said. He could not give an estimate on how many people had managed to flee the area as ""we don't have connection with Mariupol"". Since the war began, authorities say at least 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol although the true figure may be higher. Previous efforts to evacuate Mariupol's civilians have been blocked by Russian fire, although local authorities say that thousands have been able to leave in private vehicles. On Sunday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said 3,985 people had fled from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, adding that on Monday the government plans on sending about 50 buses to pick up further evacuees from the city. President Volodomyr Zelensky has said the Russian siege amounts to a ""war crime"". ""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" he said. ""They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers"".

Russia's alleged use of its hypersonic missile is probably intended to ""detract from a lack of progress"" in its ground campaign, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in a tweet. Over the last several days, Russia has claimed to have fired hypersonic missiles - for the first time ever in combat - at targets in western Ukraine. Russian officials claim the missile - known as the Kinzhal - can hit targets up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away at speeds over 6,000 km/h. The UK's MoD, however, assesses the missiles are unlikely to ""materially affect the outcome"" of Russia's campaign in Ukraine. Read more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels âWe donât want to create a European army,â the EUâs foreign
affairs chief has said. Josep Borrell was speaking after foreign and defence
ministers approved a document known as theStrategic Compass,external. It includes plans to develop âEU Rapid Deployment Capacityâ
that could allow the bloc to âswiftly deploy up to 5,000 troopsâ for different
types of crises. âWeâll conduct live exercises together,â he said, which has never happened before. Borrell emphasised member states have, and will still
have, their own armies but said countries must work more closely together. He added Nato was still ""the cornerstone of the territorial
defence of Europeâ.  White House warns of possible Russian cyber-attacks Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The White House has issued a fresh warning to US businesses of possible
cyber-attacks from Russia. In a statement, President Biden said his administration was reiterating
previous warnings ""based on evolving intelligence that the Russian
Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks"". The White House said it was a ""critical"" moment to boost defences. This is the latest in a series of warnings about possible fall-out in
cyberspace from the conflict. In particular, there have been concerns that Russia might retaliate for
sanctions by hitting back at the US and Western economies through cyber-attacks. So far these attacks have not materialised. But this latest warning does suggest US intelligence has seen some
indications of Russian activity on computer networks that could be the prelude
for some kind of attack â however, they acknowledge that this does not mean that
such an attack will definitely take place. The public warning may be designed to act as a deterrent. US and UK cyber officials have both been briefing executives of major
organisations over a period of months, especially those within critical
infrastructure, to warn them of the risks and encourage them to ensure they
have the best possible defences in place. The UK branch of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed under
administration soon, according to reports. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the UK's government is preparing to
step in and run Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd. The firm's clients include McDonald's and Siemens, as well as councils
and hospitals around the country. It does not, however, sell gas from its
parent company in Russia. The BBC understands that the UK government is looking at a number of
options and monitoring the situation closely. The government, however, has not commented on the possible
administration procedure, with a spokesperson noting only that the UK us in
""no way"" dependent on Russian gas. Earlier in March, several councils in England told the BBC they were
seeking to end their contracts with Gazprom. Both McDonald's and Siemens have
also said they were looking at trying to exit deals or cancelling supply
contracts. Gazprom has yet to comment. Read more here Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The most bombarded city in Ukraineâs war with Russia is key to Moscowâs military campaign. But why? Securing a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas:Mariupol stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Strangling Ukraine's economy:In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Propaganda opportunity:Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, which contains far-right extremists including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has given Moscow a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Major morale boost:A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow. Read Frank Gardner's report in full Wyre DaviesBBC News, Dnipro Olga was forced to flee Mariupol for Dnipro with her family Some of the internal refugees arriving at centres like the one we
visited today in Dnipro will stay here in central Ukraine, perhaps hoping one
day to return to Mariupol. But with much of the city destroyed and as many as 40% of those damaged
structures said to be irreparable, returning any time soon will not be an
option for many. Among those is Olga, who we met while she was picking up food, some
clothes, and bedding. For the time being her immediate family is staying in a
small flat here in the city after a harrowing journey out of Mariupol. ""We were driving out under fire,"" Olga tells me. ""Shells
were exploding. They were bombing us and there were dead bodies everywhere, but
we managed to join the larger convoy and eventually get out."" Olga says sheâd like to return to the broken city she calls home,
especially as she has extended family members still trapped there, unable to
escape. But, Olga told me, she received an ominous warning from a Russian
soldier at one of the last checkpoints out of Mariupol. ""Donât bother
staying in Dnipro,"" the soldier said to her, ""because we'll soon be
attacking that city as well."" This video can not be played Footage has emerged of Russian forces using gunfire to disperse demonstrators in the occupied southern city of Kherson. The footage - which was shared on social media and verified by the BBC - also shows explosions, which were reported to be from stun grenades. Demonstrators were reportedly injured during the incident. Protests have taken place in the city of Kherson since the city fell to Russian forces on 3 March. Read more about the protestshere. We told you earlier about the bombastic warning Russia issued that its relations with the US were near breaking point. It comes days after President Joe Biden called his Russian counterpart ""a war criminal"". Since Biden made the statement on 16 March, the label has been heard more often in connection with Vladimir Putin. Former UK prime ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major have called for the creation of a new international tribunal to investigate Putin and those who helped plan his invasion of Ukraine. And the Pentagon has indicated the US is actively engaged in the investigation of the Russian leader. ""We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are
committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of
evidence of that,"" spokesman John Kirby told a news
briefing. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is spearheading the legal process - after 39 nations called for an inquiry to be opened. Read more about war crimes and whether Putin may be prosecuted Hundreds were sheltering at the Mariupol theatre when missiles destroyed it S-300 anti-aircraft weapons on parade in Kyiv last year Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby says the US is in ""ongoing discussions"" with other countries to provide long-range air defence systems to Ukraine. To date, the US has provided Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. These systems, however, are primarily effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, rather than higher altitude combat aircraft. It has been reported a number of countries - including Slovakia - have expressed a willingness to give Ukraine S-300 anti-aircraft systems, provided they receive something to replace them. Ukraine already uses the S-300 and has personnel trained in its use. While Kirby does not comment directly on Slovakia or the S-300, he says the US is in ""active consultations"" about âthe
kinds of defence capabilities to include long-range air defences, that we know
that theyâre [Ukraine] comfortable using."" Wyre DaviesBBC News, Dnipro Children playing at a makeshift refugee reception centre in Dnipro At what is usually a middle school in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, a makeshift reception centre for refuges of fighting from the east has been set up. Many of the people queueing patiently in the schoolyard are from the besieged city of Mariupol â others have come here from Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. They all have another thing in common â theyâre without possessions. Families crammed into cars, they fled through mined roads and numerous Russian checkpoints to safety and need all the basics to survive; food, clothes, and medicine. All of the things being collected here are donations from residents of Dnipro and local charities. So, while children get hand-me-down toys, their mothers line up for the basics. In the school canteen, volunteers package together food parcels that will feed a family for a couple of days. Among those working here is Vadym, normally a teacher at the school but
now doing his ""civic duty to help other Ukrainians"". The UN says there
are six and a half million displaced people inside Ukraine alone. This city and
this community are doing their part to make that transition less traumatic. Women putting together food parcels for refugees If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's a short summary of
what's been happening in the war in Ukraine: Russia's foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador John Sullivan in to protest about recent statements by President Biden, who labelled President Putin a ""war criminal"" over the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement, the ministry said the comments were unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank and pushed Russian-American relations to breaking point. Hostile actions taken against Russia would receive a ""decisive and firm response,"" it warned. The State Department confirmed that the meeting between Sullivan and Russian officials took place, adding that Sullivan demanded that US citizens in custody be given access to consular services. The department says that one US citizen, basketball player Brittany Griner, has still not been given access to consular services after being detained for possession of vape cartridges last month. Speaking to reporters on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it is ""awfully rich"" for Russia to ""speak about 'inappropriate comments' when that same country is engaged in mass slaughter"". Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels The EUâs foreign affairs chief has suggested there wonât be a further package of EU sanctions against Russia adopted this week. Josep Borrell was speaking at a press conference, following meetings of the blocâs foreign and defence ministers in Brussels. âFormal adoption of sanctions requires procedure and I donât think during this week it will be formal adoption of sanctions, according with our procedures.â But he said when EU leaders meet later this week, for a summit in Brussels, theyâll likely consider âwhat else can be done"". He said the issue of energy had been raised by some ministers - but today wasnât a day for such decisions, rather one for âanalysingâ possible future actions. Borrell said there needs to be an âeffective response which wonât lead to an unbearable cost for member states"". Five cases of Russian forces detaining local officials have been recorded in the northern city of Chernihiv, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency is reporting. Quoting the Ukrainian parliament website, it says Russian forces have detained the heads of two villages and a local councillor, while two local government officials have also been abducted. Meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine, Russians have abducted the head of a village in Kharkiv, according to UNIAN news agency. The Russian newspaper KP said the lines appeared as a result of a hack We reported earlier that our colleagues at BBC Russian had compiled a list of 557 confirmed Russian military deaths in the Ukraine invasion, mentioning that Russia's defence ministry has so far only once provided fatality figures - 498 deaths as of 2 March. All that suddenly changed in the last few hours, or so it seemed... The staunchly pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) published an article quoting the ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen had died, a figure which exceeds even US intelligence estimates of Russian fatalities. It gave the number of wounded as 16,153. Minutes later, this part of the article disappeared from the page, but we were able to take screen grabs of the relevant paragraphs. KP editor Vladimir Sungorkin subsequently told the BBC the information had been the result of a hack, and said the paper will post an explanation later.  Joe Biden at the White House on Sunday US President Joe Biden has held a phone call with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, the White House has announced. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the call, as was Italian PM Mario Draghi, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. In a statement, the White House said that the leaders ""discussed their serious concerns about Russiaâs
brutal tactics in Ukraine, including its attacks on civilians"". ""They underscored
their continued support for Ukraine, including by providing
security assistance to the brave Ukrainians who are defending their country
from Russian aggression, and humanitarian assistance to the millions of
Ukrainians who have fled the violence,"" the statement added. Biden is scheduled to travel to Europe later this week for meetings with Nato, EU, and G7 allies in Brussels, followed by a bilateral meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Friday. Pavel has been taking pictures in bomb shelters Pavel Gomzyakov usually photographs the happiest days of peopleâs lives. He is an award-winning wedding photographer from Mariupol, southern Ukraine. But, recently, he has been documenting life in the city as it has come under heavy Russian attack. âBefore the start of the war, Mariupol was a peaceful Ukrainian city, a city in which 95% of people were Russian speaking, like me. My daughter used to study at a Russian school,â he tells BBC Panorama. At the end of last week, he escaped, along with his wife and nine-year-old son. His elderly parents stayed behind and he hasnât been able to contact them for days, as electricity has been cut. He is now trying work out how he can unite with his eldest daughter, 17, who is alone in Germany. She was in the north-eastern Ukrainian city Kharkiv at ballet school when the war started. Pavel says it is if they have all woken up to a new, terrible reality. More on PanoramaUkraine's Resistance: Standing Up to Putinon BBC One at 20:00 GMT A satellite photo shows the disputed Kuril islands (Hokkaido is bottom left) Russia says it is abandoning talks with Japan aimed at signing a formal peace treaty, because Japan has joined in sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. They did not formally end World War Two hostilities because of a dispute over small islands known in Russia as the Southern Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories. They lie just off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and were occupied by Soviet forces in 1945. Russia's foreign ministry says its move freezes discussions on joint economic projects for the islands and halts visa-free visits to them by Japanese citizens. ""All responsibility for the harm to bilateral co-operation and to the interests of Japan itself lies with official Tokyo, which deliberately chose to pursue an anti-Russian course,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak has told the BBC his country's resilience has made Russia ""more adequately assess the reality"" of how its invasion is progressing - leading, he says, to a change in the talks between the two countries. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, several rounds of negotiations have taken place between delegates from Kyiv and Moscow but it's been hard to gauge the progress so far.

"It is almost six years since Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained by the Iranian authorities in April 2016. Since then there were repeated attempts to secure her release - all failed. So why has she now come home? The basic answer is London-Tehran relations are better than they have been. The International Revolutionary Guard and Iran's judiciary no longer feel they need Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for leverage in relations with the UK. Nazanin arrives in UK after being freed from Iran She was a diplomatic pawn held hostage by the Iranian authorities to put pressure on London. If Tehran wanted to make nice, they would treat her well, give her access to medical help, perhaps increase the frequency of visits, possibly even allow her a temporary furlough from jail. If Tehran wanted to exert pressure on London, then her conditions might worsen and privileges might be withdrawn. The UK paying the historic Â£400m debt for tanks sold but not delivered will have made a huge difference. For years, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) claimed the two issues were not connected. But in practice, the Iranians made them one and the same issue. Some in the FCDO had wanted to pay the debt but were prevented initially by reluctance within the Treasury and the United States, fearing it would reward hostage-taking and even fund terrorism. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on way home to UK Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals How is tank debt linked to Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe? There were also fears the US would penalise any British financial institution that paid the money to the Iranian defence ministry in breach of international sanctions. There is also the sheer relentlessness of the families' campaigning and the UK's diplomacy. At first there were mistakes, such as Boris Johnson's false claim that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran, a claim that prompted Iran to level fresh charges. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (right), pictured with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, who is now seven, was first detained by Iranian authorities in April 2016. But the tireless campaigning by Nazanin's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and others kept up the pressure on the UK government. And that was reflected by the work of British diplomats behind the scenes, refusing to let Iran forget about the case. There was almost a deal to release the detainees last year. It fell through. But since then British diplomats have visited Iran several times to try to reach a fresh agreement. Iranian officials at their Ministry of Foreign Affairs were frequently frustrated that this dispute got in the way of the rest of the UK-Iran relationship. Mr Ratcliffe campaigned for his wife's release, including by going on hunger strike outside the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office last October. But the Iranian diplomats were not in charge - the IRGC and the judges were. Eventually, enough people with the Iranian government seemed to have realised that a permanently hostile relationship with the UK was not in Tehran's best interests. That might apply directly to the talks taking place in Vienna, designed to revive the agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in return for seeing economic sanctions lifted. Iran's economy has been suffering, Iran clearly wants to agree a new deal, better relations with the UK might make that happen. The deal has still not been agreed but diplomats say agreement is getting close. And in recent weeks, during the Ukraine conflict, Britain and Iran's interests have also come closer together. If sanctions can be lifted and Iran can start selling its oil again, that could help reduce global energy prices. That is in the interests of both the UK and Iran. In that context, both sides might want to clear the diplomatic decks and make a deal more likely. Nazanin on her way home to 'new life' in UK Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori arrive at RAF Brize Norton Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran for nearly six years - is back in the UK. Her release - and that of another dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori - has been linked to the payment by the UK of a multi-million pound debt to Iran, over a failed arms deal dating back 40 years. 'Is that mummy?' - Nazanin home after six-year ordeal in Iran Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? In the 1970s the Shah of Iran - the pro-Western monarch who then ruled the country - ordered1,500 Chieftain tanks and 250 Armoured Recovery Vehicles from the UK,externalin a deal worth an estimated Â£650m. The money was paid to International Military Services (IMS), a private company, then a subsidiary of the UK's Ministry of Defence. Only 185 of the tanks were delivered to the Iranian authorities before the Shah was deposed in the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The Iranian government has been trying to regain the money for the undelivered tanks ever since. Iran ordered 1,500 Chieftain tanks from the UK (here shown in a British army photo from 1968) In 1990, Iran took IMS to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a global business organisation which rules on trade disputes between countries. In 2001, a hearing found in favour of Iran. IMS appealed, although in 2002 it agreed to pay Â£328.5m to the court, in case its appeal was unsuccessful. The appeal hearings concluded in 2009 and the decision was upheld in favour of Iran. However, the European Union had placed sanctions on Iran in June 2008, and IMS's payment was not released to the Iranians. The UK government admitted it owed Iran for the undelivered tanks, but said it could not make the payment while Iran was still subject to economic sanctions. In addition, there was the complicating factor of how much the UK owed Iran. The Â£328.5m security payment made by IMS in 2002 has attracteda considerable amount of interest,externalsince then. The UK disputed how much of this should be paid to Iran. The British-Iranian was detained in April 2016, and spent nearly six years in detention for allegedly plotting against the Iranian government. She protested her innocence throughout this time. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she had been told by her captors that her imprisonment was connected to the fact that the UK had not paid its debt. In 2021, the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said Iran was linking her case and the unpaid debt. He said: ""I think they [Iran] are trying to use this as leverage to settle the historic debt for the Chieftain tanks and that's what they want settled. We obviously reject any linkage because we don't want to encourage hostage diplomacy and we want to follow the legal processes."" However, the UK government did not admit that her jailing, or the imprisonment of other dual nationalssuch as retired engineer Anoosheh Ashoori,were connected to the money. ""These are two entirely separate issues,""Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in 2021. 2021: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family protest in Whitehall, central London Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori were released after months of talks between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and her Iranian counterpart. Another dual national, Morad Tahbaz, has also been released from jail in Iran on furlough as part of the deal. Ms Truss has announced the UK settled the IMS debt ""in parallel"" to the prisoner release. She told MPs that ""highly complex"" negotiations led to the government finding a way to make a payment of Â£393.8m, and that the payment complied with existing sanctions, global counterterrorism financing rules and anti-money laundering regulations. Ms Truss said the terms would remain confidential, but added that Iran could only use the funds for humanitarian purposes.

"This week Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was finally reunited with her husband and daughter in the UK after years of detention in Iran. Now comes the task of rebuilding their lives - but the BBC's Caroline Hawley, who has been in touch with the family throughout their ordeal, says the bond between them has already helped them endure the darkest of times. It's exactly six years since Richard Ratcliffe stood at Gatwick Airport, waving goodbye to his wife. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was flying to Iran - taking their daughter Gabriella to see her grandparents. Richard had no reason to believe they wouldn't be back home a couple of weeks later. ""It was a slightly rushed goodbye,"" he once told me. ""Gabriella at the time was one and three quarters and a bit of a handful. I was just really wishing her good luck with the flight."" Earlier this week, Nazanin stepped off a plane at RAF Brize Norton. After years of detention, she and fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori were finally coming home. A little voice asked: ""Is that Mummy?"" Then Gabriella, now aged seven, rushed to hug her mother. And yet at that moment,Richard, who must have wished with all his heart to run forward and hold Nazanin too, hung back. The kind, gentle accountant - who waged such a steely campaign to get his wife home - allowed Gabriella to run first into her mother's arms, as Nazanin sobbed loudly with relief. Their story is one of any ordinary family caught in the middle of murky international politics; a long-overdue British debt to Iran; and diplomatic manoeuvrings about as far from their usual lives as it's possible to imagine. It's a story of separation. But, at its heart, it's a story about the power of love - the love of a mother for her child, a husband for his wife. And one man's extraordinary single-minded dedication to getting his wife back. ""He showed us what love really means,"" says Tulip Siddiq, the couple's MP who has become a friend to them, too. On Thursday, their first morning together after the reunion started with Richard making Nazanin a cup of tea. Then came a walk in the park with Gabriella as they began the process of rediscovering each other. ""I don't think he'd mind me saying that there's a kind of shyness, of getting to know each other again - a bit like when you first start dating,"" Ms Siddiq tells me. ""He kept saying 'baby steps' when I spoke to him about his relationship with Nazanin. But he just sounds 10 years younger now."" When Richard and Nazanin first met, he immediately felt so comfortable with her, he later described it as ""like coming home"". It was 2007 and they were introduced by a mutual friend at an academic conference. ""She transformed his life when she came along,"" says Richard's younger sister, Rebecca. ""He just dotes on her. She's everything to him. And you can see why - she's so beautiful and lovely."" Nazanin and Richard married two years after they met - first in a register office and then at a more traditional Iranian celebration. Then in 2014, Gabriella was born. ""When they were both taken from him, it was the darkest time of his life. So there was no choice [for him] but to keep fighting for them,"" Rebecca Ratcliffe says. Richard's extraordinary campaign buoyed Nazanin in the darkest days of her incarceration, when she was feeling suicidal, according to Ms Siddiq - even when prison guards taunted Nazanin that her husband's act of love would only earn her more years in jail. ""Nazanin always said to me that she held her head up high because she was proud that her husband was there and campaigning for her and it gave her the strength to keep going,"" Ms Siddiq says. At the start of her imprisonment, Nazanin told doctors, when she was in solitary confinement with the lights always on, her interrogators taunted her that Richard was having affairs and that they had photographic evidence. One of her female guards used to talk loudly to her own child just outside Nazanin's cell. ""It was unbearable,"" Nazanin said. ""I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me."" The hardest part for Nazanin was being separated from Gabriella, who she had only just stopped breastfeeding when she was arrested. There was the mother's guilt of not being able to care for her child. In 2017, she wrote to Gabriella - nicknamed Gisou - from Evin Prison in Tehran: ""Forgive me for all the nights I was not by your side to hold your warm little hand till you fall asleep. ""You, I and your father will never succumb to this hurricane of fate. The love we share knows no boundaries or walls. It is our life. There will come a day that we will be able to live anew all the days of our life. ""My Gisou, there will come a day that we will be together again and tenderly hold one another's loving hands."" On Thursday, that day finally came. Gabriella slept in a bed between her parents for the first time since she was a baby. Nazanin has told Tulip Siddiq that her daughter has been attached to her ever since ""like an extra limb"". Nazanin on BBC Sounds Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now? Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his release Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? For husband and wife, they must learn to live with each other again. Their flat is a ""pigsty"", laughs Rebecca Ratcliffe, cluttered with campaign materials. ""They're different people than they were six years ago,"" she says. ""They have had very traumatic but separate experiences and they need to come together and rebuild their relationship. And there's also the challenge of co-parenting again."" Over the past few years, they've wondered if they still have time to have another child - Nazanin will be 44 on Boxing Day. Richard, talking tenderly about Nazanin to me last year, admitted: ""I don't think I can possibly understand what she's gone through."" He knows there will be ""bumpy"" times ahead. But for the moment being together is all that matters. A short tweet from Richard, with a picture of the three of them embracing, summed the reunion up: ""No place like home. Thank-you to everyone who made this possibleâ¦ You have made us whole."" ""Whatever devils there are, they both know they love each other,"" Rebecca Ratcliffe says. ""If any couple is going to survive this experience, it's them.""

"Ukrainian resilience is causing Russia to ""more adequately assess the situation"" of the war, a Ukrainian negotiator says Mykhaylo Podolyak, an aide to President Zelensky, says the change has helped encourage a dialogue between the two sides But any decision on a peace agreement will be made between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders, he tells the BBC In Kyiv, eight people are reported dead in shelling on a residential area and shopping centre The mayor of Kyiv announces a curfew in the city from this evening until 07:00 local time on Wednesday Russian naval forces shell some residential buildings on the edge of Odesa, Ukrainian authorities say Ukraine ignores Russia's demand it gives up the city of Mariupol, saying there is ""no question of any surrender"" Ukraine's president has accused Russia of war crimes in Mariupol, where heavy fighting has now reached the city centre Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons, we're moving our live coverage of the Ukraine war to a new webpage. Please join us for thelatest updates here. Russia's alleged use of its hypersonic missile is probably intended to ""detract from a lack of progress"" in its ground campaign, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in a tweet. Over the last several days, Russia has claimed to have fired hypersonic missiles - for the first time ever in combat - at targets in western Ukraine. Russian officials claim the missile - known as the Kinzhal - can hit targets up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away at speeds over 6,000 km/h. The UK's MoD, however, assesses the missiles are unlikely to ""materially affect the outcome"" of Russia's campaign in Ukraine. Read more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels âWe donât want to create a European army,â the EUâs foreign
affairs chief has said. Josep Borrell was speaking after foreign and defence
ministers approved a document known as theStrategic Compass,external. It includes plans to develop âEU Rapid Deployment Capacityâ
that could allow the bloc to âswiftly deploy up to 5,000 troopsâ for different
types of crises. âWeâll conduct live exercises together,â he said, which has never happened before. Borrell emphasised member states have, and will still
have, their own armies but said countries must work more closely together. He added Nato was still ""the cornerstone of the territorial
defence of Europeâ.  White House warns of possible Russian cyber-attacks Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The White House has issued a fresh warning to US businesses of possible
cyber-attacks from Russia. In a statement, President Biden said his administration was reiterating
previous warnings ""based on evolving intelligence that the Russian
Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks"". The White House said it was a ""critical"" moment to boost defences. This is the latest in a series of warnings about possible fall-out in
cyberspace from the conflict. In particular, there have been concerns that Russia might retaliate for
sanctions by hitting back at the US and Western economies through cyber-attacks. So far these attacks have not materialised. But this latest warning does suggest US intelligence has seen some
indications of Russian activity on computer networks that could be the prelude
for some kind of attack â however, they acknowledge that this does not mean that
such an attack will definitely take place. The public warning may be designed to act as a deterrent. US and UK cyber officials have both been briefing executives of major
organisations over a period of months, especially those within critical
infrastructure, to warn them of the risks and encourage them to ensure they
have the best possible defences in place. The UK branch of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed under
administration soon, according to reports. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the UK's government is preparing to
step in and run Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd. The firm's clients include McDonald's and Siemens, as well as councils
and hospitals around the country. It does not, however, sell gas from its
parent company in Russia. The BBC understands that the UK government is looking at a number of
options and monitoring the situation closely. The government, however, has not commented on the possible
administration procedure, with a spokesperson noting only that the UK us in
""no way"" dependent on Russian gas. Earlier in March, several councils in England told the BBC they were
seeking to end their contracts with Gazprom. Both McDonald's and Siemens have
also said they were looking at trying to exit deals or cancelling supply
contracts. Gazprom has yet to comment. Read more here Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The most bombarded city in Ukraineâs war with Russia is key to Moscowâs military campaign. But why? Securing a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas:Mariupol stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Strangling Ukraine's economy:In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Propaganda opportunity:Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, which contains far-right extremists including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has given Moscow a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Major morale boost:A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow. Read Frank Gardner's report in full Wyre DaviesBBC News, Dnipro Olga was forced to flee Mariupol for Dnipro with her family Some of the internal refugees arriving at centres like the one we
visited today in Dnipro will stay here in central Ukraine, perhaps hoping one
day to return to Mariupol. But with much of the city destroyed and as many as 40% of those damaged
structures said to be irreparable, returning any time soon will not be an
option for many. Among those is Olga, who we met while she was picking up food, some
clothes, and bedding. For the time being her immediate family is staying in a
small flat here in the city after a harrowing journey out of Mariupol. ""We were driving out under fire,"" Olga tells me. ""Shells
were exploding. They were bombing us and there were dead bodies everywhere, but
we managed to join the larger convoy and eventually get out."" Olga says sheâd like to return to the broken city she calls home,
especially as she has extended family members still trapped there, unable to
escape. But, Olga told me, she received an ominous warning from a Russian
soldier at one of the last checkpoints out of Mariupol. ""Donât bother
staying in Dnipro,"" the soldier said to her, ""because we'll soon be
attacking that city as well."" This video can not be played Footage has emerged of Russian forces using gunfire to disperse demonstrators in the occupied southern city of Kherson. The footage - which was shared on social media and verified by the BBC - also shows explosions, which were reported to be from stun grenades. Demonstrators were reportedly injured during the incident. Protests have taken place in the city of Kherson since the city fell to Russian forces on 3 March. Read more about the protestshere. We told you earlier about the bombastic warning Russia issued that its relations with the US were near breaking point. It comes days after President Joe Biden called his Russian counterpart ""a war criminal"". Since Biden made the statement on 16 March, the label has been heard more often in connection with Vladimir Putin. Former UK prime ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major have called for the creation of a new international tribunal to investigate Putin and those who helped plan his invasion of Ukraine. And the Pentagon has indicated the US is actively engaged in the investigation of the Russian leader. ""We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are
committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of
evidence of that,"" spokesman John Kirby told a news
briefing. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is spearheading the legal process - after 39 nations called for an inquiry to be opened. Read more about war crimes and whether Putin may be prosecuted Hundreds were sheltering at the Mariupol theatre when missiles destroyed it S-300 anti-aircraft weapons on parade in Kyiv last year Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby says the US is in ""ongoing discussions"" with other countries to provide long-range air defence systems to Ukraine. To date, the US has provided Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. These systems, however, are primarily effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, rather than higher altitude combat aircraft. It has been reported a number of countries - including Slovakia - have expressed a willingness to give Ukraine S-300 anti-aircraft systems, provided they receive something to replace them. Ukraine already uses the S-300 and has personnel trained in its use. While Kirby does not comment directly on Slovakia or the S-300, he says the US is in ""active consultations"" about âthe
kinds of defence capabilities to include long-range air defences, that we know
that theyâre [Ukraine] comfortable using."" Wyre DaviesBBC News, Dnipro Children playing at a makeshift refugee reception centre in Dnipro At what is usually a middle school in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, a makeshift reception centre for refuges of fighting from the east has been set up. Many of the people queueing patiently in the schoolyard are from the besieged city of Mariupol â others have come here from Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. They all have another thing in common â theyâre without possessions. Families crammed into cars, they fled through mined roads and numerous Russian checkpoints to safety and need all the basics to survive; food, clothes, and medicine. All of the things being collected here are donations from residents of Dnipro and local charities. So, while children get hand-me-down toys, their mothers line up for the basics. In the school canteen, volunteers package together food parcels that will feed a family for a couple of days. Among those working here is Vadym, normally a teacher at the school but
now doing his ""civic duty to help other Ukrainians"". The UN says there
are six and a half million displaced people inside Ukraine alone. This city and
this community are doing their part to make that transition less traumatic. Women putting together food parcels for refugees If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's a short summary of
what's been happening in the war in Ukraine: Russia's foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador John Sullivan in to protest about recent statements by President Biden, who labelled President Putin a ""war criminal"" over the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement, the ministry said the comments were unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank and pushed Russian-American relations to breaking point. Hostile actions taken against Russia would receive a ""decisive and firm response,"" it warned. The State Department confirmed that the meeting between Sullivan and Russian officials took place, adding that Sullivan demanded that US citizens in custody be given access to consular services. The department says that one US citizen, basketball player Brittany Griner, has still not been given access to consular services after being detained for possession of vape cartridges last month. Speaking to reporters on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it is ""awfully rich"" for Russia to ""speak about 'inappropriate comments' when that same country is engaged in mass slaughter"". Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels The EUâs foreign affairs chief has suggested there wonât be a further package of EU sanctions against Russia adopted this week. Josep Borrell was speaking at a press conference, following meetings of the blocâs foreign and defence ministers in Brussels. âFormal adoption of sanctions requires procedure and I donât think during this week it will be formal adoption of sanctions, according with our procedures.â But he said when EU leaders meet later this week, for a summit in Brussels, theyâll likely consider âwhat else can be done"". He said the issue of energy had been raised by some ministers - but today wasnât a day for such decisions, rather one for âanalysingâ possible future actions. Borrell said there needs to be an âeffective response which wonât lead to an unbearable cost for member states"". Five cases of Russian forces detaining local officials have been recorded in the northern city of Chernihiv, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency is reporting. Quoting the Ukrainian parliament website, it says Russian forces have detained the heads of two villages and a local councillor, while two local government officials have also been abducted. Meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine, Russians have abducted the head of a village in Kharkiv, according to UNIAN news agency. The Russian newspaper KP said the lines appeared as a result of a hack We reported earlier that our colleagues at BBC Russian had compiled a list of 557 confirmed Russian military deaths in the Ukraine invasion, mentioning that Russia's defence ministry has so far only once provided fatality figures - 498 deaths as of 2 March. All that suddenly changed in the last few hours, or so it seemed... The staunchly pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) published an article quoting the ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen had died, a figure which exceeds even US intelligence estimates of Russian fatalities. It gave the number of wounded as 16,153. Minutes later, this part of the article disappeared from the page, but we were able to take screen grabs of the relevant paragraphs. KP editor Vladimir Sungorkin subsequently told the BBC the information had been the result of a hack, and said the paper will post an explanation later.  Joe Biden at the White House on Sunday US President Joe Biden has held a phone call with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, the White House has announced. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the call, as was Italian PM Mario Draghi, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. In a statement, the White House said that the leaders ""discussed their serious concerns about Russiaâs
brutal tactics in Ukraine, including its attacks on civilians"". ""They underscored
their continued support for Ukraine, including by providing
security assistance to the brave Ukrainians who are defending their country
from Russian aggression, and humanitarian assistance to the millions of
Ukrainians who have fled the violence,"" the statement added. Biden is scheduled to travel to Europe later this week for meetings with Nato, EU, and G7 allies in Brussels, followed by a bilateral meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Friday. Pavel has been taking pictures in bomb shelters Pavel Gomzyakov usually photographs the happiest days of peopleâs lives. He is an award-winning wedding photographer from Mariupol, southern Ukraine. But, recently, he has been documenting life in the city as it has come under heavy Russian attack. âBefore the start of the war, Mariupol was a peaceful Ukrainian city, a city in which 95% of people were Russian speaking, like me. My daughter used to study at a Russian school,â he tells BBC Panorama. At the end of last week, he escaped, along with his wife and nine-year-old son. His elderly parents stayed behind and he hasnât been able to contact them for days, as electricity has been cut. He is now trying work out how he can unite with his eldest daughter, 17, who is alone in Germany. She was in the north-eastern Ukrainian city Kharkiv at ballet school when the war started. Pavel says it is if they have all woken up to a new, terrible reality. More on PanoramaUkraine's Resistance: Standing Up to Putinon BBC One at 20:00 GMT A satellite photo shows the disputed Kuril islands (Hokkaido is bottom left) Russia says it is abandoning talks with Japan aimed at signing a formal peace treaty, because Japan has joined in sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. They did not formally end World War Two hostilities because of a dispute over small islands known in Russia as the Southern Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories. They lie just off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and were occupied by Soviet forces in 1945. Russia's foreign ministry says its move freezes discussions on joint economic projects for the islands and halts visa-free visits to them by Japanese citizens. ""All responsibility for the harm to bilateral co-operation and to the interests of Japan itself lies with official Tokyo, which deliberately chose to pursue an anti-Russian course,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak has told the BBC his country's resilience has made Russia ""more adequately assess the reality"" of how its invasion is progressing - leading, he says, to a change in the talks between the two countries. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, several rounds of negotiations have taken place between delegates from Kyiv and Moscow but it's been hard to gauge the progress so far.

"State television showed rescuers racing to the crash site A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Flight tracking data suggested the plane lost height rapidly from its cruising altitude before plummeting to the ground. More than 600 emergency responders are said to be at the crash site. Firefighters reached the scene first and managed to extinguish a blaze in the hills caused by the crash. Footage taken by local villagers and shared on Chinese social media - and by state broadcasters - showed fire and smoke from the crash, with plane debris on the ground. Allow Twitter content?

Air safety and aviation standards in China have improved vastly in recent decades, following a series of accidents in the 1990s, and crashes such as this are now very rare. The country's last major plane accident was in August 2010, when a flight from Harbin crashed in north-east Yichun during foggy weather, killing 42 people. Air disasters timeline China Eastern has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed ""its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died"". Earlier, it greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and also changed its website to black and white in an apparent sign of mourning. As a precaution, China Eastern's entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets has been grounded. It took just two and a half minutes for an apparently normal flight to turn into a tragedy. The aircraft was a 737-800, a well-proven design first produced in the late 1990s. It is a workhorse of the aviation world, with thousands still in service. It has a strong safety record. Fatigue cracks have been found in some older planes, but this one was not quite seven years old. There is no connection here with the 737 MAX, a newer version of the 737, which was grounded for more than a year and a half after a design flaw triggered two major accidents. Investigators will be looking at many possible causes - among them deliberate action, such as terrorism, technical issues such as structural failure, or a mid-air collision. They will look at communications from the pilots, examine the state of the wreckage - and search for the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Those recorders should contain the information needed to confirm exactly what happened during those minutes and why. Staff at Guangzhou airport are directing worried relatives to a separate zone set up to receive them. One woman waiting for news there told local media she had booked a seat on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very sad,"" she said. Her sister and four friends were on the crashed plane, AFP news agency reports. State-owned China Eastern is one of China's big three airlines, along with China Southern and Air China. Flight MU5735 left Kunming at 13:11 local time (05:11 GMT) and was scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou at 15:05. A file photo from 2015 of the China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 which crashed Flight tracking sites report the plane was in the air for just over an hour and was nearing its destination when it went down in Wuzhou, a verdant, hilly area prone to mixed weather at this time of year as China enters its annual flood season. The weather was cloudy, but visibility was reported to have been good at the time of the crash. Footage said to be of Flight MU5735 plummeting vertically from the sky has been circulating on social media. The plane dropped thousands of metres in three minutes, flight tracker data showed. According to FlightRadar24 data, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft, but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. ""Usually the plane is on autopilot during cruise stage. So it is very hard to fathom what happened,"" Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert, told Reuters news agency. Another expert, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge, told China's Global Times newspaper: ""It is very likely that the aircraft lost power at cruising altitude, resulting in the pilot losing control of the aircraft. ""This is a very serious technical failure in which the plane inevitably enters a high-speed descent."" The Boeing 737-800 plane was nearly seven years old, according to tracker websites. It is the predecessor model to the Boeing 737 Max line, which were the planes involved in deadly crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019. China banned that model after those crashes. Boeing issued a statement on the crash of MU5735, saying: ""We are aware of the initial media reports and are working to gather more information."" China's Civil Aviation Administration said it had dispatched its investigators to the scene.

"People can no longer buy free-range eggs in the UK due to the length of time hens have been kept indoors following outbreaks of bird flu. The eggs in shops will be labelled as ""barn eggs"" due to birds being kept inside for more than 16 weeks. The country is experiencing its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza and measures are in place to prevent the virus from spreading. About 55% of all eggs produced in the UK are free-range, says the RSPCA. It means they come from birds that, during the daytime, enjoy unlimited access to outdoor pastures. Signs will be put in supermarkets to inform shoppers of the change from Monday, and free-range labelling will only return when hens are permitted to go outside again. Human case of bird flu detected in the UK Birds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian flu Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser at the National Farmers' Union, said the government's advice was that there was ""still a high level of risk"" to birds of catching flu. ""This is an incredibly difficult time for all bird owners and vigilance remains vital,"" she added. Ms Mahony said farmers were following ""stringent biosecurity measures"" and adapting hen houses to make birds more comfortable. Avian flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird, whether it is dead or alive Both ""barn"" and ""free range"" eggs meet the RSPCA's welfare standards, because the hens that lay them have freedom and space to move around, along with perches for roosting and nest boxes. The difference is that for barn hens, this all happens inside, whereas free-range hens can access to the outside through ""popholes"" - although bird flu restrictions have put a stop to this. The RSPCA says consumers buy more boxes of free range and barn eggs than those from caged hens. However, the charity says a large proportion of eggs used as ingredients in products like mayonnaise, cakes and sandwiches are still from hens kept in cages. It says such cages provide less than the size of an A4 piece of paper of space per bird and have limited facilities for perching, nesting and scratching and do not meet its welfare standards. The charity says about 35% of egg-laying hens are still kept in cages. Case numbers of the H5N1 strain of bird flu began rising in November last year. The virus - which is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks - was first discovered in North Yorkshire. It poses an extremely low risk to humans, according to the NHS, although several people have been infected around the world and a number have died. The outbreaks have resulted in the government enforcing an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone which made it a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK - whether they have pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard flock - to keep them indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures. Under such restrictions egg farmers have a 16-week ""grace period"" to maintain their free-range status, but this ended on Monday. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, assistant director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said shops and supermarkets would ""continue to support British farmers"". In a statement the government said it would work with farmers and retailers to implement the branding changings. A spokesman added: ""We are experiencing our largest ever outbreak of avian flu and housing measures remain in force to protect poultry and other birds from this highly infectious and unpleasant disease.""

"The Stepchange charity survey by YouGov found nearly half of 25-49 year olds expect to struggle to pay bills A leading debt charity is calling on the chancellor to use this week's Spring Statement to do more to help poorer households. StepChange is calling on Rishi Sunak to increase welfare benefits and offer more help with energy bills. Without that, many more people will fall into ""problem debt"" the charity said. Mr Sunak told the BBC he cannot ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. The debt charity wants the government to consider increasing benefits by at least 7% in April to try to match the rate at which prices are rising. It wants to see more funding for local councils to support people with vouchers, grants or discretionary payments to cover essential bills. StepChange is also calling for an expansion of theWarm Home Discountand wants energy companies to stop trying to recover debt from people who cannot afford to pay their bills. It comes as the charity has released the results of a survey, which suggests that one in five people believe they will end up in debt this year and won't be able to pay it back. Of 1,676 adults surveyed by YouGov for StepChange, 42% of people said they think they will struggle to pay rising energy bills and council tax in the coming months. Modelling from the debt charity also found that if energy bills hit Â£3,000 per year -which the industry has suggested could happen- the most financially vulnerable households will be spending Â£1 in every Â£6 they earn on energy costs. StepChange's campaign is the latest in a growing chorus of calls for the government to take further action when the chancellor makes his Spring Statement this week. On Wednesday the chancellor is expected to provide an update on the overall health of the economy, but the Spring Statement does not usually include large changes to tax or spending policies. Rishi Sunak told BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. ""I can't do that, but what I would say is, I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options Millions of households will see sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government's price cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel has also soared in recent weeks, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. More than 50 Conservative MPs are calling for a cut in fuel duty to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. One of them, former housing minister Robert Jenrick said: ""I think household incomes are entering a storm and they are going to be battered from all sides, energy, food, interest rates rising and so there is a role from the Treasury now to try to smooth the effect of this shock."" This video can not be played Financial journalist Martin Lewis says fuel and energy price rises are ""catastrophic"" Carl Emmerson, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank told the BBC's Today programme that cutting fuel duty would provide targeted help for individuals and businesses who buy a lot of motor fuel. He said that the move was something that the chancellor could afford, but added: ""I think the problem with cutting fuel duty is that it never turns out to be temporary"". Fuel duty is supposed to rise automatically every year but has been frozen for more than 10 years. Mr Emmerson also suggested that the chancellor will need to choose between broader help, which will offer some help for most households, or more targeted interventions which would offer greater assistance to those on the lowest incomes. ""If you go broad, you can only really shield people from a bit of the pain"", he said. StepChange chief executive Phil Andrew said that the coming months will be ""dire"" for financially vulnerable people. ""Government must pull every lever at its disposal in order to protect those on the lowest incomes from the scars of debt and destitution. ""While the initial raft of support announced in February was welcome, the war in Ukraine has exacerbated an already difficult situation and more action is clearly needed,"" he added.

"UN scientists are likely to weigh up technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, as they gather to finalise a key report. This idea will be one of many solutions considered over the next two weeks by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Also in attendance will be government officials from all over the world, who will need to approve every line in the summary report. It is due to be published on 4 April. Climate report is 'code red for humanity' Some impacts of global warming âirreversibleâ- UN Five things new IPCC climate change study tells us This new study will be the third of three important reports from the IPCC issued over the past eight months. The previous two have looked at the causes and impacts of climate change, but this one will focus on mitigation - or what we can do to stop it. This essentially means that researchers will look at how we can reduce the amount of warming gases that are emitted from human activities. Carbon removal technology, such as at this installation in Iceland, will be examined However, the IPCC co-chair says this mitigation report will look more closely at ways of removing CO2 that's already in the atmosphere. ""We have a lot more material, this time on carbon dioxide removal. That is, not putting carbon into the atmosphere, but getting it out again,"" said Prof Jim Skea, from Imperial College, London. ""The report was scoped out to cover the full spectrum of carbon dioxide removal approaches, which vary absolutely hugely, and the carbon dioxide that is removed can end up in very different stores and in very different places. So it was within the scope of the report to cover the whole lot, basically."" For more on carbon capture and storage listen tothis episode of The Climate Questionon BBC Sounds. The kind of carbon removal approaches the report will consider will likely include tree planting and agriculture, as well as the more advanced technological approaches that uselarge machines to remove the carbon from the air. They will also look at combined approaches, where land is used to grow crops which can be burned for energy while the carbon is captured and buried. The use of these types of technology is controversial. Campaigners express doubts that they can be made to work economically and there are also concerns that technology could be seen as an excuse not to make the major changes in energy production that are needed. Scientists though say that the situation is now so serious that carbon dioxide removal will be needed in addition to massive cuts in emissions and not as a substitute for them. What ultimately emerges in the short summary for policymakers that will be published in two weeks, will depend on delicate negotiations with government representatives from 195 countries. Researchers and officials will work through the summary line by line to agree the final text. Prof Jim Skea is one of the co-chairs of the latest IPCC report There are some concerns that the war in Ukraine might have an impact on the meeting, with representatives from both Russia and Ukraine due to take part. ""We have been running some informal meetings with governments to brief them ahead of the actual approval session,"" said Prof Skea. ""I would be optimistic that we would get full participation."" The new report, part of a regular review of the science dating back to 1990, will also have a new focus on the social aspects of cutting carbon. ""This chapter looks at the social science perspective of demand, and what motivates individual consumers, communities, businesses, to make responsible consumption, reduction, design and investment choices,"" said Dr Joyashree Roy, from Jadavpur University and the lead author of this part of the report. ""Responsible production and consumption are also within the scope of this chapter, and we have also been asked to look into what are the drivers of behaviour change."" There will be much focus on short term actions that governments can take in the remaining years of this decade to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. This wasassessed in 2018as needing emissions to be cut in half by 2030 - but after the pandemic and with the likely ramping up of fossil fuel use in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, the scale of emissions cuts may need revising upwards. Despite this, the report will likely emphasise that there is hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be avoided, if urgent action is taken. Solutions such as planting mangroves or trees to absorb carbon will be considered Prof Skea says the summary will not be ""unremitting doom and gloom.""

"Shelling by Russian forces has prevented civilians from being able to evacuate the besieged port city A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of trying to starve the besieged port city of Mariupol into surrendering. Dmytro Gurin was speaking soon after Ukraine rejected a Russian deadline demanding Mariupol's defenders lay down their arms in exchange for safe passage out of the city. Mariupol is a key strategic target for the Russian military. Around 300,000 people are believed to be trapped there with supplies running out and aid blocked from entering. Residents have endured weeks of Russian bombardment with no power or running water. Mr Gurin said there was no question of Mariupol surrendering. ""Russians don't open humanitarian corridors, they don't let humanitarian convoys enter the city and we clearly see now that the goal of the Russians is to start to [create] hunger [in the city] to enforce their position in the diplomatic process,"" he said. ""If the city does not surrender, and the city will not surrender, they won't let people out. They won't let humanitarian convoys into the city."" Under the proposal, which Ukraine had until 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) to accept, Russian troops would have opened safe corridors out of Mariupol from 10:00 Moscow time, initially for Ukrainian troops and ""foreign mercenaries"" to disarm and leave the city. After two hours, Russian forces say they would then have allowed humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and other supplies to enter the city safely, once the de-mining of the roads was complete. But the deadline came and went. Should Russia capture Mariupol, it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. So far though, Mariupol's defenders have stood firm. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby,external ANALYSIS:Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wanted BATTLEFIELD:What have been Russia's military mistakes? WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the war,external There are mounting concerns about the humanitarian situation, with Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP from Mariupol, calling it ""hell on Earth"". Residents spend most of their time in shelters and basements as Russia continues its unrelenting attack on the city, from land, air and sea, officials say. Pictures show a city in ruins, with entire neighbourhoods devastated. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, estimated that over 80% of residential buildings had either been damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair. Bodies are being left in the streets as it is too dangerous to get them. Mr Gurin said teams were still unable to clean the rubble of a theatre which Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia last Wednesday. Hundreds of people are believed to remain trapped in the basement, which withstood the attack. Moscow denies targeting the building. ""The services cannot clean this rubble because the shelling never stops and bombing never stops. It's really dangerous,"" he said. He could not give an estimate on how many people had managed to flee the area as ""we don't have connection with Mariupol"". Since the war began, authorities say at least 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol although the true figure may be higher. Previous efforts to evacuate Mariupol's civilians have been blocked by Russian fire, although local authorities say that thousands have been able to leave in private vehicles. On Sunday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said 3,985 people had fled from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, adding that on Monday the government plans on sending about 50 buses to pick up further evacuees from the city. President Volodomyr Zelensky has said the Russian siege amounts to a ""war crime"". ""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" he said. ""They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers"".

"State television showed rescuers racing to the crash site A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Flight tracking data suggested the plane lost height rapidly from its cruising altitude before plummeting to the ground. More than 600 emergency responders are said to be at the crash site. Firefighters reached the scene first and managed to extinguish a blaze in the hills caused by the crash. Footage taken by local villagers and shared on Chinese social media - and by state broadcasters - showed fire and smoke from the crash, with plane debris on the ground. Allow Twitter content?

Air safety and aviation standards in China have improved vastly in recent decades, following a series of accidents in the 1990s, and crashes such as this are now very rare. The country's last major plane accident was in August 2010, when a flight from Harbin crashed in north-east Yichun during foggy weather, killing 42 people. Air disasters timeline China Eastern has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed ""its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died"". Earlier, it greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and also changed its website to black and white in an apparent sign of mourning. As a precaution, China Eastern's entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets has been grounded. It took just two and a half minutes for an apparently normal flight to turn into a tragedy. The aircraft was a 737-800, a well-proven design first produced in the late 1990s. It is a workhorse of the aviation world, with thousands still in service. It has a strong safety record. Fatigue cracks have been found in some older planes, but this one was not quite seven years old. There is no connection here with the 737 MAX, a newer version of the 737, which was grounded for more than a year and a half after a design flaw triggered two major accidents. Investigators will be looking at many possible causes - among them deliberate action, such as terrorism, technical issues such as structural failure, or a mid-air collision. They will look at communications from the pilots, examine the state of the wreckage - and search for the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Those recorders should contain the information needed to confirm exactly what happened during those minutes and why. Staff at Guangzhou airport are directing worried relatives to a separate zone set up to receive them. One woman waiting for news there told local media she had booked a seat on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very sad,"" she said. Her sister and four friends were on the crashed plane, AFP news agency reports. State-owned China Eastern is one of China's big three airlines, along with China Southern and Air China. Flight MU5735 left Kunming at 13:11 local time (05:11 GMT) and was scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou at 15:05. A file photo from 2015 of the China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 which crashed Flight tracking sites report the plane was in the air for just over an hour and was nearing its destination when it went down in Wuzhou, a verdant, hilly area prone to mixed weather at this time of year as China enters its annual flood season. The weather was cloudy, but visibility was reported to have been good at the time of the crash. Footage said to be of Flight MU5735 plummeting vertically from the sky has been circulating on social media. The plane dropped thousands of metres in three minutes, flight tracker data showed. According to FlightRadar24 data, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft, but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. ""Usually the plane is on autopilot during cruise stage. So it is very hard to fathom what happened,"" Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert, told Reuters news agency. Another expert, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge, told China's Global Times newspaper: ""It is very likely that the aircraft lost power at cruising altitude, resulting in the pilot losing control of the aircraft. ""This is a very serious technical failure in which the plane inevitably enters a high-speed descent."" The Boeing 737-800 plane was nearly seven years old, according to tracker websites. It is the predecessor model to the Boeing 737 Max line, which were the planes involved in deadly crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019. China banned that model after those crashes. Boeing issued a statement on the crash of MU5735, saying: ""We are aware of the initial media reports and are working to gather more information."" China's Civil Aviation Administration said it had dispatched its investigators to the scene.

"State television showed rescuers racing to the crash site A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Flight tracking data suggested the plane lost height rapidly from its cruising altitude before plummeting to the ground. More than 600 emergency responders are said to be at the crash site. Firefighters reached the scene first and managed to extinguish a blaze in the hills caused by the crash. Footage taken by local villagers and shared on Chinese social media - and by state broadcasters - showed fire and smoke from the crash, with plane debris on the ground. Allow Twitter content?

Air safety and aviation standards in China have improved vastly in recent decades, following a series of accidents in the 1990s, and crashes such as this are now very rare. The country's last major plane accident was in August 2010, when a flight from Harbin crashed in north-east Yichun during foggy weather, killing 42 people. Air disasters timeline China Eastern has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed ""its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died"". Earlier, it greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and also changed its website to black and white in an apparent sign of mourning. As a precaution, China Eastern's entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets has been grounded. It took just two and a half minutes for an apparently normal flight to turn into a tragedy. The aircraft was a 737-800, a well-proven design first produced in the late 1990s. It is a workhorse of the aviation world, with thousands still in service. It has a strong safety record. Fatigue cracks have been found in some older planes, but this one was not quite seven years old. There is no connection here with the 737 MAX, a newer version of the 737, which was grounded for more than a year and a half after a design flaw triggered two major accidents. Investigators will be looking at many possible causes - among them deliberate action, such as terrorism, technical issues such as structural failure, or a mid-air collision. They will look at communications from the pilots, examine the state of the wreckage - and search for the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Those recorders should contain the information needed to confirm exactly what happened during those minutes and why. Staff at Guangzhou airport are directing worried relatives to a separate zone set up to receive them. One woman waiting for news there told local media she had booked a seat on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very sad,"" she said. Her sister and four friends were on the crashed plane, AFP news agency reports. State-owned China Eastern is one of China's big three airlines, along with China Southern and Air China. Flight MU5735 left Kunming at 13:11 local time (05:11 GMT) and was scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou at 15:05. A file photo from 2015 of the China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 which crashed Flight tracking sites report the plane was in the air for just over an hour and was nearing its destination when it went down in Wuzhou, a verdant, hilly area prone to mixed weather at this time of year as China enters its annual flood season. The weather was cloudy, but visibility was reported to have been good at the time of the crash. Footage said to be of Flight MU5735 plummeting vertically from the sky has been circulating on social media. The plane dropped thousands of metres in three minutes, flight tracker data showed. According to FlightRadar24 data, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft, but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. ""Usually the plane is on autopilot during cruise stage. So it is very hard to fathom what happened,"" Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert, told Reuters news agency. Another expert, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge, told China's Global Times newspaper: ""It is very likely that the aircraft lost power at cruising altitude, resulting in the pilot losing control of the aircraft. ""This is a very serious technical failure in which the plane inevitably enters a high-speed descent."" The Boeing 737-800 plane was nearly seven years old, according to tracker websites. It is the predecessor model to the Boeing 737 Max line, which were the planes involved in deadly crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019. China banned that model after those crashes. Boeing issued a statement on the crash of MU5735, saying: ""We are aware of the initial media reports and are working to gather more information."" China's Civil Aviation Administration said it had dispatched its investigators to the scene.

"Unite workers are on strike in a dispute over pay The Unite union refused requests to exempt special school services from strike action, the Education Authority has claimed. The authority said the union declined requests it made on Wednesday 16 March and Monday 21 March. The Unite union has been contacted by BBC News NI for a response. Members ofUnite are taking action over a local government pay offer of 1.75%, which the union has called a ""real terms pay cut"". Unite is one of the largest public sector unions. The union said its members in councils, the Education Authority and the Housing Executive expressed overwhelming support for the industrial action in ballots. Gareth Scott, from Unite, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster the offer was ""totally inadequate"". ""These local authority workers have seen their pay cut in real terms by 22% in last 12 years,"" he added. ""Over the last two years, during the pandemic, they have been essential workers and now we have the cost of living crisis - the response from employers was to offer a meagre 1.75% increase."" This video can not be played We're not being offered a living wage' When asked if the union had considered making an exception for special schools, he said the problem lay with the employers. ""This could have been avoided by the employers making a fair and reasonable pay offer - something that goes a lot closer to meeting the cost of living,"" he said. ""Our members do not want to be on strike. But they have got to the point where they feel they have no alternative."" Some school transport, meals, council bin collections, leisure services and Housing Executive maintenance will be disrupted by the week-long action by over 2,000 Unite members. Some special schools are expected to be particularly affected by the unavailability of Education Authority transport as they rely heavily on the so-called yellow buses. Some classroom assistants in special schools who are members of Unite may also be on strike. But only one of 39 special schools - Glenveagh in Belfast - has said it cannot offer pupils face-to-face teaching ""due to lack of staffing"". The Education Authority, though, said it had asked on Wednesday 16 March for classroom assistants at Glenveagh to be exempt from the strike. It had also asked for yellow bus drivers in greater Belfast who transport wheelchair-using pupils to be allowed to continue to work. The strikes may cause some disruption to school meals The authority said that on Monday it had gone further and asked Unite to exempt all special school staff and bus drivers from the strike action. The Education Authority's director of human resources Clare Duffield told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra that Unite had been asked to ""protect"" special schools. ""It is very disappointing that children with special educational needs are having their normal routine disrupted,"" she said. ""And it's really disappointing that those requests have been rejected at this stage."" ""We have made the requests on a number of occasions and will continue to escalate those requests so that we can attempt to minimise the disruption throughout the week."" ""We absolutely respect the right of a trade union and their members to take lawful industrial action but it's very disappointing when that impact son the most vulnerable children and young people."" Ms Duffield said that around 100 out of over 2,000 EA bus routes had been affected by strike action on Monday but that pupils from special schools has been most affected.

"The Stepchange charity survey by YouGov found nearly half of 25-49 year olds expect to struggle to pay bills A leading debt charity is calling on the chancellor to use this week's Spring Statement to do more to help poorer households. StepChange is calling on Rishi Sunak to increase welfare benefits and offer more help with energy bills. Without that, many more people will fall into ""problem debt"" the charity said. Mr Sunak told the BBC he cannot ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. The debt charity wants the government to consider increasing benefits by at least 7% in April to try to match the rate at which prices are rising. It wants to see more funding for local councils to support people with vouchers, grants or discretionary payments to cover essential bills. StepChange is also calling for an expansion of theWarm Home Discountand wants energy companies to stop trying to recover debt from people who cannot afford to pay their bills. It comes as the charity has released the results of a survey, which suggests that one in five people believe they will end up in debt this year and won't be able to pay it back. Of 1,676 adults surveyed by YouGov for StepChange, 42% of people said they think they will struggle to pay rising energy bills and council tax in the coming months. Modelling from the debt charity also found that if energy bills hit Â£3,000 per year -which the industry has suggested could happen- the most financially vulnerable households will be spending Â£1 in every Â£6 they earn on energy costs. StepChange's campaign is the latest in a growing chorus of calls for the government to take further action when the chancellor makes his Spring Statement this week. On Wednesday the chancellor is expected to provide an update on the overall health of the economy, but the Spring Statement does not usually include large changes to tax or spending policies. Rishi Sunak told BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. ""I can't do that, but what I would say is, I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options Millions of households will see sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government's price cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel has also soared in recent weeks, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. More than 50 Conservative MPs are calling for a cut in fuel duty to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. One of them, former housing minister Robert Jenrick said: ""I think household incomes are entering a storm and they are going to be battered from all sides, energy, food, interest rates rising and so there is a role from the Treasury now to try to smooth the effect of this shock."" This video can not be played Financial journalist Martin Lewis says fuel and energy price rises are ""catastrophic"" Carl Emmerson, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank told the BBC's Today programme that cutting fuel duty would provide targeted help for individuals and businesses who buy a lot of motor fuel. He said that the move was something that the chancellor could afford, but added: ""I think the problem with cutting fuel duty is that it never turns out to be temporary"". Fuel duty is supposed to rise automatically every year but has been frozen for more than 10 years. Mr Emmerson also suggested that the chancellor will need to choose between broader help, which will offer some help for most households, or more targeted interventions which would offer greater assistance to those on the lowest incomes. ""If you go broad, you can only really shield people from a bit of the pain"", he said. StepChange chief executive Phil Andrew said that the coming months will be ""dire"" for financially vulnerable people. ""Government must pull every lever at its disposal in order to protect those on the lowest incomes from the scars of debt and destitution. ""While the initial raft of support announced in February was welcome, the war in Ukraine has exacerbated an already difficult situation and more action is clearly needed,"" he added.

"Shelling by Russian forces has prevented civilians from being able to evacuate the besieged port city A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of trying to starve the besieged port city of Mariupol into surrendering. Dmytro Gurin was speaking soon after Ukraine rejected a Russian deadline demanding Mariupol's defenders lay down their arms in exchange for safe passage out of the city. Mariupol is a key strategic target for the Russian military. Around 300,000 people are believed to be trapped there with supplies running out and aid blocked from entering. Residents have endured weeks of Russian bombardment with no power or running water. Mr Gurin said there was no question of Mariupol surrendering. ""Russians don't open humanitarian corridors, they don't let humanitarian convoys enter the city and we clearly see now that the goal of the Russians is to start to [create] hunger [in the city] to enforce their position in the diplomatic process,"" he said. ""If the city does not surrender, and the city will not surrender, they won't let people out. They won't let humanitarian convoys into the city."" Under the proposal, which Ukraine had until 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) to accept, Russian troops would have opened safe corridors out of Mariupol from 10:00 Moscow time, initially for Ukrainian troops and ""foreign mercenaries"" to disarm and leave the city. After two hours, Russian forces say they would then have allowed humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and other supplies to enter the city safely, once the de-mining of the roads was complete. But the deadline came and went. Should Russia capture Mariupol, it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. So far though, Mariupol's defenders have stood firm. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby,external ANALYSIS:Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wanted BATTLEFIELD:What have been Russia's military mistakes? WATCH:Drone footage shows Mariupol devastation,external IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the war,external There are mounting concerns about the humanitarian situation, with Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP from Mariupol, calling it ""hell on Earth"". Residents spend most of their time in shelters and basements as Russia continues its unrelenting attack on the city, from land, air and sea, officials say. Pictures show a city in ruins, with entire neighbourhoods devastated. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, estimated that over 80% of residential buildings had either been damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair. Bodies are being left in the streets as it is too dangerous to get them. Mr Gurin said teams were still unable to clean the rubble of a theatre which Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia last Wednesday. Hundreds of people are believed to remain trapped in the basement, which withstood the attack. Moscow denies targeting the building. ""The services cannot clean this rubble because the shelling never stops and bombing never stops. It's really dangerous,"" he said. He could not give an estimate on how many people had managed to flee the area as ""we don't have connection with Mariupol"". Since the war began, authorities say at least 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol although the true figure may be higher. Previous efforts to evacuate Mariupol's civilians have been blocked by Russian fire, although local authorities say that thousands have been able to leave in private vehicles. On Sunday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said 3,985 people had fled from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, adding that on Monday the government plans on sending about 50 buses to pick up further evacuees from the city. President Volodomyr Zelensky has said the Russian siege amounts to a ""war crime"". ""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" he said. ""They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers"".
