"Brexit Party candidate Ann Widdecombe and leader Nigel Farage both said they had been approached Calls are growing for an investigation into claims the Tories offered peerages to Brexit Party election candidates to persuade them to stand down. Police say they are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud. Labour peer Lord Falconer has urged the Metropolitan Police and prosecution service to launch an investigation, saying the claims raised ""serious questions"" about the integrity of the 12 December election. The PM says the claims are ""nonsense"". ""I am sure there are conversations that take place between politicians of all parties but certainly nobody's been offered a peerage,"" Boris Johnsonsaid on Friday. The claims - first made public by the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage - came after the Brexit Party announced it would not field candidates in any seats won by the Conservatives in 2017, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote. But the party said it would contest all other seats, prompting pressure from Conservatives who urged Mr Farage to withdraw more candidates to help Mr Johnson win a majority in Parliament. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Nobody's been offered a peerage"" Ina video posted on Twitter,externalearlier this week, Mr Farage claimed he and eight other Brexit Party figures had been offered jobs ""in the (Brexit) negotiating team and in government departments"" while there had been ""hints at peerages too"". Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party candidate, said she was prepared to swear on the Bible that she had been approached with an offer of ""a role"" in the next phase of Brexit negotiations. A Conservative source also told the BBC that the Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough, Mike Greene, had been offered an unpaid role in education in the hope it would convince him to stand aside. The Brexit Party candidate's team said Mr Greene would definitely be running in the Cambridgeshire constituency, which Labour held narrowly at a by-election in June. In a letter, Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor, said he wanted to raise the issue ""as a matter of urgency"". He wrote to Cressida Dick, the Met Police commissioner, and Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, saying: ""I believe these allegations raise serious questions about the integrity of the upcoming general election, and in particular whether senior individuals at CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters) or No 10 have breached two sections of the Representation of the People Act 1983."" Lord Falconer added: ""These are exceptionally serious allegations which the DPP must, in accordance with his statutory duty, fully investigate as a matter of urgency. ""In addition, in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes and this election, it is crucial that the Metropolitan Police also examine these accusations."" Brexit Party peerage claims are nonsense, says PM Where are the seats that could turn the election? A really simple guide to the UK general election Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Lord Falconer said: ""The law is that if somebody corruptly induces or procures another person to withdraw from being a candidate at an election, that's both a crime and a corrupt practice in an election, which can lead an election to be set aside. ""From my point of view, it looks as if the Conservatives might be going well beyond electoral law in trying to win this election by persuading Brexit UK candidates not to stand."" Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""This could be political corruption of the highest order and, in addition to that, it could be seen as criminal activity."" He said there should ""undoubtedly"" be an investigation. Responding to the claims, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Nothing would surprise me about the Conservatives these days given what they've been prepared to do. ""If Boris Johnson's prepared to lie to the Queen, lie to the country, you know, I'm going to stop being shocked at where his lack of boundaries lies."" The SNP has also backed a probe into the allegations, insisting there should be an urgent inquiry by the Cabinet Office. Tommy Sheppard, the SNP candidate for Edinburgh, called for a ""full and frank investigation"". The Met Police said it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the general election. The lord chancellor is a role dating back many centuries, the holder of which is also head of the Ministry of Justice. Where are the seats that could turn the election?

"Jeremy Corbyn has hailed Labour's ""transformative"" manifesto after finalising the document in a meeting with senior party figures. The Labour leader said a ""unanimous agreement"" was reached by key union backers and his shadow cabinet after six hours of talks in London. The details in the manifesto for the general election on 12 December are expected to be released on Thursday. It is billed as ""more radical"" than the document campaigned on in 2017. The party has already announced a number of policies, including a part-nationalisation of BT and extra spending on infrastructure. But members had to decide in the talks on Saturday whether to include some policies from its party conference, including on free movement of people from the EU to the UK. Mr Corbyn said he was ""very, very proud"" of the contents of the manifesto that gives the ""promise of a better Britain"". Speaking on the steps of the Institute of Engineering and Technology after the meeting, he said: ""That manifesto is a transformative document that will change the lives of the people of this country for the better. ""It will be a once in a generation opportunity to vote for a more egalitarian society that cares for all."" McCluskey on Labour, Brexit and the election Labour pledges free broadband for all So where do main parties stand on immigration? The BBC's Iain Watson said the party is expected to pledge additional support for women affected when the government in 2011 sped up plans to raise the age at which women could claim the state pension from 60 to 66. Ahead of the talks, party figures were expected to debate whether to include a commitment to ""maintain and extend"" free movement rights for migrants, asdemanded by delegatesat September's party conference. The party's 2017 manifesto stated that free movement - giving EU citizens the right to work and seek employment in the UK and UK citizens the same right in other EU countries - would end with Brexit. A small number of protesters gathered outside the meeting, chanting in support of free movement. The Liberal Democrats earlier called on Labour to make a ""cast-iron commitment"" to preserve free movement rights in its manifesto. LIVE :Latest election updates CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The party's home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said failing to do so would be a ""betrayal of future generations"". The Lib Dems are pledging a ""fair, effective"" immigration system if it is elected - with plans to resettle 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children a year. However, some within Labour are concerned that a more open policy on immigration could alienate voters in Leave-voting areas. Len McCluskey - the leader of the Unite, the biggest Labour-supporting union - has called for new employment policies to address concerns about freedom of movement. As he headed into the manifesto meeting, Mr Corbyn said it would be ""transformative"" On Thursday, he denied a newspaper report that he had told Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to take a tough line on free movement of workers. But he said Labour would ""protect all workers"" through labour market regulations. ""It won't stop the free movement of labour. It will effectively make certain that greedy bosses, agency companies, are not abusing working people,"" he said. There was a disagreement during the talks over whether to incorporate the conference policy of extending freedom of movement for workers in the manifesto. Freedom of movement will continue if voters back Remain in the new referendum which Labour is pledging. If voters back Leave, Labour would introduce its own immigration policy but, as the party wants a close relationship with the single market, it recognises there would be high levels of labour mobility. But this would be underpinned by stricter regulation of the employment market to prevent migrant workers ""undercutting"" employees here and to stop migrants being exploited. Some policies were agreed and not yet announced, for example, a process for compensating women adversely affected by a more rapid rise in the state pension age than they anticipated. Prescriptions and dental checks will also be free in England too. On Friday, Mr Corbyn confirmed an existing pledge to abolish university tuition fees will be included in the party's manifesto for the 12 December poll. He also said bringing Royal Mail, rail and water utilities under public ownership ""are clearly going to be in our manifesto next week"". Other parties have also begun announcing policies ahead of the official launch of their manifestos later in the campaign. On Saturday, both the Lib Dems and the Conservatives made rival pledges on tree planting. The Conservatives also announced Â£500m of funding over the next five years to help support developing countries in protecting oceans. The Conservatives and Labour areset to field candidatesin every constituency in Britain, except Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle's seat in Chorley in Lancashire. The Brexit Party has put forward 275 candidates, having stood aside in all the seats won by the Tories in 2017. Figures from PA suggest the party has also opted not to contest handfuls of other seats being defended by other parties, particularly in Scotland. How did manifesto meeting work? The so-called ""Clause Five"" party meeting offers an opportunity for senior figures to sign off on the party's manifesto. It is attended by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, including the shadow cabinet and trade union representatives. Party staffers present a draft document, whose different policy areas are discussed in turn. A vote is taken at the end of the meeting on the whole document, rather than voting section-by-section. There are usually some small amendments. Party positions are unlikely to change - but will perhaps be clarified. Who should I vote for?

"Live insects will not be eaten in this year's I'm A Celebrity, in a ""permanent"" change to the reality TV show. I'm A Celebrity has previously been criticised for using live bugs in its 'bushtucker trials'. Some tasks on the ITV show have included insects being eaten alive or dumped onto contestants. The stars could still be covered in bugs during filming in Australia but any eaten will already be dead.

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew has given an unprecedented interview to the BBC about his relationship with US financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The friendship between the 59-year-old member of the Royal Family and Epstein has come under close scrutinysince the American killed himself in Augustwhile awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prince Andrew said it was wrong of him to visit and stay at Epstein's house in 2010 after the financier's conviction but that he did not regret their entire friendship. He also categorically denied having sex with Virginia Roberts, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was 17 years old. Here's what we know about the links between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew said he first met Epstein, a wealthy hedge fund manager, in 1999 through Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's British girlfriend and a woman the prince said he had known since she was at university. That year was the first time the prince and the businessman were linked in press reports in the UK and US. Prince Andrew reportedly flew with Epstein on his private Gulfstream jet in February 1999,according to a log book seen by the Daily Mirror in 2015.,external The destination was said to have been Epstein's private island, Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. The Daily Mail also reported that 10 months earlier Epstein's logbook showed he had flown to the same location,externalto meet the prince's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. The couple had divorced in 1996. Epstein and Ms Maxwell were among a star-studded guest list at a party hosted by the Queen in June 2000. The Dance of the Decades event, which saw more than 600 guests descend on Windsor Castle, marked four royal birthdays including Prince Andrew's 40th.  Prince Andrew, the Queen's third child, told the BBC that Epstein was there at his invitation, not the Royal Family's, but was to some extent Ms Maxwell's ""plus one"". Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The duke at the time appeared to be part of the social circle of Ms Maxwell,whom Epstein later described as his best friend.,external Prince Andrew was pictured accompanying Ms Maxwell - daughter of the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell - at private parties and celebrity functions both in the UK and in the US that year. They were photographed together at the wedding of the prince's former girlfriend, Aurelia Cecil, near Salisbury in Wiltshire in September 2000. The Duke of York and Ghislaine Maxwell leaving the wedding of his former girlfriend Aurelia Cecil in September 2000 The Duke of York and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the event in Wiltshire Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell were again photographed together at a Halloween party,externalthrown by model Heidi Klum in Manhattan. Ms Maxwell was pictured dressed in gold lame and wearing a blonde wig for the Hookers and Pimps-themed party. Just over a month later, in December 2000, the then 40-year-old prince threw Ms Maxwell a surprise birthday party at Sandringham, the Queen's estate in Norfolk, with Epstein among the guests. He described it in the BBC interview as a ""straightforward shooting weekend"". Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Sandringham in December 2000 Ms Maxwell and Epstein were photographed on a pheasant shoot at the estate around that time. Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell went on a number of trips together including to Florida and Thailand, according to an Evening Standard report from January 2001, which claimed Epstein had joined them on five such occasions over the previous 12 months. Prince Andrew told the BBC that he used to see Epstein a maximum of three times a year but confirmed he had been on his private plane, stayed at his private island, and stayed at his homes in Palm Beach, Florida and New York. Allegations against Jeffrey Epstein started surfacing in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. The financier was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. However, a controversial secret plea deal in 2008 saw him plead guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence and was released on probation after 13 months. In July 2019 he was charged in New York with further allegations of sex trafficking and conspiracy and was due to face trial next year. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges but was facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? In July 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was invited toa masked ball at Windsor Castle to celebrate the 18th birthday of Princess Beatrice,external, Prince Andrew's elder daughter. The theme of the evening was 1888, and the 500 guests donned period costumes. The previous month,  Epstein was charged with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Prince Andrew said Epstein had been invited via Ms Maxwell but that he wasn't aware at the time the invitation was sent out ""what was going on in the United States"". He said Epstein never mentioned that he was under investigation. The duke was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in December 2010 - after the tycoon had served his sentence. Prince Andrew said he had travelled across the Atlantic to end his friendship with Epstein and was having that conversation with him when they were photographed in the park. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 The prince told the BBC: ""I said, 'Look, because of what has happened, I don't think it is appropriate that we should remain in contact.'"" Prince Andrew said he attended a small dinner party while he was there but denied it was to celebrate Epstein's release. Footage released by the Mail on Sunday in August showed Prince Andrew inside the financier's Manhattan mansion around the same time. The prince told the BBC that he regretted staying at Epstein's house during the visit, saying he ""let the side down"" by doing so. Pressed on reports that many young girls were coming and going from the house at the time, he said: ""I never saw them."" Epstein's house was like a ""railway station"" with ""people coming in and out of that house all the time"", he added. Prince Andrew's connection to the convicted sex offender did attract criticism at the time. After several days of newspaper reports on the Epstein connection in spring of 2011, Prince Andrew was hit with a further blow when Sarah Ferguson admitted having accepted Â£15,000 from Epstein, to help pay off her debts. Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson in 2011 - she is said to have accepted Â£15,000 from Epstein that year The fallout saw him quit his role as a UK trade envoy in July 2011.Prince Andrew later acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been a mistake. In 2015the duke was named in court papersas part of a US civil case against Epstein. Prince Andrew was not party to the proceedings but was identified when a motion was filed in the court, as part of the evidence. According to the Guardian,external, one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was ordered to give the prince ""whatever he required"". Prince Andrew with Virginia Roberts in early 2001, said to have been taken at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is standing behind the pair Ms Giuffre claimed in court papers in Florida she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, including when she was underage under Florida law. The details were later officially struck from the court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, an allegation by a woman called Johanna Sjoberg that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 was contained in documents from a defamation case. These documents were made public when they were released by a judge in August 2019. Ms Giuffre had brought the defamation case against Ms Maxwell. She was alleged to have procured underage girls for Epstein and his friends, but she has always denied the allegations. Prince Andrew said he had ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Ms Giuffre. He said he was looking after his children on the day in March 2001 that she alleges they went to a nightclub in London and later had sex in Ms Maxwell's house in the Belgravia area. The prince said he had taken his daughter Beatrice to a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking that afternoon for a party. He said he remembered it ""because going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I would like to reiterate and reaffirm the statements that have been issued on my behalf by the palace"" Prince Andrew said he had no recollection of a photo being taken, reportedly by Jeffrey Epstein, of him and Virginia Giuffre together in Ms Maxwell's house where his arm is around her waist. ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken,"" he said, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". Asked whether he had sex with her in a bedroom in that house, he said: ""I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.""

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I let the side down, simple as that"" The Duke of York has said he ""let the side down"" by staying at the home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, adding it was the ""wrong thing to do"". Answering questions about his links to Epstein for the first time, Prince Andrew said his stay was not ""becoming of a member of the Royal Family"". The prince spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in an interview recorded at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. It will be broadcast onBBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Saturday. Explained: Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Timeline: Prince Andrew's links to Epstein Prince Andrew, who is the Queen's third child, has been facing questions for several months over his ties to Epstein, a 66-year-old American financier who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. In 2010, the prince was photographed walking with Epstein in New York's Central Park -two years after Epstein's convictionfor soliciting a minor for prostitution. Footagepublished by the Mail on Sunday,externalshowed the prince in Epstein's Manhattan mansion at about the same time. Addressing his decision to stay with Epstein following the American's first conviction, Prince Andrew said: ""That's the bit thatâ¦ as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal Family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."" Challenged on his decision to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender, the prince said: ""It was a convenient place to stay. ""I mean I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. ""But at the time I felt it was the honourable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable but that's just the way it is."" Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein go for a stroll together through New York's Central Park In 2015, Prince Andrew was named in court papers as part of a US civil case against Epstein. One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew ""knows exactly what he's done"" In the BBC interview, Emily Maitlis asks the prince about Ms Giuffre's claims that in 2001, she had dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub, and went on to have sex with him at the house of a friend of the prince in Belgravia, central London. The prince replied: ""It didn't happen. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" When asked once more whether he remembered meeting Ms Giuffre, the prince said: ""No."" Ms Giuffre says she was abused by the prince in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, where she was pictured in 2001 Details of Ms Giuffre's claims against the prince were later officially struck from court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, a woman called Johanna Sjoberg alleged that the prince touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 in documents from a defamation case. Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials of all allegations against the prince. And Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson,wrote on Friday,externalthat the prince was a ""true [and] real gentleman and is stoically steadfast not only [in] his duty but also his kindness"". In 2015, a statement from the palace said that ""any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors"" by the prince was ""categorically untrue"". The prince first met Epstein in 1999 and they saw each other on several occasions after that. In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Prosecutors forged a deal with Epstein in 2008, which saw him avoid federal charges. He instead received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace in August, the prince said he was ""appalled"" by the sex abuse claims surrounding his former friend. The statement added: ""His royal highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.""

"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets across Iran as fuel price rises were introduced Iran's Interior Minister has warned security officials will step up action against protesters taking to the streets over a new petrol policy. Protests have erupted across Iran after the government unexpectedly announced it was rationing petrol and increasing its price. At least one person has been killed and others injured in the violence. Officials say the changes, which have seen prices rise by at least 50%, will free up money to help the poor. Iran is already suffering economically due to stiff sanctions imposed by the US after Washington decided to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Iran's network of influence in Mid-East 'growing' Protests erupted hours after the new policies were announced on Friday - with fresh demonstrations on Saturday in some cities. There are also reports that access to the internet may have been restricted, Reuters reported citing a web monitoring group. Protests have also spread to the capital Tehran Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli, speaking during an interview with state television on Saturday, warned that law enforcement and security officials will have ""no choice"" but to step in and restore calm if ""illegal"" actions continue. Mr Rahmani-Fazli criticised a ""limited number"" of people whom he accused of abusing the public mood to create ""intimidation and terror"". At least one person was killed during protests in the central city of Sirjan on Friday, officials confirmed. State news agency Irna said there were clashes with police when protesters attacked a fuel storage warehouse on Friday and tried to set fire to it. Fresh protests were held Saturday in the cities of Doroud, Garmsar, Gorgan, Ilam, Karaj, Khoramabad, Mehdishahr, Qazvin, Qom, Sanandaj, Shahroud and Shiraz, Irna reported. Footage posted on social media suggest other people may have been killed on Saturday. The semi-official Isna news agency reported that security officials have threatened to legally pursue social media users who were sharing footage online. A statement, accredited to the Security Emergency Centre (SEC) of Iran's Interior Ministry, accused some users ""rumour-mongering"" and ""spreading lies"" about the protests. The report also claimed that footage was being recycled from incidents in previous years to undermine public confidence and disrupt national security. A highway in Tehran, pictured on Saturday On both days there were reports of angry motorists blocking some roads by turning off car engines or abandoning vehicles in traffic. Videos posted online purportedly showed motorists in the capital, Tehran, stopping traffic on the Imam Ali Highway and chanting for the police to support them. Another clip shows what appeared to be a roadblock across the Tehran-Karaj motorway, hit by the season's first heavy snowfall. Other videos spreading online show clashes between security forces and protesters, and banks burning in several cities. Some pictures appeared to show police stations aflame in the southern city of Shiraz. Speaking on Iranian state TV, Prosecutor General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri blamed a ""few disruptors"" for the protests. He urged people to distance themselves from those who - in his words - want to show their opposition to the Islamic system. He also accused the protesters of having ""roots outside the country"". Under the new fuel measures, each motorist is allowed to buy 60 litres (13 gallons) of petrol a month at 15,000 rials ($0.13; Â£0.10) a litre. Each additional litre then costs 30,000 rials. Previously, drivers were allowed up to 250 litres at 10,000 rials per litre, AP reports. The revenues gained from removing subsidies on petrol will be used for cash payments to low-income households, the government says. Protestors took to the streets in Shiraz The head of the Iranian Planning and Budget Organisation, Mohammad Baqer Nobakht, said that from this month, 18 million families would get an extra cash allowance as a result of the price increase. The new measure is expected to bring in 300tn rials per annum, he said on state television. President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that 75% of Iranians were currently ""under pressure"" and the extra revenues from the petrol price hike would go to them and not the treasury. Iran has some of the world's cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall in value of its currency. It is also one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. But it has limited refining capacity and sanctions have made it difficult to obtain spare parts for oil plants. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Sanctions were reimposed last year after US President Donald Trump abandoned the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its controversial nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Since the US left the deal, Iran has been gradually stepping up its nuclear activity in breach of the accord, though it has consistently denied wanting to develop nuclear weapons. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors and triggering protests.

"Only 41 of the 353 councils who returned figures to central government reported a loss on their parking operations Councils in England made a total of Â£930m from parking activities in a year, figures show. The record figure during the past financial year is a 7% increase on 2017-18, the RAC Foundation says. Seventeen of the 20 councils making the most money are in London, with Westminster Council accruing the largest amount, at Â£69m. Brighton and Hove, Birmingham and Milton Keynes were the only three in the top 20 not in the capital. Kensington and Chelsea was second in London, with a total of Â£37m. Any money made from parking activities - which includes fines and tickets - must be spent on local transport projects. The study was carried out by transport consultant David Leibling, who analysed Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government data. Local authorities received an income of Â£1.746bn from their parking operations in 2018-19, which included Â£454m from penalties, which is up 6% year-on-year. The amount councils spent on running their day-to-day parking operations was Â£816m, not including interest payments or depreciation of assets such as car parks. David Renard, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said London had the highest number of vehicles moving about looking for spaces to park. ""I would expect the higher volume of vehicles moving around London means there'll be a higher level of infringement and fines,"" he said. ""[Councils] seek to ensure they can keep the traffic moving as efficiently as possible and that means people who infringe the regulations will get fined,"" he said.

"Jeremy Corbyn has hailed Labour's ""transformative"" manifesto after finalising the document in a meeting with senior party figures. The Labour leader said a ""unanimous agreement"" was reached by key union backers and his shadow cabinet after six hours of talks in London. The details in the manifesto for the general election on 12 December are expected to be released on Thursday. It is billed as ""more radical"" than the document campaigned on in 2017. The party has already announced a number of policies, including a part-nationalisation of BT and extra spending on infrastructure. But members had to decide in the talks on Saturday whether to include some policies from its party conference, including on free movement of people from the EU to the UK. Mr Corbyn said he was ""very, very proud"" of the contents of the manifesto that gives the ""promise of a better Britain"". Speaking on the steps of the Institute of Engineering and Technology after the meeting, he said: ""That manifesto is a transformative document that will change the lives of the people of this country for the better. ""It will be a once in a generation opportunity to vote for a more egalitarian society that cares for all."" McCluskey on Labour, Brexit and the election Labour pledges free broadband for all So where do main parties stand on immigration? The BBC's Iain Watson said the party is expected to pledge additional support for women affected when the government in 2011 sped up plans to raise the age at which women could claim the state pension from 60 to 66. Ahead of the talks, party figures were expected to debate whether to include a commitment to ""maintain and extend"" free movement rights for migrants, asdemanded by delegatesat September's party conference. The party's 2017 manifesto stated that free movement - giving EU citizens the right to work and seek employment in the UK and UK citizens the same right in other EU countries - would end with Brexit. A small number of protesters gathered outside the meeting, chanting in support of free movement. The Liberal Democrats earlier called on Labour to make a ""cast-iron commitment"" to preserve free movement rights in its manifesto. LIVE :Latest election updates CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The party's home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said failing to do so would be a ""betrayal of future generations"". The Lib Dems are pledging a ""fair, effective"" immigration system if it is elected - with plans to resettle 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children a year. However, some within Labour are concerned that a more open policy on immigration could alienate voters in Leave-voting areas. Len McCluskey - the leader of the Unite, the biggest Labour-supporting union - has called for new employment policies to address concerns about freedom of movement. As he headed into the manifesto meeting, Mr Corbyn said it would be ""transformative"" On Thursday, he denied a newspaper report that he had told Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to take a tough line on free movement of workers. But he said Labour would ""protect all workers"" through labour market regulations. ""It won't stop the free movement of labour. It will effectively make certain that greedy bosses, agency companies, are not abusing working people,"" he said. There was a disagreement during the talks over whether to incorporate the conference policy of extending freedom of movement for workers in the manifesto. Freedom of movement will continue if voters back Remain in the new referendum which Labour is pledging. If voters back Leave, Labour would introduce its own immigration policy but, as the party wants a close relationship with the single market, it recognises there would be high levels of labour mobility. But this would be underpinned by stricter regulation of the employment market to prevent migrant workers ""undercutting"" employees here and to stop migrants being exploited. Some policies were agreed and not yet announced, for example, a process for compensating women adversely affected by a more rapid rise in the state pension age than they anticipated. Prescriptions and dental checks will also be free in England too. On Friday, Mr Corbyn confirmed an existing pledge to abolish university tuition fees will be included in the party's manifesto for the 12 December poll. He also said bringing Royal Mail, rail and water utilities under public ownership ""are clearly going to be in our manifesto next week"". Other parties have also begun announcing policies ahead of the official launch of their manifestos later in the campaign. On Saturday, both the Lib Dems and the Conservatives made rival pledges on tree planting. The Conservatives also announced Â£500m of funding over the next five years to help support developing countries in protecting oceans. The Conservatives and Labour areset to field candidatesin every constituency in Britain, except Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle's seat in Chorley in Lancashire. The Brexit Party has put forward 275 candidates, having stood aside in all the seats won by the Tories in 2017. Figures from PA suggest the party has also opted not to contest handfuls of other seats being defended by other parties, particularly in Scotland. How did manifesto meeting work? The so-called ""Clause Five"" party meeting offers an opportunity for senior figures to sign off on the party's manifesto. It is attended by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, including the shadow cabinet and trade union representatives. Party staffers present a draft document, whose different policy areas are discussed in turn. A vote is taken at the end of the meeting on the whole document, rather than voting section-by-section. There are usually some small amendments. Party positions are unlikely to change - but will perhaps be clarified. Who should I vote for?

"Barack Obama said most ""ordinary Americans"" didn't want to completely tear down the system Former US President Barack Obama has issued a warning to Democratic presidential candidates, cautioning them against policies that are not ""rooted in reality"". Mr Obama said Democrats risked alienating voters if they lurched too far to the left politically. The former president, speaking at a fundraising event, said most voters didn't want to ""tear down the system"". Mr Obama is yet to publicly back a Democratic candidate. The field is crowded, with 18 Democrats vying for the nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Who will take on Trump in 2020? The key issues for 2020 Democrats The frontrunners are former Vice-President Joe Biden, senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. At the event held in Washington on Friday, Mr Obama did not mention any candidate by name nor criticise any specific policy proposal. Instead, he used the appearance to urge Democrats to ""pay some attention"" to voters on issues such as health care and immigration. These voters, Mr Obama said, did not necessarily have the same views as what he called ""certain left-leaning Twitter feeds"" or ""the activist wing of our party"". The comments, which come less than four months before the Democratic primaries, represent one of Mr Obama's most pointed interventions in the race so far. This video can not be played Watch former US President Barack Obama talk about ""woke"" culture They may be seen as a critique of senators Sanders and Warren - widely seen as two of the most left-wing candidates in the field. Both candidates have called for far-reaching political and economic change, including policies that would end private health insurance and decriminalise illegal border crossings. But Mr Obama, who occupied the White House from 2009 to 2017, said the country was ""less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement"". ""Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality,"" Mr Obama said at the meeting, reportedly attended by wealthy liberal donors. Barack Obama, pictured here with Joe Biden after giving his election victory speech in 2008, is viewed as a moderate Democrat The Democratic race is still largely up in the air even as the first of the state-by-state votes that will decide which of the contenders challenges Mr Trump for the White House looms in Iowa in February. Some Democrats are concerned that Mr Biden, a moderate, will struggle to beat Mr Trump, prompting a flurry of latecomers to join the race. In recent days Deval Patrick, the two-time former governor of Massachusetts, entered the field amid speculation that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg may follow suit. Clinton 'under enormous pressure' to run in 2020 Michael Bloomberg signals run for US presidency Meanwhile, political gossip about whether Hillary Clinton might enter the fray continues to set tongues wagging in Washington DC. In an interview with the BBC, Mrs Clinton said she was ""under enormous pressure"" to challenge Mr Trump, who beat her in the 2016 presidential election. Election day is less than a year away now and the race to become the Democratic challenger to Donald Trump is hotting up.

"Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson planted a tree in north London to mark her party's pledge The Conservative Party has said it will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if it wins the general election - as the Liberal Democrats pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. The Tories' Â£640m fund would be used to plant trees and restore peatland. Labour dismissed the scheme and said the prime minister had an ""atrocious environmental record"". The Lib Dems would plant 60 million trees a year across the UK by 2025, leader Jo Swinson said. Under the Conservatives' scheme, branded the Nature for Climate fund, the party said it would treble the tree-planting rate to cover 30,000 hectares - meaning approximately 30 million trees - every year by the end of the next Parliament in 2025. One hectare is 100m x 100m in size. The Conservatives' fund would cover England, but the party said it would work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to increase tree planting. It means plans for the Northern Forest in north-west England and the Great Northumberland Forest would be expanded, while trees would also be planted in urban areas and in new forests, the Tories said. Tree planting rise 'needs to happen quickly' Tree planting: Your questions answered The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an advisory group of experts in science, economics, and business - recommends 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually. Less than half that amount was planted in the UK in the year to March 2019. Experts in forestry say a huge programme of tree planting is needed if the UK is to have any chance of reducing its carbon emissions to effectively zero. They also say that the aim, though difficult, is feasible but will depend on careful planning - ""to get the right trees in the right places"", as one specialist put it to me. Finding enough land may be one of the toughest challenges. Farmers will want incentives to convert their fields to forests, not just to help with the cost of planting trees but also to compensate them for the long decades before they can earn an income from them. Read more from David Conservative leader Boris Johnson said there was ""nothing more conservative than protecting our environment"". He said the measures would ""sit alongside our world-leading commitment""to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. The Conservatives look set to use the ""Vote Blue, Go Green"" slogan in this election, which was first adopted by David Cameron in 2010, but which critics say he abandoned once he got into power. LIVE :Latest election updates CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The Lib Dems said their ""ambitious"" proposals to plant 40,000 hectares - or, they estimated, 60 million trees - every year would increase UK forest cover by one million hectares by 2045. The ""largest tree-planting programme in UK history"" would be part of the party's plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the same year. ""Only the Liberal Democrats have a radical plan to make a real impact in the fight against climate change and build a brighter future for our planet,"" Ms Swinson said. Labour's shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said the Conservative Party's failure to meet previous tree-planting targets showed they weren't serious about the matter. ""When Labour comes forward with its own ambitious proposals as part of our Plan For Nature, they will be informed by what the science says is necessary and possible - not by what Boris Johnson thinks he needs to do to greenwash his atrocious environmental record,"" she added. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative environment secretary Michael Gove said the failure to meet the targets was due to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which he called ""unfair, unjust and un-green"". CAP funding is one of the EU's biggest policies with a Europe-wide budget worth more than Â£50bn a year. The subsidies are designed to support the farming industry and help farmers and landowners maintain their land. Although the EU does offer grants for planting trees, farmers can lose some of their agricultural subsidy if they increase tree cover and the application processes are complex, conservation groups have said. The European Commission recentlyproposed subsidising farmers to plant trees,externalon one hectare per farm under the post-2020 CAP. Mr Johnson's party also announced a Â£500m ""Blue Planet fund"" across the next five years to help support developing countries in protecting oceans. The sum would be funded by the budget for international aid, the Conservative Party said. The money would go towards, for example, UK satellites monitoring marine environments and ensuring protected areas were not subject to illegal fishing.

"26 days to go until general election on 12 December Senior Labour figures are in a meeting to finalise the party's manifesto - it has gone on since this morning and has yet to reach full agreement While planting a tree in north London, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says it is easy to see that Labour are divided The Lib Dems say they will plant 60 million a year by 2025 The Conservatives promise 30 million trees a year by 2025 Boris Johnson breaks off from campaigning in Mansfield to travel up to Bolton, scene of a major blaze at a student apartment block SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon says that a vote for the Conservatives ""is a vote for Nigel Farage and his view of the world"" Alice Evans and John Hand Female candidates are likely to comprise about a third of those contesting the 12 December poll. As our political correspondent Iain Watson said a few minutes ago, thecrunch meeting to finalise Labour's election manifestocould be far from over. The so-called ""Clause Five"" party meeting offers an opportunity for senior figures to sign off the party's manifesto. It is attended by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, including the shadow cabinet and trade union representatives. Party staffers present a draft document, whose different policy areas are discussed in turn. A vote is taken at the end of the meeting on the whole document, rather than voting section-by-section. There are usually some small amendments - but so far today there have been strong disagreements on the exact wording of several policies, our correspondent said. For example, some within Labour are concerned that a more open policy on immigration could alienate voters in Leave-voting areas. Keep an eye out on ourElection 2019 news indexas that's where you'll be able to read about the outcome of the meeting when it ends. Have a great evening. It's been a fairly quiet day for election campaigning today with much of the focus on where the party leaders went to forward their cause: Lib Dem Jo Swinson planted a tree, made pizza and chatted to EU nationals living in London We've not seen Jeremy Corbyn since this morning when he arrived at Labour's meeting to put the finishing touches to the party's manifesto SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon met North Sea coast locals. It's an area she says would be badly affected by Brexit Prime Minister Boris Johnson met voters in Mansfield before heading to the scene of the student accommodation block fire in Bolton Jeremy Corbyn might not want to make it too late a night at that Labour manifesto meeting. He has to be up bright and early in the morning to face questions from Andrew Marr on BBC One from 9am. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford are also on the show which has been specially extended by 15 minutes (hey, there's an election on!) Mixing with all the real politicians is actor Jason Watkins, who will be explaining just how much fun he is currently having portraying 1960s prime minister Harold Wilson in The Crown.

BBC News Channel Our political correspondent Iain Watson has been waiting for the Labour crunch meeting in London to wrap up - but he could be waiting quite a while longer. He tells the BBC News Channel: ""Apparently they're only about halfway through discussing the contents of the manifesto. That said, I think some of the more contentious issues have already been discussed."" The discussions started at about midday. Many of the disagreements, our correspondent says, are over the final wording of a few of the party's pledges. One particular battle continues to be the question of freedom of movement. ""Labour's conference policy said that they should not simply maintain freedom of movement... but also extend it,"" Iain says. ""And some people in the party felt this was a gift to the Conservatives - they've been very keen to keep that word 'extend' out of the manifesto. ""The precise wording has been argued about."" Other points of contention include: a possible pledge to make the UK net carbon neutral by 2030; a promise of free prescriptions in England and free dental checks; and a possible compensation scheme for women who were caught out by increases in the state pension age. It's Saturday afternoon so prime football-watching time, with the final whistle about to blow on many fixtures up and down the country (albeit not in the top two divisions of Scotland and England because of the international break). But it reminds us that the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam started a Twitter thread this week pointing out that there are Europa League fixtures taking place on 12 December and wondering whether there has previously been an occasion when football has clashed with an election day. When told by BBC colleague Callum May that it was probably Bradford City v Charlton on 1 May 1997, he rather dangerously ventured: ""Second division doesn't count (!)."" Cue a boggle-eyed emoji response from Brighton-supporting May, whose club has done its time in the lower leagues... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This week the BBC published its round-up of the policy guides from the parties fighting for power on 12 December. You can check out where the parties stand policy-by-policy and, crucially, nation-by-nation. But with several parties yet to finalise their manifestos, it will be updated and updated and updated. So if you want to see how it looks before Jeremy Corbyn comes out of that Clause V meeting,head there now.  Dan JohnsonBBC News ""The prime minister didn't make any open comments to the cameras, but no doubt he has come here very quickly. ""After starting the morning in north Nottinghamshire, he cancelled other events to come over here to Bolton - I think probably aware of some of the similarities that there are with this fire and what happened at Grenfell. ""The pictures are absolutely horrifying - the scale of this fire, the extent of the flames, and how quickly people have described it as spreading. ""Given the criticism that Theresa May faced, that she wasn't on the scene of the Grenfell fire quickly enough... Prime Minister Boris Johnson was very quick to come here."" The BBC's senior political analyst Peter Barnes posted his latest update on polling figures on Wednesday, which meant a shedload more data being added to the BBC's famous general election poll tracker.  In a nutshell, if you put any faith in what voters tell the pollsters at this stage of an election campaign, it is looking good for the Conservatives. The poll tracker can be followed throughout the campaign. A few minutes ago we saw the PM greeting people at Bolton University's students' union, where a relief centre has been set up after ahuge fire raged at a student accommodation blockfor more than nine hours last night. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called on the PM to give families living in tower blocks with cladding ""peace of mind"". Firefighters said an investigation had been launched into the blaze at The Cube. It confirmed the cladding on the building was not the same as that on Grenfell Tower, which wasdestroyed by a firethat killed 72 people in 2017. Mr Burnham told Sky News: ""It does not have the ACM cladding which is now banned, but it does have a type of cladding which does cause concern."" ""There will be many people living in buildings with this cladding today who will be very worried,"" he added. Grenfell United has said the Bolton fire ""brings back memories"" of the devastating blaze in west London. The group, which represents bereaved and survivors from the fire, said ""answers and urgent action"" are now needed from Downing Street and the Ministry of Housing. Allow Twitter content?

Our finest number-crunchers have been busy and on Wednesday we published this feature, which shows where you can find the ""ultra marginals"" that will be the main battlegrounds on 12 December. You can also peruse other maps which try to offer firm clues on how much the Remain and Leave factions will hold sway in different areas. Nine maps in all. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery says he fears claims the Tories offered peerages to Brexit Party figures in exchange for them standing down could be ""political corruption of the highest order"". ""If what Nigel Farage suggestsis true, that Brexit Party members have been approached by senior Conservatives asking to step down with the result being peerages, what state of affairs is our politics in? It's an absolute outrage,"" he says. ""This could be political corruption of the highest order and in addition to that it could be seen as criminal activity. This cannot be accepted,"" he adds. On Tuesday, Sima Kotecha from BBC Radio 4's Today programme shone a light on a sticky campaign issue for Labour. She reported that anger from Hindu communities over Labour passing a motion criticising India's actions in Kashmir at its annual conference has led to several WhatsApp messages being sent to Hindus across the country urging them to vote Conservatives. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery has stepped in to reassure Hindus that the party is ""fully aware of the sensitivities that exist over the situation in Kashmir"". Sima's full reportcan be read here.  While many people are smiling and greeting the PM, not everyone is happy with his visit. ""Don't talk to us, get out of here,"" one man says. ""How dare you come up here a day late?"" The PM is being shown around Bolton University by Ansh Sachdeva, the students' union president. He's being shown the food and other resources that are being handed out to the hundreds of students who fled the burning building overnight. Boris Johnson has arrived in Bolton to visit the scene of the huge fire at a block of student flats. It's been stressed by his party that this is not related to Mr Johnson's election campaigning, but is instead in his capacity as prime minister. A row has broken out over the reliability of fire alarms at The Cube after the blaze forced the evacuation of hundreds of students. The SNP has backed a probe into two allegations of electoral fraud, afterclaims the Tories offered peerages to Brexit Party election candidates to persuade them to stand down. Tommy Sheppard, the SNP candidate for Edinburgh, insists there should be an urgent inquiry by the Cabinet Office. He says the allegations ""go to the heart of the abuse of the peerage system"" and calls for a ""full and frank investigation"".

"This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets interrupt hearing The curtain came up on day two of the House of Representatives' public impeachment hearings and, once again, the proceedings started off with a bang. On Wednesday, it was disclosure of an overheard phone call between Donald Trump and US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland during which the president may have asked about Ukrainian investigations. Friday's big developments included the White House release of a contradictory readout of the Mr Trump's first phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a presidential tweet that had Republicans in Congress scrambling. Mr Trump has boasted that his conduct while in office - blunt language and shoot-from-the-hip tweeting - is ""modern-day presidential"". If so, welcome to a modern-day presidential impeachment hearing. Just over an hour into Marie Yovanovitch's testimony, Mr Trump launched the kind of Twitter fusillade that has become a regular part of his political repertoire. He questioned the ambassador's competence, noted that the Ukrainian president spoke unfavourably about her and pointed out that he has the right to fire diplomats at will. What makes the moment historic is that Committee Chair Adam Schiff gave Yovanovitch a chance to refute the president's tweet almost in real time. Democrats are already characterising the president's behaviour as witness intimidation - and the latest attack by the president against one of his own government employees. Republicans, whose reported strategy was to avoid directly impugning the reputation of a long-serving, well respected diplomat, will once again find a president who has changed the rules of engagement on the fly. ""I disagree with the tweet,"" Republican congresswoman Elise Stefank told a reporter during a break in the hearing. ""I think Ambassador Yovanovitch is a public servant, like many of our public servants in the foreign service."" Mike Conaway, another Republican on the committee, said the president's tweet was ""not something I would do"". On Wednesday, the White House said the president was not watching the impeachment hearings. On day two, the president is fully engaged. His tweeting became the big headline from the morning's proceedings, helping to underscore Yovanovitch's contention that the president himself was the driving force behind her removal. Mr Trump may not be in the hearing room, but his presence is being felt. SIMPLE GUIDE:A basic take on what's going on GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents of a Pennsylvania town ON THE DOORSTEP:A Democrat sells impeachment to voters On Thursday morning, the White House released a rough transcript of Mr Trump's first phone conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky on 21 April. In it, the two exchanged pleasantries. Mr Trump congratulated Mr Zelensky on his election and suggested the possibility of a White House visit. Mr Zelensky invited the US president to his inauguration in Kyiv, and plugged his country's delicious food and hospitality. Mr Trump agreed, citing his experience with Ukrainians in his days as a beauty pageant impresario. The White House summary of the conversation released at the time, however, paints a different picture. It said Mr Trump ""noted"" that the Ukrainian election had been conducted in a fair and open process. It said he ""underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"". This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump And it said Mr Trump told Mr Zelensky that the two would work together ""to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption"". None of those things happened. It raises questions about why Mr Trump didn't talk about corruption or endorse Ukraine's territorial integrity in the call, particularly given Ukraine's history of prosecutorial misconduct and Russian support for insurgents fighting Ukrainians in the nation's eastern border region. The summary may have been what the US foreign policy team wanted the president to emphasise, but he did not. The White House regularly produces summaries of the president's conversations with foreign leaders. The disparities between the April Ukrainian summary and the actual conversation may leave many Americans - and foreign leaders - wondering how much credence to place in those documents.

"Firefighters have extinguished the blaze at The Cube in Bolton Cladding on a block of student flats that was hit by a major blaze is a cause for ""concern"", Greater Manchester's mayor has said. Two people were hurt when about 100 residents fled The Cube in Bolton after ablaze on Friday. Mayor Andy Burnham said its cladding was not the same as at Grenfell Tower,where 72 people died in 2017. But cladding is a ""bigger issue... than we have so far faced up to,"" Mr Burnham admitted. Residents of The Cube were also confused as to whether there was actually a fire in the building on Friday because, as one said, fire alarms go off ""almost every day"". Urban Student Life (USL), which manages the property, said all residents were successfully evacuated after the blaze broke out at about 20:30 GMT on Friday. In a statement,external, they said two students were treated for ""minor injuries"" on site, where up to 200 firefighters tackled the blaze. One witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the building Assistant chief fire officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said: ""The fire... really did spread very quickly and that was evident to see on the footage that's on social media."" He said an investigation had been launched into the blaze. Mr Burnham said: ""[The Cube] does not have the same ACM cladding [that was on Grenfell Tower] but nevertheless it does have a form of cladding that causes concern and raises issues that will have to be addressed."" He said he would talk to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited the Bolton site earlier, about whether ""we need to go further to remove cladding from these buildings and give families peace of mind"". Salford mayor Paul Dennett said he would be asking the government for more money to remove flammable cladding, adding there was ""an industrial crisis"" around the issue. Roy Wilsher, chief of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said the fire ""once again highlights how changes to building regulations need to be moved on at a much quicker pace"". The fire has led to damage on all floors of the six-storey building On the issue of the fire alarms, resident Afnan Gohar said she thought it was a ""false alarm"" ""We didn't take notice of it until a girl came running and screamed, telling us to get out and we didn't believe it at first,"" she said.

Melissa McGarrigle said: ""The fire alarms in the corridor went off but they aren't particularly loud, especially if you're asleep. ""It just doesn't feel real, everyone thought it was just the fire alarms acting up as usual until we heard people screaming."" The fire started on the fourth floor, the property management firm said Witness Ace Love, 35, said the fire ""kept getting more intense, climbing up and to the right because the wind was blowing so hard"". ""We could see it bubbling from the outside and then being engulfed from the outside,"" he added. ""A lot of students got out very fast, someone was very distressed, the rest were on phones calling for help. ""The fire got worse and worse, to the point where you could see through the beams, it was just bare frame."" About 200 firefighters tackled the blaze Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of welfare for the National Union of Students (NUS), said it had been ""calling for a number of improvements in fire-safety measures in student accommodation"" across the UK. ""It shouldn't take another fire to put the issue of building safety back on the agenda,"" she said. ""Student safety must always be the first priority for accommodation providers and the government."" Huge fire at student flats block In 2016, Urban Student Life (USL) was criticised in a tribunal ruling for not providing clear written guidelines on fire safety procedures or displaying fire safety notices in one of its student accommodation blocks in Leeds. Leeds City Council sent in fire authority officers to inspect the building, who declared at the time it was not fit for use. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), said the latest fire was ""deeply troubling"". ""This is not how any building should react to a fire in the 21st century, let alone a building in which people live,"" he said. ""It's time for a complete overhaul of UK fire safety before it's too late."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson met people helping residents after the fire in Bolton Les Skarratts, of the FBU in the north-west, said there would be ""hard lessons to learn as the circumstances become clearer in the coming days"". Forty fire engines were called to the scene of the blaze, which affected every floor.

"Smokers can improve the health of their hearts within weeks of switching to e-cigarettes, the largest trial of its kind shows. Themonth-long study,externalof 114 smokers suggests vaping has the potential to reduce heart attack and stroke risk. The team, at the University of Dundee, stressed vaping was ""not safe"" - just less harmful than tobacco. The British Heart Foundation said stopping smoking was the single best thing you could do for your heart. Chemicals in cigarette smoke narrow arteries as they get furred up with fatty deposits increasing the risk of a deadly blockage. Ultimately smokingdoubles your risk of having a heart attack,external. But the researchers said the current evidence on vaping was ""very poor"" and often assessed the impact of a single e-cigarette on heart health. Apple removes vaping apps from app store Vaping: How popular are e-cigarettes? What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US? So they monitored people's blood vessels a month after they were switched to e-cigarettes on the trial. They focused on how blood vessels expand when a wave of blood rushes through, by measuring ""flow-mediated dilation"". The more the blood vessels are able to expand the healthier they are. Flow-mediate dilation scores have been closely linked to the long-term risk of heart attacks and stroke. The results, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, showed: Healthy non-smokers had a score of 7.7% Smokers had a score of 5.5% But those who switched to nicotine e-cigarettes for a month had a score of 6.7% So, switching to vaping got those smokers about halfway back to a healthy score. ""They're not quite normal, but their vascular function improved quite significantly, just within a month,"" said one of the researchers, Professor Jacob George. The study is too short to fully establish whether or not this improvement could be sustained in the long-term or if vaping would definitely save lives. It is also worth noting that vapers did not have a normal score. Prof George added: ""The key take-home is these devices are not completely safe and should not be tried by non-smokers or children. ""We now have clear evidence they're less harmful than tobacco cigarettes."" The potential dangers of vaping were highlighted this week whena British teenager told the BBC how e-cigarettes nearly killed him. The devices set off a catastrophic immune reaction in his lungs that left him on life-support with his breathing replaced by an artificial lung. But overall, the advice in the UK is that vaping is 95% safer than smoking and that smokers should switch and non-smokers should not take up vaping. The British Heart Foundation said 50 people every day die as a result of heart problems caused by smoking. ""Stopping smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health,"" the charity said. Prof John Britton, director of the UK centre for tobacco and alcohol studies at the University of Nottingham, said: ""This randomised trial provides clear evidence of a reduction in a marker of cardiovascular disease risk in people who switch from smoking to vaping. ""The finding of the study, that vaping is less harmful than smoking, is intuitively correct on the grounds of the lower range and levels of emissions known to be present in vapour relative to tobacco smoke.""

"Firefighters are tackling the blaze at The Cube in Bolton Firefighters have been tackling a huge blaze at a university student accommodation block. Crowds of students were evacuated from The Cube in Bolton when the fire broke out at about 20:30 GMT on Friday. At its height about 200 firefighters from 40 fire engines were tackling the blaze which was affecting every floor. A witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the six-storey building. One person was rescued by crews using an aerial platform. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said two people were treated by paramedics at the scene. It said six fire engines remained at the scene at 05:30 as firefighters ""tackle the last few pockets of fire"". Area manager Jim Hutton said ""hardworking firefighters"" had prevented the fire from spreading to an adjacent building. ""Our crews have done a fantastic job bringing this fire under control, in what have been very challenging circumstances,"" added Assistant Chief Fire Officer Tony Hunter. One witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the building University of Bolton student Shannon Parker, who lives in the building, said she was in her room when the fire started. ""I heard the fire alarm going off but it kept on going off so I just thought it was a drill at first until one of my flatmates shouted down the corridor that it was a real fire,"" the 22-year-old said. ""So I ran out the flat as quickly as I could and I saw that it was one of the flats below mine and we went out by the fire exit."" She said she was being relocated to either a nearby hotel or another student accommodation building. Police have closed a number of roads in the area GMFRS has asked residents of The Cube to register at Orlando Village Student Accommodation and contact family members to let them know they are safe. The University of Bolton said it was supporting students who had been evacuated and had given people temporary accommodation at the Orlando student halls and in some hotels. Prof George E Holmes DL, president and vice-chancellor of the university, said: ""University colleagues have worked through the night to make sure support is in place for students over the weekend. ""We have also arranged to provide necessities such as toiletries for all students affected and are opening the university over the weekend so students can be supported. We will also provide food for them."" He said The Cube was not owned by the University of Bolton and that it was owned and managed by a private landlord. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch A US diplomat told Donald Trump Ukraine would carry out investigations the president had asked for, a US official testified at the impeachment inquiry. State department official David Holmes said he had overheard this during a call in July between Mr Trump and the US envoy to the EU, Gordon Sondland. Mr Holmes said the call came a day after Mr Trump asked Kyiv to probe ex-Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Trump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry as ""presidential harassment"". The inquiry is investigating whether Mr Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce a corruption inquiry into Mr Biden, now his rival for the US presidency. On Friday, Mr Trump launched a Twitter attack on another witness - former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Mr Trump wrote in the middle of her testimony. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go?"" Asked for her response, Ms Yovanovitch called it ""very intimidating"". Mr Trump later hit back, arguing his tweets were not intimidating ""at all"". He told reporters he had watched part of the impeachment hearing and considered it ""a disgrace"". How Trump tweet shook impeachment hearing The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Holmes, a US diplomatic aide, testified behind closed doors before lawmakers in Washington DC. David Holmes: ""Sondland told Trump that [Ukrainian President] Zelensky 'loves your ass.'"" He said he had overheard the phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Sondland in which ""investigations"" are said to have been discussed. He said Mr Sondland called Mr Trump from a restaurant in Ukraine's capital Kyiv on 26 July 2019. According to a copy of his opening statement obtained by CBS News, Mr Holmes said: ""Sondland told Trump that [Ukrainian President] Zelensky 'loves your ass.'"" ""I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' ""Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it', adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to'."" This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing Observers have drawn attention to the security implications of making the call from a restaurant, potentially exposing the conversation to eavesdropping by Russian intelligence. Mr Holmes' deposition appears to corroborateWednesday's testimony to the impeachment inquiry by US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor. He said one of his aides heard the same chat. The aide said Mr Trump had asked about ""investigations"" and Mr Sondland had replied that Ukraine was ready to move forward. According to Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland then told the aide that the president cared more about the investigation of the Bidens than anything else involving Ukraine. The call - which the US president has denied any knowledge of - allegedly happened the day after the now-famous Trump-Zelensky phone call. While giving her evidence, Ms Yovanovitch was alerted to the president's criticism by the hearing's chairman Adam Schiff. Responding directly to Mr Trump's tweet, in which he appeared to blame her for upheaval in Somalia, Ms Yovanovitch replied: ""I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu and Somalia and not in other places. ""I actually think that where I've served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better, you know, for the US as well as for the countries that I've served in. Her response was broadcast live during the televised hearing. Mr Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, suggested the president's tweets could be classed as witness intimidation. Why Ukraine is so important to the US How right-wing media covered impeachment hearings Ms Yovanovitch was removed as ambassador to Kyiv in May, two months before a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, which is now key to the inquiry. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. In earlier closed-door testimony, Ms Yovanovitch alleged she had fallen victim to a smear campaign at the hands of Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. She said Mr Giuliani had worked to discredit her while attempting to push Ukraine into the anti-Biden investigations. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president?

"Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson planted a tree in north London to mark her party's pledge The Conservative Party has said it will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 if it wins the general election - as the Liberal Democrats pledged to plant twice as many trees in the same period. The Tories' Â£640m fund would be used to plant trees and restore peatland. Labour dismissed the scheme and said the prime minister had an ""atrocious environmental record"". The Lib Dems would plant 60 million trees a year across the UK by 2025, leader Jo Swinson said. Under the Conservatives' scheme, branded the Nature for Climate fund, the party said it would treble the tree-planting rate to cover 30,000 hectares - meaning approximately 30 million trees - every year by the end of the next Parliament in 2025. One hectare is 100m x 100m in size. The Conservatives' fund would cover England, but the party said it would work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to increase tree planting. It means plans for the Northern Forest in north-west England and the Great Northumberland Forest would be expanded, while trees would also be planted in urban areas and in new forests, the Tories said. Tree planting rise 'needs to happen quickly' Tree planting: Your questions answered The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an advisory group of experts in science, economics, and business - recommends 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually. Less than half that amount was planted in the UK in the year to March 2019. Experts in forestry say a huge programme of tree planting is needed if the UK is to have any chance of reducing its carbon emissions to effectively zero. They also say that the aim, though difficult, is feasible but will depend on careful planning - ""to get the right trees in the right places"", as one specialist put it to me. Finding enough land may be one of the toughest challenges. Farmers will want incentives to convert their fields to forests, not just to help with the cost of planting trees but also to compensate them for the long decades before they can earn an income from them. Read more from David Conservative leader Boris Johnson said there was ""nothing more conservative than protecting our environment"". He said the measures would ""sit alongside our world-leading commitment""to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. The Conservatives look set to use the ""Vote Blue, Go Green"" slogan in this election, which was first adopted by David Cameron in 2010, but which critics say he abandoned once he got into power. LIVE :Latest election updates CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The Lib Dems said their ""ambitious"" proposals to plant 40,000 hectares - or, they estimated, 60 million trees - every year would increase UK forest cover by one million hectares by 2045. The ""largest tree-planting programme in UK history"" would be part of the party's plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the same year. ""Only the Liberal Democrats have a radical plan to make a real impact in the fight against climate change and build a brighter future for our planet,"" Ms Swinson said. Labour's shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said the Conservative Party's failure to meet previous tree-planting targets showed they weren't serious about the matter. ""When Labour comes forward with its own ambitious proposals as part of our Plan For Nature, they will be informed by what the science says is necessary and possible - not by what Boris Johnson thinks he needs to do to greenwash his atrocious environmental record,"" she added. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative environment secretary Michael Gove said the failure to meet the targets was due to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which he called ""unfair, unjust and un-green"". CAP funding is one of the EU's biggest policies with a Europe-wide budget worth more than Â£50bn a year. The subsidies are designed to support the farming industry and help farmers and landowners maintain their land. Although the EU does offer grants for planting trees, farmers can lose some of their agricultural subsidy if they increase tree cover and the application processes are complex, conservation groups have said. The European Commission recentlyproposed subsidising farmers to plant trees,externalon one hectare per farm under the post-2020 CAP. Mr Johnson's party also announced a Â£500m ""Blue Planet fund"" across the next five years to help support developing countries in protecting oceans. The sum would be funded by the budget for international aid, the Conservative Party said. The money would go towards, for example, UK satellites monitoring marine environments and ensuring protected areas were not subject to illegal fishing.

"Front-runners Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Sajith Premadasa Sri Lankans voted to choose a new president on Saturday, seven months after a devastating terror attack killed more than 250 people. A total of 35 candidates were vying for votes in the presidential election, the third since the end of the country's decades-long civil war in 2009. The current president, however, was not on the ballot. Maithripala Sirisena decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. The attack by Islamic State group-linked militants in April, which targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island, left at least 253 people dead. The government was forced to later admit it had suffered a ""major intelligence lapse"", with the defence secretary revealing an Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities. After polls closed, election officials carried ballot boxes to counting centres Just before polling got under way, gunmen opened fire on a convoy of buses carrying Muslim voters in the country's north-west. The perpetrators built a makeshift roadblock out of burning tyres, before shooting at the buses and pelting them with stones. Police said there were no casualties, but two women were injured by the stones. Meanwhile in the northern Jaffna peninsula, police said 10 men were arrested for ""trying to create trouble"". Despite these incidents turnout was reported to be high, with election chief Mahinda Deshapriya saying it was over 80%. Although there was a two-foot long ballot paper to accommodate all the candidates' names, this was an election with two clear frontrunners, one of whom has been accused of human rights abuses during his decade as defence secretary under his brother's presidential rule. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was in power when thousands of people - particularly Tamils - went missing in what have been described as enforced disappearances between 2005 and 2015. But it was also his role in ending the civil war that boosted Mr Rajapaksa's fortunes after this year's Easter Sunday attacks. His tough stance on security impressed many in the country's Sinhalese Buddhist majority following the attack, with supporters choosing to overlook the various allegations against him - including questions over citizenship. The importance of security to voters did not go unnoticed by his main rival, fellow frontrunner Sajith Premadasa. He launched his campaign with a promise that if he won, he would hire the army chief who defeated the Tamil Tigers, Sarath Fonseka, to oversee national security.

Like his rival, he already has a loyal support base. The son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993, he is the current housing minister and has managed to take on the Rajapaksa family in their own region. Yogita Limaye, BBC News in Colombo The ballot paper is the longest it has ever been in the country's history - 35 names. That's why the period for voting has been extended by an hour. I met voters coming out of a Colombo polling station, their fingers inked after they cast their vote. Shahini Liyanagama, a first-time voter, said the Easter Sunday bombings weighed heavily on her mind. ""It was the first time I thought I could die, because one of the attacks was very close to my home. I think my country is very unstable at the moment, so I want that to change,"" she told me. Mohommad Farouk Mohodin, a senior citizen, said he voted for a ""new line of thinking"". Many Sri Lankans believe the current government has failed to protect them, which is the big challenge for ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa. In the country's north where Tamil minorities live, there is the fear that Gotabaya Rajapaksa could win. He is accused of human rights violations against Tamils. Kanagasabai Ratnasingham, 82, believes Mr Rajapaksa was behind the disappearance of his son in 2006. ""If he comes to power, it will be dangerous for us,"" he told me. Mr Rajapaksa has always denied the allegations against him and among many of the Sinhalese majority, he is seen as the strongman who ended the war. Maithripala Sirisena swept to power in a surprise victory against Mr Rajapaksa in 2015. But he has decided not to try for a second term, with no explanation forthcoming. However, he is increasingly unpopular with Sri Lankans. Evidence he may have disregarded intelligence about the Easter Sunday bombings came hot on the heels of a constitutional crisis sparked by Mr Sirisena sacking his own prime minister.

Mr Rajapaksa said he planned to ""restore relations"" with Sri Lanka's top lender, China, if he wins the election. This may have been controversial in some circles, due to concerns over the size of Sri Lankan debt to the Asian superpower. Mr Premadasa, meanwhile, was seen as leaning more towards India and the US.

"This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch US President Donald Trump has attacked the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, on Twitter, in the middle of her testimony to the impeachment inquiry. ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Mr Trump wrote. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go?"" Asked for her response, Ms Yovanovitch called it ""very intimidating"". Mr Trump later hit back, arguing his tweets were not intimidating ""at all"". He told reporters he had watched part of the impeachment hearing and considered it ""a disgrace"". While giving her evidence, Ms Yovanovitch was alerted to the president's criticism by hearing chairman Adam Schiff. Responding directly to Mr Trump's tweet, in which he appeared to blame her for upheaval in Somalia, Ms Yovanovitch replied: ""I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu and Somalia and not in other places. ""I actually think that where I've served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better, you know, for the US as well as for the countries that I've served in. Her response was broadcast live during the televised hearing. Friday's testimony: How it unfolded The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, suggested the president's tweets could be classed as witness intimidation. The inquiry is currently investigating whether Mr Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new president to announce a corruption inquiry into former Vice-President Joe Biden, now his rival for the US presidency. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing and has branded the proceedings ""presidential harassment"". This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing Ms Yovanovitch was removed as ambassador to Kyiv in May, two months before a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, which is now key to the inquiry. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. A US diplomatic aide told the impeachment inquiry he overheard a phone call President Trump had with the US envoy to the EU, Gordon Sondland, in which ""investigations"" are said to have been discussed. State department official David Holmes testified behind closed doors on Friday about the call by Mr Sondland, from a restaurant in Kyiv, to Mr Trump. According to a copy of his opening statement obtained by CBS News, Mr Holmes said: ""Sondland told Trump that [Ukrainian President] Zelensky 'loves your ass.'"" ""I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' ""Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it', adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to'."" Mr Holmes' deposition appears to corroborate Wednesday's testimony to the impeachment inquiry by US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor. He said one of his aides heard the same chat. The aide said Mr Trump had asked about ""investigations"" and Mr Sondland had replied that Ukraine was ready to move forward. According to Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland then told the aide that the president cared more about the investigation of the Bidens than anything else involving Ukraine. The call - which the US president has denied any knowledge of - allegedly happened on 26 July, the day after the now-famous Trump-Zelensky phone call. In earlier closed-door testimony, Ms Yovanovitch alleged she had fallen victim to a smear campaign at the hands of Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. She said Mr Giuliani had worked to discredit her while attempting to push Ukraine into the anti-Biden investigations. Why Ukraine is so important to the US How right-wing media covered impeachment hearings On Friday, the former envoy accused the US state department - headed by Mike Pompeo - of failing to resist ""foreign and corrupt interests"" she said had ""hijacked"" America's policy towards Ukraine. When Ms Yovanovitch left her post, she was replaced by Bill Taylor, the current acting ambassador to Ukraine. Mr Taylor has testified before the impeachment inquirythat a member of his staff overheard a telephone call in which the president inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. Mr Trump has boasted that his conduct while in office - blunt language and shoot-from-the-hip tweeting - is ""modern-day presidential"". If so, welcome to a modern-day presidential impeachment hearing. Just over an hour into Marie Yovanovitch's testimony, Mr Trump launched the kind of Twitter fusillade that has become a regular part of his political repertoire. He questioned the ambassador's competence, noted that the Ukrainian president spoke unfavourably about her and pointed out that he has the right to fire diplomats at will. What makes the moment historic is that Committee Chair Adam Schiff gave Yovanovitch a chance to refute the president's tweet almost in real time. Democrats are already characterising the president's behaviour as witness intimidation - and the latest attack by the president against one of his own government employees. Republicans, whose reported strategy was to avoid directly impugning the reputation of a long-serving, well-respected diplomat, will once again find a president who has changed the rules of engagement on the fly. Read more from Anthony here In a break during the hearing, chairman Adam Schiff called the president's tweets about Ms Yovanovitch an effort to ""chill"" her and other witnesses who might come forward. He told reporters the ambassador had been ""smeared"" and ""recalled for no reason"", and was now experiencing ""witness intimidation in real-time by the president of United States"". Ken Starr, who served as special prosecutor during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, said on Fox News that Mr Trump's comments showed ""extraordinarily poor judgement"". But Republicans rejected the intimidation claim. ""The witness is testifying. She wouldn't even have known about the quote, if Mr Schiff hadn't read the tweet,"" Representative Jim Jordan said.

"Jeremy Corbyn has hailed Labour's ""transformative"" manifesto after finalising the document in a meeting with senior party figures. The Labour leader said a ""unanimous agreement"" was reached by key union backers and his shadow cabinet after six hours of talks in London. The details in the manifesto for the general election on 12 December are expected to be released on Thursday. It is billed as ""more radical"" than the document campaigned on in 2017. The party has already announced a number of policies, including a part-nationalisation of BT and extra spending on infrastructure. But members had to decide in the talks on Saturday whether to include some policies from its party conference, including on free movement of people from the EU to the UK. Mr Corbyn said he was ""very, very proud"" of the contents of the manifesto that gives the ""promise of a better Britain"". Speaking on the steps of the Institute of Engineering and Technology after the meeting, he said: ""That manifesto is a transformative document that will change the lives of the people of this country for the better. ""It will be a once in a generation opportunity to vote for a more egalitarian society that cares for all."" McCluskey on Labour, Brexit and the election Labour pledges free broadband for all So where do main parties stand on immigration? The BBC's Iain Watson said the party is expected to pledge additional support for women affected when the government in 2011 sped up plans to raise the age at which women could claim the state pension from 60 to 66. Ahead of the talks, party figures were expected to debate whether to include a commitment to ""maintain and extend"" free movement rights for migrants, asdemanded by delegatesat September's party conference. The party's 2017 manifesto stated that free movement - giving EU citizens the right to work and seek employment in the UK and UK citizens the same right in other EU countries - would end with Brexit. A small number of protesters gathered outside the meeting, chanting in support of free movement. The Liberal Democrats earlier called on Labour to make a ""cast-iron commitment"" to preserve free movement rights in its manifesto. LIVE :Latest election updates CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The party's home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said failing to do so would be a ""betrayal of future generations"". The Lib Dems are pledging a ""fair, effective"" immigration system if it is elected - with plans to resettle 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children a year. However, some within Labour are concerned that a more open policy on immigration could alienate voters in Leave-voting areas. Len McCluskey - the leader of the Unite, the biggest Labour-supporting union - has called for new employment policies to address concerns about freedom of movement. As he headed into the manifesto meeting, Mr Corbyn said it would be ""transformative"" On Thursday, he denied a newspaper report that he had told Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to take a tough line on free movement of workers. But he said Labour would ""protect all workers"" through labour market regulations. ""It won't stop the free movement of labour. It will effectively make certain that greedy bosses, agency companies, are not abusing working people,"" he said. There was a disagreement during the talks over whether to incorporate the conference policy of extending freedom of movement for workers in the manifesto. Freedom of movement will continue if voters back Remain in the new referendum which Labour is pledging. If voters back Leave, Labour would introduce its own immigration policy but, as the party wants a close relationship with the single market, it recognises there would be high levels of labour mobility. But this would be underpinned by stricter regulation of the employment market to prevent migrant workers ""undercutting"" employees here and to stop migrants being exploited. Some policies were agreed and not yet announced, for example, a process for compensating women adversely affected by a more rapid rise in the state pension age than they anticipated. Prescriptions and dental checks will also be free in England too. On Friday, Mr Corbyn confirmed an existing pledge to abolish university tuition fees will be included in the party's manifesto for the 12 December poll. He also said bringing Royal Mail, rail and water utilities under public ownership ""are clearly going to be in our manifesto next week"". Other parties have also begun announcing policies ahead of the official launch of their manifestos later in the campaign. On Saturday, both the Lib Dems and the Conservatives made rival pledges on tree planting. The Conservatives also announced Â£500m of funding over the next five years to help support developing countries in protecting oceans. The Conservatives and Labour areset to field candidatesin every constituency in Britain, except Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle's seat in Chorley in Lancashire. The Brexit Party has put forward 275 candidates, having stood aside in all the seats won by the Tories in 2017. Figures from PA suggest the party has also opted not to contest handfuls of other seats being defended by other parties, particularly in Scotland. How did manifesto meeting work? The so-called ""Clause Five"" party meeting offers an opportunity for senior figures to sign off on the party's manifesto. It is attended by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, including the shadow cabinet and trade union representatives. Party staffers present a draft document, whose different policy areas are discussed in turn. A vote is taken at the end of the meeting on the whole document, rather than voting section-by-section. There are usually some small amendments. Party positions are unlikely to change - but will perhaps be clarified. Who should I vote for?

"Brexit Party candidate Ann Widdecombe and leader Nigel Farage both said they had been approached Calls are growing for an investigation into claims the Tories offered peerages to Brexit Party election candidates to persuade them to stand down. Police say they are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud. Labour peer Lord Falconer has urged the Metropolitan Police and prosecution service to launch an investigation, saying the claims raised ""serious questions"" about the integrity of the 12 December election. The PM says the claims are ""nonsense"". ""I am sure there are conversations that take place between politicians of all parties but certainly nobody's been offered a peerage,"" Boris Johnsonsaid on Friday. The claims - first made public by the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage - came after the Brexit Party announced it would not field candidates in any seats won by the Conservatives in 2017, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote. But the party said it would contest all other seats, prompting pressure from Conservatives who urged Mr Farage to withdraw more candidates to help Mr Johnson win a majority in Parliament. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Nobody's been offered a peerage"" Ina video posted on Twitter,externalearlier this week, Mr Farage claimed he and eight other Brexit Party figures had been offered jobs ""in the (Brexit) negotiating team and in government departments"" while there had been ""hints at peerages too"". Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party candidate, said she was prepared to swear on the Bible that she had been approached with an offer of ""a role"" in the next phase of Brexit negotiations. A Conservative source also told the BBC that the Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough, Mike Greene, had been offered an unpaid role in education in the hope it would convince him to stand aside. The Brexit Party candidate's team said Mr Greene would definitely be running in the Cambridgeshire constituency, which Labour held narrowly at a by-election in June. In a letter, Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor, said he wanted to raise the issue ""as a matter of urgency"". He wrote to Cressida Dick, the Met Police commissioner, and Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, saying: ""I believe these allegations raise serious questions about the integrity of the upcoming general election, and in particular whether senior individuals at CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters) or No 10 have breached two sections of the Representation of the People Act 1983."" Lord Falconer added: ""These are exceptionally serious allegations which the DPP must, in accordance with his statutory duty, fully investigate as a matter of urgency. ""In addition, in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes and this election, it is crucial that the Metropolitan Police also examine these accusations."" Brexit Party peerage claims are nonsense, says PM Where are the seats that could turn the election? A really simple guide to the UK general election Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Lord Falconer said: ""The law is that if somebody corruptly induces or procures another person to withdraw from being a candidate at an election, that's both a crime and a corrupt practice in an election, which can lead an election to be set aside. ""From my point of view, it looks as if the Conservatives might be going well beyond electoral law in trying to win this election by persuading Brexit UK candidates not to stand."" Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""This could be political corruption of the highest order and, in addition to that, it could be seen as criminal activity."" He said there should ""undoubtedly"" be an investigation. Responding to the claims, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Nothing would surprise me about the Conservatives these days given what they've been prepared to do. ""If Boris Johnson's prepared to lie to the Queen, lie to the country, you know, I'm going to stop being shocked at where his lack of boundaries lies."" The SNP has also backed a probe into the allegations, insisting there should be an urgent inquiry by the Cabinet Office. Tommy Sheppard, the SNP candidate for Edinburgh, called for a ""full and frank investigation"". The Met Police said it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the general election.

"Front-runners Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Sajith Premadasa Sri Lankans voted to choose a new president on Saturday, seven months after a devastating terror attack killed more than 250 people. A total of 35 candidates were vying for votes in the presidential election, the third since the end of the country's decades-long civil war in 2009. The current president, however, was not on the ballot. Maithripala Sirisena decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. The attack by Islamic State group-linked militants in April, which targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island, left at least 253 people dead. The government was forced to later admit it had suffered a ""major intelligence lapse"", with the defence secretary revealing an Indian intelligence warning from the beginning of the month about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities. After polls closed, election officials carried ballot boxes to counting centres Just before polling got under way, gunmen opened fire on a convoy of buses carrying Muslim voters in the country's north-west. The perpetrators built a makeshift roadblock out of burning tyres, before shooting at the buses and pelting them with stones. Police said there were no casualties, but two women were injured by the stones. Meanwhile in the northern Jaffna peninsula, police said 10 men were arrested for ""trying to create trouble"". Despite these incidents turnout was reported to be high, with election chief Mahinda Deshapriya saying it was over 80%. Although there was a two-foot long ballot paper to accommodate all the candidates' names, this was an election with two clear frontrunners, one of whom has been accused of human rights abuses during his decade as defence secretary under his brother's presidential rule. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was in power when thousands of people - particularly Tamils - went missing in what have been described as enforced disappearances between 2005 and 2015. But it was also his role in ending the civil war that boosted Mr Rajapaksa's fortunes after this year's Easter Sunday attacks. His tough stance on security impressed many in the country's Sinhalese Buddhist majority following the attack, with supporters choosing to overlook the various allegations against him - including questions over citizenship. The importance of security to voters did not go unnoticed by his main rival, fellow frontrunner Sajith Premadasa. He launched his campaign with a promise that if he won, he would hire the army chief who defeated the Tamil Tigers, Sarath Fonseka, to oversee national security. The family networks behind the bombings Controversial ex-defence chief eyes power Sri Lanka's Muslims 'demonised' after Easter bombings St Anthony's 'church of miracles' a symbol of hope This video can not be played How the army finally crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after 25 years of bloody war However, Mr Premadasa has more regularly focused on social issues, promising to eradicate poverty and improve housing. Like his rival, he already has a loyal support base. The son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993, he is the current housing minister and has managed to take on the Rajapaksa family in their own region. Yogita Limaye, BBC News in Colombo The ballot paper is the longest it has ever been in the country's history - 35 names. That's why the period for voting has been extended by an hour. I met voters coming out of a Colombo polling station, their fingers inked after they cast their vote. Shahini Liyanagama, a first-time voter, said the Easter Sunday bombings weighed heavily on her mind. ""It was the first time I thought I could die, because one of the attacks was very close to my home. I think my country is very unstable at the moment, so I want that to change,"" she told me. Mohommad Farouk Mohodin, a senior citizen, said he voted for a ""new line of thinking"". Many Sri Lankans believe the current government has failed to protect them, which is the big challenge for ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa. In the country's north where Tamil minorities live, there is the fear that Gotabaya Rajapaksa could win. He is accused of human rights violations against Tamils. Kanagasabai Ratnasingham, 82, believes Mr Rajapaksa was behind the disappearance of his son in 2006. ""If he comes to power, it will be dangerous for us,"" he told me. Mr Rajapaksa has always denied the allegations against him and among many of the Sinhalese majority, he is seen as the strongman who ended the war. Maithripala Sirisena swept to power in a surprise victory against Mr Rajapaksa in 2015. But he has decided not to try for a second term, with no explanation forthcoming. However, he is increasingly unpopular with Sri Lankans. Evidence he may have disregarded intelligence about the Easter Sunday bombings came hot on the heels of a constitutional crisis sparked by Mr Sirisena sacking his own prime minister. This video can not be played Outgoing Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena: IS 'chose Sri Lanka to show they exist' And then there were a number of bizarre rants - aboutthe cashew nuts on board Sri Lanka's national carrier, for example, and aboutthe organisers of a gig by Spanish pop star Enrique Iglesias, whom Mr Sirisena said should be whipped. National security was arguably the biggest issue. However, equality for minorities and unemployment also played on voters' minds. What you need to know 16 millionSri Lankans eligible to vote 35Number of candidates vying for the top job Two footLength of ballot paper 74.32%Average turnout at previous votes But the two candidates also promised something different on the international stage. Mr Rajapaksa said he planned to ""restore relations"" with Sri Lanka's top lender, China, if he wins the election. This may have been controversial in some circles, due to concerns over the size of Sri Lankan debt to the Asian superpower. Mr Premadasa, meanwhile, was seen as leaning more towards India and the US.

Sri Lanka's war 10 years on: Finding Father Francis Sri Lanka profiled There was only one round in the election but voters could choose up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, the winner among the top two is determined after tallying the second preferences of voters. Results are expected on Sunday if one candidate secures more than 50% of the vote, but flooding in three of the 22 electoral districts disrupted counting, and could delay the results.

"Smokers can improve the health of their hearts within weeks of switching to e-cigarettes, the largest trial of its kind shows. Themonth-long study,externalof 114 smokers suggests vaping has the potential to reduce heart attack and stroke risk. The team, at the University of Dundee, stressed vaping was ""not safe"" - just less harmful than tobacco. The British Heart Foundation said stopping smoking was the single best thing you could do for your heart. Chemicals in cigarette smoke narrow arteries as they get furred up with fatty deposits increasing the risk of a deadly blockage. Ultimately smokingdoubles your risk of having a heart attack,external. But the researchers said the current evidence on vaping was ""very poor"" and often assessed the impact of a single e-cigarette on heart health. Apple removes vaping apps from app store Vaping: How popular are e-cigarettes? What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US? So they monitored people's blood vessels a month after they were switched to e-cigarettes on the trial. They focused on how blood vessels expand when a wave of blood rushes through, by measuring ""flow-mediated dilation"". The more the blood vessels are able to expand the healthier they are. Flow-mediate dilation scores have been closely linked to the long-term risk of heart attacks and stroke. The results, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, showed: Healthy non-smokers had a score of 7.7% Smokers had a score of 5.5% But those who switched to nicotine e-cigarettes for a month had a score of 6.7% So, switching to vaping got those smokers about halfway back to a healthy score. ""They're not quite normal, but their vascular function improved quite significantly, just within a month,"" said one of the researchers, Professor Jacob George. The study is too short to fully establish whether or not this improvement could be sustained in the long-term or if vaping would definitely save lives. It is also worth noting that vapers did not have a normal score. Prof George added: ""The key take-home is these devices are not completely safe and should not be tried by non-smokers or children. ""We now have clear evidence they're less harmful than tobacco cigarettes."" The potential dangers of vaping were highlighted this week whena British teenager told the BBC how e-cigarettes nearly killed him. The devices set off a catastrophic immune reaction in his lungs that left him on life-support with his breathing replaced by an artificial lung. But overall, the advice in the UK is that vaping is 95% safer than smoking and that smokers should switch and non-smokers should not take up vaping. The British Heart Foundation said 50 people every day die as a result of heart problems caused by smoking. ""Stopping smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health,"" the charity said. Prof John Britton, director of the UK centre for tobacco and alcohol studies at the University of Nottingham, said: ""This randomised trial provides clear evidence of a reduction in a marker of cardiovascular disease risk in people who switch from smoking to vaping. ""The finding of the study, that vaping is less harmful than smoking, is intuitively correct on the grounds of the lower range and levels of emissions known to be present in vapour relative to tobacco smoke.""

"Rodney Reed has spent 21 years on death row A court in Texas has halted the execution of Rodney Reed, convicted for murder, in a case that has attracted huge public attention in the US. Reed has been 21 years on death row for a 1996 murder. He was due to die by lethal injection on 20 November. More than 2.9m people signed an online petition urging clemency. Celebrities Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid have spoken in his support. Reed says he is innocent. His lawyers say fresh evidence proves that. Texas bans chaplains from execution chambers US inmate has 'no right to painless death' US inmate executed amid imam row He was convicted of the murder of 19-year-old Stacey Stites, who was found strangled after failing to turn up for work The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals halted Reed's scheduled execution. The decision came shortly after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended a 120-day reprieve for the inmate. The board also rejected his request to commute his sentence to life in jail. Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West was with Reed when he received news of his stay of execution. She told her followers on Instagram,externalthat words could not ""describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment"". Innocence Project, an organisation which has been working on the case, also welcomed the appeal court's ruling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The 19-year-old was due at work early in the morning of 23 April. She never turned up to the grocery store in Bastrop, near Austin. Within a few hours, the truck she drove was found abandoned. By that afternoon her body was discovered. She had been strangled with her own belt. Investigators found a very small amount of sperm cells - three in total - in her vagina. The semen came from a young black man, Rodney Reed. Death penalty: How many countries still have it? Police had his DNA on file because he had been investigated - but found not guilty - over a different sexual assault case. He claimed that he was having a secret relationship with Stacey. The murder weapon was never tested for DNA. None of Reed's fingerprints were found on the truck Stacey was driving. The case against him was mainly built around his semen. He said he'd had consensual sex with Stacey the day before she was killed. Expert witnesses told the murder trial that could not be true. They argued that sperm could not possibly have survived in Stacey's body for so long. Instead, they believed that she must have been raped shortly before being murdered. This was enough for an all-white jury to convict Reed. Reed's lawyers have been fighting to change this and havesubmitted new evidence (Warning: Contains upsetting material).,external The evidence focuses partly on the claims by forensic witnesses in the original trial that sperm could not survive for more than a day after sex. One of those medical experts, Dr Roberto Bayardo, has put out a sworn statement explaining that he is now aware that sperm can stay intact for days after death. And so, he says, there is no evidence that Stacey Stites and Rodney Reed had anything other than consensual sex. Stacey was engaged - due to marry a white former policeman called Jimmy Fennell. But now witnesses have come forward with statements about the couple's relationship. One woman talks about him saying that if his girlfriend ever cheated on him, he would strangle her. Jimmy Fennell An insurance salesperson remembers Jimmy Fennell threatening to kill Stacey Stites if he ever caught her ""messing around"" on him. Another statement comes from a former policeman. He says he remembers Jimmy Fennell looking at Stacey Stites's body at her funeral and saying something about her getting what she deserved. Jimmy Fennell went on to serve years in prison for kidnapping and sexually assaulting another woman. He was released in 2018. One of the new witnesses is a man who was in jail with him. Arthur Snow was the leader of a white supremacist prison gang. He claims that Jimmy Fennell told him that his fiancÃ©e had been sleeping with a black man behind his back. In a sworn statement he says: ""Toward the end of the conversation, Jimmy said confidently, 'I had to kill my n-word-loving fiancÃ©e'."" What does Jimmy Fennell say? His lawyer, Bob Phillips, says there is ""absolutely not a scintilla of merit"" in this claim. He toldCBS Austin,externalthat Arthur Snow is a ""career criminal"" who is ""trying to save his own scalp"". He also calls the other new witnesses ""laughable"" and questions why they waited so long to come forward. He maintains that it's ""absolutely untrue"" that Stacey Stites was having an affair with Rodney Reed. Texas bans chaplains from execution rooms How many countries still have the death penalty?

"This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch US President Donald Trump has attacked the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, on Twitter, in the middle of her testimony to the impeachment inquiry. ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Mr Trump wrote. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go?"" Asked for her response, Ms Yovanovitch called it ""very intimidating"". Mr Trump later hit back, arguing his tweets were not intimidating ""at all"". He told reporters he had watched part of the impeachment hearing and considered it ""a disgrace"". While giving her evidence, Ms Yovanovitch was alerted to the president's criticism by hearing chairman Adam Schiff. Responding directly to Mr Trump's tweet, in which he appeared to blame her for upheaval in Somalia, Ms Yovanovitch replied: ""I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu and Somalia and not in other places. ""I actually think that where I've served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better, you know, for the US as well as for the countries that I've served in. Her response was broadcast live during the televised hearing. Friday's testimony: How it unfolded The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, suggested the president's tweets could be classed as witness intimidation. The inquiry is currently investigating whether Mr Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new president to announce a corruption inquiry into former Vice-President Joe Biden, now his rival for the US presidency. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing and has branded the proceedings ""presidential harassment"". This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing Ms Yovanovitch was removed as ambassador to Kyiv in May, two months before a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, which is now key to the inquiry. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. A US diplomatic aide told the impeachment inquiry he overheard a phone call President Trump had with the US envoy to the EU, Gordon Sondland, in which ""investigations"" are said to have been discussed. State department official David Holmes testified behind closed doors on Friday about the call by Mr Sondland, from a restaurant in Kyiv, to Mr Trump. According to a copy of his opening statement obtained by CBS News, Mr Holmes said: ""Sondland told Trump that [Ukrainian President] Zelensky 'loves your ass.'"" ""I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' ""Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it', adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to'."" Mr Holmes' deposition appears to corroborate Wednesday's testimony to the impeachment inquiry by US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor. He said one of his aides heard the same chat. The aide said Mr Trump had asked about ""investigations"" and Mr Sondland had replied that Ukraine was ready to move forward. According to Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland then told the aide that the president cared more about the investigation of the Bidens than anything else involving Ukraine. The call - which the US president has denied any knowledge of - allegedly happened on 26 July, the day after the now-famous Trump-Zelensky phone call. In earlier closed-door testimony, Ms Yovanovitch alleged she had fallen victim to a smear campaign at the hands of Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. She said Mr Giuliani had worked to discredit her while attempting to push Ukraine into the anti-Biden investigations. Why Ukraine is so important to the US How right-wing media covered impeachment hearings On Friday, the former envoy accused the US state department - headed by Mike Pompeo - of failing to resist ""foreign and corrupt interests"" she said had ""hijacked"" America's policy towards Ukraine. When Ms Yovanovitch left her post, she was replaced by Bill Taylor, the current acting ambassador to Ukraine. Mr Taylor has testified before the impeachment inquirythat a member of his staff overheard a telephone call in which the president inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. Mr Trump has boasted that his conduct while in office - blunt language and shoot-from-the-hip tweeting - is ""modern-day presidential"". If so, welcome to a modern-day presidential impeachment hearing. Just over an hour into Marie Yovanovitch's testimony, Mr Trump launched the kind of Twitter fusillade that has become a regular part of his political repertoire. He questioned the ambassador's competence, noted that the Ukrainian president spoke unfavourably about her and pointed out that he has the right to fire diplomats at will. What makes the moment historic is that Committee Chair Adam Schiff gave Yovanovitch a chance to refute the president's tweet almost in real time. Democrats are already characterising the president's behaviour as witness intimidation - and the latest attack by the president against one of his own government employees. Republicans, whose reported strategy was to avoid directly impugning the reputation of a long-serving, well-respected diplomat, will once again find a president who has changed the rules of engagement on the fly. Read more from Anthony here In a break during the hearing, chairman Adam Schiff called the president's tweets about Ms Yovanovitch an effort to ""chill"" her and other witnesses who might come forward. He told reporters the ambassador had been ""smeared"" and ""recalled for no reason"", and was now experiencing ""witness intimidation in real-time by the president of United States"". Ken Starr, who served as special prosecutor during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, said on Fox News that Mr Trump's comments showed ""extraordinarily poor judgement"". But Republicans rejected the intimidation claim. ""The witness is testifying. She wouldn't even have known about the quote, if Mr Schiff hadn't read the tweet,"" Representative Jim Jordan said.

"This video can not be played Teresa Cheng is jostled in London China has condemned what it called an ""appalling attack"" by protesters on Hong Kong's justice secretary in London on Thursday evening. Teresa Cheng fell and was treated for an arm injury in hospital after being jostled by about 30 supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Chinese official Geng Shuang said some in the UK ""supported violent acts... to create chaos"" in its former colony. Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests. The campaign started in opposition to a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but it has since morphed into wider demonstrations backing democracy and opposing the actions of the police. Hong Kong in first recession for a decade Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The protests have continued unabated - Friday was the fifth consecutive day - and have often turned violent. On Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick thrown during clashes. A murder inquiry has been opened. Hong Kong meanwhile confirmed it had entered its first recession for a decade, with the economy shrinking 3.2% in July to September, compared with the previous quarter. The justice secretary had been in Camden, north London, to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub. Ms Cheng fell to the ground during the incident in Camden Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) when she was surrounded by a group of protesters. Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground. London's Metropolitan Police said they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had yet been made. ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm,"" a statement said. In a statement, CIArb said Ms Cheng had been ""assaulted by a crowd"". But one of the protesters told the Guardian she had slipped trying to escape from the crowd and ""nobody laid a hand on her"". Tom Tugendhat, chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee, condemned the behaviour of the protesters. Ministers ""visiting the UK should be able to go about their business free from abuse and assault. This is not right"", he tweeted. Mr Geng, China's foreign ministry spokesman, said the attack was ""directly related to certain British politicians confusing right from wrong on the Hong Kong issue and their support for violent acts, giving a platform to those who are anti-China and want to create chaos in Hong Kong"". Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong to close schools amid tense protests He said if the UK did not alter its approach ""and continues to add fuel to the fire, sow discord and instigate others"" it would ""bring calamity on itself"".

"Roger Stone arriving at court with his wife Nydia to learn his fate US President Donald Trump's adviser Roger Stone has been convicted on seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering. The court heard he lied about his efforts to learn more about when WikiLeaks would publish damaging emails about Hillary Clinton in 2016. The jury returned its verdict on day two of deliberations in Washington DC. Witness tampering carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. The other counts can carry five years each. The court heard Stone lied in September 2017 during his testimony to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee's inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the US elections a year earlier. He was asked about WikiLeaks' release of damaging emails about Mrs Clinton - President Donald Trump's Democratic rival in the vote. After Friday's verdict Mr Trump claimed that Stone had been the victim of ""a double standard"", arguing that the likes of Mrs Clinton and former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs he has sparred with had also told lies.

US intelligence officials and Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller later concluded those messages had been stolen by Russian hackers. Stone is the sixth Trump aide or adviser convicted in a criminal case resulting from Mr Mueller's since-concluded investigation. The trial heard Stone had told five lies under oath, including about his conversations with Trump campaign officials and a supposed ""intermediary"" with WikiLeaks in early August 2016. Roger Stone: Trump ally and Russia probe defendant He also lied about the existence of certain texts or emails. Prosecutors told the court that Stone had made the false statements to protect Mr Trump's image. Stone maintained the case against him was politically motivated. Roger Stone, who served as an informal political adviser to Mr Trump for decades, was convicted of lying to Congress, among other offences.  But it wasn't so much the fact that he lied, as it was what he lied about that could be politically damaging to Donald Trump. Federal prosecutors presented evidence during the trial that the 2016 Trump campaign viewed Stone as a conduit through which it could learn about the hacked Democratic documents that WikiLeaks possessed and when that material might be released. According to testimony by Rick Gates, deputy chairman of Trump's presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump had a telephone conversation with Stone discussing WikiLeaks. The president has said under oath that he did not recall any such conversations. His team has also disavowed any connection or coordination with WikiLeaks, which US intelligence agencies have concluded was being used by Russia to distribute the hacked Democratic material. Stone, prosecutors said, knew that if he truthfully testified about his efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks and pass information along to the campaign, it would at the very least be embarrassing for all involved. That, they concluded, is why he lied. Now that information is out anyway. And Roger Stone is facing years of incarceration. Stone had also tipped off the Trump campaign about new batches of damaging emails. He told Congress his intermediary with WikiLeaks was New York radio host and comedian Randy Credico, who interviewed Assange in 2016 - but prosecutors said Stone's actual go-between with WikiLeaks was a conservative author, Jerome Corsi. When asked if he had a comment, Stone told reporters: ""None whatsoever."" When Credico later testified to US lawmakers, he said Stone had advised him to ""do a 'Frank Pentangeli'"" - referring to a character in the Godfather movies who lies to Congress. Stone also threatened Credico's therapy dog, Bianca, saying he was ""going to take that dog away from you"", the trial heard. Meanwhile, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon also testified against Stone during the trial - telling the court he had boasted about his links to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. Stone appeared not to react to the verdict, ignoring a command to stand as it was being read out. As the jury reaffirmed their votes, he put his glasses back on to watch them. Former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo also refused to stand as the jury was leaving, despite being ordered to by a security officer. He was promptly removed from the courtroom. Prosecutors alleged that Stone communicated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones about the case on Thursday night, breaking a gag order. When Judge Jackson asked if this was true, Stone denied it - audibly telling his lawyers, ""it's not"" - but the judge added that she had ""serious concerns"", both about the gag order and about the ""nature"" of some of the people at the hearing. Among the media figures present at court were Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-right group Proud Boys, and Milo Yiannopolous. As Stone left the hearing, he told reporters who asked for comment that he had ""none whatsoever"", before posing for photos.

One witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the building University of Bolton student Shannon Parker, who lives in the building, said she was in her room when the fire started. ""I heard the fire alarm going off but it kept on going off so I just thought it was a drill at first until one of my flatmates shouted down the corridor that it was a real fire,"" the 22-year-old said. ""So I ran out the flat as quickly as I could and I saw that it was one of the flats below mine and we went out by the fire exit."" She said she was being relocated to either a nearby hotel or another student accommodation building. Police have closed a number of roads in the area GMFRS has asked residents of The Cube to register at Orlando Village Student Accommodation and contact family members to let them know they are safe. The University of Bolton said it was supporting students who had been evacuated and had given people temporary accommodation at the Orlando student halls and in some hotels. Prof George E Holmes DL, president and vice-chancellor of the university, said: ""University colleagues have worked through the night to make sure support is in place for students over the weekend. ""We have also arranged to provide necessities such as toiletries for all students affected and are opening the university over the weekend so students can be supported. We will also provide food for them."" He said The Cube was not owned by the University of Bolton and that it was owned and managed by a private landlord. Allow Twitter content?
