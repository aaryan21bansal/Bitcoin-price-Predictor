"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis said there was ""still time"" for Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement Brandon Lewis has refused to say when the Tories' European election campaign will launch, saying his priority is not to have to fight them at all. The UK is due to elect new MEPs on 23 May, after Brexit was delayed amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. Several parties have launched their campaigns already but Conservative chair Mr Lewis told the BBC his focus was on next week's local elections. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, or sooner if a deal is agreed. This means the UK must now hold European Parliament elections on 23 May if it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal. But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the elections.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. The Lib Demslaunched their campaign on Friday, with a pledge to do what they can to stop Brexit altogether. Nigel Farage's Brexit Partyandpro-Remain party Change UK'shave also launched their European election campaigns. Tories 'are transparent' on Islamophobia Party-by-party guide to UK's European elections 2019 European elections: List of candidates How do European elections work? Labour's NEC is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on its manifesto for the campaign. But asked about Conservative campaign plans on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis said: ""As a government, our first priority is to not have to fight the EU elections. ""I think we should be doing everything we can to respect that 2016 referendum, if and when we are at the point where we are definitely fighting those EU elections then we will take some decisions about that."" He said there was ""still time"" for the UK Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement - which it has so far rejected three times - in time so the UK could leave the EU and would not have to take part in the elections at all. He rejected reports about donors deserting the Conservatives, saying that 2018 had been a ""record peacetime fundraising year"". SomeConservative members reportedly plan to back the Brexit Party,externalat the elections, andConservative councillors in Derbyshire are refusing to campaign at all,externalin protest at the failure to have left the EU. Mr Lewis said: ""I don't deny the frustration people in our party have over where we are on Brexit. I share that frustration, I want to get this done so we don't fight those European elections."" He added: ""I hope that Conservative members, colleagues, volunteers, activists will come to want to not just vote for, but campaign for Conservatives to get elected, because ultimately Conservative representation is better than any other party."" Rebecca Long-Bailey said ""we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines"" On Sky News, Labour frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said the government was still refusing to move on ""any of their red lines"" in cross-party talks aimed at reaching an agreement on Brexit. She said: ""Honestly I think the discussions so far have been productive, they've gone into a lot of detail, there seems to be a willingness on both sides to move towards some form of consensus. ""But as yet we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines, we're having further discussions this week and hopefully we'll see some movement."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

"PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez promised supporters a pro-European government that would tackle inequality Spain's governing Socialists have won the country's third election in four years, but are short of a majority. PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez's party polled 29% and will need the help of either left-wing Podemos and regional parties, or the centre right, to form a government. Far-right party Vox also won seats - the first time a significant far-right force has done so in decades. Vox opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration, and what it calls ""radical feminism"". Analysts say support for Vox has been boosted by widespread anger at separatists in the province of Catalonia, who want independence from Spain. Vox fervently opposes any concessions to the secessionists. The other big story of the election was the collapse in support for the conservative Popular Party (PP), which governed Spain until it was dumped from power in May 2018 in a no-confidence vote. In its worst election ever, the PP won just 66 seats, down from 137 in the previous parliament. Turnout was 75.8%, the highest for several years and 9% more than the previous election in 2016. In his victory speech, Mr SÃ¡nchez said the party's big challenges were to fight inequality, advance co-existence and halt corruption. ""The future has won and the past has lost,"" he told cheering supporters. During his time in office he has raised the minimum wage, appointed a female-dominated cabinet and promised to strengthen rape laws, defining it as sex without clear consent. Socialists battle to stop right-wing surge Pedro SÃ¡nchez: Spain's accidental PM on a roll Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? After weeks of Spain's resurgent far right hogging all the headlines, didn't the centre-left just win a resounding victory? Did Spaniards have a last-minute change of heart? What does this all mean? Spain's Socialist party members will certainly have the biggest smiles on their faces this morning. But landslide victory this was not. The party improved massively on its last performance in national elections. It managed to take control of Spain's upper house of parliament too, but still lacks a majority to govern. Read more:Spain's general election: What just happened? The result is a personal success for the prime minister, who increased his party's share from 23% of the vote in 2016. But it still leaves the Socialists and Podemos 11 seats short of the necessary 176 for a majority in the 350-seat parliament. Mr SÃ¡nchez must now look for support from the smaller parties or from the centre right. An alliance with centre-right Ciudadanos (57 seats) would give him the numbers, but its leader, Albert Rivera, was bitterly critical of Mr SÃ¡nchez's collaboration with Catalan separatists, referring to his earlier ""Frankenstein government"" â and vowed he would not enter a coalition with the Socialists. And as Mr SÃ¡nchez gave his victory speech late on Sunday, supporters chanted ""Not with Rivera!"", making it clear they also did not want a coalition with Ciudadanos. It was a big night for Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera after the party's best result so far The head of previous coalition partner Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, made clear on Sunday night that another left-wing administration was possible. But the results appear to make any left-coalition dependent on Catalan pro-independence parties, which opponents on the right see as toxic. An alliance involving all the other regional parties, including the Basque nationalist PNV, would leave him one seat short of a majority. All parties are now looking towards the regional and European elections in less than a month. The PP's historic defeat means that, even with the support of Ciudadanos (Citizens) and Vox, it has no chance of forming a right-wing coalition, and leader Pablo Casado said it would become the main opposition force. But Vox saw its support surge, winning more than 10% of the vote, which gives it 24 seats. It received congratulations from other right-wing leaders, including Italy's deputy PM Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far-right National Rally. Nationalists vow to 'make Spain great again' Vox's success is seen as a turning point for the far-right, who have not won seats in parliament sincethe death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1975and the restoration of democracy â with the sole exception of a single seat for Blas PiÃ±ar in the first parliament of 1979â1982. Led by Santiago Abascal, a former PP member, the party has emerged in a matter of months with a vow to ""make Spain great again"". In his speech after the results, Mr Abascal said: ""We told you that we were starting a reconquest of Spain and that is exactly what we have done... and we can clearly say to all of Spain that Vox is here to stay."" Vox rejects the far-right label but its views on immigration and Islam place it in line with far-right and populist parties elsewhere in Europe. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? It wants to repeal laws against gender violence, and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Critics see it as a nationalist throwback to the Franco era. Vox aims to deport migrants legally entitled to be in Spain if they have committed an offence, and wants to prevent any migrant who comes in illegally from staying. The future of Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region was one of the big issues of the election. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain country profile Catalonia held an independence referendum in October 2017 and then declared independence from Spain. A dozen of its leaders have since gone on trial in Madrid, facing charges including rebellion and sedition. During last Monday's election debate, the leaders of the PP and Ciudadanos accused the prime minister of siding with ""enemies of Spain"" and wanting to ""liquidate Spain"". The centre-left Catalan ERC was the big winner in Catalonia, with a projected 15 seats. Its leader, Oriol Junqueras, is among those facing trial. Allow Twitter content?

"Avengers: Endgame has made box office history by taking a record-breaking $1.2bn (Â£929m) in global ticket sales in its opening run. The Disney blockbuster has become the fastest film ever to break the $1bn barrier, doing so in just five days. Endgame is the 22nd offering in the Marvel Studios superhero franchise. Its opening takings smashed the previous global debut record of $640m set by last year's Avengers: Infinity War. In the US alone, Endgame - which stars Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man - brought in a record $350m, and also enjoyed the UK and Ireland's biggest opening ever with takings of Â£43.7m. Avengers fans queue for hours for tickets Avengers: Endgame - A spoiler-free plot recap The Marvel Cinematic Universe explained Forbes,externalnotes that 45% of the global ticket sales came from 3-D showings around the world while $91.5m (Â£70.7m) came from IMAX screens, double Marvel Studio's previous opening weekend record. Also 4DX - the cinema experience with stimulating effects like water, wind, scent and strobe lighting - earned $15m (Â£11.6m) globally on the movie. Empire journalist, Helen O'Hara, believes familiarity and investment in the Avengers characters is the key to the worldwide phenomenon and that the above figures should have a positive impact on the industry as a whole. ""There's been 21 previous films and people have got to know these characters and they really care about them,"" she told BBC News, ""so we're desperately invested in everything that happens to them now. ""There was clapping in my screen, as well as cheering at certain points. It's really interactive at this point because we're just so invested"". She added: ""There were stories this weekend of sold-out cinemas, people were going to see all the other films because they were already at the cinema. ""So I think it is good overall. There is a risk that it could suck up all the oxygen in the room from other films but the secret has always been make a good film and people will see it one day. ""I think if people get into the habit of going to the cinema to see these movies then they're likely to keep going to see the other ones as well"". The movie drew huge audiences in China, where it made a record $330.5m after opening there on Wednesday, ahead of North America. Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn said in a statement: ""Though Endgame is far from an end for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these first 22 films constitute a sprawling achievement, andthis weekend's monumental success is a testament to the world they've envisioned,external, the talent involved, and their collective passion, matched by the irrepressible enthusiasm of fans around the world"".

"Searches have been carried out in Kattankudy The father and two brothers of the alleged organiser of the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, Zahran Hashim, were killed in a security forces operation on Friday, police say. Hashim, who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo, founded an Islamist group, the NTJ, which has now been banned. Police have raided the group's HQ in the eastern town of Kattankudy. The Sri Lankan president has announced a ban on face coverings, aimed at Muslim women following the attacks. Children of the Easter Sunday attacks What led to carnage? What is the NTJ? The attacks targeted churches and hotels, killing at least 250 people. Sunday church services were cancelled across the country as a precaution but worshippers in the capital gathered to pray outside St Anthony's, which was badly damaged in the attacks. Security forces raided a house in Sainthamaruthu, near Hashim's hometown Kattankudy, on Friday. Gunmen opened fire as troops moved in, police say, and three men set off explosives, killing themselves, six children and three women. Three other people died in gunfire. Police sealed off the NTJ's headquarters on Sunday A close family relative confirmed for BBC News that Hashim's father and two brothers died in the raid. Police sources who spoke to Reuters news agency named the three men as Mohamed Hashim, and his sons  Zainee Hashim and Rilwan Hashim. All three had been seen in a video circulating on social media calling for all-out war against all non-believers, Reuters adds. In Kattankudy itself, police searched the headquarters of the NTJ (National Thawheed Jamath), which Zahran Hashim had led. By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Sainthamaruthu The safe house was discovered after local people alerted police When I entered the house where the Islamists and their families were killed on Friday evening, the smell of death was unbearable. A police officer at the site also said Zahran Hashim's mother was also believed to be among the victims. Security forces have been conducting raids across the country but this safe house was discovered by chance, when the suspicious house owner and local people alerted the police. Every day, police are making arrests, seizing weapons, explosives and jihadist material suggesting the radicalisation process, however small it may be,  has been happening over a period of time. If the security agencies had missed this, then it is a colossal failure. The ongoing raids and discovery of weapons and material are gradually building up tensions among the communities. A hotel owner said she was worried because she was a Catholic. Muslims say they are nervous to visit Sinhala-majority areas. Some foreign governments have warned that there is a possibility of further attacks and if those happen, fragile ethnic relations could be further strained. Announcing the ban on face coverings, which will begin on Monday, President Maithripala Sirisena said he was taking the emergency measure on national security grounds. The announcement made no specific mention of the niqab and burka - worn by Muslim women - but instead said people's faces should be fully visible so they could be identified. Sri Lanka has been on high alert since a co-ordinated wave of bombings last Sunday, which also wounded more than 500 people. The bombings targeted churches that were packed full for the Easter holiday, as well as hotels popular with tourists. As well as St Anthony's Shrine, bombers struck churches in Negombo and the eastern city of Batticaloa, and hotels in the capital, Colombo. 'I invited the bomber into the church' The victims of the attacks Most of those killed were Sri Lankan, but dozens of foreign citizens were also among the dead. This video can not be played 'This is Sri Lanka': Fighting back with peace While the authorities have blamed the NTJ for the attacks, they say they must have had help from a larger network. The Islamic State group, which carried out mass attacks on civilians in Paris and other locations in recent years,  has said it was involved, but has not given details. Christians in Sri Lanka prayed at home while the Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, held a televised Mass, attended by the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He called the attacks an ""insult to humanity"" in the service, broadcast from a chapel in his residence. This video can not be played Sri Lankans pray and light candles, one week after a string of bombings by Islamist militants ""Today during this Mass we are paying attention to last Sunday's tragedy and we try to understand it,"" he said. ""We pray that in this country there will be peace and co-existence and understanding each other without division."" Scores of people gathered for the public service outside St Anthony's, where Buddhist monks joined Catholic priests in a show of solidarity with the Christian community. Crowds of people watched the heavily-guarded church from behind a barricade, with some singing hymns and passing rosary beads through their hands. Many lit candles and placed them in a makeshift memorial for the victims. The church's bells tolled at 08:45 (03:15 GMT) - the exact moment a bomber detonated his device one week ago. The hands of its damaged clock tower are still stuck at that time.

"More than 90 Labour MPs and MEPs have urged commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal agreed Labour's deputy leader has stepped up calls for his party to promise a referendum on any Brexit deal in its European elections manifesto. Tom Watsonurged party members,externalto message Labour's ruling national executive committee to call for a ""confirmatory ballot"" pledge. The NEC meets on Tuesday to decide on Labour's campaign manifesto. But frontbencher Barry Gardiner said a referendum on any Brexit deal would be a change in Labour policy. The shadow international trade secretary told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics that the party's policy agreed at last year's conference was to go for a referendum ""to stop a no-deal or a bad Tory Brexit."" He added: ""If we are being pushed into a no-deal by this government, we will have a second referendum. But we want to try - and that's why we're in there with the government now - trying to deliver on what people voted for."" Euro elections: Tories aim not to have to fight campaign Labour MPs push for referendum pledge Will Labour push for public vote? Hundreds of thousands of peoplemarched in central London last month to call for another EU referendum. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's deal or talks end in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it cannot force one, it added, the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". However, following parliamentary deadlock and a refusal by MPs to approve the withdrawal deal negotiated between the EU and UK, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus. And many Labour members now want the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a ""confirmatory ballot"". Mr Watson has been among figures calling for that pledge to be included in Labour's European Parliamentary elections campaign, arguing it is needed to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage's newly formed Brexit Party. On Friday it emerged that more than 90 Labour MPs and MEPs had written to the NEC, urging a ""clear commitment"" to a public vote on any Brexit deal agreed. Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson's party is campaigning to stop Brexit Asked whether another referendum was a ""red line"" for Labour in the talks, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Sky News: ""We are not being hugely prescriptive on the minute detail of specific elements because we are willing to compromise and we are willing to be flexible"". She said she was ""hopeful"" that in coming weeks ""we will see some movement"" in the talks. If all of the party's criteria was not met, she said ""all options are on the table which includes campaigning for a public vote"". And shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he expected the NEC to ""endorse Labour's policy that came out of the conference"". Mr Gwynne said: ""I want to ensure that we avoid a bad Tory Brexit or a no-deal scenario. In those circumstances, yes, I think that wasn't on the ballot paper in 2016, we should then perhaps ask the people 'is this actually what you want, a confirmatory vote, do you support what the government's proposition is?'. ""But let's see what comes out of these talks because I hope that the government can move on some of these red lines so that we can get a more sensible approach towards Brexit going forwards."" But Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, whose party launched its European parliamentary elections campaign on Friday with a ""stop Brexit"" message, told the BBC: ""Every Liberal Democrat vote is a vote to stop Brexit. ""A vote for Labour is a vote for Brexit. Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson will use those votes to say the British people want Brexit to happen."" There is some opposition to another referendum within Labour, amid concern about alienating party voters who backed Leave. Earlier this month 25 Labour backbenchers wrote to Mr Corbyn, urging him to rule one out and arguing that it would ""be exploited by the far right, damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election"".

"Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would ""live up to our responsibility"" on climate change Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference. The SNP leader told delegates in Edinburgh she was inspired aftermeeting young climate campaignerswho had gone on strike from school. Ms Sturgeon said ""they are right"", and pledged to ""live up to our responsibility"" to halt climate change. She also announced what she described as the SNP's ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence"". Labour is expected to press the UK government to declare a national climate emergency on Wednesday. The party will call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions, with leader Jeremy Corbyn also calling for a UK-wide ban on fracking. Fracking has already been halted in Scotland by Ms Sturgeon's devolved government. What is a climate emergency? Brian Taylor: Sturgeon reaches out to No voters Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? What does the SNP's new currency plan mean? It comes after weeks of strikes by school pupils and protests by Extinction Rebellion protestors, which have targeted both the UK and Scottish parliaments. Ms Sturgeon told the conference that Scotland is a ""world leader"" on climate change, and is already committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. She pledged that the country would continue to ""lead by example"" as our obligations to the next generation are ""the most important we carry"". Ms Sturgeon challenged her party to aim for a ""surge"" in support for independence The first minister said: ""A few weeks ago, I met some of the young climate change campaigners who've gone on strike from school to raise awareness of their cause. ""They want governments around the world to declare a climate emergency.  They say that's what the science tells us. And they are right. ""So today, as first minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it."" SNP members change leadership's currency plan UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The Committee on Climate Change is due to publish new scientific advice on Scotland's emissions targets this week. And Ms Sturgeon made clear that ""if that advice says we can go further or go faster, we will do so"". SNP MSPs - along with those from the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems - voted down a Scottish Parliament motion put forward by the Greens calling for a ""climate emergency"" to be declared on 27 March, after disputing the impact of the oil and gas industry. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said in that debate that climate change was an ""urgent"" matter, but that the government a duty to respond ""responsibly"" and ""keep Scotland's lights on"". Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Scotland is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Read more here Ms Sturgeon says she wants another independence referendum within the next two years Ms Sturgeon's conference speech came just days after she announced that she wants a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. The UK government has already said it will not grant the permission that Ms Sturgeon says is needed before a referendum is actually held. But she told party members that a ""surge"" in support for Scottish independence could force Westminster to change its stance. Ms Sturgeon said this would demonstrate that ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Mss Sturgeon said it was wrong to view Scotland as ""No voters or Yes voters"". Wrong to consider fellow Scots as ""Remainers or Leavers"". In a modern version of Jock Tamson's Bairns, she told delegates that they should view even those who are critical of the SNP as fellow citizens. Perhaps especially those who are critical of the SNP. Nationalists, she said, should make their case with ""decency, respect and dignity"". So far, so familiar. But there is more to this than the customary appeal for humane politics. This is also about strategy. SNP strategists look at the contemporary condition of politics. Febrile, brittle, divided. Fragmented by Brexit chaos. They have concluded that, in such circumstances, it will not do to be too overtly partisan, even about the issue which motivates the SNP - independence. You can only win a referendum if you get 50% of the vote plus one. That, for the SNP, means taking along with you people who are not currently convinced. Read more here Ms Sturgeon also announced a leaflet would be sent to every home in Scotland as part of the ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence in our party's history"". In addition, she revealed the SNP would create a social justice and fairness commission, which she said would ""set out how the proceeds of economic growth in an independent Scotland can be shared much more fairly"". The first minister predicted: ""If we can now show what is possible with the economic powers of independence, we will win a referendum."" She also revealed Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum will be introduced in May. The aim would be to pass it by the end of the year, she said, so it is in place should the UK government ultimately agree to a referendum being held. The first minister also described how her plans for a Citizens' Assembly would allow people from across Scotland to ""guide the conversation"" about independence.

"PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez promised supporters a pro-European government that would tackle inequality Spain's governing Socialists have won the country's third election in four years, but are short of a majority. PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez's party polled 29% and will need the help of either left-wing Podemos and regional parties, or the centre right, to form a government. Far-right party Vox also won seats - the first time a significant far-right force has done so in decades. Vox opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration, and what it calls ""radical feminism"". Analysts say support for Vox has been boosted by widespread anger at separatists in the province of Catalonia, who want independence from Spain. Vox fervently opposes any concessions to the secessionists. The other big story of the election was the collapse in support for the conservative Popular Party (PP), which governed Spain until it was dumped from power in May 2018 in a no-confidence vote. In its worst election ever, the PP won just 66 seats, down from 137 in the previous parliament. Turnout was 75.8%, the highest for several years and 9% more than the previous election in 2016. In his victory speech, Mr SÃ¡nchez said the party's big challenges were to fight inequality, advance co-existence and halt corruption. ""The future has won and the past has lost,"" he told cheering supporters. During his time in office he has raised the minimum wage, appointed a female-dominated cabinet and promised to strengthen rape laws, defining it as sex without clear consent. Socialists battle to stop right-wing surge Pedro SÃ¡nchez: Spain's accidental PM on a roll Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? After weeks of Spain's resurgent far right hogging all the headlines, didn't the centre-left just win a resounding victory? Did Spaniards have a last-minute change of heart? What does this all mean? Spain's Socialist party members will certainly have the biggest smiles on their faces this morning. But landslide victory this was not. The party improved massively on its last performance in national elections. It managed to take control of Spain's upper house of parliament too, but still lacks a majority to govern. Read more:Spain's general election: What just happened? The result is a personal success for the prime minister, who increased his party's share from 23% of the vote in 2016. But it still leaves the Socialists and Podemos 11 seats short of the necessary 176 for a majority in the 350-seat parliament. Mr SÃ¡nchez must now look for support from the smaller parties or from the centre right. An alliance with centre-right Ciudadanos (57 seats) would give him the numbers, but its leader, Albert Rivera, was bitterly critical of Mr SÃ¡nchez's collaboration with Catalan separatists, referring to his earlier ""Frankenstein government"" â and vowed he would not enter a coalition with the Socialists. And as Mr SÃ¡nchez gave his victory speech late on Sunday, supporters chanted ""Not with Rivera!"", making it clear they also did not want a coalition with Ciudadanos. It was a big night for Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera after the party's best result so far The head of previous coalition partner Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, made clear on Sunday night that another left-wing administration was possible. But the results appear to make any left-coalition dependent on Catalan pro-independence parties, which opponents on the right see as toxic. An alliance involving all the other regional parties, including the Basque nationalist PNV, would leave him one seat short of a majority. All parties are now looking towards the regional and European elections in less than a month. The PP's historic defeat means that, even with the support of Ciudadanos (Citizens) and Vox, it has no chance of forming a right-wing coalition, and leader Pablo Casado said it would become the main opposition force. But Vox saw its support surge, winning more than 10% of the vote, which gives it 24 seats. It received congratulations from other right-wing leaders, including Italy's deputy PM Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far-right National Rally. Nationalists vow to 'make Spain great again' Vox's success is seen as a turning point for the far-right, who have not won seats in parliament sincethe death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1975and the restoration of democracy â with the sole exception of a single seat for Blas PiÃ±ar in the first parliament of 1979â1982. Led by Santiago Abascal, a former PP member, the party has emerged in a matter of months with a vow to ""make Spain great again"". In his speech after the results, Mr Abascal said: ""We told you that we were starting a reconquest of Spain and that is exactly what we have done... and we can clearly say to all of Spain that Vox is here to stay."" Vox rejects the far-right label but its views on immigration and Islam place it in line with far-right and populist parties elsewhere in Europe. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? It wants to repeal laws against gender violence, and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Critics see it as a nationalist throwback to the Franco era. Vox aims to deport migrants legally entitled to be in Spain if they have committed an offence, and wants to prevent any migrant who comes in illegally from staying. The future of Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region was one of the big issues of the election. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain country profile Catalonia held an independence referendum in October 2017 and then declared independence from Spain. A dozen of its leaders have since gone on trial in Madrid, facing charges including rebellion and sedition. During last Monday's election debate, the leaders of the PP and Ciudadanos accused the prime minister of siding with ""enemies of Spain"" and wanting to ""liquidate Spain"". The centre-left Catalan ERC was the big winner in Catalonia, with a projected 15 seats. Its leader, Oriol Junqueras, is among those facing trial. Allow Twitter content?

"Three flights were diverted to Stansted Three flights have been diverted after a possible drone sighting at Gatwick Airport. EasyJet flights from Barcelona and Amsterdam were diverted to Stansted, as was a British Airways flight from Heraklion, Greece. All three later landed at Gatwick more than 90 minutes after their scheduled arrival time. Gatwick said it had investigated an ""unconfirmed sighting of an object"" outside its exclusion zone. A spokeswoman confirmed an Aer Lingus pilot made the initial report. The airport added: ""Following a full assessment, the airport has remained fully operational throughout."" How can a drone cause so much chaos? Stansted Airport said it did not anticipate any further diversions. A suspected drone closed the airport for 33 hours in December, disrupting the journeys of about 140,000 passengers.  A huge police operation and the Army eventually brought the incident under control. Military anti-drone equipment, which can detect the flying machines and disable them by jamming radio signals, remained at the airport until March.

"Sergio Aguero notched his 20th goal of the season for Manchester City to keep them a point ahead of Liverpool Manchester City stand just two victories away from retaining their Premier League title after Sergio Aguero's second-half goal gave them a scrappy victory over Burnley at Turf Moor. Aguero's 64th-minute goal - bundled in and given via goal-line technology despite Matthew Lowton's attempted clearance - summed up much of City's performance as Burnley's organisation and resilience threatened to keep them out. Gabriel Jesus had another effort kicked off the line by Ben Mee and while Burnley rarely threatened, City knew only victory would do or the initiative would be handed back to Liverpool. It was duly secured with a 12th successive league win. Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton also saved from Aguero, Aymeric Laporte and Bernardo Silva in a City performance that was average for long spells - but the main priority of three points was achieved and they know victory at home to Leicester City and away at Brighton will ensure they keep the crown. City have been put to the test since their Champions League quarter-final exit against Tottenham - and they have responded in the manner of champions with three wins without conceding a goal. And in Premier League victories at home to Spurs and here at Burnley, with a routine derby win at Manchester United sandwiched in between, they have had to show a different side of their character, one not associated with the flowing football which has become their trademark. City were so sloppy in spells, with passes going astray and moves breaking down after moments of carelessness, that there must have been genuine anxiety at half-time that they would be the first to blink in this magnificent tit-for-tat title battle with Liverpool. In the end it was Aguero, predictably, who made the decisive contribution, as he became only the second player in Premier League history to score 20 or more goals in five consecutive campaigns, after Thierry Henry between 2001-02 and 2005-06. The goal, like City's display, was not a thing of beauty but City's players and their fans did not care as they celebrated another vital step forward on the road to the title at the end. Manchester City's dominance of possession in the final third third of the pitch at Turf Moor is reflected in their heat map (right) compared to Burnley's (left). Burnley's supporters rose to acclaim their team at the final whistle despite defeat - another season of Premier League safety assured by manager Sean Dyche and his players. Dyche kept his nerve when Burnley dropped into the Premier League's bottom three after a 5-1 home defeat by Everton on Boxing Day, which left them with just 12 points from 19 games. Tom Heaton replaced Joe Hart in goal and all the traditional Burnley qualities of organisation and determination have made sure they will be in the top flight again next term. The problem the Clarets had here was that, despite all the sweat they expended and how expertly they were set up in defence by Dyche, they just did not have that extra touch of class in attack to lay a glove on the reigning champions. Burnley recorded only two shots on target, their lowest in a Premier League game, and it was endeavour rather than inspiration that made it an anxious closing phase for City. Dyche and Burnley, however, deserve huge credit for how they pulled their season around after it threatened to plunge into crisis around the Christmas period.

"A woman's remains were found inside a suitcase in the lake A suitcase containing the remains of a woman, believed to be one of seven victims of a suspected serial killer, has been discovered at the bottom of a lake in Cyprus, officials say. It is the fourth body to be found in an investigation into what has been dubbed the island's first serial killing. A Greek-Cypriot army officer has confessed to killing the seven women and girls, all of foreign descent. Authorities have been accused of not investigating properly at the time. The national police confirmed to the BBC that a woman's body was found on Sunday in a suitcase in a man-made lake in the village of Mitsero, some 32km (20 miles) west of the capital, Nicosia. Cyprus reels over serial killer case Police were searching the area after the 35-year-old suspect told investigators he put the bodies of three of his victims into suitcases and threw them into the toxic red lake, which is part of a now-defunct copper pyrite mine. Rescuers and divers retrieve a suitcase which police say contains a female body The body was in an advanced stage of decomposition when it was pulled from the lake, according to police officials. Tests are now being conducted to confirm the woman's identity. The case first came to light earlier this month, when the body of 38-year-old Marry Rose Tiburcio, from the Philippines, was found in a flooded shaft near the lake. The discovery triggered a homicide investigation, which led to the army official's arrest. The body of a second woman, believed to be 28-year-old Arian Palanas Lozano, also from the Philippines, was found in the shaft days later. Search teams are using robotic equipment to navigate the Red Lake's toxic water The suspect at first denied killing a third woman from the Philippines, Maricar Valtez Arquiola, 31, who has been missing since late 2017. However, he then changed his testimony and confessed to the murder of seven women and girls over the past three years. Following his arrest, the suspect showed investigators to a well at an army firing range where the unidentified body of a woman of Nepalese or Indian descent was discovered. Marry Rose Tiburcio's six-year-old daughter and a Romanian mother and her young daughter, who have been missing since September 2016, are believed to be among the victims. Authorities have come under fire with accusations that they failed to take the cases seriously because of the victims being of foreign descent. The main opposition party has called on the police chief and justice minister to resign. ""Unprecedented indifference was shown simply because these people were not of Cypriot origin but came from foreign countries,"" said AKEL leader Andros Kyprianou. Doros Polycarpou, the director of Kisa, a migrant and refugee support group, told Reuters that Cyprus operated a ""two-tier system"" in which ""some non-Cypriots did not enjoy the same rights as locals"". Migrant workers in Cyprus stand in solidarity during a protest in Nicosia Police have responded that a restrictive legal framework limits their ability to check things like phone records without a court order, which is only issued if a criminal offence punishable by more than five years imprisonment is suspected. They have said they will investigate the handling of the case. Scarface killer jailed for fifth murder Is our love of true crime problematic?

"Protesters carried yellow umbrellas, reviving the symbol of the 2014 pro-democracy demonstrations Thousands of people protested in Hong Kong on Sunday over a proposed law change that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Officials say they need to amend the law before July so that they can extradite a murder suspect to Taiwan. Demonstrators - some marching with umbrellas - fear Beijing is trying to exert more powerover the territory. Police estimate that about 22,000 people took part, while organisers say this figure was closer to 130,000. Either way, these estimates would make it the largest demonstration since pro-democracy rallies in 2014 known as the Umbrella Movement. Reuters news agency reported that people were chanting ""step down, Carrie Lam"". Ms Lam is the pro-Beijing leader of Hong Kong. Protesters accused Carrie Lam of having 'betrayed' Hong Kong Hong Kong has a separate legal system to mainland China, thanks to ""one country, two systems"". The former British colony was handed back to China in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. But earlier this year Ms Lam's government announced that it would overhaul the city's extradition laws so that, for the first time, suspects could be extradited to Taiwan, Macau or mainland China on a case-by-case basis. Fears over Hong Kong-China extradition plans Hong Kong 'Umbrella' protesters jailed Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Officials said that no-one at risk of being sentenced to death, being tortured, or facing a political charge would be sent to the mainland. But protesters are unconvinced, with some accusing Ms Lam of having ""betrayed"" Hong Kong. They also point to Beijing's poor human rights record and opaque legal system. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, also told the government-funded broadcaster RTHK the proposal was ""an assault on Hong Kong's values, stability and security"".

"Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would ""live up to our responsibility"" on climate change Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference. The SNP leader told delegates in Edinburgh she was inspired aftermeeting young climate campaignerswho had gone on strike from school. Ms Sturgeon said ""they are right"", and pledged to ""live up to our responsibility"" to halt climate change. She also announced what she described as the SNP's ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence"". Labour is expected to press the UK government to declare a national climate emergency on Wednesday. The party will call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions, with leader Jeremy Corbyn also calling for a UK-wide ban on fracking. Fracking has already been halted in Scotland by Ms Sturgeon's devolved government. What is a climate emergency? Brian Taylor: Sturgeon reaches out to No voters Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? What does the SNP's new currency plan mean? It comes after weeks of strikes by school pupils and protests by Extinction Rebellion protestors, which have targeted both the UK and Scottish parliaments. Ms Sturgeon told the conference that Scotland is a ""world leader"" on climate change, and is already committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. She pledged that the country would continue to ""lead by example"" as our obligations to the next generation are ""the most important we carry"". Ms Sturgeon challenged her party to aim for a ""surge"" in support for independence The first minister said: ""A few weeks ago, I met some of the young climate change campaigners who've gone on strike from school to raise awareness of their cause. ""They want governments around the world to declare a climate emergency.  They say that's what the science tells us. And they are right. ""So today, as first minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it."" SNP members change leadership's currency plan UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The Committee on Climate Change is due to publish new scientific advice on Scotland's emissions targets this week. And Ms Sturgeon made clear that ""if that advice says we can go further or go faster, we will do so"". SNP MSPs - along with those from the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems - voted down a Scottish Parliament motion put forward by the Greens calling for a ""climate emergency"" to be declared on 27 March, after disputing the impact of the oil and gas industry. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said in that debate that climate change was an ""urgent"" matter, but that the government a duty to respond ""responsibly"" and ""keep Scotland's lights on"". Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Scotland is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Read more here Ms Sturgeon says she wants another independence referendum within the next two years Ms Sturgeon's conference speech came just days after she announced that she wants a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. The UK government has already said it will not grant the permission that Ms Sturgeon says is needed before a referendum is actually held. But she told party members that a ""surge"" in support for Scottish independence could force Westminster to change its stance. Ms Sturgeon said this would demonstrate that ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Mss Sturgeon said it was wrong to view Scotland as ""No voters or Yes voters"". Wrong to consider fellow Scots as ""Remainers or Leavers"". In a modern version of Jock Tamson's Bairns, she told delegates that they should view even those who are critical of the SNP as fellow citizens. Perhaps especially those who are critical of the SNP. Nationalists, she said, should make their case with ""decency, respect and dignity"". So far, so familiar. But there is more to this than the customary appeal for humane politics. This is also about strategy. SNP strategists look at the contemporary condition of politics. Febrile, brittle, divided. Fragmented by Brexit chaos. They have concluded that, in such circumstances, it will not do to be too overtly partisan, even about the issue which motivates the SNP - independence. You can only win a referendum if you get 50% of the vote plus one. That, for the SNP, means taking along with you people who are not currently convinced. Read more here Ms Sturgeon also announced a leaflet would be sent to every home in Scotland as part of the ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence in our party's history"". In addition, she revealed the SNP would create a social justice and fairness commission, which she said would ""set out how the proceeds of economic growth in an independent Scotland can be shared much more fairly"". The first minister predicted: ""If we can now show what is possible with the economic powers of independence, we will win a referendum."" She also revealed Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum will be introduced in May. The aim would be to pass it by the end of the year, she said, so it is in place should the UK government ultimately agree to a referendum being held. The first minister also described how her plans for a Citizens' Assembly would allow people from across Scotland to ""guide the conversation"" about independence.

"Three flights were diverted to Stansted Three flights have been diverted after a possible drone sighting at Gatwick Airport. EasyJet flights from Barcelona and Amsterdam were diverted to Stansted, as was a British Airways flight from Heraklion, Greece. All three later landed at Gatwick more than 90 minutes after their scheduled arrival time. Gatwick said it had investigated an ""unconfirmed sighting of an object"" outside its exclusion zone. A spokeswoman confirmed an Aer Lingus pilot made the initial report. The airport added: ""Following a full assessment, the airport has remained fully operational throughout."" How can a drone cause so much chaos? Stansted Airport said it did not anticipate any further diversions. A suspected drone closed the airport for 33 hours in December, disrupting the journeys of about 140,000 passengers.  A huge police operation and the Army eventually brought the incident under control. Military anti-drone equipment, which can detect the flying machines and disable them by jamming radio signals, remained at the airport until March.

"Ms Dugdale was Scottish Labour leader between 2015 and 2017 Kezia Dugdale has declined to comment on reports that she will step down from the Scottish Parliament in the summer. TheSunday Times,externalclaims that the former Scottish Labour leader will confirm her departure shortly, and will leave Holyrood in June. A senior Labour source has told BBC Scotland that they understand the report is true, and that Ms Dugdale has another job lined up. A spokesman for Ms Dugdale said he would be making no comment. The Sunday Times says it was told by a source close to Ms Dugdale that ""she will make a departure announcement shortly"" and that she is ""expected to go when this parliamentary term finishes at the end of June."" The Lothians MSP became Scottish Labour leader in August 2015, beforestepping down two years later. She was replaced by Richard Leonard, who is an ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Dugdale has openly criticised Jeremy Corbyn in the past, and opposed him become leader Ms Dugdale has been a long-standing critic of Mr Corbyn, and has been disillusioned with the party's stance on Brexit in particular. She describes herself as ""proudly pro-European"", and has been calling for another Brexit referendum. After quitting as leader, she was reprimanded by the party after appearing in the jungle as a contestant on the ITV show I'm a Celebrity.. Get Me Out of Here. Earlier this month Ms Dugdalesuccessfully defended a defamation casebrought by a pro-independence blogger over her claim that he had written ""homophobic tweets"". Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell sued Ms Dugdale over a column she wrote in the Daily Record in 2017. The newspaper funded Ms Dugdale during the case after the Labour Party withdrew its support. She won the case after a sheriff ruled her comments had been ""fair"", despite Ms Dugdale being incorrect to imply that Mr Campbell is homophobic.

"One week ago many dozens of children were killed in Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday attacks. Dressed in their finest clothes for one of the most important church services of the year, this was the first generation in decades to grow up free of violence. Their stories - and the struggle for the surviving children to comprehend the carnage - take the island down a devastatingly familiar path. When bubbly Sneha Savindri Fernando went along for the Easter Sunday Mass at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, her mind was on something else entirely. She had spent weeks excitedly making plans for her 13th birthday - a day she would never get the chance to celebrate. Sneha was looking forward to celebrating her 13th birthday ""She was like a little bird. She loved to dance. She danced to anything. If you asked her to dance, she would immediately jump into a sari or a long skirt and oblige,"" her mother, Nirasha Fernando says. Sneha, Ms Fernando and their neighbours Gayani and Tyronne all left together in Tyronne's auto-rickshaw. Only Nirasha came back. Sneha was among many children who died when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the church in the Negombo community of Katuwapitiya. At almost that precise moment five other locations, churches and hotels, were hit by bombers. It was the first thing that first responders I talked to noticed as soon as they walked into the churches that had been targeted: the large number of children among the dead. The overall number of casualties from the attacks is unclear but officials believe children could end up accounting for more than a fifth of the final death toll. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? Who were the victims? Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack This is because the bombers' targets were the softest of them all - morning church services on a major religious festival and luxury hotels where families settled down to Sri Lanka's generous breakfast buffets. Now Sneha's mother Nirasha gazes in anguish at her daughter's photo. Part of the bomb embedded itself in her upper lip - a constant irritant, a permanent physical mark and reminder of her loss. Banners are up all around the city of Negombo - this banner commemorates Sneha ""We called her duwani (daughter) at home. She was my first. I rocked her to sleep... I held her in my hands... I brought her up with so much love and now she's gone."" They were in the third pew of the church - very close to the front - when the bomb went off. The damage to Sneha's body was so severe she was brought home in a sealed casket. ""I couldn't even see her face,"" Nirasha says blankly. Part of the bomb has embedded itself into Nirasha Fernando's upper lip - a constant reminder of the violence of that day A hall in another Negombo home hosts an unbearable scene. Four open caskets lie next to each other. Three contain bodies of children: siblings Rashini Praveesha aged 14, Shalomi Himaya, nine, and Shalom Shathiska who was seven. Shocked relatives keep walking into the house as though to confirm the truth of what they are seeing. An elderly relative enters and immediately becomes incoherent with grief. ""Shalom! Shalom! Our youngest, our baby,"" she says, almost falling on to his coffin. ""You were always so naughty, you always loved playing tricks on us. Get up my baby, please get up!"" Relatives rush in and take her away, even as she keeps shouting. It is a similar story in the eastern coastal town of Batticaloa on the other side of the country. Like Negombo, Batticaloa is adorned with banners strung up to commemorate the dead, many of them children. Among them is the banner for 13-year-old John Jesuran Jayaratnam dressed in his finest red shirt and braces. He had just finished his Sunday school lesson. His mother tells the BBC she had been standing outside with him as they waited to enter the Zion church for Easter service. He told her he would get a drink of water from the fountain and come back. That was the last time she saw him. Outside John's house, a basketball hoop attached to a dusty wall sways in the breeze. The banners take pains to show the children in their Sunday best - this is hung outside John Jesuran Jayaratnam's home ""He used to love basketball. I used to sit here and watch him play,"" his mother says, as she stares out of the living room window. The youngest of three sons, John was her baby and a regular worshipper at the church. For Sri Lankans the loss of so many children has been one of the most defining features of these attacks. It is not the bombers who are the subject of conversation - but the children. In the days immediately after the attacks, versions of events involving the children began to circulate on WhatsApp and Facebook, in family conversations and even during exchanges in the street. They were narratives about the children who died. People began saying there were so many of them because bombs exploded as children were called up for a blessing, or because a choir was at the front when the bombs hit, or that they had all been dressed as angels. This video can not be played ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies"" It has been difficult to confirm such details - and few of these stories appear to have any foundation. One survivor of the Negombo attack told me that so many women and children were among the casualties only because they sat inside, where it was cooler, while the men stood outside. But the narratives about the children kept spreading. Counselling psychologist Nivendra Uduman says such narratives can take hold for a number of reasons - it could be seen as a way of feeling useful at a time of crisis, an important way to connect. Whatever the reason, it was the images of innocence that gripped the public imagination. Candles are lit at the funeral of a young girl in Negombo. This is the first instance of mass violence children under the 10 have had to contend with in Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, however, these children also represented what could be called the first ""innocent"" generation. War, division and brutality were not part of their daily diet. In just a few weeks, the country is due to mark 10 years from the end of a 30-year civil war between government forces and separatist Tamil militants. It was a conflict that saw bomb attacks unleashed across the country and brutal violence meted out by both sides. The ""pre-war"" generations witnessed two bloody Marxist insurrections - first in the late 1970s, then in the late '80s and early '90s, which saw massive and violent disruptions to daily life, including months-long shutdowns of schools. A brutal retaliation from the government saw even more bloodshed. So the deaths of so many of these children on Easter Sunday felt especially poignant because this was the first generation for decades for whom violence wasn't part of their day-to-day lives. That's not to say there wasn't strife - there have been anti-Muslim riots and attacks on churches. Religious tensions were on the rise albeit never on this scale. However, the bloodshed that regularly affected Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims of generations before had all but gone. For Dr Ajith Danthanarayana, director of Lady Ridgeway children's hospital in Colombo, the aftermath of the bomb attacks are a bitter reminder of the past. ""These are all children. There is no race, no religion. We have faced 30 years of war, and also the tsunami. We faced so many bad things and we managed to tolerate and do the best for our patients. That's all we can do."" On the ward, it's a similar sentiment. ""At least I was used to this. We all either knew or heard of people who had been killed in violence, and we constantly saw pictures on TV and in the newspapers. But how can I explain this to my son? How will he even process it?"" Wasantha Fernando asks me, while standing at his son's bedside at the hospital. Akalanka, 7, has a ball bearing embedded in his muscle but still doesn't fully comprehend what has happened to him Seven-year-old Akalanka was among those injured at St Sebastian's church. An iron ball bearing had ripped into his leg, fracturing the bone and embedding itself into his muscle. He was being discharged that day, but still had no clear idea of why he was in hospital. ""He has heard us use the word bomb and is asking us what it means. I have told him that it is something that makes a loud noise like a firecracker. He doesn't know that it can hurt or cause death. But I will have to say something to him, because so many of his friends and peers are gone,"" Mr Fernando says. This represents the second big challenge to a population already reeling from the brutality of these attacks. How do they explain it to their children, many of whom are already traumatised? Dr Gadambanathan, the consultant psychiatrist at the Batticaloa Hospital, visited some of the injured children immediately after the attacks. His staff had identified a range of immediate challenges - panic attacks, sleep disturbances and nightmares, worries about facial disfigurement due to injuries, parents overwhelmed by grief who were unable to care for their remaining children, or adults who struggled to communicate the loss of a sibling or parent to a child. A mental health and psychosocial support worker in Batticaloa, who does not wish to be identified, says the most obvious impact was on those children directly connected to the attacks. However, watching videos of the attacks, experiencing the panic induced by rumours or perceiving the fears of the adults around them could also affect children quite distant from events, he says. ""I have been in contact with parents from across the island whose children have been terrified by the thought that bombers may target their homes or towns, who are unable to sleep, who have questions about why this happened, or who are expressing strong feelings of anger towards the perpetrators,"" he said. A number of organisations are trying to help adults talk to their children about what happened A number of organisations including Unicef have been putting out guidelines to help adults talk to their children about what happened in an age-appropriate way. These have been shared widely on social media and also with parents and medical staff in hospitals as well as teachers. In fact, returning to school, experts say, is another good way to help children process such events. Dayani Samarakoon, who teaches children between seven and 12 at a Colombo school, describes how she had been preparing for the return of her students. Her approach, she says, depends on the age group. ""The youngest ones may or may not know some of what has happened. I will get them to talk to me about what they know. Some of what they know could be the truth while the rest could be hearsay. But the important thing is to hear them out and listen to their fears,"" she says. The extent to which such services are freely available is unclear. In Sri Lanka, seeking help for mental health conditions is still considered taboo and adults - many themselves traumatised - may not have the necessary tools to comfort their children. But in the meantime, loss and funerals still consume the living. Back in Negombo, a woman wails in anguish, beating her chest in agony. She has lost her husband and both her children in the St Sebastian's attack. Her daughter Sachini Appuhami was 21, and Vimukthi, her son, was 14. Her brother-in-law Jude Prasad says both children were bright students. Sachini had finished secondary school and was doing a course in accounting. Vimukthi, apparently never had to be nagged to do his homework. Siblings Sachini and Vimukthi pictured when they were much younger ""We tried so many times to get them interested in sports, but they were much more interested in their books,"" he says smiling. Yet Vimukthi, he adds, also had a keen interest in music. ""When he passed his standard five examinations, he asked his father for that,"" he says his voice breaking, pointing to the mezzanine floor above with an elaborate drum set. ""My brother and I went all the way to Wennappuwa (a large town 21km away) to get this for him. He really loved it."" Just then, another relative walks in and heads straight to a wall on which framed photographs of the family are displayed. She touches the faces of the two children in a photo taken when they were much younger. ""Why couldn't even one of you live for your mother?"" she demands, growing increasingly hysterical. ""Why couldn't at least one of you stay?""

"This video can not be played Natascha Engel says she has quit over ""ridiculously low' tremor limits The UK's shale gas commissioner is resigning after just six months, saying fracking is being throttled by rules preventing mini earthquakes. Current government rules,externalmean fracking must be suspended every time a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected. But Natascha Engel, a former Labour MP, said the cautious approach to tremors had created a de facto ban on fracking. She claimed campaign groups ""were driving policy"" - but the groups say fracking damages the environment. In her resignation letter, Ms Engel - who was MP for North East Derbyshire from 2005 to 2017 - said government was ""pandering to what we know to be myths and scare stories"" about shale gas extraction. She told BBC News that when she took up the post, there had been an understanding that fracking would struggle to develop if the ""really ridiculously low"" limits on tremors had not been increased. Ms Engel said the role had been her ideal job but that ""where you've got government in such terrible paralysis, you do have to do something as dramatic as this"" in order to have your voice heard. She added: ""The profile of environmentalism has really been raised and I think the need to reduce our carbon emissions is absolutely urgent and fracking is absolutely one way we can do that."" A spokesperson for the government said it was confident that current regulations ""strike the right balance in ensuring the industry can develop, while ensuring any operations are carried out safely and responsibly"". What is fracking and why is it controversial? Ex-Labour MP is first fracking commissioner Ministers created the commissioner role to give confidence in regulation to local communities, the industry and regulators. In January, the government told shale firm Cuadrilla it had ""no intention of altering"" the regulations after the rulesrepeatedly halted work in Fylde, in Lancashire. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hascalled for a ban on frackingwhich he has said is ""not compatible with climate change prevention"". On Wednesday, the party is expected to call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions and to press the government to declare a national ""climate emergency"". Ms Engel's departure will be welcomed by green groups who said her pro-fracking views precluded her from being an honest broker. A spokeswoman for the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion said Ms Engel's resignation meant the government should ""rethink"" its energy policy and move away from fossil fuels. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, which is in charge of shale gas extraction at sites in Lancashire, said: ""Natascha Engel has accurately assessed the current situation with regard to shale gas extraction in the UK. UK shale explorers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds proving that we have enough gas beneath our feet to supply homes across the country for the next 50 years."" He added: ""We remain wedded to a miniscule micro-seismic threshold which has no scientific basis and is without parallel anywhere else in the world. Meanwhile other industries - including key Government projects like Crossrail, quarrying operations and geothermal - produce ground vibrations far in excess every working day. The situation is beyond ridiculous, it's embarrassing."" The key issue is a government rule that forces the industry to stop fracking every time there is a micro-tremor of 0.5 magnitude. Miss Engel said: ""This amounts to a de facto ban. The paralysis we are seeing in Parliament (on fracking policy) is made worse by social media and a powerful environmental lobby making impossible demands on CO2 emissions."" The government said it wanted to support fracking because gas produces fewer carbon emissions than coal. Ms Engel said the result of the over-strict regulations would be difficulty in making those CO2 reductions, lower economic growth, and less energy security - as the UK would need to import gas rather than produce its own. She continued: ""These points have been made repeatedly but ministers ignore them and instead allow campaign groups to drive policy. ""So many local businesses face collapse. They have invested vast amounts to 'get ready for shale' as the government had told them to. There is, therefore, no purpose in this role."" She pointed out that 49 geoscientists had recently called on the government to relax what they called the over-zealous regulations. The Lancashire for Shale group said her departure was ""a damning indictment of government dithering"", calling for ministers to take another look at ""overly cautious rules on mini earth tremors"". A spokeswoman said: ""Instead of listening to the science and expert opinion, politicians appear to be taking their steer from a vocal minority, aided and abetted by well-funded international campaign groups and their slick PR machines."" Campaigners say fracking is environmentally damaging Environmentalists will be delighted with Ms Engel's decision to quit. They argued that fracking rules on the crowded land of the UK must be far more rigorous than in the open spaces of the USA. More fundamentally, they said it was madness for the UK to be seeking more gas when firms have already discovered far more fossil fuel than scientists say can be burned without wrecking the climate. Greenpeace UK head of politics Rebecca Newsom said the fracking industry had been ""stuck in a time warp"" and that ""it's not surprising some of its backers are getting tired of waiting"", adding: ""What's bad news for frackers is good news for everyone else."" Environmental charity Friends of the Earth said Ms Engel's suggestion that fracking could help reduce carbon emissions was ""outrageous"". It added the government had already ""bent over backwards to help the fracking industry"", despite it being ""bad news for our climate and environment"" and ""deeply unpopular with the public"". Earlier this week, the former CBI head Adair Turner said there was no place for fracking if the UK was to play its part in holding global temperature rise down to 1.5C. The government's policy has also been influenced by its own backbenchers. This week, the Teesside MP Simon Clark said in Parliament that the time for fracking had come and gone.

"A woman's remains were found inside a suitcase in the lake A suitcase containing the remains of a woman, believed to be one of seven victims of a suspected serial killer, has been discovered at the bottom of a lake in Cyprus, officials say. It is the fourth body to be found in an investigation into what has been dubbed the island's first serial killing. A Greek-Cypriot army officer has confessed to killing the seven women and girls, all of foreign descent. Authorities have been accused of not investigating properly at the time. The national police confirmed to the BBC that a woman's body was found on Sunday in a suitcase in a man-made lake in the village of Mitsero, some 32km (20 miles) west of the capital, Nicosia. Cyprus reels over serial killer case Police were searching the area after the 35-year-old suspect told investigators he put the bodies of three of his victims into suitcases and threw them into the toxic red lake, which is part of a now-defunct copper pyrite mine. Rescuers and divers retrieve a suitcase which police say contains a female body The body was in an advanced stage of decomposition when it was pulled from the lake, according to police officials. Tests are now being conducted to confirm the woman's identity. The case first came to light earlier this month, when the body of 38-year-old Marry Rose Tiburcio, from the Philippines, was found in a flooded shaft near the lake. The discovery triggered a homicide investigation, which led to the army official's arrest. The body of a second woman, believed to be 28-year-old Arian Palanas Lozano, also from the Philippines, was found in the shaft days later. Search teams are using robotic equipment to navigate the Red Lake's toxic water The suspect at first denied killing a third woman from the Philippines, Maricar Valtez Arquiola, 31, who has been missing since late 2017. However, he then changed his testimony and confessed to the murder of seven women and girls over the past three years. Following his arrest, the suspect showed investigators to a well at an army firing range where the unidentified body of a woman of Nepalese or Indian descent was discovered. Marry Rose Tiburcio's six-year-old daughter and a Romanian mother and her young daughter, who have been missing since September 2016, are believed to be among the victims. Authorities have come under fire with accusations that they failed to take the cases seriously because of the victims being of foreign descent. The main opposition party has called on the police chief and justice minister to resign. ""Unprecedented indifference was shown simply because these people were not of Cypriot origin but came from foreign countries,"" said AKEL leader Andros Kyprianou. Doros Polycarpou, the director of Kisa, a migrant and refugee support group, told Reuters that Cyprus operated a ""two-tier system"" in which ""some non-Cypriots did not enjoy the same rights as locals"". Migrant workers in Cyprus stand in solidarity during a protest in Nicosia Police have responded that a restrictive legal framework limits their ability to check things like phone records without a court order, which is only issued if a criminal offence punishable by more than five years imprisonment is suspected. They have said they will investigate the handling of the case. Scarface killer jailed for fifth murder Is our love of true crime problematic?

"The Indonesian election was one of the world's biggest one-day ballots More than 270 election workers in Indonesia have died, mostly of fatigue-related illnesses caused by long hours of work counting millions of ballot papers by hand, an official says. Arief Priyo Susanto, spokesman of the General Elections Commission (KPU), said 1,878 other staff had fallen ill. Some seven million people were helping count and monitor the 17 April vote. Staff were expected to work through the night in sweltering conditions, which took a hefty physical toll on many. The elections were the first time the country of 260 million people combined the presidential vote with national and regional parliamentary ballots, in order to save money.

"This video can not be played The shooting happened at a synagogue in Poway, north of San Diego A gunman opened fire at a synagogue in California on Saturday, killing one woman and wounding three other people, police said. A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested after the attack, in Poway, north of the city of San Diego. The synagogue had been hosting a Passover celebration when the gunman burst in, reports said. Police did not suggest a motive but US President Donald Trump said the attack appeared to be ""a hate crime"". The attack comes exactly six months after ashooting in Pittsburghin which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. America's gun culture in 10 charts As Pittsburgh reeled, its teenagers mobilised San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic ""open letter"" published online. In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he was inspired by theattack on two Christchurch mosqueslast month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting. Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month. Police quickly sealed off the scene of the shooting in Poway A makeshift memorial appeared on a corner near the synagogue ""During the shooting, four individuals were wounded and transported to Palomar hospital,"" Sheriff Gore said. ""One succumbed to their wounds. The other three are in stable condition."" Mayor Steve Vaus said the rabbi had been shot in the hand. ""For this to happen only a week later at the end of the Passover, only a week after Easter is horrific,"" Mr Vaus told MSNBC. Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an ""AR-15 type"" assault rifle. He said an off-duty border patrol officer fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but did not hit him. The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit. ""He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Mr Nisleit said. ""As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle."" On Saturday evening a vigil for the victims was held at the Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church in San Diego. The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers, who the author John Earnest calls an ""inspiration"". Mr Bowers is the man charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October - the deadliest attack on the US Jewish community in the nation's history. The threat of rising anti-Semitism in US In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over. ""I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,"" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled""Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews"",external. A woman stands at a memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October In the wake of Saturday's attack in Poway, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined,""Synagogue shootings - now a thing"",external. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US, says anti-Semitism is on the rise. Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language. The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as ""global special interests"" and ""those who control the levers of power"" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"". ""All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,"" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. ""My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in."" A candlelight vigil was held at Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church President Trump tweeted to offer ""thoughts and prayers"". Allow Twitter content?

"One week ago many dozens of children were killed in Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday attacks. Dressed in their finest clothes for one of the most important church services of the year, this was the first generation in decades to grow up free of violence. Their stories - and the struggle for the surviving children to comprehend the carnage - take the island down a devastatingly familiar path. When bubbly Sneha Savindri Fernando went along for the Easter Sunday Mass at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, her mind was on something else entirely. She had spent weeks excitedly making plans for her 13th birthday - a day she would never get the chance to celebrate. Sneha was looking forward to celebrating her 13th birthday ""She was like a little bird. She loved to dance. She danced to anything. If you asked her to dance, she would immediately jump into a sari or a long skirt and oblige,"" her mother, Nirasha Fernando says. Sneha, Ms Fernando and their neighbours Gayani and Tyronne all left together in Tyronne's auto-rickshaw. Only Nirasha came back. Sneha was among many children who died when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the church in the Negombo community of Katuwapitiya. At almost that precise moment five other locations, churches and hotels, were hit by bombers. It was the first thing that first responders I talked to noticed as soon as they walked into the churches that had been targeted: the large number of children among the dead. The overall number of casualties from the attacks is unclear but officials believe children could end up accounting for more than a fifth of the final death toll. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? Who were the victims? Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Sister of 'ringleader' deplores attack This is because the bombers' targets were the softest of them all - morning church services on a major religious festival and luxury hotels where families settled down to Sri Lanka's generous breakfast buffets. Now Sneha's mother Nirasha gazes in anguish at her daughter's photo. Part of the bomb embedded itself in her upper lip - a constant irritant, a permanent physical mark and reminder of her loss. Banners are up all around the city of Negombo - this banner commemorates Sneha ""We called her duwani (daughter) at home. She was my first. I rocked her to sleep... I held her in my hands... I brought her up with so much love and now she's gone."" They were in the third pew of the church - very close to the front - when the bomb went off. The damage to Sneha's body was so severe she was brought home in a sealed casket. ""I couldn't even see her face,"" Nirasha says blankly. Part of the bomb has embedded itself into Nirasha Fernando's upper lip - a constant reminder of the violence of that day A hall in another Negombo home hosts an unbearable scene. Four open caskets lie next to each other. Three contain bodies of children: siblings Rashini Praveesha aged 14, Shalomi Himaya, nine, and Shalom Shathiska who was seven. Shocked relatives keep walking into the house as though to confirm the truth of what they are seeing. An elderly relative enters and immediately becomes incoherent with grief. ""Shalom! Shalom! Our youngest, our baby,"" she says, almost falling on to his coffin. ""You were always so naughty, you always loved playing tricks on us. Get up my baby, please get up!"" Relatives rush in and take her away, even as she keeps shouting. It is a similar story in the eastern coastal town of Batticaloa on the other side of the country. Like Negombo, Batticaloa is adorned with banners strung up to commemorate the dead, many of them children. Among them is the banner for 13-year-old John Jesuran Jayaratnam dressed in his finest red shirt and braces. He had just finished his Sunday school lesson. His mother tells the BBC she had been standing outside with him as they waited to enter the Zion church for Easter service. He told her he would get a drink of water from the fountain and come back. That was the last time she saw him. Outside John's house, a basketball hoop attached to a dusty wall sways in the breeze. The banners take pains to show the children in their Sunday best - this is hung outside John Jesuran Jayaratnam's home ""He used to love basketball. I used to sit here and watch him play,"" his mother says, as she stares out of the living room window. The youngest of three sons, John was her baby and a regular worshipper at the church. For Sri Lankans the loss of so many children has been one of the most defining features of these attacks. It is not the bombers who are the subject of conversation - but the children. In the days immediately after the attacks, versions of events involving the children began to circulate on WhatsApp and Facebook, in family conversations and even during exchanges in the street. They were narratives about the children who died. People began saying there were so many of them because bombs exploded as children were called up for a blessing, or because a choir was at the front when the bombs hit, or that they had all been dressed as angels. This video can not be played ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies"" It has been difficult to confirm such details - and few of these stories appear to have any foundation. One survivor of the Negombo attack told me that so many women and children were among the casualties only because they sat inside, where it was cooler, while the men stood outside. But the narratives about the children kept spreading. Counselling psychologist Nivendra Uduman says such narratives can take hold for a number of reasons - it could be seen as a way of feeling useful at a time of crisis, an important way to connect. Whatever the reason, it was the images of innocence that gripped the public imagination. Candles are lit at the funeral of a young girl in Negombo. This is the first instance of mass violence children under the 10 have had to contend with in Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, however, these children also represented what could be called the first ""innocent"" generation. War, division and brutality were not part of their daily diet. In just a few weeks, the country is due to mark 10 years from the end of a 30-year civil war between government forces and separatist Tamil militants. It was a conflict that saw bomb attacks unleashed across the country and brutal violence meted out by both sides. The ""pre-war"" generations witnessed two bloody Marxist insurrections - first in the late 1970s, then in the late '80s and early '90s, which saw massive and violent disruptions to daily life, including months-long shutdowns of schools. A brutal retaliation from the government saw even more bloodshed. So the deaths of so many of these children on Easter Sunday felt especially poignant because this was the first generation for decades for whom violence wasn't part of their day-to-day lives. That's not to say there wasn't strife - there have been anti-Muslim riots and attacks on churches. Religious tensions were on the rise albeit never on this scale. However, the bloodshed that regularly affected Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims of generations before had all but gone. For Dr Ajith Danthanarayana, director of Lady Ridgeway children's hospital in Colombo, the aftermath of the bomb attacks are a bitter reminder of the past. ""These are all children. There is no race, no religion. We have faced 30 years of war, and also the tsunami. We faced so many bad things and we managed to tolerate and do the best for our patients. That's all we can do."" On the ward, it's a similar sentiment. ""At least I was used to this. We all either knew or heard of people who had been killed in violence, and we constantly saw pictures on TV and in the newspapers. But how can I explain this to my son? How will he even process it?"" Wasantha Fernando asks me, while standing at his son's bedside at the hospital. Akalanka, 7, has a ball bearing embedded in his muscle but still doesn't fully comprehend what has happened to him Seven-year-old Akalanka was among those injured at St Sebastian's church. An iron ball bearing had ripped into his leg, fracturing the bone and embedding itself into his muscle. He was being discharged that day, but still had no clear idea of why he was in hospital. ""He has heard us use the word bomb and is asking us what it means. I have told him that it is something that makes a loud noise like a firecracker. He doesn't know that it can hurt or cause death. But I will have to say something to him, because so many of his friends and peers are gone,"" Mr Fernando says. This represents the second big challenge to a population already reeling from the brutality of these attacks. How do they explain it to their children, many of whom are already traumatised? Dr Gadambanathan, the consultant psychiatrist at the Batticaloa Hospital, visited some of the injured children immediately after the attacks. His staff had identified a range of immediate challenges - panic attacks, sleep disturbances and nightmares, worries about facial disfigurement due to injuries, parents overwhelmed by grief who were unable to care for their remaining children, or adults who struggled to communicate the loss of a sibling or parent to a child. A mental health and psychosocial support worker in Batticaloa, who does not wish to be identified, says the most obvious impact was on those children directly connected to the attacks. However, watching videos of the attacks, experiencing the panic induced by rumours or perceiving the fears of the adults around them could also affect children quite distant from events, he says. ""I have been in contact with parents from across the island whose children have been terrified by the thought that bombers may target their homes or towns, who are unable to sleep, who have questions about why this happened, or who are expressing strong feelings of anger towards the perpetrators,"" he said. A number of organisations are trying to help adults talk to their children about what happened A number of organisations including Unicef have been putting out guidelines to help adults talk to their children about what happened in an age-appropriate way. These have been shared widely on social media and also with parents and medical staff in hospitals as well as teachers. In fact, returning to school, experts say, is another good way to help children process such events. Dayani Samarakoon, who teaches children between seven and 12 at a Colombo school, describes how she had been preparing for the return of her students. Her approach, she says, depends on the age group. ""The youngest ones may or may not know some of what has happened. I will get them to talk to me about what they know. Some of what they know could be the truth while the rest could be hearsay. But the important thing is to hear them out and listen to their fears,"" she says. The extent to which such services are freely available is unclear. In Sri Lanka, seeking help for mental health conditions is still considered taboo and adults - many themselves traumatised - may not have the necessary tools to comfort their children. But in the meantime, loss and funerals still consume the living. Back in Negombo, a woman wails in anguish, beating her chest in agony. She has lost her husband and both her children in the St Sebastian's attack. Her daughter Sachini Appuhami was 21, and Vimukthi, her son, was 14. Her brother-in-law Jude Prasad says both children were bright students. Sachini had finished secondary school and was doing a course in accounting. Vimukthi, apparently never had to be nagged to do his homework. Siblings Sachini and Vimukthi pictured when they were much younger ""We tried so many times to get them interested in sports, but they were much more interested in their books,"" he says smiling. Yet Vimukthi, he adds, also had a keen interest in music. ""When he passed his standard five examinations, he asked his father for that,"" he says his voice breaking, pointing to the mezzanine floor above with an elaborate drum set. ""My brother and I went all the way to Wennappuwa (a large town 21km away) to get this for him. He really loved it."" Just then, another relative walks in and heads straight to a wall on which framed photographs of the family are displayed. She touches the faces of the two children in a photo taken when they were much younger. ""Why couldn't even one of you live for your mother?"" she demands, growing increasingly hysterical. ""Why couldn't at least one of you stay?""

"A family in Negombo prays as they follow the Archbishop of Colombo's televised service Christians in Sri Lanka have prayed at home one week after a series of deadly bombings by Islamist militants. Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith held a televised mass, attended by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He called the attacks on churches and hotels ""an insult to humanity"" in the service, broadcast from a chapel in his residence. At least 250 people died. Sunday church services were cancelled after the attacks on Easter Sunday. Children of the Easter Sunday attacks What led to carnage? ""Today during this Mass we are paying attention to last Sunday's tragedy and we try to understand it,"" Cardinal Ranjith said. ""We pray that in this country there will be peace and co-existence and understanding each other without division."" As people prayed, police sources said the father and two brothers of Zahran Hashim - the radical preacher suspected of masterminding the attacks - were killed in a raid on their safe house on Friday. Brothers Zainee and Rilwan and their father, Mohamed Hashim, were identified asthree of the 15 people who died during the operation in Sainthamaruthu, near Hashim's hometown.

"Searches have been carried out in Kattankudy The father and two brothers of the alleged organiser of the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, Zahran Hashim, were killed in a security forces operation on Friday, police say. Hashim, who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo, founded an Islamist group, the NTJ, which has now been banned. Police have raided the group's HQ in the eastern town of Kattankudy. The Sri Lankan president has announced a ban on face coverings, aimed at Muslim women following the attacks. Children of the Easter Sunday attacks What led to carnage? What is the NTJ? The attacks targeted churches and hotels, killing at least 250 people. Sunday church services were cancelled across the country as a precaution but worshippers in the capital gathered to pray outside St Anthony's, which was badly damaged in the attacks. Security forces raided a house in Sainthamaruthu, near Hashim's hometown Kattankudy, on Friday. Gunmen opened fire as troops moved in, police say, and three men set off explosives, killing themselves, six children and three women. Three other people died in gunfire. Police sealed off the NTJ's headquarters on Sunday A close family relative confirmed for BBC News that Hashim's father and two brothers died in the raid. Police sources who spoke to Reuters news agency named the three men as Mohamed Hashim, and his sons  Zainee Hashim and Rilwan Hashim. All three had been seen in a video circulating on social media calling for all-out war against all non-believers, Reuters adds. In Kattankudy itself, police searched the headquarters of the NTJ (National Thawheed Jamath), which Zahran Hashim had led. By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Sainthamaruthu The safe house was discovered after local people alerted police When I entered the house where the Islamists and their families were killed on Friday evening, the smell of death was unbearable. A police officer at the site also said Zahran Hashim's mother was also believed to be among the victims. Security forces have been conducting raids across the country but this safe house was discovered by chance, when the suspicious house owner and local people alerted the police. Every day, police are making arrests, seizing weapons, explosives and jihadist material suggesting the radicalisation process, however small it may be,  has been happening over a period of time. If the security agencies had missed this, then it is a colossal failure. The ongoing raids and discovery of weapons and material are gradually building up tensions among the communities. A hotel owner said she was worried because she was a Catholic. Muslims say they are nervous to visit Sinhala-majority areas. Some foreign governments have warned that there is a possibility of further attacks and if those happen, fragile ethnic relations could be further strained. Announcing the ban on face coverings, which will begin on Monday, President Maithripala Sirisena said he was taking the emergency measure on national security grounds. The announcement made no specific mention of the niqab and burka - worn by Muslim women - but instead said people's faces should be fully visible so they could be identified. Sri Lanka has been on high alert since a co-ordinated wave of bombings last Sunday, which also wounded more than 500 people. The bombings targeted churches that were packed full for the Easter holiday, as well as hotels popular with tourists. As well as St Anthony's Shrine, bombers struck churches in Negombo and the eastern city of Batticaloa, and hotels in the capital, Colombo. 'I invited the bomber into the church' The victims of the attacks Most of those killed were Sri Lankan, but dozens of foreign citizens were also among the dead. This video can not be played 'This is Sri Lanka': Fighting back with peace While the authorities have blamed the NTJ for the attacks, they say they must have had help from a larger network. The Islamic State group, which carried out mass attacks on civilians in Paris and other locations in recent years,  has said it was involved, but has not given details. Christians in Sri Lanka prayed at home while the Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, held a televised Mass, attended by the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

"Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would ""live up to our responsibility"" on climate change Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference. The SNP leader told delegates in Edinburgh she was inspired aftermeeting young climate campaignerswho had gone on strike from school. Ms Sturgeon said ""they are right"", and pledged to ""live up to our responsibility"" to halt climate change. She also announced what she described as the SNP's ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence"". Labour is expected to press the UK government to declare a national climate emergency on Wednesday. The party will call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions, with leader Jeremy Corbyn also calling for a UK-wide ban on fracking. Fracking has already been halted in Scotland by Ms Sturgeon's devolved government. What is a climate emergency? Brian Taylor: Sturgeon reaches out to No voters Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? What does the SNP's new currency plan mean? It comes after weeks of strikes by school pupils and protests by Extinction Rebellion protestors, which have targeted both the UK and Scottish parliaments. Ms Sturgeon told the conference that Scotland is a ""world leader"" on climate change, and is already committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. She pledged that the country would continue to ""lead by example"" as our obligations to the next generation are ""the most important we carry"". Ms Sturgeon challenged her party to aim for a ""surge"" in support for independence The first minister said: ""A few weeks ago, I met some of the young climate change campaigners who've gone on strike from school to raise awareness of their cause. ""They want governments around the world to declare a climate emergency.  They say that's what the science tells us. And they are right. ""So today, as first minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it."" SNP members change leadership's currency plan UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The Committee on Climate Change is due to publish new scientific advice on Scotland's emissions targets this week. And Ms Sturgeon made clear that ""if that advice says we can go further or go faster, we will do so"". SNP MSPs - along with those from the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems - voted down a Scottish Parliament motion put forward by the Greens calling for a ""climate emergency"" to be declared on 27 March, after disputing the impact of the oil and gas industry. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said in that debate that climate change was an ""urgent"" matter, but that the government a duty to respond ""responsibly"" and ""keep Scotland's lights on"". Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Scotland is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Read more here Ms Sturgeon says she wants another independence referendum within the next two years Ms Sturgeon's conference speech came just days after she announced that she wants a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. The UK government has already said it will not grant the permission that Ms Sturgeon says is needed before a referendum is actually held. But she told party members that a ""surge"" in support for Scottish independence could force Westminster to change its stance. Ms Sturgeon said this would demonstrate that ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Mss Sturgeon said it was wrong to view Scotland as ""No voters or Yes voters"". Wrong to consider fellow Scots as ""Remainers or Leavers"". In a modern version of Jock Tamson's Bairns, she told delegates that they should view even those who are critical of the SNP as fellow citizens. Perhaps especially those who are critical of the SNP. Nationalists, she said, should make their case with ""decency, respect and dignity"". So far, so familiar. But there is more to this than the customary appeal for humane politics. This is also about strategy. SNP strategists look at the contemporary condition of politics. Febrile, brittle, divided. Fragmented by Brexit chaos. They have concluded that, in such circumstances, it will not do to be too overtly partisan, even about the issue which motivates the SNP - independence. You can only win a referendum if you get 50% of the vote plus one. That, for the SNP, means taking along with you people who are not currently convinced. Read more here Ms Sturgeon also announced a leaflet would be sent to every home in Scotland as part of the ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence in our party's history"". In addition, she revealed the SNP would create a social justice and fairness commission, which she said would ""set out how the proceeds of economic growth in an independent Scotland can be shared much more fairly"". The first minister predicted: ""If we can now show what is possible with the economic powers of independence, we will win a referendum."" She also revealed Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum will be introduced in May. The aim would be to pass it by the end of the year, she said, so it is in place should the UK government ultimately agree to a referendum being held. The first minister also described how her plans for a Citizens' Assembly would allow people from across Scotland to ""guide the conversation"" about independence.

"This video can not be played Warnings are ""tip of the iceberg"", says addiction counsellor Nicki Hari All opioid medicines in the UK will carry prominent warnings on their labels saying they can cause addiction, the health secretary has announced. Matt Hancock acted after figures in England and Wales revealed a-more-than 60% increase in prescriptions for opioid painkillers in the last decade. People needed protection ""from the darker side to painkillers,"" he said. Health experts welcomed the move, saying opioids can cause ""life-altering and sometimes fatal addictions"". NHS accused of fuelling rise in opioid addiction What are opioids and what are the risks? Illicit and prescription drugs 'played role in 10 deaths' in NI Opioids, such as morphine or fentanyl, can be highly effective for managing severe pain but they can also be highly addictive, the Department of Health (DoH) said. It warned the number of prescriptions in England and Wales issued for these sorts of medicines had risen dramatically from more than 14 million in 2008 to 23 million last year. The DoH added there are also some opioids available over the counter, such as codeine-based painkillers, which are weaker in strength but can also cause addiction. From 2008 to 2018, the number of codeine-related deaths in England and Wales has more than doubled to more than 150, it said. In Scotland, codeine-related deaths spiked at 43 in 2016, dropping to 27 in 2017,National Records of Scotland,externalsaid. In Northern Ireland, there were16 codeine-related deaths in 2017,external. A large group of drugs used mainly to treat pain Includes naturally occurring chemicals like morphine and codeine, as well as synthetic drugs Codeine, morphine and methadone are among opioids judged by the World Health Organization as essential for treatment of pain and end-of-life care Some opioid medications - methadone and buprenorphine - are used to help people break their addictions to stronger opioids like heroin Moderate and severe pain relief Limited time treatment of pain that does not respond to standard painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and paracetamol Usually used for acute pain - such as after surgery or terminally-ill cancer patients They can be highly addictive Pleasurable feeling that results from taking opioids can contribute to psychological dependence on the drugs Higher doses can slow breathing and heart rate, which can lead to death Mixing with alcohol or other sedatives such as benzodiazepines can also have serious consequences Mr Hancock said: ""I have been incredibly concerned by the recent increase in people addicted to opioid drugs. ""Painkillers were a major breakthrough in modern medicine and are hugely important to help people manage pain alongside their busy lives but they must be treated with caution. ""We know that too much of any painkiller can damage your health, and some opioids are highly addictive and can ruin lives like an illegal drug. ""Things are not as bad here as in America, but we must act now to protect people from the darker side to painkillers."" Lisa Peake, from London I was prescribed painkillers for chronic neck pain after an accident in February 2014 but the pain didn't go away. I was taking codeine four to five times a day, tramadol as a top-up once a day, as well as naproxen and co-dydramol four or five times a day. Opioids affect your mental capacity, you feel dizzy, you can't concentrate and it's hard for you to do your job. I went on a three-week hospital pain management programme in October 2016 and they helped wean me off the meds and rely on other methods of pain control. I had all the symptoms, albeit to a lesser extent, of a drug addict doing the same. It feels like you've got thousands of insects inside your skin. You can't find any comfort, you can't sleep and your bowel movements are shot to pieces. Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, has welcomed the government action. She said: ""We know that long-term use of painkillers can lead to life-altering and sometimes fatal addictions, so I am delighted to see measures put in place to raise awareness of the risks of codeine and prescribed drugs. ""It is vital that anyone who is prescribed strong painkillers takes them only as long as they are suffering from serious pain. ""As soon as the pain starts to alleviate, the drugs have done their job, and it is important to switch to over-the-counter medication like paracetamol which do not carry the same risk of addiction that comes with long term use."" Until the late 90s in the UK, opioids were usually restricted to cancer patients and for those in acute pain following surgery, but then they began being increasingly prescribed for chronic pain. As our population ages, the number of people living with low back or nerve pain is soaring.  Opioids can be effective in the short term, but don't work for pain that lasts for months or years. The medicine packets already contain leaflets warning about potentially dangerous side-effects and the risks of addiction.  Making these more prominent may encourage patients and their doctors to discuss alternatives such as physical and talking therapies. The variation in prescribing rates between NHS regions shows that it is possible to limit their use. Things have been getting worse here, but are nowhere near as bad as the US which has four times the rate of opioid prescriptions as the UK. Public Health England is already undertaking a review,externalinto prescription medication addiction and is due to report its findings this year. Under Mr Hancock's plan, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will have the power to enforce warnings on opioids packaging, following recommendations from the UK's Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) Opioid expert working group. Dr June Raine, director of the MHRA's vigilance and risk management of medicines division, said: ""This is an important first step to help minimise the risks of addiction associated with opioid medicines, while supporting patients to get the right information at the right time to support their care.""

"The government's Brexit legislation is on hold as the UK gears up for the general election on 12 December. But where do the parties stand on Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to leave the European Union (EU) with the revised deal he agreed. He says that with a majority Conservative government,he would start the process to ""get Brexit done"" on day one,externalof the new Parliament. He previously said the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"". However, Mr Johnson was forced to write a Brexit extension letter to the EU, after MPs failed to approve his revised deal. Mr Johnson secured changes to the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May. It includes scrappingthe controversial Irish backstopand replacing it witha new customs arrangement. Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal has not yet been approved by the UK Parliament Brexit left the Conservative Party heavily divided, with 21 MPs expelled for failing to follow the government's line. Ten were later welcomed back. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Key Conservative Party manifesto promises explained If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. It says it will achieve this within six months. Labour says its referendumwould be a choice between a ""sensible"" Leave option versus Remain.,external Under its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a ""close"" single market relationship. This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. If a referendum was held,Mr Corbyn has said he would remain neutralif he was prime minister ""so I can credibly carry out the results"". Just like the Conservatives, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"". While Labour's election strategy early on was to emphasise that the vote was about more than Brexit, it is changing its focus. The message now is thatLabour's leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Mr Johnson's deal- it wants to find what it believes is a better one. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Key Labour Party manifesto promises explained The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum,externalon Brexit. Alternatively,it wants Article 50 revokedif it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""catastrophic"" The SNP's ultimate objective is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the EU. SNP launch: Scotland's Remain party? The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit if they win power at the general election. Party leader Jo Swinson says a Lib Dem majority government would cancel Brexit The policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference. If the Lib Dems do not win a majority, they would support another referendum. Leader Jo Swinson says thatstopping Brexit would free up Â£50bn, over five years, to spend on public services. She says that so-called ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra money for schools and to help support low-paid workers. Lib Dems promise Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit Key Lib Dems manifesto promises explained The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had an agreement with the Conservatives whereby it lent it support in the Commons during the last Parliament. However,while the DUP wants the UK to leave the EU,,externalit opposes elements of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal which relate to Northern Ireland,.

"US President Donald Trump has announced measures to combat the country's opioid crisis. But what are these drugs and why are they such a problem? Opioids are a group of drugs that range from codeine, to illegal drugs like heroin. Prescription opioids are primarily used for pain relief. They work by attaching to opioid receptors in your brain cells to release signals that block your perception of pain and boost your feelings of pleasure. The strongest legal treatments are usually only available by prescription from a doctor and include: morphine tramadol fentanyl methadone diamorphine alfentanil Opioids are generally used for moderate and severe pain relief. They are intended to be used for a limited period of time to treat pain that does not respond to standard painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and paracetamol. Examples of when the drugs are likely to be used include aiding with acute pain - such as after surgery - or for cancer patients or people at the end of life. Donald Trump has called the opioid epidemic a ""national shame"" While there are good reasons for taking opioids, they can be highly addictive. The feelings of pleasure that result from taking an opioid can also make people want to continue experiencing those feelings, which can contribute to psychological dependence on the drugs. At lower doses, opioids can make people feel sleepy, but higher doses of the drugs can slow your breathing and heart rate, which can lead to death. Mixing any opioid painkillers with alcohol, or with other sedatives such as benzodiazepines, can also have serious consequences. Unlike many European countries, the US does not have universal healthcare paid for by taxes. Instead, Americans must get their own insurance - usually via an employer or the government. Professor Judith Feinberg from the West Virginia University School of Medicine told the BBCthat opioids are easy to prescribe, and for many poor people their insurance won't pay for anything but a pill. ""Say you have a patient that's 45 years old. They have lower back pain, you examine them, they have a muscle spasm. ""Really the best thing is physical therapy, but no one will pay for that. So doctors get very ready to pull out the prescription pad."" Why opioids are such an American problem Are we missing the real opioid drug crisis? President Trump called the opioid epidemic a ""national shame"" in October and declared it a public health emergency. The figures in America are certainly stark. Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from opioid use,with figures recently showing a 30% increase in overdoses there in the last year. The country also gets 30 times more opioid pain relief medication than it needs. But there are fears that the problem could spread to other countries. In theUK the NHS has been accused of fuelling an ""addiction crisis""after nearly 24 million opioids were prescribed in 2017 - 10 million more than in 2007. The UK government hasordered Public Health England to conduct a review of the scale and nature of the problem with prescription levels,external. But elsewhere millions of people in other parts of the world can't get hold of the drugs. For example, Nigeria gets just 0.2% of what it needs, India 4%, China 16% and Mexico 36%. Diederik Lohman, from Human Rights Watch, said the tough international rhetoric on opioids has led in some countries to ""opiophobia... an irrational fear around the use of these medications"".

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis said there was ""still time"" for Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement Brandon Lewis has refused to say when the Tories' European election campaign will launch, saying his priority is not to have to fight them at all. The UK is due to elect new MEPs on 23 May, after Brexit was delayed amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. Several parties have launched their campaigns already but Conservative chair Mr Lewis told the BBC his focus was on next week's local elections. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, or sooner if a deal is agreed. This means the UK must now hold European Parliament elections on 23 May if it wants to avoid leaving the EU without a deal. But if agreement can be reached among MPs before 22 May, the UK could cancel its participation in the elections.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. The Lib Demslaunched their campaign on Friday, with a pledge to do what they can to stop Brexit altogether. Nigel Farage's Brexit Partyandpro-Remain party Change UK'shave also launched their European election campaigns. Tories 'are transparent' on Islamophobia Party-by-party guide to UK's European elections 2019 European elections: List of candidates How do European elections work? Labour's NEC is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on its manifesto for the campaign. But asked about Conservative campaign plans on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis said: ""As a government, our first priority is to not have to fight the EU elections. ""I think we should be doing everything we can to respect that 2016 referendum, if and when we are at the point where we are definitely fighting those EU elections then we will take some decisions about that."" He said there was ""still time"" for the UK Parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement - which it has so far rejected three times - in time so the UK could leave the EU and would not have to take part in the elections at all. He rejected reports about donors deserting the Conservatives, saying that 2018 had been a ""record peacetime fundraising year"". SomeConservative members reportedly plan to back the Brexit Party,externalat the elections, andConservative councillors in Derbyshire are refusing to campaign at all,externalin protest at the failure to have left the EU. Mr Lewis said: ""I don't deny the frustration people in our party have over where we are on Brexit. I share that frustration, I want to get this done so we don't fight those European elections."" He added: ""I hope that Conservative members, colleagues, volunteers, activists will come to want to not just vote for, but campaign for Conservatives to get elected, because ultimately Conservative representation is better than any other party."" Rebecca Long-Bailey said ""we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines"" On Sky News, Labour frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said the government was still refusing to move on ""any of their red lines"" in cross-party talks aimed at reaching an agreement on Brexit. She said: ""Honestly I think the discussions so far have been productive, they've gone into a lot of detail, there seems to be a willingness on both sides to move towards some form of consensus. ""But as yet we haven't seen the government move on any of their red lines, we're having further discussions this week and hopefully we'll see some movement."" At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 73 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But earlier this month, she agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.

""The last year has been extremely challenging. I finished my PhD while separating from my husband and caring for my mother. When I signed up for the marathon, I needed a challenge, a focus, and throughout the training I struggled with injuries and a lot of emotional ups and downs. Sunday is a test for me to prove to myself that I can do this. I work in the public health sector in low and middle income countries. While I am running I will be thinking of all the amazing women that I have come across in these countries who do not have such opportunities. But most of all I am running to heal so that I can be strong enough to do the work I do. It's been an emotional journey but I'm so excited to be running this weekend. Despite this being my third London Marathon, I am nervous, I haven't covered enough miles due to illness and injuries but what matters now is that I am believe in myself."" Four years ago, Del Singh weighed 25.5 stone. He was in danger of having a stroke, developing diabetes, getting cancer and ultimately not see his five children and his grandchildren grow up. But fast forward to 2019, and Del, now aged 56, will be on the start line for the London Marathon for the first time. So what changed? âIâm a British-born Sikh, but coming from an Indian background, looking after my family came first. But in doing so I was neglecting the most important thing in the equation â and that was me, walking even a short distance made me out of breath,â Del Said. âWhen a doctor told me that if I was to carry on the trajectory I was on, with a sedentary lifestyle and overeating that I would probably die before 66 the age at which my father died. It was a real wake-up call.â Del and his wife, Jas, decided to use their savings â earmarked for a new kitchen â so he could undergo gastric sleeve bariatric surgery. Six months after surgery, he took up walking. He was soon clocking up more than 15,000 steps a day â and looking for excuses not to drive. Del then started running and took part in half marathon in 2017 and the Loch Ness Marathon in 2018. Spurred on by his success in completing this toughest of marathons, he applied for a place at 2019âs London Marathon. âMy goal was to give myself a fighting chance to live beyond 66,â said Del. âI think Iâve achieved my goal. My message to others is donât leave it too late to change. Donât buy the kitchen â buy a new life.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When I struggled on the long runs, there were people to encourage me to keep going. I found a camaraderie and a kinship with like minded running enthusiasts.

"Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would ""live up to our responsibility"" on climate change Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference. The SNP leader told delegates in Edinburgh she was inspired aftermeeting young climate campaignerswho had gone on strike from school. Ms Sturgeon said ""they are right"", and pledged to ""live up to our responsibility"" to halt climate change. She also announced what she described as the SNP's ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence"". Labour is expected to press the UK government to declare a national climate emergency on Wednesday. The party will call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions, with leader Jeremy Corbyn also calling for a UK-wide ban on fracking. Fracking has already been halted in Scotland by Ms Sturgeon's devolved government. What is a climate emergency? Brian Taylor: Sturgeon reaches out to No voters Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? What does the SNP's new currency plan mean? It comes after weeks of strikes by school pupils and protests by Extinction Rebellion protestors, which have targeted both the UK and Scottish parliaments. Ms Sturgeon told the conference that Scotland is a ""world leader"" on climate change, and is already committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. She pledged that the country would continue to ""lead by example"" as our obligations to the next generation are ""the most important we carry"". Ms Sturgeon challenged her party to aim for a ""surge"" in support for independence The first minister said: ""A few weeks ago, I met some of the young climate change campaigners who've gone on strike from school to raise awareness of their cause. ""They want governments around the world to declare a climate emergency.  They say that's what the science tells us. And they are right. ""So today, as first minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it."" SNP members change leadership's currency plan UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The Committee on Climate Change is due to publish new scientific advice on Scotland's emissions targets this week. And Ms Sturgeon made clear that ""if that advice says we can go further or go faster, we will do so"". SNP MSPs - along with those from the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems - voted down a Scottish Parliament motion put forward by the Greens calling for a ""climate emergency"" to be declared on 27 March, after disputing the impact of the oil and gas industry. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said in that debate that climate change was an ""urgent"" matter, but that the government a duty to respond ""responsibly"" and ""keep Scotland's lights on"". Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Scotland is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Read more here Ms Sturgeon says she wants another independence referendum within the next two years Ms Sturgeon's conference speech came just days after she announced that she wants a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. The UK government has already said it will not grant the permission that Ms Sturgeon says is needed before a referendum is actually held. But she told party members that a ""surge"" in support for Scottish independence could force Westminster to change its stance. Ms Sturgeon said this would demonstrate that ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Mss Sturgeon said it was wrong to view Scotland as ""No voters or Yes voters"". Wrong to consider fellow Scots as ""Remainers or Leavers"". In a modern version of Jock Tamson's Bairns, she told delegates that they should view even those who are critical of the SNP as fellow citizens. Perhaps especially those who are critical of the SNP. Nationalists, she said, should make their case with ""decency, respect and dignity"". So far, so familiar. But there is more to this than the customary appeal for humane politics. This is also about strategy. SNP strategists look at the contemporary condition of politics. Febrile, brittle, divided. Fragmented by Brexit chaos. They have concluded that, in such circumstances, it will not do to be too overtly partisan, even about the issue which motivates the SNP - independence. You can only win a referendum if you get 50% of the vote plus one. That, for the SNP, means taking along with you people who are not currently convinced. Read more here Ms Sturgeon also announced a leaflet would be sent to every home in Scotland as part of the ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence in our party's history"". In addition, she revealed the SNP would create a social justice and fairness commission, which she said would ""set out how the proceeds of economic growth in an independent Scotland can be shared much more fairly"". The first minister predicted: ""If we can now show what is possible with the economic powers of independence, we will win a referendum."" She also revealed Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum will be introduced in May. The aim would be to pass it by the end of the year, she said, so it is in place should the UK government ultimately agree to a referendum being held. The first minister also described how her plans for a Citizens' Assembly would allow people from across Scotland to ""guide the conversation"" about independence.

"Chancellor Philip Hammond will this week rule on the future of 1p and 2p coins, a year after he called them ""obsolete"". In his Spring Statement in 2018, a Treasury consultation about the mix of coins in circulation appeared topave the way for the end of both of them. Aswift reverse by the Prime Minister's official spokesmandeclared there were no plans to scrap the copper coins. The Treasury has declined to comment on a report that there will be a reprieve. But it confirmed that ""the result of the review will be announced shortly"". The Mail on Sunday quoted,externala government source as saying: ""We will confirm the penny coin won't be scrapped."" That Treasury consultation document said surveys suggested six-in-10 of UK 1p and 2p coins were only used once before being put in a jar or discarded, while one-in-12 were thrown into a bin. The value of the 1p coin has also been reduced by inflation so, in effect, the 1p coin is now worth less than the halfpenny when it was abolished in 1984. Pretty penny: considerable sum of money Penny dropped: something was finally understood Penny-dreadful: a cheap, often lurid, book or magazine Penny-pinching: miserly Penny-wise: Careful and thrifty in small matters Source: Collins English Dictionary Among many of those who support the continuing use of copper coins, the belief is that retailers would simply round up prices to the nearest 5p if copper coins were scrapped. Penny pitching: Your eight uses for 1p and 2p coins Debit card payments more popular than cash Who do you trust after cash? But writing on the Bank of England's blog,Bank Underground,external, staff members Marilena Angeli and Jack Meaning last year argued that - even if this happened - it would have little or no effect on the cost of living, as measured by inflation. They also argued that the growth of non-cash payments - particularly contactless cards - meant that shoppers could still be charged the exact amount when paying by card. Thirdly, the duo quoted figures showing that only 12% of prices ended with 99p, with a falling number of items now priced at, say, Â£1.99.

"PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez promised supporters a pro-European government that would tackle inequality Spain's governing Socialists have won the country's third election in four years, but are short of a majority. PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez's party polled 29% and will need the help of either left-wing Podemos and regional parties, or the centre right, to form a government. Far-right party Vox also won seats - the first time a significant far-right force has done so in decades. Vox opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration, and what it calls ""radical feminism"". Analysts say support for Vox has been boosted by widespread anger at separatists in the province of Catalonia, who want independence from Spain. Vox fervently opposes any concessions to the secessionists. The other big story of the election was the collapse in support for the conservative Popular Party (PP), which governed Spain until it was dumped from power in May 2018 in a no-confidence vote. In its worst election ever, the PP won just 66 seats, down from 137 in the previous parliament. Turnout was 75.8%, the highest for several years and 9% more than the previous election in 2016. In his victory speech, Mr SÃ¡nchez said the party's big challenges were to fight inequality, advance co-existence and halt corruption. ""The future has won and the past has lost,"" he told cheering supporters. During his time in office he has raised the minimum wage, appointed a female-dominated cabinet and promised to strengthen rape laws, defining it as sex without clear consent. Socialists battle to stop right-wing surge Pedro SÃ¡nchez: Spain's accidental PM on a roll Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? After weeks of Spain's resurgent far right hogging all the headlines, didn't the centre-left just win a resounding victory? Did Spaniards have a last-minute change of heart? What does this all mean? Spain's Socialist party members will certainly have the biggest smiles on their faces this morning. But landslide victory this was not. The party improved massively on its last performance in national elections. It managed to take control of Spain's upper house of parliament too, but still lacks a majority to govern. Read more:Spain's general election: What just happened? The result is a personal success for the prime minister, who increased his party's share from 23% of the vote in 2016. But it still leaves the Socialists and Podemos 11 seats short of the necessary 176 for a majority in the 350-seat parliament. Mr SÃ¡nchez must now look for support from the smaller parties or from the centre right. An alliance with centre-right Ciudadanos (57 seats) would give him the numbers, but its leader, Albert Rivera, was bitterly critical of Mr SÃ¡nchez's collaboration with Catalan separatists, referring to his earlier ""Frankenstein government"" â and vowed he would not enter a coalition with the Socialists. And as Mr SÃ¡nchez gave his victory speech late on Sunday, supporters chanted ""Not with Rivera!"", making it clear they also did not want a coalition with Ciudadanos. It was a big night for Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera after the party's best result so far The head of previous coalition partner Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, made clear on Sunday night that another left-wing administration was possible. But the results appear to make any left-coalition dependent on Catalan pro-independence parties, which opponents on the right see as toxic. An alliance involving all the other regional parties, including the Basque nationalist PNV, would leave him one seat short of a majority. All parties are now looking towards the regional and European elections in less than a month. The PP's historic defeat means that, even with the support of Ciudadanos (Citizens) and Vox, it has no chance of forming a right-wing coalition, and leader Pablo Casado said it would become the main opposition force. But Vox saw its support surge, winning more than 10% of the vote, which gives it 24 seats. It received congratulations from other right-wing leaders, including Italy's deputy PM Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far-right National Rally. Nationalists vow to 'make Spain great again' Vox's success is seen as a turning point for the far-right, who have not won seats in parliament sincethe death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1975and the restoration of democracy â with the sole exception of a single seat for Blas PiÃ±ar in the first parliament of 1979â1982. Led by Santiago Abascal, a former PP member, the party has emerged in a matter of months with a vow to ""make Spain great again"". In his speech after the results, Mr Abascal said: ""We told you that we were starting a reconquest of Spain and that is exactly what we have done... and we can clearly say to all of Spain that Vox is here to stay."" Vox rejects the far-right label but its views on immigration and Islam place it in line with far-right and populist parties elsewhere in Europe. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? It wants to repeal laws against gender violence, and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Critics see it as a nationalist throwback to the Franco era. Vox aims to deport migrants legally entitled to be in Spain if they have committed an offence, and wants to prevent any migrant who comes in illegally from staying. The future of Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region was one of the big issues of the election. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain country profile Catalonia held an independence referendum in October 2017 and then declared independence from Spain. A dozen of its leaders have since gone on trial in Madrid, facing charges including rebellion and sedition. During last Monday's election debate, the leaders of the PP and Ciudadanos accused the prime minister of siding with ""enemies of Spain"" and wanting to ""liquidate Spain"". The centre-left Catalan ERC was the big winner in Catalonia, with a projected 15 seats. Its leader, Oriol Junqueras, is among those facing trial. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Natascha Engel says she has quit over ""ridiculously low' tremor limits The UK's shale gas commissioner is resigning after just six months, saying fracking is being throttled by rules preventing mini earthquakes. Current government rules,externalmean fracking must be suspended every time a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected. But Natascha Engel, a former Labour MP, said the cautious approach to tremors had created a de facto ban on fracking. She claimed campaign groups ""were driving policy"" - but the groups say fracking damages the environment. In her resignation letter, Ms Engel - who was MP for North East Derbyshire from 2005 to 2017 - said government was ""pandering to what we know to be myths and scare stories"" about shale gas extraction. She told BBC News that when she took up the post, there had been an understanding that fracking would struggle to develop if the ""really ridiculously low"" limits on tremors had not been increased. Ms Engel said the role had been her ideal job but that ""where you've got government in such terrible paralysis, you do have to do something as dramatic as this"" in order to have your voice heard. She added: ""The profile of environmentalism has really been raised and I think the need to reduce our carbon emissions is absolutely urgent and fracking is absolutely one way we can do that."" A spokesperson for the government said it was confident that current regulations ""strike the right balance in ensuring the industry can develop, while ensuring any operations are carried out safely and responsibly"". What is fracking and why is it controversial? Ex-Labour MP is first fracking commissioner Ministers created the commissioner role to give confidence in regulation to local communities, the industry and regulators. In January, the government told shale firm Cuadrilla it had ""no intention of altering"" the regulations after the rulesrepeatedly halted work in Fylde, in Lancashire. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hascalled for a ban on frackingwhich he has said is ""not compatible with climate change prevention"". On Wednesday, the party is expected to call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions and to press the government to declare a national ""climate emergency"". Ms Engel's departure will be welcomed by green groups who said her pro-fracking views precluded her from being an honest broker. A spokeswoman for the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion said Ms Engel's resignation meant the government should ""rethink"" its energy policy and move away from fossil fuels. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, which is in charge of shale gas extraction at sites in Lancashire, said: ""Natascha Engel has accurately assessed the current situation with regard to shale gas extraction in the UK. UK shale explorers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds proving that we have enough gas beneath our feet to supply homes across the country for the next 50 years."" He added: ""We remain wedded to a miniscule micro-seismic threshold which has no scientific basis and is without parallel anywhere else in the world. Meanwhile other industries - including key Government projects like Crossrail, quarrying operations and geothermal - produce ground vibrations far in excess every working day. The situation is beyond ridiculous, it's embarrassing."" The key issue is a government rule that forces the industry to stop fracking every time there is a micro-tremor of 0.5 magnitude. Miss Engel said: ""This amounts to a de facto ban. The paralysis we are seeing in Parliament (on fracking policy) is made worse by social media and a powerful environmental lobby making impossible demands on CO2 emissions."" The government said it wanted to support fracking because gas produces fewer carbon emissions than coal. Ms Engel said the result of the over-strict regulations would be difficulty in making those CO2 reductions, lower economic growth, and less energy security - as the UK would need to import gas rather than produce its own. She continued: ""These points have been made repeatedly but ministers ignore them and instead allow campaign groups to drive policy. ""So many local businesses face collapse. They have invested vast amounts to 'get ready for shale' as the government had told them to. There is, therefore, no purpose in this role."" She pointed out that 49 geoscientists had recently called on the government to relax what they called the over-zealous regulations. The Lancashire for Shale group said her departure was ""a damning indictment of government dithering"", calling for ministers to take another look at ""overly cautious rules on mini earth tremors"". A spokeswoman said: ""Instead of listening to the science and expert opinion, politicians appear to be taking their steer from a vocal minority, aided and abetted by well-funded international campaign groups and their slick PR machines."" Campaigners say fracking is environmentally damaging Environmentalists will be delighted with Ms Engel's decision to quit. They argued that fracking rules on the crowded land of the UK must be far more rigorous than in the open spaces of the USA. More fundamentally, they said it was madness for the UK to be seeking more gas when firms have already discovered far more fossil fuel than scientists say can be burned without wrecking the climate. Greenpeace UK head of politics Rebecca Newsom said the fracking industry had been ""stuck in a time warp"" and that ""it's not surprising some of its backers are getting tired of waiting"", adding: ""What's bad news for frackers is good news for everyone else."" Environmental charity Friends of the Earth said Ms Engel's suggestion that fracking could help reduce carbon emissions was ""outrageous"". It added the government had already ""bent over backwards to help the fracking industry"", despite it being ""bad news for our climate and environment"" and ""deeply unpopular with the public"". Earlier this week, the former CBI head Adair Turner said there was no place for fracking if the UK was to play its part in holding global temperature rise down to 1.5C. The government's policy has also been influenced by its own backbenchers. This week, the Teesside MP Simon Clark said in Parliament that the time for fracking had come and gone.

""So today, as first minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it."" SNP members change leadership's currency plan UK government 'will not grant indyref2 consent' Sturgeon wants independence vote by 2021 The Committee on Climate Change is due to publish new scientific advice on Scotland's emissions targets this week. And Ms Sturgeon made clear that ""if that advice says we can go further or go faster, we will do so"". SNP MSPs - along with those from the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems - voted down a Scottish Parliament motion put forward by the Greens calling for a ""climate emergency"" to be declared on 27 March, after disputing the impact of the oil and gas industry. Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said in that debate that climate change was an ""urgent"" matter, but that the government a duty to respond ""responsibly"" and ""keep Scotland's lights on"". Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Scotland is committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Read more here Ms Sturgeon says she wants another independence referendum within the next two years Ms Sturgeon's conference speech came just days after she announced that she wants a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if the UK leaves the EU. The UK government has already said it will not grant the permission that Ms Sturgeon says is needed before a referendum is actually held. But she told party members that a ""surge"" in support for Scottish independence could force Westminster to change its stance. Ms Sturgeon said this would demonstrate that ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Mss Sturgeon said it was wrong to view Scotland as ""No voters or Yes voters"". Wrong to consider fellow Scots as ""Remainers or Leavers"". In a modern version of Jock Tamson's Bairns, she told delegates that they should view even those who are critical of the SNP as fellow citizens. Perhaps especially those who are critical of the SNP. Nationalists, she said, should make their case with ""decency, respect and dignity"". So far, so familiar. But there is more to this than the customary appeal for humane politics. This is also about strategy. SNP strategists look at the contemporary condition of politics. Febrile, brittle, divided. Fragmented by Brexit chaos. They have concluded that, in such circumstances, it will not do to be too overtly partisan, even about the issue which motivates the SNP - independence. You can only win a referendum if you get 50% of the vote plus one. That, for the SNP, means taking along with you people who are not currently convinced. Read more here Ms Sturgeon also announced a leaflet would be sent to every home in Scotland as part of the ""biggest campaign on the economics of independence in our party's history"". In addition, she revealed the SNP would create a social justice and fairness commission, which she said would ""set out how the proceeds of economic growth in an independent Scotland can be shared much more fairly"". The first minister predicted: ""If we can now show what is possible with the economic powers of independence, we will win a referendum."" She also revealed Scottish Parliament legislation that could pave the way for a referendum will be introduced in May. The aim would be to pass it by the end of the year, she said, so it is in place should the UK government ultimately agree to a referendum being held. The first minister also described how her plans for a Citizens' Assembly would allow people from across Scotland to ""guide the conversation"" about independence.

"This video can not be played The shooting happened at a synagogue in Poway, north of San Diego A gunman opened fire at a synagogue in California on Saturday, killing one woman and wounding three other people, police said. A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested after the attack, in Poway, north of the city of San Diego. The synagogue had been hosting a Passover celebration when the gunman burst in, reports said. Police did not suggest a motive but US President Donald Trump said the attack appeared to be ""a hate crime"". The attack comes exactly six months after ashooting in Pittsburghin which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. America's gun culture in 10 charts As Pittsburgh reeled, its teenagers mobilised San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic ""open letter"" published online. In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he was inspired by theattack on two Christchurch mosqueslast month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting. Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month. Police quickly sealed off the scene of the shooting in Poway A makeshift memorial appeared on a corner near the synagogue ""During the shooting, four individuals were wounded and transported to Palomar hospital,"" Sheriff Gore said. ""One succumbed to their wounds. The other three are in stable condition."" Mayor Steve Vaus said the rabbi had been shot in the hand. ""For this to happen only a week later at the end of the Passover, only a week after Easter is horrific,"" Mr Vaus told MSNBC. Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an ""AR-15 type"" assault rifle. He said an off-duty border patrol officer fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but did not hit him. The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit. ""He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Mr Nisleit said. ""As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle."" On Saturday evening a vigil for the victims was held at the Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church in San Diego. The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers, who the author John Earnest calls an ""inspiration"". Mr Bowers is the man charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October - the deadliest attack on the US Jewish community in the nation's history. The threat of rising anti-Semitism in US In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over. ""I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,"" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled""Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews"",external. A woman stands at a memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October In the wake of Saturday's attack in Poway, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined,""Synagogue shootings - now a thing"",external. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US, says anti-Semitism is on the rise. Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language. The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as ""global special interests"" and ""those who control the levers of power"" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"". ""All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,"" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. ""My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in."" A candlelight vigil was held at Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church President Trump tweeted to offer ""thoughts and prayers"". Allow Twitter content?

"Police say they are investigating with a number of agencies ""how the picture was taken"" A photo said to be of the body of Premier League footballer Emiliano Sala, who was killed in a plane crash earlier this year, has been posted online, prompting a police inquiry. The 28-year-old's body was found in the wreckage of a light aircraft in the English Channel two weeks after the plane vanished near Guernsey. A Dorset Police spokesman said: ""We are aware that a picture reported to be of Mr Sala's body has been shared on social media channels and are disgusted that somebody did this."" He added: ""It is clearly a very difficult time for Mr Sala's family and they should not have to endure additional pain that this shameful act will undoubtedly cause. ""We are investigating this incident and are working together with a number of agencies to establish how the picture was taken and who is responsible."" The Argentine striker had been travelling in a Piper Malibu plane to his first training session at Cardiff City, after completing a Â£15m club record move from Nantes FC, when it crashed on 21 January. The body of the pilot, David Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, has not been found. A Cardiff spokesman said: ""Cardiff City FC expresses its disgust and outrage at the individual/individuals who thoughtlessly took and shared the image."" Air accident investigators' photo showing the rear left side of the fuselage on the seabed, from where Sala's body was recovered On Friday it was announced that Sala's father, Horacio Sala,had died after suffering a heart attack,three months after his son's death. Sala's body was recovered from the wreckage in the Channel on 8 February, after a private rescue team took over the search for the missing plane. Cardiff City seek talks with Nantes over Emiliano Sala transfer fee dispute Cardiff set to claim transfer Emiliano Sala deal 'not legally binding' Emiliano Sala plane crash: The story behind the transfer flights The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) are still looking into why the plane crashed. The legality of Sala's flight has not yet been established,but a preliminary AAIB reportin February said the pilot was not licensed to carry fee-paying passengers and the plane was not registered for commercial flights. On 15 April, Cardiff City submitted evidence to football's world governing body, Fifa, in a dispute with Nantes over the Â£15m transfer fee for Sala. Cardiff have so far refused to make an interim payment towards the fee for the striker. The Premier League club claim the deal was not legally binding and Nantes referred the dispute to Fifa, An inquest into the death of Sala was opened and adjourned at Bournemouth Coroner's Court on 11 February.

After a tough year both professionally and personally, Priya needed to set herself a challenge to prove her strength and represent the amazing women she works with. Here's her story... ""The last year has been extremely challenging. I finished my PhD while separating from my husband and caring for my mother. When I signed up for the marathon, I needed a challenge, a focus, and throughout the training I struggled with injuries and a lot of emotional ups and downs. Sunday is a test for me to prove to myself that I can do this. I work in the public health sector in low and middle income countries. While I am running I will be thinking of all the amazing women that I have come across in these countries who do not have such opportunities. But most of all I am running to heal so that I can be strong enough to do the work I do. It's been an emotional journey but I'm so excited to be running this weekend. Despite this being my third London Marathon, I am nervous, I haven't covered enough miles due to illness and injuries but what matters now is that I am believe in myself."" Four years ago, Del Singh weighed 25.5 stone. He was in danger of having a stroke, developing diabetes, getting cancer and ultimately not see his five children and his grandchildren grow up. But fast forward to 2019, and Del, now aged 56, will be on the start line for the London Marathon for the first time. So what changed? âIâm a British-born Sikh, but coming from an Indian background, looking after my family came first. But in doing so I was neglecting the most important thing in the equation â and that was me, walking even a short distance made me out of breath,â Del Said. âWhen a doctor told me that if I was to carry on the trajectory I was on, with a sedentary lifestyle and overeating that I would probably die before 66 the age at which my father died. It was a real wake-up call.â Del and his wife, Jas, decided to use their savings â earmarked for a new kitchen â so he could undergo gastric sleeve bariatric surgery. Six months after surgery, he took up walking. He was soon clocking up more than 15,000 steps a day â and looking for excuses not to drive. Del then started running and took part in half marathon in 2017 and the Loch Ness Marathon in 2018. Spurred on by his success in completing this toughest of marathons, he applied for a place at 2019âs London Marathon. âMy goal was to give myself a fighting chance to live beyond 66,â said Del. âI think Iâve achieved my goal. My message to others is donât leave it too late to change. Donât buy the kitchen â buy a new life.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played London Marathon: Sir Mo Farah expresses his disappointment Gary Taylor was diagnosed
with a rare tumour in his neck in 2016. Fortunately it was benign. However, he
was told that due to the invasive nature of the surgery to remove it, this
meant that Gary wouldnât ever be able to eat again. Gary said: ""I lost five stone to begin with, my confidence and strength took a big knock. I didnât want to leave hospital, I had panic attacks and I used to grind my teeth as if I was chewing too. Now Iâm less selfâconscious, exercise has really helped me with that. When I said I wanted to run marathons, I knew there could be complications, but I spoke to my nurse specialists and they got completely behind me. Gary will be need to carry a specialist backpack and feeding pump to constantly deliver the special blend of nutrients, water and electrolytes he needs while running.The equipment will need to be changed three times during the run and a volunteer support runner will be on hand to assist with the equipment. ""They want me to live a ânormalâ life and my nurse, along with my hospital dietitian have done everything they can to support my dreams â it definitely isnât part of their âday jobsâ, yet theyâre just as excited about it as I am. I want to do this to show people who are starting to tube feed that it isnât the end of the world. Itâs scary and overwhelming but you will adjust and thereâs an incredible support network available."" Adam's marathon journey started back in 2006, when his lack of work/life balance lead him to cancelling a much needed family holiday in Italy. Needless to say something needed to change. Here's Adam's story... ""Work was piling up, long hours left me irritable and tired and I was often absent for bedtimes and playtimes at home. I was failing to be a good husband and a good father. Looking back I wouldnât say I was suicidal, but one day driving home from work I found myself thinking, âIf I swerved, itâd look like an accident and theyâd be able to do some much with the Life Insuranceâ¦â That probably wasn't the most rational thought to be going through my head. I knew something needed to change, and fast. Through help and support from Care for the Family, I started to refocus my attention and I actually moved jobs. I began to put my family first and focus on the important things like my own mental health. Running had always been something I did on my own - my escape time, my thinking time, my 'me against myself' time. But for 2019 London Marathon, I took a leap of faith and joined a local running club. Suddenly the runs went quicker as I was busy chatting, not noticing the miles. When I struggled on the long runs, there were people to encourage me to keep going. I found a camaraderie and a kinship with like minded running enthusiasts. Since joining the club, My 5k and 10k times have been shrinking almost as much as my waistline and if I can help one other person in the situation I was, then it will all be worth it.""

"A section of the crane plunged into Mercer Street, Seattle Four people were killed and three others injured when a construction crane collapsed in the US city of Seattle. Cars were crushed when the crane fell from a building site and into a road in the South Lake Union district, the Seattle Fire Department said. Two were killed working in the crane and two were killed in their cars. A woman and her baby, and a man in his 20s, were injured and taken to hospital, officials said. The incident happened at about 15:30 local time (22:30 GMT) on Saturday. Witness Esther Nelson told the Seattle Times,externalthat the crane appeared to break in half during strong winds. ""Half of it was flying down sideways on the building, the other half fell down on the street, crossing both lanes of traffic,"" she said. The building under construction was badly damaged.

"This video can not be played Warnings are ""tip of the iceberg"", says addiction counsellor Nicki Hari All opioid medicines in the UK will carry prominent warnings on their labels saying they can cause addiction, the health secretary has announced. Matt Hancock acted after figures in England and Wales revealed a-more-than 60% increase in prescriptions for opioid painkillers in the last decade. People needed protection ""from the darker side to painkillers,"" he said. Health experts welcomed the move, saying opioids can cause ""life-altering and sometimes fatal addictions"". NHS accused of fuelling rise in opioid addiction What are opioids and what are the risks? Illicit and prescription drugs 'played role in 10 deaths' in NI Opioids, such as morphine or fentanyl, can be highly effective for managing severe pain but they can also be highly addictive, the Department of Health (DoH) said. It warned the number of prescriptions in England and Wales issued for these sorts of medicines had risen dramatically from more than 14 million in 2008 to 23 million last year. The DoH added there are also some opioids available over the counter, such as codeine-based painkillers, which are weaker in strength but can also cause addiction. From 2008 to 2018, the number of codeine-related deaths in England and Wales has more than doubled to more than 150, it said. In Scotland, codeine-related deaths spiked at 43 in 2016, dropping to 27 in 2017,National Records of Scotland,externalsaid. In Northern Ireland, there were16 codeine-related deaths in 2017,external. A large group of drugs used mainly to treat pain Includes naturally occurring chemicals like morphine and codeine, as well as synthetic drugs Codeine, morphine and methadone are among opioids judged by the World Health Organization as essential for treatment of pain and end-of-life care Some opioid medications - methadone and buprenorphine - are used to help people break their addictions to stronger opioids like heroin Moderate and severe pain relief Limited time treatment of pain that does not respond to standard painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and paracetamol Usually used for acute pain - such as after surgery or terminally-ill cancer patients They can be highly addictive Pleasurable feeling that results from taking opioids can contribute to psychological dependence on the drugs Higher doses can slow breathing and heart rate, which can lead to death Mixing with alcohol or other sedatives such as benzodiazepines can also have serious consequences Mr Hancock said: ""I have been incredibly concerned by the recent increase in people addicted to opioid drugs. ""Painkillers were a major breakthrough in modern medicine and are hugely important to help people manage pain alongside their busy lives but they must be treated with caution. ""We know that too much of any painkiller can damage your health, and some opioids are highly addictive and can ruin lives like an illegal drug. ""Things are not as bad here as in America, but we must act now to protect people from the darker side to painkillers."" Lisa Peake, from London I was prescribed painkillers for chronic neck pain after an accident in February 2014 but the pain didn't go away. I was taking codeine four to five times a day, tramadol as a top-up once a day, as well as naproxen and co-dydramol four or five times a day. Opioids affect your mental capacity, you feel dizzy, you can't concentrate and it's hard for you to do your job. I went on a three-week hospital pain management programme in October 2016 and they helped wean me off the meds and rely on other methods of pain control. I had all the symptoms, albeit to a lesser extent, of a drug addict doing the same. It feels like you've got thousands of insects inside your skin. You can't find any comfort, you can't sleep and your bowel movements are shot to pieces. Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, has welcomed the government action. She said: ""We know that long-term use of painkillers can lead to life-altering and sometimes fatal addictions, so I am delighted to see measures put in place to raise awareness of the risks of codeine and prescribed drugs. ""It is vital that anyone who is prescribed strong painkillers takes them only as long as they are suffering from serious pain. ""As soon as the pain starts to alleviate, the drugs have done their job, and it is important to switch to over-the-counter medication like paracetamol which do not carry the same risk of addiction that comes with long term use."" Until the late 90s in the UK, opioids were usually restricted to cancer patients and for those in acute pain following surgery, but then they began being increasingly prescribed for chronic pain. As our population ages, the number of people living with low back or nerve pain is soaring.  Opioids can be effective in the short term, but don't work for pain that lasts for months or years. The medicine packets already contain leaflets warning about potentially dangerous side-effects and the risks of addiction.  Making these more prominent may encourage patients and their doctors to discuss alternatives such as physical and talking therapies. The variation in prescribing rates between NHS regions shows that it is possible to limit their use. Things have been getting worse here, but are nowhere near as bad as the US which has four times the rate of opioid prescriptions as the UK. Public Health England is already undertaking a review,externalinto prescription medication addiction and is due to report its findings this year. Under Mr Hancock's plan, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will have the power to enforce warnings on opioids packaging, following recommendations from the UK's Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) Opioid expert working group. Dr June Raine, director of the MHRA's vigilance and risk management of medicines division, said: ""This is an important first step to help minimise the risks of addiction associated with opioid medicines, while supporting patients to get the right information at the right time to support their care.""

"The UK should make ""independent"" decisions about whether to let Huawei help build its 5G network, according to China's ambassador in London. The US, Australia and New Zealand say the Chinese firm is a security risk because of its ties to the state. Butwriting in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Liu Xiaoming said Britain should resist pressure from other nations. He said risks should be taken seriously but added the company had enjoyed a ""good track record on security"". Last week, the Daily Telegraph reported the UK had agreed to allow Huawei limited access to help build Britain's new 5G network, amid warnings about possible risks to national security. The paper also reported that various ministers had raised concerns about the plan.

"Bootprints have been laid in the sand in honour of the 749 servicemen who died on 28 April 1944 Hundreds of US servicemen who died in a World War Two disaster while rehearsing the D-Day landings are being remembered in an art installation. Bootprints of 749 troops have been laid out on Slapton Sands, Devon, to mark the 75th anniversary of Exercise Tiger. The men died when convoys training for the Normandy Landings were attacked by German E-Boats off the Devon coast. Artist Martin Barraud hopes the artwork will help raise money for employment projects for veterans. Mr Barraud also designed last year's There But Not There campaign, which placed silhouettes of  ""Tommy"" troops across the UK, to mark the centenary of the end of World War One. ""Our Tommy campaign captured the hearts of the nation, whilst giving a substantial boost to the mental health and wellbeing of veterans,"" he said. ""We're hoping the public will get behind our D-Day 75 campaign by purchasing their own bootprints to mark the great sacrifice of our WW2 heroes, in particular those who helped kick-start the liberation of Europe with the invasion of Normandy on D-Day."" Slapton Sands was used by US forces rehearsing for the D-Day landing at Utah Beach because of its similar geography On 28 April 1944, eight tank landing ships, full of US servicemen and military equipment, converged in Lyme Bay heading for Slapton Sands for the rehearsal. But a group of E-boats from the Kriegsmarine were alerted to heavy radio traffic and intercepted the slow-moving convoy. A series of tragic misfortunes, including communication problems which led to deaths from live Allied fire, compounded the toll. The Exercise Tiger incident was only nominally reported afterwards because of the strict secrecy of the D-Day landings. The D-Day rehearsal that cost 800 lives Survivors' tales of covered up disaster Slapton service remembers Exercise Tiger Pam Wills, 85, from Devon, was just 10 when Exercise Tiger took place near her home, and her family was evacuated before the exercise began. She said: ""The US soldiers came over and talked to us, they gave us sweets and comics, but they then suddenly disappeared. ""We didn't know Exercise Tiger had taken place, but my father, who was in the Royal Observer Corps watching for enemy aircraft, saw ambulances going to and from Slapton Sands, so we knew something was wrong."" A Sherman tank raised from the seabed in 1984 has served a permanent memorial to the dead ever since Commemorative bootprints and special plaques made by veterans to represent each of the 22,763 British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who were killed on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944 will go on sale. Mr Barraud said: ""Our enduring hope is that every one of the US, British and Commonwealth soldiers, sailors and airmen who gave their lives will have a bootprint purchased in their memory.""

"This video can not be played Natascha Engel says she has quit over ""ridiculously low' tremor limits The UK's shale gas commissioner is resigning after just six months, saying fracking is being throttled by rules preventing mini earthquakes. Current government rules,externalmean fracking must be suspended every time a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected. But Natascha Engel, a former Labour MP, said the cautious approach to tremors had created a de facto ban on fracking. She claimed campaign groups ""were driving policy"" - but the groups say fracking damages the environment. In her resignation letter, Ms Engel - who was MP for North East Derbyshire from 2005 to 2017 - said government was ""pandering to what we know to be myths and scare stories"" about shale gas extraction. She told BBC News that when she took up the post, there had been an understanding that fracking would struggle to develop if the ""really ridiculously low"" limits on tremors had not been increased. Ms Engel said the role had been her ideal job but that ""where you've got government in such terrible paralysis, you do have to do something as dramatic as this"" in order to have your voice heard. She added: ""The profile of environmentalism has really been raised and I think the need to reduce our carbon emissions is absolutely urgent and fracking is absolutely one way we can do that."" A spokesperson for the government said it was confident that current regulations ""strike the right balance in ensuring the industry can develop, while ensuring any operations are carried out safely and responsibly"". What is fracking and why is it controversial? Ex-Labour MP is first fracking commissioner Ministers created the commissioner role to give confidence in regulation to local communities, the industry and regulators. In January, the government told shale firm Cuadrilla it had ""no intention of altering"" the regulations after the rulesrepeatedly halted work in Fylde, in Lancashire. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hascalled for a ban on frackingwhich he has said is ""not compatible with climate change prevention"". On Wednesday, the party is expected to call for a dramatic cut in the UK's carbon emissions and to press the government to declare a national ""climate emergency"". Ms Engel's departure will be welcomed by green groups who said her pro-fracking views precluded her from being an honest broker. A spokeswoman for the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion said Ms Engel's resignation meant the government should ""rethink"" its energy policy and move away from fossil fuels. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, which is in charge of shale gas extraction at sites in Lancashire, said: ""Natascha Engel has accurately assessed the current situation with regard to shale gas extraction in the UK. UK shale explorers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds proving that we have enough gas beneath our feet to supply homes across the country for the next 50 years."" He added: ""We remain wedded to a miniscule micro-seismic threshold which has no scientific basis and is without parallel anywhere else in the world. Meanwhile other industries - including key Government projects like Crossrail, quarrying operations and geothermal - produce ground vibrations far in excess every working day. The situation is beyond ridiculous, it's embarrassing."" The key issue is a government rule that forces the industry to stop fracking every time there is a micro-tremor of 0.5 magnitude. Miss Engel said: ""This amounts to a de facto ban. The paralysis we are seeing in Parliament (on fracking policy) is made worse by social media and a powerful environmental lobby making impossible demands on CO2 emissions."" The government said it wanted to support fracking because gas produces fewer carbon emissions than coal. Ms Engel said the result of the over-strict regulations would be difficulty in making those CO2 reductions, lower economic growth, and less energy security - as the UK would need to import gas rather than produce its own. She continued: ""These points have been made repeatedly but ministers ignore them and instead allow campaign groups to drive policy. ""So many local businesses face collapse. They have invested vast amounts to 'get ready for shale' as the government had told them to. There is, therefore, no purpose in this role."" She pointed out that 49 geoscientists had recently called on the government to relax what they called the over-zealous regulations. The Lancashire for Shale group said her departure was ""a damning indictment of government dithering"", calling for ministers to take another look at ""overly cautious rules on mini earth tremors"". A spokeswoman said: ""Instead of listening to the science and expert opinion, politicians appear to be taking their steer from a vocal minority, aided and abetted by well-funded international campaign groups and their slick PR machines."" Campaigners say fracking is environmentally damaging Environmentalists will be delighted with Ms Engel's decision to quit. They argued that fracking rules on the crowded land of the UK must be far more rigorous than in the open spaces of the USA. More fundamentally, they said it was madness for the UK to be seeking more gas when firms have already discovered far more fossil fuel than scientists say can be burned without wrecking the climate. Greenpeace UK head of politics Rebecca Newsom said the fracking industry had been ""stuck in a time warp"" and that ""it's not surprising some of its backers are getting tired of waiting"", adding: ""What's bad news for frackers is good news for everyone else."" Environmental charity Friends of the Earth said Ms Engel's suggestion that fracking could help reduce carbon emissions was ""outrageous"". It added the government had already ""bent over backwards to help the fracking industry"", despite it being ""bad news for our climate and environment"" and ""deeply unpopular with the public"". Earlier this week, the former CBI head Adair Turner said there was no place for fracking if the UK was to play its part in holding global temperature rise down to 1.5C. The government's policy has also been influenced by its own backbenchers. This week, the Teesside MP Simon Clark said in Parliament that the time for fracking had come and gone.

"This video can not be played Brother Stanley recalls coming face-to-face with one of the Sri Lanka bombing suspects Fifteen people including six children were killed in Sri Lanka on Friday when suspected Islamist militants blew themselves up in a raid, police said. The raid occurred in Sainthamaruthu, near the hometown of the suspected ringleader of the Easter Sunday attacks that killed at least 250 people. Gunmen opened fire as troops attempted to raid a house, police said. Three men set off explosives, they added, killing the children and three women. Three others died in gunfire. One civilian was caught in the crossfire and died, according to police, while a wounded woman and child were taken to hospital. Footage shown on state television showed charred bodies inside the house, one cradling a rifle. Explosives, a generator, a drone, and batteries were also visible. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? Children of the Easter Sunday carnage US woman wrongly identified as suspect Around the same time, security forces raided another building in a nearby town where they said they found explosives and a drone. Some 600 Muslims fled the area as the raid unfolded and took shelter in a school, residents said. By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Sainthamaruthu There's an eerie silence in the street where security forces carried out the raid. Three armed policemen stand outside the house, which has suffered damage to its roof.  Steel gates and glass windows have been shattered. There are bloodstains on the ground. A van damaged during the shooting is still there. There were suspicions that the van could have been booby-trapped but police have not found anything inside the van so far. Police found charred remains of several people inside the building. All the neighbours in the street have moved out of the area because of fears for their safety. Police  say a woman and a child were rescued from the house. Both of them were injured. They believe they could be the wife and daughter of radical cleric Zahran Hashim, the suspected mastermind of the Easter Sunday attacks. Sainthamaruthu is a predominantly Muslim town overlooking the Indian Ocean. It is about 360km (240 miles) from the capital, Colombo. Residents here are still in disbelief that hardcore militants were hiding in a middle-class locality. It is still not clear how many suspected Islamists are still in hiding. Sri Lanka has been on high alert since a co-ordinated wave of bombings last Sunday, which also wounded more than 500 people. The bombings targeted churches that were packed full for the Easter holiday, as well as hotels popular with tourists. Sri Lankan authorities blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Tawheed Jamath, for the attacks, although the Islamic State group (IS) has also claimed it played a role. President Maithripala Sirisena outlawed the extremists under new emergency laws, as well as the militant group Jamathei Millathu - whose members are also thought to have been involved. Sri Lankan soldiers inspect a car at a checkpoint in the capital, Colombo Security forces have carried out raids across the country since the attacks, but officials say there are dozens of IS sympathisers still at large in the country. Police said the raid on Friday followed a tip-off about a location in the Muslim-majority town of Ampara Sainthamaruthu, near Batticaloa. The area is not far from the hometown of Zahran Hashim, who is said to have died in one of the bombings on Sunday. St Anthony's shrine in Colombo was one of the churches targeted by bombers In another raid in the same town, IS flags, 150 sticks of gelignite explosive, thousands of steel pellets and a drone camera were found, a military spokesman said. According to local media reports, 10 arrests were made across the country on Friday, bringing the total number detained since last Sunday to 80. President Sirisena has told reporters that intelligence services believed about 130 suspects linked to IS were in the country and that police were hunting 70 still at large. The manager of one of the Colombo hotels targeted by a suicide bomber last Sunday described to the BBC the moments leading up to the attack. Rohan Karr said the suspected bomber checked into the Cinnamon Grand hotel the evening before, was served a welcome drink and then went up to his room.

The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka has cancelled all Sunday Masses until further notice. Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Ranjith said he had seen a leaked security document warning of further attacks. Cardinal Ranjith said that the Church had not been told about intelligence warnings of possible attacks. ""We didn't know anything. It came as a thunderbolt for us,"" he told reporters. Asked about the warnings, he said: ""I felt betrayed a little bit. I felt sad. It's a very serious lapse on the part of the security agencies that they didn't tell us about it."" Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, fears further attacks are possible He said the church would halt all services until further notice, and urged parishioners to instead ""stay indoors and do their prayers"". Security was stepped up around mosques for Friday prayers, while some Muslims stayed away, fearing revenge attacks. Sri Lanka's police chief and top defence ministry official both resigned over the bombings. But Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that crucial intelligence warnings had not been passed on to him. He argued that as he had not been aware of the warnings, he did not need to step down from his position. ""If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,"" he said, adding: ""But what do you do when you are out of the loop?""

Participants dressed as Batman to Spiderman have run the tough 26.2-mile race, in what has been a record-breaking year for applications. More than 40,000 took part to the cheers and applause from crowds. Eliud Kipchoge won the men's race with a new course record and second fastest time ever, while Sir Mo Farah finished fifth. Kenya's Brigid Kosgei won the women's race with compatriot Vivian Cheruiyot coming in second - a role reversal from last year when she beat Kosgei to the crown.

An eight-strong team from TV soap EastEnders are running for Dementia Revolution on behalf of Dame Barbara Windsor, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2014. Just before the race, her husband Scott Mitchell said: ""I'm feeling so excited, it's almost like a school trip and Christmas all rolled into one. I'm a little bit nervous as I've never been runner."" He added that someone gave him some great advice that ""you ain't going to win it, so just enjoy it"". ""I just want to take everything in and I want to thank everyone who has donated,"" he said. Prince Harry presented Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei with their medals While running across Tower Bridge, Helen Skelton said she had not run since before she had her two children and was nervous. ""I want the boys to be proud, I want to raise lots of money for prostate cancer but ultimately I love this event because it makes you like people,"" she said. The TV presenter added she was aiming for a time of 4.5 hours but added ""you do not come here for a time, but for the atmosphere as the crowd is unbelievable, makes you want to cry"".

Many runners were attempting world records At the Embankment, there was one touching moment when a couple next to me all of a sudden started to jump up and down screaming with excitement as they noticed their son approaching. Once he spotted them, he immediately ran over. A quick hug and exclamation of how tired he felt saw him back on his way. His parents then quickly went in the opposite direction to get the Tube to try and race him to the finish line. He wasn't the only tired one though, a few people were clearly feeling the full affects of the previous 23 miles and as they jogged - and walked - by. In contrast to the exhaustion of the runners, was the energy of the crowd, which comprised of a host of samba and brass bands, whistles and inflatable clappers. And if that wasn't enough, spectators were offering high fives and shouting out runners' names to give them a final boost.

"This video can not be played The shooting happened at a synagogue in Poway, north of San Diego A gunman opened fire at a synagogue in California on Saturday, killing one woman and wounding three other people, police said. A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested after the attack, in Poway, north of the city of San Diego. The synagogue had been hosting a Passover celebration when the gunman burst in, reports said. Police did not suggest a motive but US President Donald Trump said the attack appeared to be ""a hate crime"". The attack comes exactly six months after ashooting in Pittsburghin which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. America's gun culture in 10 charts As Pittsburgh reeled, its teenagers mobilised San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic ""open letter"" published online. In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he was inspired by theattack on two Christchurch mosqueslast month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting. Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month. Police quickly sealed off the scene of the shooting in Poway A makeshift memorial appeared on a corner near the synagogue ""During the shooting, four individuals were wounded and transported to Palomar hospital,"" Sheriff Gore said. ""One succumbed to their wounds. The other three are in stable condition."" Mayor Steve Vaus said the rabbi had been shot in the hand. ""For this to happen only a week later at the end of the Passover, only a week after Easter is horrific,"" Mr Vaus told MSNBC. Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an ""AR-15 type"" assault rifle. He said an off-duty border patrol officer fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but did not hit him. The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit. ""He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Mr Nisleit said. ""As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle."" On Saturday evening a vigil for the victims was held at the Rancho Bernardo Community Presbyterian Church in San Diego. The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers, who the author John Earnest calls an ""inspiration"". Mr Bowers is the man charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October - the deadliest attack on the US Jewish community in the nation's history. The threat of rising anti-Semitism in US In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over. ""I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,"" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled""Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews"",external. A woman stands at a memorial at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October In the wake of Saturday's attack in Poway, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined,""Synagogue shootings - now a thing"",external. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US, says anti-Semitism is on the rise. Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language. The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as ""global special interests"" and ""those who control the levers of power"" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"". ""All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,"" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. ""My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in.""

"Amara Majeed is a US activist fighting anti-Muslim stereotypes Sri Lankan police have apologised after they wrongly identified a US woman as a suspect in the Easter Sunday attacks. Amara Majeed is a Muslim activist and author who wrote a book, titled The Foreigners, to combat stereotypes about Islam. ""I have this morning been FALSELY identified by the Sri Lankan government as one of the ISIS Easter attackers in Sri Lanka,"" she tweeted. ""What a thing to wake up to!"" Around 253 people died and hundreds were injured in the Sri Lanka attacks, where suicide bombers struck several hotels and churches. A photograph of Amara Majeed was released by Sri Lankan authorities identifying her as a suspect linked to the bloodshed. The name attached to the picture was Abdul Cader Fathima Khadiya - but the picture was of Baltimore-born Ms Majeed, whose parents are from Sri Lanka. ""This is obviously completely false and frankly, considering that our communities are already greatly afflicted with issues of surveillance, I don't need more false accusations and scrutiny,"" Ms Majeed wrote on Twitter.

"The ruthlessness of the suicide attacks has stunned Sri Lankans Sri Lanka is in a state of shock and confusion, trying to understand how a little-known Islamist group may have unleashed the wave of co-ordinated suicide bombings that resulted in the Easter Sunday carnage - the worst since the end of the civil war a decade ago. The South Asian island nation has experience of such attacks - suicide bombers were used by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war. But the ruthlessness of the new atrocities has stunned the nation anew. Eventually the government spokesman, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, came out and blamed National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), a home-grown Islamist group, for the bombings. ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded,"" he told reporters on Monday. That might go some way to explaining how a group that has been blamed for promoting hate speech may now have been able to scale up its capacity so monumentally. Who are the victims of the Sri Lanka attacks? 'My heart shattered when I saw the bodies' On Tuesday, however, the Islamic State (IS) group said its militants had carried out the attacks. It published a video of eight men the group claimed were behind the attacks. The IS claim should be treated cautiously. It is not clear whether these men were trained by the group or simply inspired by IS ideology. The manner in which NTJ was identified was circuitous. The prime minister said there had been warnings made to officials that hadn't been shared with the cabinet. He said only the president would get such briefings, even though it is not clear if he personally did in this instance. This is not an insignificant statement from a prime minister who was at loggerheads with the president for much of the past year. Many are drawing a conclusion about how political discord can have serious consequences - as well as undermining trust in the messages being put out. If the suicide bombers were local Sri Lankan Muslims, as stated by the government, then it is a colossal failure by the intelligence agencies. Information is also now emerging in the US media that the Sri Lankan government may also have had warnings from US and Indian intelligence about a possible threat. ""Our understanding is that [the warning] was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to President Maithripala Sirisena, said. The Sri Lankan president, who oversees security forces, has now set up a committee to find out what went wrong. Sri Lankan intelligence was credited with foiling several suicide attacks by the Tamil Tiger rebels at the height of the civil war and for penetrating a well-knit and ruthless Tamil Tiger organisation. While this is clearly a security and political failure, there are also questions about the nature of communal strife in Sri Lanka's more recent history. During the civil war, Muslims were also targeted by Tamil Tiger rebels and suffered at their hands. But Muslim community leaders say successive Sri Lankan governments have failed to restore confidence among young Muslims following more recent attacks by some members of the majority Sinhalese Buddhist community. One of the worst incidents was in the town of Digana in central Sri Lanka where one person died when a Sinhalese mob attacked Muslim shops and mosques in March last year. Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency after attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses in 2018 ""After Digana quite a few Muslims lost faith in the government to provide them security. Some of them got the idea that they can defend themselves,"" says Hilmy Ahamed, vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council. The attacks and what the youths perceived as the lack of action by the government may have led some of them towards groups like NTJ. Some of the radicals were blamed for damaging Buddhist statues in recent years and their leader was arrested last year for offending religious sentiments. He later apologised for offending the sentiments of the Buddhist Sinhalese. Now it is widely believed a new group emerged a few years ago under the leadership of Zaharan Hashim, a radical Muslim preacher from eastern Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Who are National Thowheed Jamath? Mr Hashim posted several videos on social media purportedly promoting hatred against non-Muslims. Most of his videos are in the Tamil language. His teachings are said to have attracted several Muslim youths. ""This man was preaching hate with lots of YouTube videos on social media posts. Some of us reported him to the national intelligence services. Once about three years ago and once in January this year,"" says Mr Ahamed. He added that  security services did not take any action against Mr Hashim. Reports say the preacher was one of the suicide bombers though it's yet to be confirmed. Like Muslims, Christians are a minority in Sri Lanka Muslim community leaders say a few youths went to Syria to join IS, and some of them were killed in fighting there. It's important not to overstate this, though, and a former senior military officer Maj Gen (Retired) GA Chandrasiri says ""we have very cordial relationship with the Muslims. Most Muslims are not with these people. They are peace loving people"". There are no reports so far of a high number of jihadists returning to Sri Lanka. But even if a select few jihadists are angry with the majority, why were Christians targeted? In the complex cocktail of Sri Lanka's religious and ethnic tensions, Christians are almost unique for not perpetrating any kind of violence on behalf of their community. After all, it is a religion that crosses ethnic lines. I covered the Sri Lankan civil war for years and reported on many Tamil Tiger suicide attacks. It took years for the group to be able to learn to detonate such devices. So it is intriguing that a lesser-known Islamist group, with a few home-grown radicals, could carry out six - some say even seven - suicide attacks with such pinpoint precision and devastation. None of them failed. Even though connections with global jihadist groups are unclear, the choice of major luxury hotels and Christians as a target - in addition to the sophistication of the operation - makes it plausible that local radicalism has come under the influence of global jihadist networks.  It would be a tried and tested pattern in global attacks. 'Church of miracles' is a symbol of hope 'I thought we left violence behind us' During the Sri Lankan civil war foreign tourists were spared and attacks on outsiders were rare. In the latest bombings, many foreigners were killed and this has raised the spectre of links with al-Qaeda or IS. ""For this type of operation you need lots of assistance from outside. You need finances, training and technique for this kind of work. You can't do these things alone. May be there was some help from outside,"" Gen Chandrasiri said. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka has soared after the end of the civil war Violence is not new to Sri Lanka. It went through turbulent times during a left-wing insurrection in the 1970s followed by a nearly three-decade bloody war with the Tamil Tiger rebels. Tens of thousands of people were killed. But the ruthlessness and sophistication of the latest atrocities indicate that it will be challenge for the Sri Lankan security forces to deal with those behind the bombings. The last thing the Sri Lankan public wants is more violence and recrimination.
