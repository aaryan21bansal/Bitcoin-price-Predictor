"The AA says the safety of women is ""100% at the top"" of its priorities after claims it no longer prioritised call-outs to lone female drivers. The firm faced a backlash after customer Helen Mott was told lone male and female drivers were given the same priority as ""that's equality"". Responding to her story on Twitter, the AA said it didn't ""prioritise based on gender"" but would consider the location of where someone had broken down. The company later apologised. Technology helping keep women safe on the streets 'I begged bus driver to let me travel home safely' Ms Mott posted about her experience on Tuesday, believing the long standing practice was still in place. She wrote: ""I am a lone woman whose car has broken down at night in the dark. ""Your call handler has told me you treat lone women and lone men as exactly the same priority in such circumstances because 'that's equality'."" The AA replied to her tweet saying she had been ""advised correctly"". They added: ""We don't prioritise based on gender, we do consider the location so as an example we would prioritise someone on a motorway over someone in a supermarket car park."" The response attracted a lot of attention on social media, including from Labour MP Rosie Duffield. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Duffield said: ""The AA calls itself the fourth emergency service. We just need to know that at that end of the phone is someone prioritising our safety. ""We are more at risk physically than men in that situation. It's just a fact, I'm afraid."" The MP wrote to the company's president, Edmund King, saying the reply had ""provoked a huge response from women, and many men, who had understood that a lone woman would always be given priority... due to the reality of gender-based violence and the current huge publicity surrounding violence against women and girls."" Replying to her letter, Mr King, said ""the safety of women, and all vulnerable customers, is 100% at the top"" of its priorities. He said the AA had ""reminded staff"" of its ""vulnerable customer processes and procedures"", and said if there was a breakdown involving a lone woman, ""where there is any concern raised by the customer, they receive the highest level of care and priority."" Green Flag and the RAC both said they prioritised people in vulnerable situations, including lone women.

"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng refused Aquind Ltd development consent The UK government has refused permission for a Â£1.2bn electricity link between England and France. Aquind Ltd wanted to lay cables through Portsmouth, Hampshire, to Normandy. But a decision noticeposted on the government's website,externalsaid Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was not satisfied ""more appropriate alternatives to the proposed route"" had been fully considered. Aquind said it was ""disappointed"" and would consider a legal challenge. The company - which is part-owned by Russian-born Victor Fedotov - and another of his businesses, have donated Â£700,000 to 34 Conservative MPs since the Aquind project began, theBBC Panorama programme reportedin October. Another director, Ukrainian-born Alexander Temerko, has donated a further Â£700,000 to the party. Aquind has previously said the planned 2GW interconnector could supply up to 5% of the UK's energy needs. Aquind is part-owned by Ukrainian-born British businessman Alexander Temerko The decision letter said the project's ""proposed landfall in an urban location"" was of particular concern to Mr Kwarteng. It said: ""The Secretary of State considers that in the circumstances of this particular application it is exceptionally necessary to consider whether sufficient consideration has been given to whether there are more appropriate alternatives to the proposed route."" Both Portsmouth MPs, Labour's Stephen Morgan and Conservative Penny Mordaunt, have objected to the scheme. Ms Mordaunt, also a trade minister, celebrated the decision by tweeting ""we did it"". She said: ""Thank you to everyone who campaigned against Aquind and this ridiculous proposal that would have damaged our city and it would have damaged the country."" Flick Drummond, MP for West Meon, said the decision was ""extremely good news"". ""It was going to be very disruptive to my constituents so they will be very pleased,"" she said. MP Stephen Morgan, pictured with a megaphone, has supported local protesters against the project Mr Morgan said: ""The government have finally seen sense and stopped the disastrous Aquind project. ""This is a victory for the people of Portsmouth over years of uncertainty and Tory cronyism."" Portsmouth protest group Let's Stop Aquind also voiced opposition to the project. It said: ""The Pandora Papers investigation revealed the hidden wealth of Aquind's owner and cast further doubts on the suitability of this company for a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project."" Lawyers for Aquind and Mr Temerko previously said their donations were ""entirely lawful, properly declared and have not been made in return for any special treatment"". Mr Fedotov said that he ""has never had any interest in British politics and has operated in an open and transparent manner"". The Conservative Party said fundraising was a legitimate activity and did not influence political policy. In a statement released following the announcement, an Aquind spokesperson said: ""We disagree with the decision of the secretary of state, and the rationale behind it. ""We are considering the decision, the grounds for the refusal, and a potential legal challenge (judicial review). ""We believe our application for a development consent order to be accurate and robust, and it has met all the requirements. ""We will continue the development of Aquind Interconnector, and we will be engaging with the relevant parties in the coming weeks.""

"Tracey Emin is best known for her headline-grabbing 1990s works, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With and My Bed Tracey Emin has asked the government to remove her neon artwork from 10 Downing Street, saying it did not need ""any encouragement"" for a party atmosphere. More Passion, her 2011 gift to David Cameron's government was meant to evoke such an atmosphere, like ""funfairs, casinos, bars"", she told Woman's Hour. But given the row over drinks parties at Downing Street during lockdown, she has asked for it to be taken down. ""People are really genuinely upset about this,""she told the Radio 4 show. ""It's not about a political thing, it's a moral, ethical thing,"" she said. ""People had to watch their loved ones be buried on their telephone, or be cremated on their telephone,"" she added, noting how Her Majesty, The Queen had ""sat there stoically alone"" during Prince Philip's funeral. Why UK prime minister is under pressure to quit No 10 culture: Mixing work and socialising Emin was speaking after making her feelings clear about the piece on Instagram on Wednesday, writing that the ""current situation is shameful"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrecently apologised to Buckingham Palacefor two staff parties in No 10 on the night before the Royal funeral. In Januaryhe apologisedfor attending a ""bring your own booze"" party in Downing Street during the first Covid lockdown. Ahead of Prime Minister's Questions, he told MPs he had attended the gathering, held in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020, for 25 minutes. He is now facing down an attempt from some Tory MPsto oust him as leaderover lockdown parties held in Downing Street. The government is facing mounting pressure over several events that are alleged to have been held during lockdowns. How many No 10 lockdown parties do we know about? Senior civil servantSue Gray is expected to publish the findingsof her report into the potential breaking of Covid rules at Downing Street this week. The PM, Emin revealed to presenter Emma Barnett, once told her he likes the artwork in question - which now belongs to the Government Art Collection. His official spokesman told the BBC ""we will discuss its location with the artist, my understanding is it will remain part of the collection"". A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told BBC News: ""When an artwork comes into the Government Art Collection, the Collection can display the work at any of its 365 locations. ""On occasions the collection may consult with an artist when a work is going to a specific location."" While Emin is not asking for it back, she does want it to be removed from Number 10 at the moment. ""I don't actually want the neon back because I donated it to the government's art collection and what people have to understand is, if [Labour leader] Keir Starmer was to become prime minister next week, and he liked my neon, it's still hanging in there,"" she said. ""When the Government Art Collection has a work of yours, it's for any government, it's for time immemorial. They hang it in embassies, schools, hospitals all over the place. So I don't want the work back because I don't need it. ""I would simply like at the moment for it to be taken down. Because the neon is notoriously for a party atmosphere. You have them in funfairs, casinos, bars or whatever and I really do not feel that Number 10 needs any encouragement on this level."" ""This government, they need morecompassion,"" she continued, with reference to the work's title. ""That's what they need, not more passion, they don't need more party atmospheres. ""Most of us are obeying the rules in every single way because this pandemic has affected everybody so terribly - whether it's financially, whether it's health-wise, you know, whether it's people dying, and this government doesn't seem to care about that.""

"Visualisation of a metro link to Glasgow Airport A mass transit network in Glasgow and bridges or tunnels to some of Scotland's islands are among the ideas in the Scottish government's new transport strategy. Ministers havemade 45 recommendations,externalto guide transport investment decisions over the next 20 years. Improving public transport links in the biggest city regions is at the heart of the blueprint. Schemes to encourage more people to walk and cycle are also prioritised. The Scottish government hopes that shifting the priorities of transport spending to greener projects will help tackle climate emissions in the coming years. The strategy does not give timescales or funding commitments for its recommendations. The ideas to be explored over the next two decades include: Introducing more 20mph speed limits and zones Creating networks of segregated freeways for cycling and walking Improved mass transit systems for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow Electrifying more rail routes including the Fife Circle and Perth to Inverness route Improvements to the A75 and A77 road corridors in the south west of Scotland A feasibility study in replacing ferry routes with either bridges or tunnels at the Sound of Harris and Sound of Barra The creation of more segregated cycle routes is included in the transport strategy Michael Matheson, the cabinet secretary for transport, said: ""The investment decisions we make now have never been more important. ""A green recovery from Covid-19 will set us on a path to delivering a fair and just transition to Net Zero. ""This review represents a repositioning of our transport investment priorities - the focus is firmly on how transport can help us protect our climate and improve lives. It takes a balanced and fair approach to all modes of transport, and all areas of Scotland."" Borders Railway extension to Carlisle would be 'best solution' Radical blueprint calls for Glasgow metro Older cars face ban from Edinburgh city centre The idea of a city-wide metro system in Glasgowwas first proposed in 2019and would involve reviving abandoned rail routes, converting heavy rail to light rail and developing on-street trams. Scottish Labour and Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill said: ""Today's announcement failed to provide answers on what the Glasgow metro project will look like, when work will begin and how the work will be funded. ""Glasgow is in desperate need of investment to help it recover from the pandemic and make up for the chronic lack of investment over the last 15 years."" A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said the new transit system would ""have a transformative effect in reducing carbon emissions, boosting public transport and alleviating congestion on the M8, one of Scotland's busiest sections of road."" Electrifying more rail routes is part of the blueprint Colin Howden, director of the Transform Scotland lobby group, said: ""Scottish transport spending has in recent years been massively skewed towards high-carbon road-building. ""So today's focus on active travel, decarbonised public transport and new light rail in the cities is a welcome change of course."" On the proposed studies into bridges or tunnels for the Sound of Barra and Sound of Harris, Mr Howden added: ""I doubt any of these suggested crossings will ever be built. They look as improbable as Boris Johnson's failed Irish Sea Bridge proposal."" Meanwhile, it has been revealed nearly Â£900,000 of taxpayers' money was spent on a study commissioned by Boris Johnson which found it would be too expensive to build a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK government Department for Transport said the research into the feasibility of a fixed link - which was later dismissed as ""impossible to justify"" - cost Â£896,681.

"BT has said most customers will see bills rise by more than 9% from the end of March as households are squeezed by cost of living pressures. The telecoms giant said broadband and phone bills will jump by 9.3% following a ""dramatic increase"" in data usage over the last few years. Affected customers will pay an extra Â£3.50 a month on average from 31 March. But households on certain packages, as well as those claiming benefits, will be exempt. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Around two years ago, BT changed how it raised bills, saying it would make one increase a year at the end of March of 3.9% plus inflation as measured by the consumer price index to reflect ""rising costs to the business"". Inflation is running at a 30 year-high of 5.4%. On Thursday, Nick Lane, BT's managing director for consumer customer services,wrote in a blog post,external: ""Price rises are never popular, but are sometimes a necessary part of business, if we're to keep up with the rising costs we face."" Customers' data usage had ""increased dramatically"" with a 90% increase on broadband usage since 2018, and a 79% increase on mobile phones since 2019. Working from home, online education and TV streaming has led to more demands on BT's network, he said. ""Unlike most things we buy, like food, electricity or fuel, you don't pay more for using more as our data plans are unlimited, but we need to keep investing in our networks so they can handle this huge increase in demand,"" he said. However, customers on BT's at-cost social tariff, BT Home Essentials, will not see a rise in prices, and neither will those on BT Basic. To qualify for these packages, customers need to be claiming benefits such as Universal Credit. Customers with just a landline will also not experience an increase. BT said it will write to customers to tell them about the increases. Rival Virgin Media said earlier this month that prices will rise for broadband customers from the beginning of March. Price comparison website Uswitch said this would add Â£56 per year to bills for millions of customers. Vulnerable customers, including those on benefits, will not see prices rises, a Virgin Media spokesman said. Virgin will hike its prices for mobile customers from the beginning of April by 3.9% plus inflation as measured by the retail price index inflation rate for February. The price hikes from broadband providers will pile more pressure on household finances, with the cost of other utilities also set to increase. Energy customers are facing the prospect of a50% increasein their gas bills from April. Surging food prices push inflation to 30-year high Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Peloton has pushed back at a report that it plans to temporarily stop production of its exercise machines. The company's shares plunged by more than 20% after the CNBC report, which cited internal documents. In a blog, the firm's chief executive said the information was ""incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton's strategy"". Peloton saw sales soar during the pandemic as people were forced to stay at home due to lockdowns. The firm, which pairs its equipment with streaming and live exercise classes, had struggled to keep up with orders at the start of the pandemic, as gyms shut their doors. More recently, however, appetite has dwindled for its bikes and treadmills, which start at nearly $1,500 (Â£1,100). ""We worked quickly and diligently to meet the demand head-on at a time when the world really needed us,""Peloton's co-founder John Foley said on the company's website.,external ""We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth."" In a separate statement issued with the company's quarterly earnings Mr Foley said,external: ""As we discussed last quarter, we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook and optimize our costs across the company. ""This includes gross margin improvements, moving to a more variable cost structure, and identifying reductions in our operating expenses as we build a more focused Peloton moving forward."" The firm was hit last year after thedeath of a childin a treadmill accident led to a recall and government safety investigation. It also cut prices as people started to return to pre-pandemic exercise habits. In November, it told investors it had experienced ""softer than anticipated"" sales and was lowering its expectations for the year. CNBC reported that Peloton was halting production of its most expensive expensive bike from December until June and its most expensive treadmill for all of its 2022 financial year, which runs through June. It is also pausing production of its standard bike in February and March and its treadmill for six weeks. CNBC, which also reported that the firm is considering job cuts, said the presentation blamed increased competition and price sensitivity for a ""significant reduction"" in demand. The news sent the price of Peloton shares below $29, which is below what they fetched when the loss-making firm floated on the stock market in 2019. The value of the shares are down roughly 80% over the last 12 months. At the time, analysts said it was not clear how big the market for Peloton machines was given their cost. The firm also makes money from people who subscribe for classes via its app. Peloton probed over the safety of its treadmills Peloton set to build first US factory And Just Like That Peloton resurrects character Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Alison was diagnosed with breast cancer seven months after her daughter Mia was diagnosed with leukaemia A mother diagnosed with terminal cancer said she does not regret focusing on her child, who also has the disease, rather than getting checked out earlier. Mia, six, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2020 after it was spotted at an eye test. Just seven months later her mother, Alison, was told she had stage four breast cancer. The mum-of-two said she is putting her own treatment on hold to focus on Mia. Mia was four when a routine eye test showed she had chronic myeloid leukaemia. Parents coping with son's cancer treatment during Covid Cancer: Newport couple raise almost Â£1m in 40 years ""If it wasn't for myself taking her to our local opticians, then we would have been none the wiser of how ill Mia was, as she didn't show any signs or symptoms,"" Alison said. ""Mia was fit and well with no symptoms of vision problems whatsoever, so I thought it was strange she had failed the test, half her class had failed the eye test and I thought I would take her just in case and I am really pleased I did. ""We took her for further investigations - but I couldn't have anticipated what would come next."" Mia was referred to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, for further tests and was diagnosed. Mia has endured two years of chemotherapy She has been receiving chemotherapy daily for the past two years, but the family has been told it is no longer working. Mia has been given a trial of new chemotherapy, and providing the trial works, will have a bone marrow transplant in a few months. Mia, pictured with her sister, was diagnosed with leukaemia a week before her fifth birthday Shortly after Mia's diagnosis, the family was given the news that her mother had been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. Alison said she felt something in her breast but thought it was a cyst and focused on Mia and getting her through her treatment. ""It was hard when I got the diagnosis, as I hadn't got over the shock of Mia. ""But I just had to put myself aside, and honestly, I don't care about myself, I just have to be there for Mia and get her through it. ""And I don't regret that, if we were to go through it again I would do the exact same thing,"" she said. She had an intense course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and has also undergone surgery to remove the 17cm tumour in her breast. She is awaiting more surgery, but has put her treatment on hold to be able to support her daughter. Alison is proud of how strong and resilient Mia is Alison said going through cancer at the same time as her daughter means she can make it less scary for Mia. ""As we both have cancer, I understand exactly what she is going through. ""I'm glad I've got it in a way so she can be less afraid as mammy has it too and we can both fight it together. ""The next round of chemotherapy that Mia is going to have, is the one that I was on which is really intense and she has seen what happened with me when I was on it. ""I lost my hair, that was the most frightening part, well for me, but it is now coming back and Mia can see that now - she can see mammy's hair growing back so she knows hers will fall out but will grow back, although she is excited about getting a rainbow wig after seeing all mine,"" Alison added. ""I am just so proud of her - how resilient and strong she is. ""She is constantly doing TikToks, laughing, dancing and joking, just taking it all in her stride - she doesn't whinge and she is just awesome. "" The family have been trying to raise as much awareness as they can about the importance of eye tests and are also looking for any help with fundraising and donations to help to support them through Mia's treatment.

"Boris Johnson was asked about the claims on a visit to Somerset Boris Johnson says he has ""seen no evidence"" of blackmail in his party after claims by one of his own MPs. William Wragg - who has called on the PM to resign over parties at No 10 - said suspected plotters against the PM have been threatened with bad publicity and cuts to constituency funding. He has advised colleagues who feel threatened to go to the police. An ex-Tory MP who defected to Labour, Christian Wakeford, also saidhe was threatened over funding for a school. Mr Johnson told reporters on Thursday he had ""seen no evidence [and] heard no evidence"" of Mr Wragg's claims, but he would look into them. On Friday,the Times reported,externalrebels have met to discuss the tactics of government whips, the MPs in charge of party discipline. The newspaper reported the plotters discussed whether to make public text messages and other evidence of how they have been treated. Looks like checkmate for PM, says senior Tory MP What are whips and are MPs scared of them? Pie, pizza and curry - history's tasty political plots What is Sue Gray investigating? Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner called Mr Wragg's claims ""shocking"" and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of ""acting more like a mafia boss than a prime minister"". Scotland's First Minister, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, said: ""If Tories are threatening to withhold public investment from constituencies as a way of keeping MPs in line then, yes, that's blackmail and intimidation - but it is also corruption. ""The moral decay at the heart of Johnson's government may be even worse than we thought."" But Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries accused Mr Wragg of ""attention-seeking behaviour"", calling his accusations ""nonsense"". And Energy Minister Greg Hands, who used to work as a government whip, said Mr Wakeford was not a ""credible source"" because his defection meant his job was now to ""do down the Conservative Party"". He added that Mr Wragg's claims had ""not been borne out by anybody else"", adding: ""This is not something that happens."" This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries calls the blackmail accusations ""nonsense"" Mr Johnson is facing down an attempt from some Tory MPs to oust him as leader over lockdown parties held in Downing Street. He has called on potential rebels to wait for the outcome of civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into parties, expected next week, before passing judgement on him. But prominent Tory backbencher, Steve Baker,told the BBC's Political Thinking podcastthat it ""looks like checkmate"" for the prime minister. ""Honestly, at the moment, I'm looking to the cabinet for leadership,"" he told host Nick Robinson. ""At the moment, I'm afraid it does look like checkmate - but whether he can save himself, we'll see."" This video can not be played MPs should report intimidation tactics to the police, says William Wragg Mr Wragg launched a stinging attack on the way the government has handled dissent among Tory MPs on Thursday, in another sign of worsening relations between Mr Johnson and his backbenchers. Speaking at a Commons committee that he chairs, the MP for Hazel Grove accused government whips of threatening those suspected of plotting with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. He also said he had received reports of government ministers, advisers and staff at No 10 ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass"" those suspected of lacking confidence in the PM. Downing Street not in control after day of chaos Why UK prime minister is under pressure to quit Mr Wragg claimed the reports ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" - and as well as contacting police, affected MPs should contact the Commons Speaker. After the appearance, Mr Wakeford - who defected to the Labour Party on Thursday - said he had been threatened into supporting the government when sitting as a Tory MP. ""I was threatened that I would not get the school for Radcliffe if I didn't vote one particular way,"" he told BBC North West Tonight. ""This is a town that's not had a high school for the best part of 10 years and how would you feel with holding back the regeneration of a town for a vote?"" He said the incident ""didn't sit comfortably"" and it led to him ""starting to question my place where I was and ultimately to where I am now"". Black books and dark arts, quiet words and not so quiet words. The art of persuasion is as old as the stones in Parliament's walls. But William Wragg's intervention stands out because it alleges blackmail, potential criminal wrongdoing and breaches of the ministerial code. One or two are whispering privately here that Mr Wragg is overcooking his argument and has long been outspoken about the prime minister. And a few are saying similar stuff publicly. It's a reminder that while the imminent pressure on Boris Johnson has eased for now, the anger and vitriol provoked by these rows is still very real, very live. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said ""serious allegations"" had been made, and MPs with concerns should write to him. He said government ministers and those who work for them ""are not above the criminal law,"" after Mr Wragg said MPs concerned about potential blackmail should contact the Metropolitan Police. But the Speaker added: ""The investigation of allegedly criminal conduct is a matter for the police and decisions about prosecution are for the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service]."" This video can not be played Christian Wakeford says he was threatened to vote in a certain way One rebel MP told the BBC that some dissenters had been threatened with funding cuts, whilst animpending shake-up of parliamentary boundariesdue next year had also been used to put down rebellion. ""It's been done to the weakest to make an example,"" they added. However, Tory MP Anthony Mangnall, said he had never been threatened, despite rebelling against the government on ""quite a lot of matters"". Ms Dorries also called Mr Wragg's accusations ""disappointing"" and told BBC West Midlands: ""That is nonsense because that is not how government works, and we are the party of government. ""The whips have no say over what happens in individual constituencies. ""And not only is it nonsense, it is just attention seeking behaviour from William Wragg, who has been a constant critic of the prime minister.""

Tory grandee and former ally of Mr Johnson David Davistold the PM: ""In the name of God, go."" So far six Conservative MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests. There are claims that the threshold of 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote and leadership election could soon be reached, but no official word has been given. However, some Conservatives have told the BBC the mood has changed, following the defection of Mr Wakeford. Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns - a close ally of Mr Johnson - claimed Tory MPs were ""stepping back"" from calling for the PM to go now, and were waiting for Ms Gray's report.

"Pamela Armillei said it was important to know what to expect when battling a serious illness A woman who recently returned to her home on the Isle of Man after a seven-month battle with cancer has said she wants ""to share some hope"" with others. After being diagnosed with leukaemia in April, Pamela Armillei was admitted to Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. The 40-year-old from Onchan returned to the island last week after the disease went into full remission. She now wants to share her experiences to help other patients ""find ways of dealing with it"". At one point during her fight against the disease at the Liverpool hospital, Ms Armillei had to be admitted to the intensive care unit for four weeks after suffering a cardiac arrest. She said: ""When I came round everyone was just so happy... I do not remember any of the really bad stuff. ""My worst part of it all was the 10 days initial chemo, which was horrendous."" Unable to have visitors due to Covid-19 restrictions, she set up an online blog to share her experiences with other cancer patients, enabling those in the group to offer support to one another. The 40-year-old shared her experiences with other patients over social media On her return to the island by ferry she was given a surprise visit by her sister, before being driven home in an Aston Martin, which had been sent to pick her up from the Sea Terminal by a local car dealer. During the journey through Douglas, colleagues from the bank where she works lined the street outside the branch to cheer her return. Ms Armillei said it was important to ""acknowledge the journey people with cancer have, from diagnosis through the treatment, and to know what expect when you are in hospital with a serious illness"". ""I have been really fortunate. It is lovely that I got to come home, and that I am okay,"" she added. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external?

"Fans will be able to return to watch when Wales kicks-off its Six Nations in February More restrictions to people's daily lives have been eased in Wales as Omicron cases continue to decline. Pubs and restaurants in Wales can now operate outdoors without the rule of six or social distancing. All limits on sports events have been scrapped meaning thousands of fans are set to return to watch fixtures across the country. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We have passed the peak and the situation has improved significantly."" It is the second part of a three-week roadmap to scrap restrictions imposed because of the Omicron variant. As it happened: Drakeford slams PM as rules ease UK ministers 'distracting people from awful mess' What are the Covid rules in Wales? From a peak of more than 2,300 cases per 100,000 people in Wales, the rate has dipped below 500 on Friday. The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics also estimates a fall in the number of people in Wales with Covid - affecting one in 25 of the population. The number of people in hospital and in intensive care with Covid are also both declining. The first minister said: ""Omicron was another unpleasant twist to this long-running pandemic."" Mr Drakeford said decisions to lift rules in England are being to made to deflect from the ""dire difficulties the Prime Minister has created for himself"" ""We have weathered this storm together in Wales by following the rules and these measures that have kept us safe for nearly two years,"" added Mr Drakeford. ""Sadly the pandemic is not over and coronavirus is still with us but we can look forward to the future with renewed hope and with better and brighter days ahead of us."" He previously laid out a roadmap for which restrictions will be eased and when. From 15 January, numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500 From 21 January, all limits for outdoor activities have been scrapped with crowds able to return to sporting events. On 28 January, Wales will move to alert level zero. This means nightclubs can reopen and the rule of six will be scrapped in pubs and restaurants, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres From 10 February, a three-week review cycle returns as the country is at alert level zero But the Welsh Conservatives said Mr Drakeford should set a date for all Covid-related laws - including mask wearing and self-isolation rules - to be lifted. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh government needed to set out what else it will do to help the hospitality sector. Anyone over 18 will still have to show aCovid passto go to larger outdoor event, so they can show they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the past 24 hours. The passes, which are being scrapped in England, will also still be required in cinemas and theatres until at least the next review on 10 February. The rule of six will be lifted for pubs and restaurants outdoors from Friday Before Mr Drakeford set outhis plans to phase out the post-Christmas rules, he had faced growing pressure to ease sporting restrictions, including from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), whichthreatened to move Wales' Six Nations home games to England. He toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""I don't think anybody watching objectively what is happening in England could imagine that their decisions have been made by a careful attention to public health advice and some long-term plan. ""Their announcements are entirely down to the astonishing mess they find themselves in and an effort to create headlines that will distract the public's attention from the prime minister's failings. ""Covid passes encourage people to get out and about, using venues where they know everyone else has taken precautions."" Christmas Covid rules 'cost pubs Â£16,000 each' How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? The changes mean sports fans can return to Welsh stadiums from Saturday, with Swansea City's home game against Preston North End among the first to welcome back supporters. Season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""It's been strange when you could do a 500 mile roundtrip to go watch us away but you couldn't go 10 minutes down the road to watch at us at home."" While Lorraine Dyer said her ""football mad"" grandsons were excited to return to the Swansea.com stadium. Swansea City season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""Football's not the same without fans in the stadium"" Calum Darling, of Club One47 in Llandudno, has said his nightclub has lost up to 95% of its trade since restrictions had come into force. ""We've always got the most restrictions imposed on us as opposed to England, Scotland, Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""It just doesn't make sense that we're always five steps behind. There's just no logic to the reasoning behind it."" Alert level zero is the lowest level of measures, where all businesses are allowed to reopen without two-metre social distancing rules in place. If all goes to plan, the rule of six will not apply in pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres from 28 January. However, face masks will still be required in most indoor public places,unlike England where they will not be compulsory from Thursday. Self-isolation rules also remain in force, and work from home guidance will remain advice but will not be law. Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Ireland, brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The decision to continue easing the rules comes as Wales sees the ""fastest rate of decline"" in case numbers and the lowest rate in the UK, according to Mr Drakeford. It is down 61% in a week to 490.8 cases per 100,000, the lowest since 9 December. The ONS infection survey estimates numbers infected in Wales have fallen 34% over the week, with 3.69% of the population having Covid in the week ending 15 January. The number of patients with Covid in hospital is at an average of 722, an 16% fall on last week, while numbers in critical care are the lowest since 11 August. However, Mr Drakeford added: ""We are not out of the woods yet. There are still more than 1,000 people in hospital with Covid and that is putting additional pressure on the NHS."" But the former head of Public Health Wales' communicable disease surveillance centre said the restrictions had been unnecessary and ""should have been lifted three weeks ago"". Dr Roland Salmon said: ""I've been a long time sceptic of these long-term measures such as lockdown. ""They've contributed very little while, in contrast, the vaccination programme has contributed a great deal."" Chester are an English club, insists chairman after Covid 'rule break' Wales Covid rules relaxed as cases drop rapidly Wales could be turning corner on Covid says minister The UK government said it intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate in England - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggesting he would not renew them - and that the date could be brought forward if the data allows.

"This video can not be played His owner could hear him crying and barking when he was stuck down the crevice. A pup who was trapped down a 10ft (3m) crevice for 34 hours has been rescued. Reggie the sprocker spaniel was enjoying his regular walk in Clydach forestry, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on Tuesday when he fell in. The 11 month old was stuck until rescuers finally freed him at 01:00 GMT on Thursday. Following Reggie's ordeal, family member Leah Davies said: ""He's the kindest, loving little boy ever, he's my best friend, he's amazing."" Reggie was absolutely exhausted after being trapped for about 34 hours The drama unfolded on Tuesday when Reggie started sniffing by the gap in the path. ""The next minute his bum was up in the air and he was down the hole,"" Leah said. ""He fell off the lip, fell down and we couldn't see him. Everyone from locals to emergency rescue teams were trying to rescue the puppy ""I was absolutely petrified and felt so helpless because I couldn't do anything for him. ""He was whimpering, crying and very vocal."" Dog charity braced for Â£30,000 monthly vet bill More than 200 dogs rescued from unlicensed breeder Coastguard rescues dog trapped by rising tide No one could fit down the ""narrow gap"", Leah says A fire and rescue crew arrived about 30 minutes after Leah called at 15:00, but she said ""there was nothing they could really do because of the complexity of the hole"". After failed attempts to rescue Reggie by manoeuvring down the hole to chip away at the ground, the decision was made to leave him overnight, with food being thrown down the gap. ""I was absolutely traumatised, I couldn't sleep that night I went home. Hearing him panting was awful, it was terrible,"" Leah said. Reggie was rescued at about 01:00 on Thursday Leah says the whole experience ""has been an absolute wow"" In a desperate plea for help, Leah took tosocial media,externalwhich resulted in ""the whole Rhondda community"" bringing food and supplies to keep Reggie going. Local business Drainforce brought camera equipment, which meant they were able to see Reggie for the first time since his fall. With extra help from other volunteers, including one who brought ropes, they were able to reach Reggie and lift him to safety. ""Everyone was shouting 'he's out, he's out!'"" Leah said. ""If it wasn't for the Drainforce guys we wouldn't have got him out. ""In the car on the way down (the mountain), his eyes were huge, his heart beat was really fast. I was feeding him water out of my hand."" Leah said Reggie was ""absolutely exhausted"" but quickly recovered. ""He was so excited to see us, rubbing against him. He was so happy,"" she said. Reggie and his owner Dayne on their way to the vet Reggie is recovering after his 34-hour ordeal Leah said the scare made her think twice about venturing up the mountain again. ""Imagine you took your child up walking and that was your child,"" she said. ""The more people know about these crevices, the better.""

"This video can not be played Waiting times: 'I always thought the NHS was there for us' When John Evans needed treatment for a rapidly spreading skin infection on his face, he was told to go to A&E. ""It's happened to me before, so I knew I had to get some serious treatments and IV antibiotics,"" said the 59-year-old from Cardiff. But he said he spent four nights on a chair at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales waiting for a bed. Cardiff and Vale health board said it was in touch with Mr Evans and ""sincerely"" apologised. The Welsh government said health boards were already working together to share infrastructure and were expected to develop regional approaches for high volume and specialist services. Woman goes to Lithuania for op over waiting lists NHS waiting times hit record high again Fix NHS staff crisis to tackle backlog, warn MPs ""I was really shocked by the conditions that the patients and staff were in,"" said Mr Evans. ""There was only one toilet to use and no hot food. ""The staff did a fantastic job and they worked really hard and they're so caring, but they were under real pressure as well. ""There was a sense of helplessness from the staff to the point where they had to just manage their way through a horrific situation, caring for people in this way. ""I'd always believed that the health service was there if I needed it. ""In this instance it was there, but only just and that was because of the staff and their professionalism."" A health board spokesman said: ""Our services are under extreme pressure due to a number of factors including current staff shortages and the sustained challenges coronavirus presents. ""In addition, health and social care services across Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan are experiencing significant and sustained pressures which is impacting the timely discharge of patients from hospital. ""These and other challenges are impacting on patient flow within our sites and, in turn, waiting times in our emergency unit. ""In this instance we sincerely apologise for the delays and experience for Mr Evans, and our concerns team are in touch with him to respond directly to the concerns raised."" University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is the main A&E for the health board The disrupted flow of patients through the hospital system has been well documented during the pandemic. Staff shortages in social caremean there are currently about 1,000 patients who are medically fit in Welsh hospitals, but care cannot be secured in the community, meaning their beds cannot be given to others. The impact has trickled through the system, leaving patients such as John with long waits for a bed, as well as more than 8,800 patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E in November alone. The most recent A&E waiting times show 66.5% of patients were seen within four hours, against a target of 95%, in December, the second worse figure on record. Opposition parties said long term solutions were required and Sue Hill, from the Royal College of Surgeons, agreed. ""Already in Wales we had bigger, longer waiting lists per head of population than similar places in England,"" said Ms Hill. ""Every winter I've had to cancel my elective patients because beds on my surgical ward are full of medical patients with chest infections, not Covid, but flu, pneumonia and those things."" In November 2021, there were 682,279 patient pathways waiting to start treatment, as numbers on waiting lists hit record highs for the 19th month in a row. ""One of the things the Royal College of Surgeons has asked the Welsh government to consider is mandating cross-regional cooperation,"" said Ms Hill. She explained that where health boards have been able to establish surgical hubs, many procedures have been able to continue, but not all areas in Wales have the capacity to do that. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Health boards are already working closely together to share infrastructure in an effort to meet demand and ensure that those patients most in need of care are treated. ""Over time this will help address the backlog of patients waiting for treatment. This includes Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay working closely together on a number of areas, including cataracts, and Cwm Taf Morgannwg being a regional hub for diagnostics. ""Cancer and cardiac treatment is already managed across health board boundaries, with Swansea, for example, leading on pancreatic and lung cancer treatment. ""We expect health boards to develop regional approaches for their high volume and specialist services whilst developing sustainable services. ""Last year we announced a Â£170m recurrent investment in planned care and expect health boards to develop plans about how they can transform how their services are delivered and make best use of the funding available.""

"Big banks, advertising firms and insurers have announced plans to return to the office after the government scrapped its work-from-home guidance for England with immediate effect. However, most said flexible working arrangements would remain in place. Some have questioned whether the move is premature and could worsen already-high staff absences. But others said city centres hit hard by Omicron would get a much needed boost as commuters returned. Banking group HSBC said its staff started returning to the office on Thursday, while Standard Chartered has asked employees to come in from Monday - although both lenders have flexible working arrangements in place. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs also plan to resume office working. Meanwhile Havas, a French advertising agency with 11,500 staff worldwide, told the BBC it would ""fully reopen"" its London office from Monday after more than a month of employees working from home. Latest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020,external, up from 27% the previous year. The government introduced its Plan B restrictions in December to battle the Omicron variant, but on Wednesday eased them saying infections had peaked nationally. Along with the end of working-from guidance, the requirement in England for mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports will both be ditched from next Thursday. Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England Working-from-home guidance shift 'may not help me' What are the new working from home rules? Chris Hirst, global head of creative at Havas, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Many of our employees really do want to come back into the office, but there are some people who are nervous and we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach to that. ""We'll be talking to those people individually and finding solutions that work for them."" Insurance firm Zurich, which employs 4,500 in the UK, said it was ""excited"" to welcome staff back to its offices but most would continue on a hybrid basis. ""We had a flexible working policy prior to the pandemic, but [Covid] meant suddenly everybody was experiencing the benefits and some of the downfalls and we've learnt a lot,"" chief operating officer John Keppel told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme. Alex, 28, says he can't wait for people at his law firm to go back to the office in the next month. He joined the company in November, when it was working on a hybrid basis, but virtually all staff have been working from home since mid December. ""I'm a new joiner and just getting started,"" he told the BBC. ""But it's been really difficult to learn about the company culture, make new connections and make an impression."" However, he does appreciate the flexibility of being able to work from home, and supports his firm's goal of moving to a 60:40 split between office and home working. ""Working from home can be more productive. Although now people have got used to doing it full time, I think some will be loath to give it up."" Network Rail said the number of people using its stations between 6:00 and 10.30 GMT on Thursday was up 10% compared with the same period last week. But the statistics show daily passenger numbers had been increasing even before the guidance to work from home in England was lifted yesterday afternoon. Thursday's figure was just 1% higher compared with Wednesday. Business groups have broadly welcomed the easing of Plan B restrictions in England, with the CBI calling for ""greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term"". Lord Stuart Rose, chairman of Asda and former boss of Marks and Spencer and Argos, hailed the decision to scrap the guidance. ""I cannot believe we have a nation sitting at home now cowered by this government, because they are fearful of this virus,"" he said. ""It is something we have to now live with."" According to the Times newspaper,,externalthe government has asked civil servants to go back to their desks as an example to other employers. But some have questioned the safety of the move at time when the NHS remains under pressure. The British Chambers of Commerce also urged the government to improve access to rapid testing so firms could bring staff back to workplaces with confidence. ""With infection rates still high, many firms are experiencing significant staff absences and will be cautious about teams rushing back to the office when that could result in further absences,"" BCC director general Shevaun Haviland said. ""Maintenance of testing capacity must also be a priority for government, with reports still reaching us of firms unable to access rapid testing at times when they need it."" Unions also said employers had to ensure a safe return to work, and provide flexible working when staff wanted it. The TUC called for a better sick pay offer from government amid concerns that many workers will be infected and have to take time off on statutory sick pay. Others, however, said the change in guidance was overdue for city centre retailers, which rely on commuter trade that has dried up over the last few months. Most workers do not expect full office return On Thursday, the City Pub Group, which has 46 sites, said it expected ""consumer confidence and consequently demand"" to grow once office workers return to work. And the Gym Group said demand was returning after a slow December, and would ""show further improvement"" due to the end of work from home guidance. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director said: ""Blanket work-from-home guidance has had significant downsides for city centre trade in sectors such as hospitality and retail."" According to BBC research in September, most peopledo not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would ""never return to offices at the same rate"".

"Covid certification checks in Northern Ireland began last month Stormont ministers have agreed to drop the use of vaccine passports in pubs, restaurants and cinemas in Northern Ireland from midday on Wednesday. The move is part of several relaxations to Northern Ireland's Covid rules. It means proof of Covid status will no longer be legally required in hospitality premises from 26 January. The system will remain in place for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance. Ministers have also agreed to remove rules on table service in hospitality businesses and the so-called ""rule of six"" per table from midday on Friday. It is understood that hospitality businesses will still be advised in guidance to retain use of Covid certification. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill announced the changes to the rules while on a visit to Londonderry Under the latest changes, the guidance limit of three households allowed to meet indoors in a home is also to be removed from Friday. Under the plan, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen from Wednesday with dancing and indoor standing events permitted again. The Stormont executive was advised by the Department of Health that the minimum self-isolation period for people testing positive for Covid-19 will be reduced to five full days, subject to negative lateral flow tests on days five and six of their isolation. Also from next Wednesday, the need for offices to ""take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing"" will be removed although risk assessments should be carried out. First Minister Paul Givan described the changes as a ""step in the right direction"" and said they reflected the changing circumstances in Northern Ireland. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""clear we were past the peak"" in terms of coronavirus case numbers and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. Proof of Covid certification has been legally required in certain settings in Northern Ireland since 13 December, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) the only party in the executive opposed to its use. Some representatives ofthe hospitality sector had criticised the move when it was imposed, saying it would affect their trade. Speaking on Thursday, Ken Sharpe, owner of Salty Dog hotel and restaurant in Bangor, County Down, said his turnover in December was down by 25% compared with two years ago. ""It was the introduction of Covid certification and other restrictions that really caused us to crash,"" he said. The decision by ministers to remove the requirement for Covid passports was welcomed by several trade bodies. Is the pandemic entering its endgame? What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? Self-isolation period set to be reduced Angela McGowan, the Northern Ireland director of the Confederation of British Industry, said companies would be hopeful that ""we are finally starting to turn the corner on Covid-19"". ""Removing indoor hospitality restrictions will come as a big relief to those companies desperate to start trading their way to recovery after a difficult festive period. ""The decision to limit the vaccine passport scheme to nightclubs will also be welcomed by Northern Ireland's significant food, drink and tourism sectors as we head into spring. ""The focus must now be on how we can safely live with the virus, grow the economy and stimulate investment."" Covid certification will no longer be required for entry to a bar from Wednesday The Campaign For Real Ale's Northern Ireland chairwoman Ruth Sloan said the easing of Covid rules was ""good news for our pubs, publicans and pub-goers"". ""The end of table-service only requirementsÂ will be particularly welcome, helping pubs toÂ operate at a decent capacity andÂ be able toÂ get enough money through the tillsÂ after months of devastating restrictions. ""However, ministers here and in Westminster will need to continue to support our local pubs, breweries and cider producersÂ to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels of trade."" At their meeting to agree the changes on Thursday, ministers were advised by health officials that there may be a ""secondary peak"" in cases in the next two weeks as a result of further spread in school age children. However the advice also states that it is likely that existing measures will be ""sufficient"" to manage hospital admissions and deaths are not expected to rise significantly, due to Omicron being less severe than previous variants. Mr Givan also said the next executive meeting on 10 February would be an ""important one"" when other measures would be discussed. He said he wanted to see movement on the wearing of masks. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon told BBC News NI's The View that she was content to agree with the recommendations. ""This is all as a result of the mammoth effort that the people of Northern Ireland have put in and the huge sacrifices that they have made to keep themselves safe, to keep their families safe and to keep everyone else safe,"" she said. But she was critical of a leak of an executive paper outlining what ministers would discuss in meeting, which she said had led to ""uncertainty [and] media speculation"". ""That was bad government on a good day and I think people deserve better than that,"" said the SDLP minister. There's no doubt that we are closer to the end of this pandemic than the beginning. While it was science, and chiefly the vaccination programme, that got us to this point, so did a huge amount of sacrifice and effort. That's why some experts are urging caution and stressing that it's not over yet. While easing of restrictions is welcomed, infection levels are still causing much concern. Infections have fallen but are still well above what they were at the height of the peak last winter - the big difference is that Omicron is affecting people much less severely. The executive has been warned that in the next fortnight, there could be a secondary peak in cases as a result of further spread among children. While not severely affected, children who test positive are off school, requiring parents to stay off work to be with them - an indirect impact causing huge staff absences across the public sector. As in other jurisdictions, politics is influencing what decisions are being taken - a delicate and difficult balance. Spring, however, is looking brighter. Scotland, England and Wales have already announced some easing of restrictions. A number of Covid measures in England are to end from 27 January, with the advice for people to work from home being dropped, along with Covid passports and the requirement to wear a face covering in public places. In Scotlandrules on table service in hospitality venues will be lifted from Monday, when nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen, whilein Wales a three-week plan for scrapping restrictionshas been set out. The Republic of Ireland's government has suggestedchanges are likely to its restrictionstoo, including large crowds returning to outdoor events.

"Mask wearing is now guidance rather than law The health minister has revoked Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions, so rules that were formerly legally binding, such as wearing face coverings in enclosed public spaces, are now merely guidance. This means that while people are encouraged to follow restrictions, they will not face any punishment for not doing so. However, individual businesses are still able to ask customers to follow certain rules. Issues that were previously covered by guidance - such as the advice to work from home where possible - have not changed either, because the changes only affect legal restrictions. People are still being strongly encouraged to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces, such as shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and on public transport. In post-primary schools it was always guidance - rather than a legal requirement - for pupils to wear face coverings. This has not changed. Hospitality and entertainment venues will still be strongly encouraged to use so-called Covid passports, and the certificates will still be available for anyone who needs them to travel abroad. Social distancing is also still encouraged as well as meeting outdoors or in well-ventilated places were possible. The requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing had already been removed, but soon risk assessments will no longer be required. People are still advised to work from home where possible but Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear he wants the guidance to be urgently reviewed. He said he would work with ministerial colleagues on the issue. There have not been any changes to the rules on self-isolation. The Department of Health clarified on Tuesday evening that - contrary to England - the self-isolation rules in Northern Ireland were never enshrined in legislation. Instead, they were classified as ""very strong guidance"". Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should self-isolate for 10 days from the date their symptoms start or the date they took a test, whichever is sooner. They can leave isolation from day six if they have two consecutive lateral flow tests taken 24 hours apart, with the first taken no earlier than day five, and provided they do not have a high temperature. The testing and contact-tracing system will also remain in place. People are no longer required to social distance outdoors in Northern Ireland Travel rules remain in place, although there are currently no countries on the red list for international travel. If you are fully vaccinated and travelling to Northern Ireland from a country outside the Common Travel Area, you do not have to take a pre or post-departure test or self-isolate on arrival. However you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. You must also book and pay for a pre-departure PCR or LFD test to be taken in the two days before you travel to Northern Ireland and book and pay for a PCR test to be taken on or before day two following arrival. Foreign countries all have their own rules which you must follow if you are travelling to them. Dentistry has been severely disrupted by the pandemic and a large backlog of patients seeking routine appointments has built up since the first lockdown in March 2020. Dentistry was not specifically mentioned with the lifting of Covid restrictions, so dentists are still working underoperational guidelines issued by the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) which were last updated in December 2021,external. Currently, patients are asked about their Covid status before they attend appointments and those who have no symptoms of Covid or other respiratory infection can be treated under standard infection control measures that were in place before the pandemic began. But patients who test positive or who report Covid symptoms can only receive dental treatment if it is considered urgent and they should be segregated from other visitors to the surgery. A spokeswoman from the British Dental Association told BBC News NI that all enhanced measures to keep patients and staff safe have radically reduced capacity across the service and the current backlog means that routine appointments ""are still a long way off"". Translink said it will now encourage passengers to continue to wear face coverings in its vehicles and buildings A Translink spokesperson said the public service transport firm would ""continue to follow public health guidance"" regarding face coverings. ""To help keep everyone safe and in line with the latest guidance, we are encouraging our passengers to wear a face covering, if they can, in stations and on-board buses and trains,"" they added. There has been a mixed response on mask wearing guidelines from supermarkets and entertainment venues. Asda said wearing a face covering would now be ""a personal choice"". Sainsburys is continuing to ask people to wear them in its stores in Great Britain, but in Northern Ireland, the supermarket giant said it was reviewing what Stormont's health minister has said and will keep customers informed. Belfast's Grand Opera House has confirmed that it will continue to encourage people to wear face coverings, unless they are exempt or are eating and drinking. However, the Movie House Cinema chain said people could now make their own decisions on wearing face coverings.  It will also be removing guidance signs from its cinemas.

"This video can not be played Child abuse survivors are still waiting on a state apology, five years after HIA inquiry Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers will make an official apology to survivors of child abuse in institutions on 11 March, it has been confirmed. The apology was recommended in the final report of the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry (HIAI). It was published five years ago. Paul Givan and Michell O'Neill will make the apology in parliament buildings on behalf of the executive. Officials will meet with survivors' groups over the coming weeks to discuss the event. The inquiry examined the period 1922-1995, and found there had been widespread and systemic abuse at institutions. The chair, the late Sir Anthony Hart, recommended compensation, an apology and a memorial. Campaigner Margaret McGuckin said many of those who wanted an apology have now died Margaret McGuckin, from the group Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abuse (SAVIA), said the announcement was ""welcome"" but had been a ""very long time coming"". ""I think it's happened because of the pressure we had to apply again,"" she said. ""It's unfortunate so many people who wanted an apology have gone to their graves blaming themselves and will never hear the words: 'It wasn't your fault, it was our fault.'"" 'Ten years' to process abuse redress applications Abuse survivors identified in 'massive' email error Kate Walmsley, who was sexually abused between the ages of eight and 12 at an institution in Londonderry, said: ""All I've wanted was for somebody to say sorry."" She explained how her experience had affected the rest of her life. Kate Walmsley was sexually abused between the ages of eight and 12 at an institution in Londonderry ""I just never felt I belonged anywhere. I still am lonely and feel I'm not accepted, and totally ignored."" Kate said she felt ""more traumatised"" by having to push for Sir Anthony Hart's recommendations to be implemented. Days after the Hart Report was published, the powersharing executive at Stormont collapsed - leaving Northern Ireland without a government for three years. Campaigners asked the then Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith to pass legislation at Westminster to set up the compensation scheme recommended by Sir Anthony Hart. The late Sir Anthony Hart recommended a compensation scheme Mr Smith did so in November 2019. The Stormont Executive was restored two months later. A review is currently being carried out into the financial redress scheme. It's understood Stormont officials have heard several different views from survivors about the value and timing of an apology. Confirming the date for an official apology, First Minister Paul Givan said: ""Victims and survivors of historical institutional abuse have our full support, and we are determined they will receive the acknowledgement, support, and redress they deserve. ""Our priority remains approaching an apology with care and sensitivity, and basing it upon the experience of victims and survivors."" Michelle O'Neill acknowledged there would be ""many different views"" on a public apology and said the date had been announced in advance so  that survivors and their families could give input. ""While no apology will make up for the shameful failures, and the pain that victims and survivors have endured as a result, we owe it to them to acknowledge the harm they suffered."" She added: ""The needs of victims and survivors are at the heart of this and we are working to ensure that we have the right support in place - before, during, and after the apology is made."" Survivors of the institutions in Northern Ireland travelled from Great Britain, Australia and other parts of the world to give evidence at the Hart Inquiry - which was the biggest investigation of its kind to be held in the UK at the time. Brian O'Donoghue now lives in Lancashire. When he talks about his childhood six decades ago - his pictures are sharp and his memories evidently vivid. He describes having meals in a cellar at Rubane House, in County Down, as feeling ""a bit like Oliver Twist to me"". Brian O'Donoghue recorded his experiences in a self-published memoir His initial impressions of the institution, which was run by the De La Salle Brothers, was that it was ""frightening"", he didn't have good clothes to wear and he wasn't fed very well. He was sexually abused and remembers how - at the age of nine - he ""didn't understand what was happening, but I knew it was wrong to be touched"". In his self-published memoir - written from the perspective of his boyhood self - Brian recorded one incident where two boys who tried to run away were punished. A partition between two classrooms was opened up, so everyone in the institution could be made to watch. He said they were made to strip to a pair of swimming trunks, and beaten in front of all the other boys ""until they jumped in the air and screamed"". ""There was sweat pouring off the Brother who did the beating - that was how much he put into it."" Brian was born in Limerick and was first put into an institution in the Republic of Ireland, after his mother ""went out for some milk of magnesia for the baby and didn't come back for two years"". After his time in Northern Ireland, he was also in a children's home in the north of England, which was ""totally different"". ""You weren't brutalised but any punishments were psychological - so you weren't spoken to, you were made an outcast,"" he said. Looking back on his life, he described himself as becoming ""fiercely independent"" because ""no-one's looked after me since I was a kid"". He has had depression for many years, and said his wife Marcia was ""the first person in my life who gave me stability"". He said he maintained a positive attitude to life - ""I get out there every day and make the best of it."" He is ""grateful"" to have received compensation through the Stormont scheme. On the prospect of a state apology in Northern Ireland, he said: ""Some people will say it should have come sooner - and it should have done.

"Peloton has pushed back at a report that it plans to temporarily stop production of its exercise machines. The company's shares plunged by more than 20% after the CNBC report, which cited internal documents. In a blog, the firm's chief executive said the information was ""incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton's strategy"". Peloton saw sales soar during the pandemic as people were forced to stay at home due to lockdowns. The firm, which pairs its equipment with streaming and live exercise classes, had struggled to keep up with orders at the start of the pandemic, as gyms shut their doors. More recently, however, appetite has dwindled for its bikes and treadmills, which start at nearly $1,500 (Â£1,100). ""We worked quickly and diligently to meet the demand head-on at a time when the world really needed us,""Peloton's co-founder John Foley said on the company's website.,external ""We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth."" In a separate statement issued with the company's quarterly earnings Mr Foley said,external: ""As we discussed last quarter, we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook and optimize our costs across the company. ""This includes gross margin improvements, moving to a more variable cost structure, and identifying reductions in our operating expenses as we build a more focused Peloton moving forward."" The firm was hit last year after thedeath of a childin a treadmill accident led to a recall and government safety investigation. It also cut prices as people started to return to pre-pandemic exercise habits. In November, it told investors it had experienced ""softer than anticipated"" sales and was lowering its expectations for the year. CNBC reported that Peloton was halting production of its most expensive expensive bike from December until June and its most expensive treadmill for all of its 2022 financial year, which runs through June. It is also pausing production of its standard bike in February and March and its treadmill for six weeks. CNBC, which also reported that the firm is considering job cuts, said the presentation blamed increased competition and price sensitivity for a ""significant reduction"" in demand. The news sent the price of Peloton shares below $29, which is below what they fetched when the loss-making firm floated on the stock market in 2019. The value of the shares are down roughly 80% over the last 12 months. At the time, analysts said it was not clear how big the market for Peloton machines was given their cost. The firm also makes money from people who subscribe for classes via its app. Peloton probed over the safety of its treadmills Peloton set to build first US factory And Just Like That Peloton resurrects character Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Carhartt, the work wear and outdoor gear maker, is facing calls for a boycott among conservatives opposed to its vaccine mandate for staff. The outcry comes amid fierce debate in the US over Covid-19 jabs. This month, the US Supreme Court said the government could not force large employers to make Covid-19 vaccination or weekly testing mandatory. Companies including the coffee chain Starbucks have since reversed their plans for such rules. But in a recent memo to staff, Carhartt leaders said the Supreme Court decision had not changed company requirements, which went into effect for much of their staff in early January. ""We put workplace safety at the very top of our priority listâ¯andâ¯the Supreme Court's recentâ¯ ruling doesn't impact that core value,"" wrote Carhartt's chief executive Mark Valade, a descendant of the company's founder. ""While we appreciate that there may be differing views, workplace safety is an area where we and the union that represents our associates cannot compromise. â¯An unvaccinated workforce is both a peopleâ¯andâ¯business risk that our company is unwilling to take.â¯""â¯ After copies of the message were circulated on social media, prominent conservatives and Republican figures weighed in. ""Well Carhartt has labelled the unvaccinated dangerous and implemented a vaccine mandate,"" conservative attorney Molly McCann wrote on Twitter. ""Pretty rich from a company sustained by the ranchers, farmers, labourers, etc. who make this country great and celebrate her values of freedom and liberty."" ""Boycott Carhartt until they break,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Founded in 1889, Carhartt employs more than 5,500 people globally. It is privately-owned and based in Michigan, a state in the middle of the US that is fiercely divided between Republicans and Democrats. Self-promoted as a brand for ""hard-working"" people, Carhartt made its name supplying labourers and farm workers. But it has also been embraced by fashionistas in Europe, where it has a longstanding ""Work in Progress"" design line. In recent years, which the firm has described as a ""growth period"", Carhartt caps and coats have turned up everywhere from playgrounds to the Golden Globes. A 2017 article in men's magazine Esquire described it as one of the rare brands able to transcend America's political divide - at least so far. ""Regardless of the boycott, when you think about core American fashion brands, people always mention Ralph Lauren and Levi, but Carhartt is also on that list,"" said Jeff Carvalho, co-founder of men's fashion site Highsnobiety. ""They're just quite important."" Mr Carvalho, a collector of vintage Carhartt gear, said conservatives represent an important consumer base for the brand, but he believes it will survive the current firestorm, noting that buyers have few alternatives. He asked: ""Who are they going to turn to otherwise?"" ""It is the uniform, or tuxedo of American industry."" Carhartt, which has factories in Kentucky and Tennessee as well as Mexico, said the ""vast majority"" of its staff are fully vaccinated or in the process of getting their jabs. It also granted ""a number"" of religious and medical exemption requests. Model Kaia Gerber steps out in a Carhartt jacket A spokeswoman for the company said: ""Carhartt fully understands and respects the varying opinions on this topic, and we are aware some of our associates do not support this policy. ""However, we stand behind our decision because we believe vaccines are necessary to protect our workforce."" Just over a third of US workers are now covered by vaccine mandates, according to a Gallup poll in December. While the Supreme Court struck down the national requirement, courts have been more open to states and companies setting their own policies. Investment bank Citigroup and United Airlines are among the firms that have moved forward with vaccine mandates. United Airlines's boss Scott Kirby recently told staff that the policy had saved lives. Other firms have wavered in the face of opposition. About 55% of US workers support vaccination requirements at work, a Gallup poll found in December. But more than a third were strongly opposed. Divide over the issue is linked to politics, with Republicans leading the opposition. Business groups say companies are worried about compliance costs and staff recruitment. About 63% of Americans are fully vaccinated but that number varies significantly depending on location.

"Tracey Emin is best known for her headline-grabbing 1990s works, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With and My Bed Tracey Emin has asked the government to remove her neon artwork from 10 Downing Street, saying it did not need ""any encouragement"" for a party atmosphere. More Passion, her 2011 gift to David Cameron's government was meant to evoke such an atmosphere, like ""funfairs, casinos, bars"", she told Woman's Hour. But given the row over drinks parties at Downing Street during lockdown, she has asked for it to be taken down. ""People are really genuinely upset about this,""she told the Radio 4 show. ""It's not about a political thing, it's a moral, ethical thing,"" she said. ""People had to watch their loved ones be buried on their telephone, or be cremated on their telephone,"" she added, noting how Her Majesty, The Queen had ""sat there stoically alone"" during Prince Philip's funeral. Why UK prime minister is under pressure to quit No 10 culture: Mixing work and socialising Emin was speaking after making her feelings clear about the piece on Instagram on Wednesday, writing that the ""current situation is shameful"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrecently apologised to Buckingham Palacefor two staff parties in No 10 on the night before the Royal funeral. In Januaryhe apologisedfor attending a ""bring your own booze"" party in Downing Street during the first Covid lockdown. Ahead of Prime Minister's Questions, he told MPs he had attended the gathering, held in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020, for 25 minutes. He is now facing down an attempt from some Tory MPsto oust him as leaderover lockdown parties held in Downing Street. The government is facing mounting pressure over several events that are alleged to have been held during lockdowns. How many No 10 lockdown parties do we know about? Senior civil servantSue Gray is expected to publish the findingsof her report into the potential breaking of Covid rules at Downing Street this week. The PM, Emin revealed to presenter Emma Barnett, once told her he likes the artwork in question - which now belongs to the Government Art Collection. His official spokesman told the BBC ""we will discuss its location with the artist, my understanding is it will remain part of the collection"". A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told BBC News: ""When an artwork comes into the Government Art Collection, the Collection can display the work at any of its 365 locations. ""On occasions the collection may consult with an artist when a work is going to a specific location."" While Emin is not asking for it back, she does want it to be removed from Number 10 at the moment. ""I don't actually want the neon back because I donated it to the government's art collection and what people have to understand is, if [Labour leader] Keir Starmer was to become prime minister next week, and he liked my neon, it's still hanging in there,"" she said. ""When the Government Art Collection has a work of yours, it's for any government, it's for time immemorial. They hang it in embassies, schools, hospitals all over the place. So I don't want the work back because I don't need it. ""I would simply like at the moment for it to be taken down. Because the neon is notoriously for a party atmosphere. You have them in funfairs, casinos, bars or whatever and I really do not feel that Number 10 needs any encouragement on this level."" ""This government, they need morecompassion,"" she continued, with reference to the work's title. ""That's what they need, not more passion, they don't need more party atmospheres. ""Most of us are obeying the rules in every single way because this pandemic has affected everybody so terribly - whether it's financially, whether it's health-wise, you know, whether it's people dying, and this government doesn't seem to care about that.""

"The Grenfell fire in June 2017 claimed the lives of 72 people Nearly five years after the Grenfell Tower fire, 40% of buildings in England with the same type of cladding have not been made safe, new figures show. The flammable cladding panels have been blamed for the rapid spread of the 2017 London fire, which led to 72 deaths. In all, 481 buildings have been identified with Grenfell-style ACM cladding and are unlikely to meet building regulations. As of December 2021, 289 of those buildings have had work fully finished. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block. The cost has often been passed on to flat owners under the leasehold system in England and Wales. Many leaseholders have also seen sharply increasing service charges, and some have had to pay for so-called ""waking watch"" fire wardens. The government had set aside billions of pounds to remove dangerous cladding. Blocks in England above 18 meters tall with cladding defects qualify for the Â£5.1bn Building Safety Fund. Cladding campaigners say it is taking too long to make homes safe, while leaseholders have told the BBC that accessing funding is a complex process. Remediation work has been slow to begin and not all blocks are eligible for help. Will flat owners be refunded for cladding costs? Expert seeks answer on pre-Grenfell cladding tests The information comes fromgovernment figures released on Thursday,externaland analysed by the BBC. The number of buildings where the work is done is lower for private sector blocks. Fewer than half, some 48%, have been finished and signed off as safe. Greater Manchester and London have the biggest clusters of buildings with Grenfell-style ACM cladding: 268 in London, 72 in Manchester and 141 in the rest of England. For other types of dangerous materials, known as non-ACM cladding, progress has been slower. In all, 970 blocks have been approved for funding from more than 3,000 applications. But so far, just 18 have been completed, amounting to less than 2%. In its latest data release, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: ""A series of measures have been taken to ensure that remediation occurs quickly and safely. ""The government is determined to learn the lessons from the Grenfell Tower tragedy by making funding available to address the fire safety risks of unsafe cladding on homes and bringing forward the most significant building safety reforms in almost 40 years."" The department said it had launched a new online service to allow leaseholders to track Building Safety Fund applications and ""expose building owners who are failing to take action to fix their properties"". This video can not be played ""We are coming for you"" - Michael Gove's warning to firms that cut corners, sought to profiteer and mis-sold dangerous products In recent weeks, leaseholders and Grenfell survivors have campaigned for further action and compensation. A group including the End Our Cladding Scandal, UK Cladding Action Group and Grenfell United campaigners sent a letter to Norway's giant state investment fund calling on them to pressure cladding firms and builders to fix fire safety issues - and withhold investment if they did not take action. ""This crisis has meant that at least 3,000,000 leaseholders are trapped in flammable flats they cannot sell, they are financing interim fire safety costs that they cannot afford to pay, and facing repossession/forfeiture over life-changing bills to make homes safe,"" the letter addressed to the boss of Norges Bank Investment Management said. It followed the announcement from Housing Secretary Michael Gove that firms would be given until March to agree how to help leaseholders trapped in ""unsellable homes"". Mr Gove warned those who had mis-sold unsafe cladding or cut corners on homes that the government was ""coming for you"". Mr Gove said some building companies had shown leadership and covered the costs but others ""had not shouldered their responsibilities."" Who has to pay to remove unsafe cladding?

"Former Pope Benedict XVI failed to act over four child abuse cases when he was archbishop of Munich, a German probe into the Catholic Church has alleged. Pope Benedict, then called Josef Ratzinger, held the position from 1977 to 1982. He has denied the accusations. But a new report into historical abuse allegations carried out by a German law firm incriminated the former pontiff. Abuse continued under his tenure, it is alleged, and the accused priests remained active in church roles. The former pope, now aged 94, became the first Church leader to resign in more than 600 years in 2013, citing exhaustion. Since then, he has led a largely quiet life in the Vatican City and is known as pope emeritus. The new report from German law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl was commissioned by the Catholic Church. ""Two of these cases concern abuses committed during his tenure and sanctioned by the state,"" lawyer Martin Pusch said as he announced the report. ""In both cases, the perpetrators remained active in pastoral care."" Sex abuse and the Catholic Church New Vatican laws toughen sexual abuse punishment In one instance, it is alleged he knew about a priest accused of abusing boys who was transferred to his diocese, but who then continued to work in pastoral care roles - this often involves visiting and supporting people within the community. The former pope is reported to have submitted dozens of pages of answers to the law firm's questioning, in which he expressed support for the inquiry but denied any knowledge or lack of action around the abuse allegations. The report, however, contains minutes which strongly suggest he was present at a meeting at which the subject was discussed. The Vatican said in a statement that it would examine the details of the report once it had been published. ""As we reiterate the sense of shame and regret for the abuses on minors by priests, the Holy See expresses its support for all victims and it confirms the path to protect minors, guaranteed safe spaces for them,"" the Vatican added. A previous report into historical abuse in Germany concluded that more than 3,600 people nationwide had been abused by clergy members between 1946 and 2014. Many of the victims were very young and served as altar boys. The new report looking into the Munich and Freising areas specifically found at least 497 abuse victims from 1945 to 2019. In addition to the former pope, the report criticised other Church figures, including the region's current archbishop, Cardinal Reinhard Marx. He was found to have failed to act in two cases of alleged abuse. The cardinal already offered Pope Francis his resignation in June 2021, saying he should share responsibility for the ""catastrophe"" of abuse which was coming to light. Pope Francis, however,refused to accept the resignation. Days earlier, the pope hadchanged the Vatican's criminal laws, toughening the Church's stance on sexual abuse.

"People in England are being urged to return to offices, as advice to work from home is lifted The UK is entering a new chapter in its fight against Covid-19, the health secretary says Sajid Javid says it is the right time to ease Plan B restrictions in England as Omicron is in ""retreat"" From today, secondary pupils in England no longer have to wear face coverings in classrooms Compulsory face masks in public places and Covid passport rules will also end next Thursday NHS staff absences due to Covid are falling across the country In Northern Ireland, restrictions including Covid passes for pubs are being dropped from Wednesday Meanwhile, Boris Johnson continues to be under pressure over lockdown parties held at No 10 Edited by Becky Morton We're ending our live coverage of todayâs coronavirus developments. Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Nathan Williams. The page was edited by Becky Morton. From all of us, have a good evening.  As we draw our live coverage to a close, here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments today: Daily Covid cases are continuing to fall, butthe number of deaths recorded is still rising. The average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test has been going up since the start of January. But, this is related to the number of people who started getting sick about a month ago, so lags behind the downward trend in daily cases. Hospital numbers also remain high. The most recent figures for the whole of the UK show 18,494 people were in hospital with Covid on 19 January, down from 19,796 a week earlier. Although the number of hospital patients has been rising recently, it remains below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. Fraud and errors in Covid business support schemes cost the public at least Â£16m, auditors have told members of the Scottish Parliament. Between 1% and 2% of the two main schemes - which paid out a total of Â£1.6bn - are thought to have been lost to fraud and error. Auditor General Stephen Boyle said the government had accepted a higher level of risk than usual given the urgent need to deliver support during the pandemic. Audit Scotland said that at the end of the last financial year, just over Â£1m had been recovered and 150 recovery cases were under way. A mother who nearly died from Covid after she gave birth says she wants to become an intensive care nurse to support those who ""literally gave me my life back"". Ellie Wright, 21 and from Walsall, contracted the virus when she was 30 weeks pregnant in January 2021. She became seriously ill in hospital, fighting Covid and pneumonia, and baby Leo had to be delivered by C-section 10 weeks prematurely. Ellie was placed in an induced coma that lasted three weeks and remembers saying ""who's that?"" when she saw her son for the first time. Find out more about her story here. Shaun Bailey pictured at a party at Conservative HQ during lockdown London mayor Sadiq Khanhas called on assembly member Shaun Bailey to quit from all his remaining positions, after it emerged he attended a party during the 2020 December lockdown. Bailey, who finished second after Khan in the mayoral election, has already left his roles as chairman of two key committees. The mayor says apologies offered by Bailey are ""mealy-mouthed"" and made ""because he was caught out"". ""His resignation as an assembly member must surely now be an inevitability. Londoners deserve much better representatives than that,"" Khan says. Bailey, who earlier went to his first assembly meeting since mid-December, hasn't responded. Last month, it was revealed that he attended a gathering at the Conservative Campaign Headquarters on 14 December 2020. Meanwhile in the US, outdoor clothing makerCarhartt is facing calls for a boycottamong those who are against its vaccine mandate for staff. This is happening amid a fierce debate in the country over Covid vaccines, after the US Supreme Court said the government can't force large companies to mandate jabs. In a memo to staff, Carhartt leaders said the court's decision had not changed the company's requirements, which went into effect for most of their staff in early January. ""We put workplace safety at the very top of our priority listâ¯andâ¯the Supreme Court's recentâ¯ruling doesn't impact that core value,"" wrote Carhartt's chief executive Mark Valade. After copies of the message were circulated on social media, prominent conservative figures weighed in. Attorney Molly McCann, who has represented Donald Trump, wrote on Twitter. ""Boycott Carhartt until they break.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We've got a bit more reaction now to secondary school pupils in England no longer having to wear face coverings in classrooms. Kevin Sexton, head teacher of Chesterfield High School in Crosby, Merseyside, says he wants face masks to remain compulsory in classrooms until the spring, adding that schools did not get enough warning of the rule changes. Sexton tells the BBC that teachers had to work late last night to make arrangements for the change, which was announced yesterday, and that the workload is âtaking its tollâ. But Mike Hobday, from the National Deaf Children's Society, has welcomed the news. He says it will come as a ""huge relief to England's 45,000 deaf children, who tell us that face masks have left them struggling to learn and left out of conversations with their friends"". This morning, Health Secretary Sajid Javid defended the move, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while infections were high, case rates were falling nationally and that ministers had to consider the impact of mask-wearing on children's education. The number of Covid cases recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with the total reported over the past seven days down by 32.8% on the previous week. However, the lag between people catching the virus and then becoming seriously ill means deaths are still rising. The weekly figure is up slightly by 1.8% on the previous week. The UK has reported 107,364 new Covid cases and 330 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  It's just been confirmed that some Covid restrictions are being eased
in Northern Ireland: Ministers in Northern Ireland have agreed to scrap the use of Covid passes in pubs, restaurants and cinemas from next Wednesday,BBC News NI understands. But proof of Covid status will still be needed in nightclubs, and indoor unseated and partially seated events with 500 or more people. First Minister Paul Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill are due to hold a news briefing shortly. We'll bring you the main updates here oryou can follow our Northern Ireland live page for more in-depth coverage. A union has expressed its anger after the government said people donât need to wear face masks at universities and colleges in England from next Thursday. Instead staff, students and visitors are being told they can choose to wear them ""voluntarily"" but masks will no longer be advised in lecture halls and classrooms, after Plan B measures end next week. Unions have described the move as ""irresponsible"". Jo Grady, University and College Union secretary, says while Covid cases remain high âbasic measures such as face masksâ¦ should continue to be in place"". Anastasia Karamalidou, a senior lecturer in criminology at the University of the West of England, Bristol, says the decision is âdisappointingâ, adding the âremoval of masks endangers student and staff physical and mental health"". While some may be celebrating the
rolling back of Covid restrictions in England, Bernie McGreavey in West
Yorkshire is not. Bernie, who has an inflammatory arthritic
condition that makes her clinically extremely vulnerable, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the changes
are ""really worrying"" for her and make her feel like a ""second-class
citizen"". Even before the changes, she had
to do a ""risk assessment"" before deciding to go somewhere, she says, ending
up sticking to places she knows are, for example, well-ventilated. ""Today, I've been out to a
local shopping centre with my niece,"" Bernie says, adding that most people were wearing masks. ""This time next week I will
probably not be going to that shopping centre, because the majority of people will
not be wearing masks."" Is now
the right time to drop restrictions? ""For me, it feels too
much too soon,"" Bernie says. Commuters at Waterloo station in London this morning As more people start to return to the office, Network Rail has reported an increase in passengers this morning. Figures show the number of people using its stations between 6:00 and 10.30 GMT was up 10% compared with the same period last week. Thatâs an increase from 275,000 to 303,000 people. But the statistics show daily passenger numbers had been increasing even before the guidance to work from home in England was lifted yesterday afternoon. Todayâs figure was just 1% higher compared with yesterday. As we've been reporting,ministers in Northern Ireland are considering plans to relax some Covid rules. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she is ""cautiously optimistic"" and while the pandemic is not over, she believes Northern Ireland has passed the peak of the Omicron wave. As a result, she says ministers believe they now have the ""space"" to reverse some of the curbs, which were introduced after Christmas to combat Omicron. However, she adds: ""It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet, we still have a journey to travel."" After the Stormont executive meets later, she says ministers hope to be able to say ""positive things that will be welcomed by both individuals and also by the hospitality sector"". First Minister Paul Givan has said he wants to see the use of Covid certification lifted entirely - but the BBC has been told Covid passes will still be required for entry to nightclubs. Breast screening is just one of many ways of picking up cancers People are being urged not to put off seeking help for worrying cancer symptomsbecause of pressures on the health service due to Covid. NHS England chiefs say record numbers were seen for check-ups before Omicron hit - and despite the current situation cancer is being prioritised. There have been nearly 50,000 fewer cancer diagnoses across the UK since the start of the pandemic, Macmillan Cancer Support say. This risks an increase in late-stage diagnoses, reducing survival chances. The plea comes as pressure on hospitals is starting to ease and the number of patients being admitted to hospital with Covid begins to fall. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Classes were suspended at Hong Kong's primary schools last Friday All secondary schools in Hong Kong are to close from
Monday because of rising Covid-19 infections, the city's education bureau has said. âThe epidemic
situation is getting severe,â it said, and advises that from next week, schools
âflexibly deploy various teaching modes and provide respective support to
sustain studentsâ learning at homeâ. Nursery and primary
school classes were already suspended in the city last Friday and Hong Kong has moved to impose new restrictions over the last couple of
weeks. On 7 Jan, bars
and gyms were ordered to closed, and a 6pm restaurant curfew was introduced.
Hong Kong has also this month introduced bans on flights from multiple
countries, including the UK. The government
has warned this week of âan imminent threat of both the Delta and Omicron
mutant strains spreading in the communityâ .
Sixteen local cases were recorded on Tuesday, two of unknown origins. Boris Johnson has said he has not seen any evidence to support claims the government has tried to blackmail its own MPswho have plotted to remove him as leader. William Wragg, one of those calling on the PM to resign over lockdown parties held at Downing Street, said rebels had faced ""pressures and intimidation"" from ministers. Christian Wakeford, who on Wednesday defected from the Conservatives to Labour, said he was threatened over funding for a school. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Rutherford Diagnostic Centre in Taunton, the prime minister said: ""What I am focused on is what we're doing to deal with the number one priority of the British people, which is coming through Covid."" The prime minister added that the government was looking ""absolutely ruthlessly"" at waiting lists. BBC Radio 4's Today programme has been speaking to Peter Marks, head of major nightclub firm Rekom
UK. He says he's happy he won't be having to ask customers in England for a Covid pass any more,with rules being ditched from next week. Marks says he's always believed nightclubs are ""no worse"" than
any other hospitality or indoor setting in terms of risk. But people are always
suggesting that clubs should be first to close, and last to open - or that they should face restrictions, he says. ""We've really got to get the confidence back in our customers,""
he says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.11720475

Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Nathan Williams. The page was edited by Becky Morton. From all of us, have a good evening.  As we draw our live coverage to a close, here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments today: Daily Covid cases are continuing to fall, butthe number of deaths recorded is still rising. The average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test has been going up since the start of January. But, this is related to the number of people who started getting sick about a month ago, so lags behind the downward trend in daily cases. Hospital numbers also remain high. The most recent figures for the whole of the UK show 18,494 people were in hospital with Covid on 19 January, down from 19,796 a week earlier. Although the number of hospital patients has been rising recently, it remains below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. Fraud and errors in Covid business support schemes cost the public at least Â£16m, auditors have told members of the Scottish Parliament. Between 1% and 2% of the two main schemes - which paid out a total of Â£1.6bn - are thought to have been lost to fraud and error. Auditor General Stephen Boyle said the government had accepted a higher level of risk than usual given the urgent need to deliver support during the pandemic. Audit Scotland said that at the end of the last financial year, just over Â£1m had been recovered and 150 recovery cases were under way. A mother who nearly died from Covid after she gave birth says she wants to become an intensive care nurse to support those who ""literally gave me my life back"". Ellie Wright, 21 and from Walsall, contracted the virus when she was 30 weeks pregnant in January 2021. She became seriously ill in hospital, fighting Covid and pneumonia, and baby Leo had to be delivered by C-section 10 weeks prematurely. Ellie was placed in an induced coma that lasted three weeks and remembers saying ""who's that?"" when she saw her son for the first time. Find out more about her story here.

"Delays in prosecuting suspected criminals have hit a record 708 days for the average time it takes to go from offence to completion of a case. In the three months to September 2021, the average time it took to deal with a crime rose 15%, up from 620 days. The figures,externalare a blow to the Ministry of Justice which is battling to reduce the massive backlog of serious crimes waiting to be dealt with by judges. The Criminal Bar Association's Jo Sidhu QC called the figures ""devastating"". The Ministry of Justice says its latest measures will restore swift justice. 'I don't believe my abuse case will get to court' Long delay for hundreds of rape cases, says report The government figures show that while more cases are being listed for trial at Crown Court, they are not being dealt with fast enough to prevent the average wait for justice from increasing. The overall backlog has fallen by around 1,000 to 59,928 outstanding Crown Court prosecutions. Judges set provisional dates for almost 6,200 new cases in the three months to September - a significant improvement. But, at the same time, 6,009 other prosecutions did not progress for a combination of reasons including postponements. Criminal barristers say those postponements are being driven by a combination of a lack of court time, judges and available lawyers to run each prosecution. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said that victims and defendants in some rape and domestic violence cases were now waiting up to five years for a prosecution to end in a verdict. ""These devastating figures of backlog and delay are only the tip of the iceberg,"" said Mr Sidhu.   ""The criminal justice crisis that long predated the pandemic has now escalated to a perfect storm across the country while trial delays grow. ""We simply do not have sufficient judges, prosecutors and defenders available to deal with the huge backlog. This is all entirely of the government's own making. It is the victims of crime and defendants alike who pay the price."" Earlier this week, the government announced it would soon allow the lower magistrates courts to sentence some offendersfor up to a year- a move to reduce the flow of less serious cases to judges in the Crown Courts. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Our decisive action kept justice moving despite the unprecedented impact of the pandemic. ""As a result, the Crown Court backlog has stabilised and fallen slightly in recent months, while in the magistrates' court it is now back to pre-pandemic levels. ""With super courtrooms, increased sentencing powers for magistrates and unlimited sitting days in Crown Courts this financial year, we will restore the swift access to justice that victims deserve.""

"This video can not be played Australian Open 2022: Emma Raducanu out of Australian Open with Danka Kovinic defeat Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Emma Raducanu was warned by her team not to play in the Australian Open second round because of a blister on her racquet hand that hampered the Briton in the defeat by Danka Kovinic. The US Open champion, 19, raced into a 3-0 lead before needing treatment on her hand and losing the opening set. She fought back to win the second set but was beaten 6-4 4-6 6-3 by the world number 98 on Margaret Court Arena. Raducanu says she has been nursing the blister for about five days. She has been ""trying every solution"" to tape the affected area because it ""kept ripping off"". ""It has been a challenge, for sure,"" she told BBC Sport. ""The past few days I have been really hindered in my practice and couldn't hit any forehands or serves at all. ""Some people in my team didn't really want me to go out there. I wanted to go and fight and see how far that would take me."" However, Raducanu says the experience showed she is ""probably tougher than I thought in terms of playing through that much pain"". ""I also learnt that I have got some hand skills, even though some people tell me I've got the hands of a bricklayer,"" she added. ""If I can use these sort of hand skills, and improve it going forward and mix it with my aggressive game, I think I can be pretty dangerous."" Evans into third round as Watson loses Iga Swiatek on Melbourne sightseeing & work-life balance Tsitsipas and Rublev reach third round Andy Murray loses in straight sets to Taro Daniel in Melbourne Montenegro's Kovinic is into the last 32 of a Grand Slam for the first time. Raducanu had only lost one Grand Slam match before this meeting and while she may ultimately have been defeated, the Briton will surely have won even more admirers for her gutsy display. The teenager has been spending almost 12 hours on site every day to ""get my business done"", which she says means training, having lunch, doing recovery, more training, gym work and then more recovery. That extra work initially paid dividends as Raducanu delivered the perfect start, breaking in the opening game and storming into a 3-0 lead. She looked set to replicate her first-round meeting against Sloane Stephens, where she claimed the opening set without dropping a game, although she was then taken to a deciding set by the American for the first time in her Grand Slam career. The blister then started to affect Raducanu and, at 3-2 after Kovinic had responded by winning two games, the Briton took a medical timeout for treatment. She double faulted on her return to the court and looked tentative as Kovinic broke again to level and completed the turnaround by winning five games in a row. A toiling Raducanu strung together a series of cleverly constructed points to break for the third time, but that resistance was short lived as Kovinic closed out the set. If Kovinic believed the second set would continue as a similar procession then Raducanu, smiling through gritted teeth, had other ideas. The teenager seemed to be effectively playing with just a backhand at times, jabbing and slicing on her forehand side to minimise the discomfort as she opened up a 3-1 lead. First-round opponent Stephens, a former US Open champion herself, warned Raducanu after their meeting that the teenager will have to learn to deal with ""ups and downs"". But Raducanu is a star student and showed during this chapter of her early Grand Slam education that she can learn on the job, letting out a huge ""come on"" after her adapted approach made it 4-2. The world number 18 had a chance to extend that advantage with break point on Kovinic's serve, but the Montenegrin displayed tactical nous and composure of her own to hold. Raducanu appeared to be grimacing with every forehand yet still chalked up another two break points at 4-4 and converted a superb winner off the troublesome side. The guile and desire that made her the first British woman to win a Grand Slam since Virginia Wade at Wimbledon in 1977 then shone through. Raducanu complemented a punchy serve with aggressive groundstrokes to fend off two break-back points and take the second set, shaking her blistered hand in celebration. Kovinic came through in three sets in a match lasting two hours 38 minutes Kovinic took a long bathroom break before the decider, no doubt wondering how she had failed to close out the match in two sets against an injured opponent. Indeed it was Raducanu who missed early break points and then, on a sweltering day in Melbourne where temperatures touched 30C, the Briton began to look fatigued for the first time as Kovinic converted her own to open up a 3-1 lead. Both players looked on as the crowd cheered a seagull circling inside the arena, and it looked like the breather Raducanu needed, as she broke back to love. But it was Kovinic who outlasted her opponent in the final set. She teed up two match points and although she watched the first scream back past her off a Raducanu forehand winner, she then found the corner with a backhand to cap a fine display and reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. ""It was a really nice experience to play Emma here and make the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time after many years,"" said Kovinic, the world number 98. ""Emma has had amazing results, winning a Grand Slam at such a young age. She is an amazing talent. I'm just so happy I could play such a high level. ""I was a little bit low in my energy through the third set so I tried to focus on myself, not show much emotion and save my energy."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller There was a brief period, midway through the first set, when Emma Raducanu looked quite agitated about the blister that was preventing her playing her natural game. Unable to hit her usual topspin forehand, because of a red raw blister on her serving hand, she began to improvise. She hit virtually every single forehand with slice in the second set, and was able to level the match, even though she says she has been told in the past that she has the ""hands of a bricklayer"". The 19-year-old has gained some more invaluable Grand Slam experience here in Melbourne, even though her Australian Open debut lasted just two matches. She beat a fellow Grand Slam champion - Sloane Stephens - for the first time in the first round, and won a deciding set in a Slam, which was also a first. And then against Danka Kovinic she had to think on her feet in the face of adversity - and in the process developed a new trick which could prove very useful in future matches.

"Delays in prosecuting suspected criminals have hit a record 708 days for the average time it takes to go from offence to completion of a case. In the three months to September 2021, the average time it took to deal with a crime rose 15%, up from 620 days. The figures,externalare a blow to the Ministry of Justice which is battling to reduce the massive backlog of serious crimes waiting to be dealt with by judges. The Criminal Bar Association's Jo Sidhu QC called the figures ""devastating"". The Ministry of Justice says its latest measures will restore swift justice. 'I don't believe my abuse case will get to court' Long delay for hundreds of rape cases, says report The government figures show that while more cases are being listed for trial at Crown Court, they are not being dealt with fast enough to prevent the average wait for justice from increasing. The overall backlog has fallen by around 1,000 to 59,928 outstanding Crown Court prosecutions. Judges set provisional dates for almost 6,200 new cases in the three months to September - a significant improvement. But, at the same time, 6,009 other prosecutions did not progress for a combination of reasons including postponements. Criminal barristers say those postponements are being driven by a combination of a lack of court time, judges and available lawyers to run each prosecution. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said that victims and defendants in some rape and domestic violence cases were now waiting up to five years for a prosecution to end in a verdict. ""These devastating figures of backlog and delay are only the tip of the iceberg,"" said Mr Sidhu.   ""The criminal justice crisis that long predated the pandemic has now escalated to a perfect storm across the country while trial delays grow. ""We simply do not have sufficient judges, prosecutors and defenders available to deal with the huge backlog. This is all entirely of the government's own making. It is the victims of crime and defendants alike who pay the price."" Earlier this week, the government announced it would soon allow the lower magistrates courts to sentence some offendersfor up to a year- a move to reduce the flow of less serious cases to judges in the Crown Courts. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Our decisive action kept justice moving despite the unprecedented impact of the pandemic. ""As a result, the Crown Court backlog has stabilised and fallen slightly in recent months, while in the magistrates' court it is now back to pre-pandemic levels. ""With super courtrooms, increased sentencing powers for magistrates and unlimited sitting days in Crown Courts this financial year, we will restore the swift access to justice that victims deserve.""

"Covid certification checks in Northern Ireland began last month Stormont ministers have agreed to drop the use of vaccine passports in pubs, restaurants and cinemas in Northern Ireland from midday on Wednesday. The move is part of several relaxations to Northern Ireland's Covid rules. It means proof of Covid status will no longer be legally required in hospitality premises from 26 January. The system will remain in place for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance. Ministers have also agreed to remove rules on table service in hospitality businesses and the so-called ""rule of six"" per table from midday on Friday. It is understood that hospitality businesses will still be advised in guidance to retain use of Covid certification. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill announced the changes to the rules while on a visit to Londonderry Under the latest changes, the guidance limit of three households allowed to meet indoors in a home is also to be removed from Friday. Under the plan, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen from Wednesday with dancing and indoor standing events permitted again. The Stormont executive was advised by the Department of Health that the minimum self-isolation period for people testing positive for Covid-19 will be reduced to five full days, subject to negative lateral flow tests on days five and six of their isolation. Also from next Wednesday, the need for offices to ""take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing"" will be removed although risk assessments should be carried out. First Minister Paul Givan described the changes as a ""step in the right direction"" and said they reflected the changing circumstances in Northern Ireland. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""clear we were past the peak"" in terms of coronavirus case numbers and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. Proof of Covid certification has been legally required in certain settings in Northern Ireland since 13 December, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) the only party in the executive opposed to its use. Some representatives ofthe hospitality sector had criticised the move when it was imposed, saying it would affect their trade. Speaking on Thursday, Ken Sharpe, owner of Salty Dog hotel and restaurant in Bangor, County Down, said his turnover in December was down by 25% compared with two years ago. ""It was the introduction of Covid certification and other restrictions that really caused us to crash,"" he said. The decision by ministers to remove the requirement for Covid passports was welcomed by several trade bodies. Is the pandemic entering its endgame? What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? Self-isolation period set to be reduced Angela McGowan, the Northern Ireland director of the Confederation of British Industry, said companies would be hopeful that ""we are finally starting to turn the corner on Covid-19"". ""Removing indoor hospitality restrictions will come as a big relief to those companies desperate to start trading their way to recovery after a difficult festive period. ""The decision to limit the vaccine passport scheme to nightclubs will also be welcomed by Northern Ireland's significant food, drink and tourism sectors as we head into spring. ""The focus must now be on how we can safely live with the virus, grow the economy and stimulate investment."" Covid certification will no longer be required for entry to a bar from Wednesday The Campaign For Real Ale's Northern Ireland chairwoman Ruth Sloan said the easing of Covid rules was ""good news for our pubs, publicans and pub-goers"". ""The end of table-service only requirementsÂ will be particularly welcome, helping pubs toÂ operate at a decent capacity andÂ be able toÂ get enough money through the tillsÂ after months of devastating restrictions. ""However, ministers here and in Westminster will need to continue to support our local pubs, breweries and cider producersÂ to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels of trade."" At their meeting to agree the changes on Thursday, ministers were advised by health officials that there may be a ""secondary peak"" in cases in the next two weeks as a result of further spread in school age children. However the advice also states that it is likely that existing measures will be ""sufficient"" to manage hospital admissions and deaths are not expected to rise significantly, due to Omicron being less severe than previous variants. Mr Givan also said the next executive meeting on 10 February would be an ""important one"" when other measures would be discussed. He said he wanted to see movement on the wearing of masks. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon told BBC News NI's The View that she was content to agree with the recommendations. ""This is all as a result of the mammoth effort that the people of Northern Ireland have put in and the huge sacrifices that they have made to keep themselves safe, to keep their families safe and to keep everyone else safe,"" she said. But she was critical of a leak of an executive paper outlining what ministers would discuss in meeting, which she said had led to ""uncertainty [and] media speculation"". ""That was bad government on a good day and I think people deserve better than that,"" said the SDLP minister. There's no doubt that we are closer to the end of this pandemic than the beginning. While it was science, and chiefly the vaccination programme, that got us to this point, so did a huge amount of sacrifice and effort. That's why some experts are urging caution and stressing that it's not over yet. While easing of restrictions is welcomed, infection levels are still causing much concern. Infections have fallen but are still well above what they were at the height of the peak last winter - the big difference is that Omicron is affecting people much less severely. The executive has been warned that in the next fortnight, there could be a secondary peak in cases as a result of further spread among children. While not severely affected, children who test positive are off school, requiring parents to stay off work to be with them - an indirect impact causing huge staff absences across the public sector. As in other jurisdictions, politics is influencing what decisions are being taken - a delicate and difficult balance. Spring, however, is looking brighter. Scotland, England and Wales have already announced some easing of restrictions. A number of Covid measures in England are to end from 27 January, with the advice for people to work from home being dropped, along with Covid passports and the requirement to wear a face covering in public places. In Scotlandrules on table service in hospitality venues will be lifted from Monday, when nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen, whilein Wales a three-week plan for scrapping restrictionshas been set out. The Republic of Ireland's government has suggestedchanges are likely to its restrictionstoo, including large crowds returning to outdoor events.

"Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, represented himself at the trial at the Royal Courts of Justice People owed an estimated Â£2m by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson have appointed an independent insolvency expert to try to recover their money before a March deadline. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, declared himself bankrupt last March. In July, a judge ordered him to pay Â£100,000 to a refugee schoolboy he had wrongly accused of attacking a girl. He also owes an estimated Â£1.5m in legal costs for the boy's lawyers. Tommy Robinson loses Syrian schoolboy libel case Robinson failed to convince the High Court his claims that Jamal Hijazi had attacked ""young English girls"" in his school in Huddersfield were true. The legal costs are before any accrued interest. Other creditors include HMRC, a former business partner and Barrow-In-Furness Borough Council. The anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate is fundraising to pay for the cost of the independent insolvency expert, Heath Sinclair of Richard Long & co. The expert has until 3 March to try to find any assets or money that Robinson could be hiding, otherwise he will come out of bankruptcy, and it may become harder to recover the money he owes. Bankruptcies are usually for 12 months, but the independent expert can apply to court to have the discharge from bankruptcy suspended. This can be for a lack of co-operation on the part of the bankrupt, for example. Until now the work has been done by the official receiver, but the creditors hope the independent expert will uncover more assets. The expert has the power to look at Robinson's bank records, to interview people under oath and apply for search warrants if necessary. He and his wife Jenna Lennon divorced in February last year, just before he declared himself bankrupt, and before he lost the libel case. She owns a large detached house in Bedfordshire where there have been extensive building works over the autumn and winter, including the creation of a gym in the old double garage, and a games room above a new garage being built in the garden. The house was worth Â£705,000 when she bought it in November 2020, although she does have a mortgage. Robinson has been seen at the house talking to builders, sometimes with his ex-wife and sometimes alone, according to anti-fascism activists. Hope not Hate believes he may have access to up to Â£3m in assets earned through property, investments, donations and book sales. It thinks the Bedfordshire house alone could now be worth Â£1.2m. The campaign group's chief executive Nick Lowles said it was helping to fund the independent insolvency expert, because Robinson's videos and online comments had ""turned Jamal's life upside down"". It added: ""Jamal and his family had to move, had to start all over again, got all sorts of threats. ""It just seems outrageous that the person who did that, and then lost a libel case, can walk away scot-free. ""So partly it's about holding him to account and giving some justice to Jamal. ""We need to demonstrate to him and others there are consequences for doing this. You cannot get away with making people's lives a misery, creating lies, dividing communities, whipping up hatred, inspiring others to do attacks and not be held accountable for your actions, and I think for us this is a way to hold him to account."" During his years as an activist espousing far-right views and campaigns, Robinson built up a strong social media following. He used crowdfunding techniques and advertising on his social media channels to earn money, but this dried up when he was banned by Facebook and other social media companies. His main outlet is now on Gettr, a platform set up by Jason Miller, a former aide to former US President Donald Trump. In November 2013, Robinson pleaded guilty to fraud, and he was subsequently jailed for 18 months. He also has convictions for stalking, assault, using someone else's passport, using threatening behaviour and contempt of court.

"The restrictions introduced to curb the Omicron wave are being scrapped in England. Mandatory face coverings, Covid passes and working-from-home guidance - the so-called Plan B -are all going. It leaves England - in the words of Health Secretary Sajid Javid - the most open country in Europe. But is it too soon to take such a step? Infections levels, while falling, are still well above what they were at the height of the peak last winter. What is more, the progress being made varies between regions. The Midlands, North East and Yorkshire are yet to see hospital admissions start falling, despite a drop in the overall national figure. UK reports 108,069 cases on Wednesday It is why some scientists and public health experts have expressed concern the easing may be too much and risks a rebound in infections . And one has to wonder what influence the political considerations have had - the Tory backbenchers were unlikely to vote to keep any part of Plan B. But, in the end, it also comes down to a judgement about what is proportionate. A trade-off has to be made between the costs of such restrictions and the benefits they bring. And with the worst of the Omicron wave almost certainly over, the benefits were reducing. How are the Covid rules changing? Do you think it is too soon to lift restrictions? Share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external England - and the rest of the UK, for that matter - is one of best protected nations when you combine the immunity built up by vaccination and previous infection. More than 97% of the population has antibodies, the latest Office for National Statistics data suggests,external. When the pandemic began, that was, of course, 0%. This does not necessarily mean people are immune to infection, but our bodies have become better at fighting the virus. The result is Covid is now causing milder illness and the proportion of infected people dying has dropped markedly. Although there are also signs this is partly down to Omicron being intrinsically less severe too. This has helped keep the number of deaths in recent weeks much lower than previous waves and at a similar level to a bad flu season. It is very much the best-case scenario in terms of what we were told we could see when this variant, first identified in South Africa, took off. Is the pandemic entering its endgame? Hospital admissions appear to have peaked at just over 2,000 a day, when modelling suggested they could reach three to four times that in the worst case and even the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the government's official advisory body, said it expected them to hit 3,000 at least. But there are still huge pressures on the NHS. More than 15,000 people in England are in hospital with Covid, although this is not entirely what it seems as close to half of them have been admitted for something else rather than being seriously ill with the virus. So there are plenty of reasons for ministers and their advisers to say the data supports the case for a relaxation. The restriction that reduces spread of the virus most when infected - the requirement to isolate - remains, remember. The outgoing Plan B measures, by comparison, all have a more marginal impact, if any. Of these,working from home was the measure government scientists always argued had the most effect- but the jury was out over the exact effectiveness of the others. For example,the Department for Education's own evidence review,externaladmitted the data on the ability of masks in classrooms to reduce the spread of the virus was inconclusive, with studies showing mixed results. What is more, their use could harm communication and learning. What are the Covid rules in UK schools? Where do I still need to wear a mask? Meanwhile, the rise of Omicron meant the effectiveness of two vaccine doses in preventing infection has been significantly reduced, weakening the argument forCovid passes to access events. Instead, what many experts believe will be crucial now is the behaviour of the public. Just because the government is giving people more freedom, it does not mean there will be a headlong rush back to normal. This has been seen throughout the pandemic. Even after England's 19 July ""Freedom Day"", mixing patterns did not rebound back to pre-pandemic levels, when people would average 10 contacts a day, helping keep the virus largely in check until the arrival of Omicron. By the end of December, as the Omicron wave was peaking, daily contacts were actually close to the levels seen in the first lockdown, curbing the spread in the process. Now the public is again being asked to manage the risks, and that behaviour will determine the course of the pandemic over the coming weeks. Follow Nickon Twitter,external. Read morefrom Nick.

"Big banks, advertising firms and insurers have announced plans to return to the office after the government scrapped its work-from-home guidance for England with immediate effect. However, most said flexible working arrangements would remain in place. Some have questioned whether the move is premature and could worsen already-high staff absences. But others said city centres hit hard by Omicron would get a much needed boost as commuters returned. Banking group HSBC said its staff started returning to the office on Thursday, while Standard Chartered has asked employees to come in from Monday - although both lenders have flexible working arrangements in place. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs also plan to resume office working. Meanwhile Havas, a French advertising agency with 11,500 staff worldwide, told the BBC it would ""fully reopen"" its London office from Monday after more than a month of employees working from home. Latest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020,external, up from 27% the previous year. The government introduced its Plan B restrictions in December to battle the Omicron variant, but on Wednesday eased them saying infections had peaked nationally. Along with the end of working-from guidance, the requirement in England for mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports will both be ditched from next Thursday. Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England Working-from-home guidance shift 'may not help me' What are the new working from home rules? Chris Hirst, global head of creative at Havas, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Many of our employees really do want to come back into the office, but there are some people who are nervous and we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach to that. ""We'll be talking to those people individually and finding solutions that work for them."" Insurance firm Zurich, which employs 4,500 in the UK, said it was ""excited"" to welcome staff back to its offices but most would continue on a hybrid basis. ""We had a flexible working policy prior to the pandemic, but [Covid] meant suddenly everybody was experiencing the benefits and some of the downfalls and we've learnt a lot,"" chief operating officer John Keppel told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme. Alex, 28, says he can't wait for people at his law firm to go back to the office in the next month. He joined the company in November, when it was working on a hybrid basis, but virtually all staff have been working from home since mid December. ""I'm a new joiner and just getting started,"" he told the BBC. ""But it's been really difficult to learn about the company culture, make new connections and make an impression."" However, he does appreciate the flexibility of being able to work from home, and supports his firm's goal of moving to a 60:40 split between office and home working. ""Working from home can be more productive. Although now people have got used to doing it full time, I think some will be loath to give it up."" Network Rail said the number of people using its stations between 6:00 and 10.30 GMT on Thursday was up 10% compared with the same period last week. But the statistics show daily passenger numbers had been increasing even before the guidance to work from home in England was lifted yesterday afternoon. Thursday's figure was just 1% higher compared with Wednesday. Business groups have broadly welcomed the easing of Plan B restrictions in England, with the CBI calling for ""greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term"". Lord Stuart Rose, chairman of Asda and former boss of Marks and Spencer and Argos, hailed the decision to scrap the guidance. ""I cannot believe we have a nation sitting at home now cowered by this government, because they are fearful of this virus,"" he said. ""It is something we have to now live with."" According to the Times newspaper,,externalthe government has asked civil servants to go back to their desks as an example to other employers. But some have questioned the safety of the move at time when the NHS remains under pressure. The British Chambers of Commerce also urged the government to improve access to rapid testing so firms could bring staff back to workplaces with confidence. ""With infection rates still high, many firms are experiencing significant staff absences and will be cautious about teams rushing back to the office when that could result in further absences,"" BCC director general Shevaun Haviland said. ""Maintenance of testing capacity must also be a priority for government, with reports still reaching us of firms unable to access rapid testing at times when they need it."" Unions also said employers had to ensure a safe return to work, and provide flexible working when staff wanted it. The TUC called for a better sick pay offer from government amid concerns that many workers will be infected and have to take time off on statutory sick pay. Others, however, said the change in guidance was overdue for city centre retailers, which rely on commuter trade that has dried up over the last few months. Most workers do not expect full office return On Thursday, the City Pub Group, which has 46 sites, said it expected ""consumer confidence and consequently demand"" to grow once office workers return to work. And the Gym Group said demand was returning after a slow December, and would ""show further improvement"" due to the end of work from home guidance. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director said: ""Blanket work-from-home guidance has had significant downsides for city centre trade in sectors such as hospitality and retail."" According to BBC research in September, most peopledo not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would ""never return to offices at the same rate"".

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner called Mr Wragg's claims ""shocking"" and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of ""acting more like a mafia boss than a prime minister"". Scotland's First Minister, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, said: ""If Tories are threatening to withhold public investment from constituencies as a way of keeping MPs in line then, yes, that's blackmail and intimidation - but it is also corruption. ""The moral decay at the heart of Johnson's government may be even worse than we thought."" But Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries accused Mr Wragg of ""attention-seeking behaviour"", calling his accusations ""nonsense"". And Energy Minister Greg Hands, who used to work as a government whip, said Mr Wakeford was not a ""credible source"" because his defection meant his job was now to ""do down the Conservative Party"". He added that Mr Wragg's claims had ""not been borne out by anybody else"", adding: ""This is not something that happens."" This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries calls the blackmail accusations ""nonsense"" Mr Johnson is facing down an attempt from some Tory MPs to oust him as leader over lockdown parties held in Downing Street. He has called on potential rebels to wait for the outcome of civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into parties, expected next week, before passing judgement on him. But prominent Tory backbencher, Steve Baker,told the BBC's Political Thinking podcastthat it ""looks like checkmate"" for the prime minister. ""Honestly, at the moment, I'm looking to the cabinet for leadership,"" he told host Nick Robinson. ""At the moment, I'm afraid it does look like checkmate - but whether he can save himself, we'll see."" This video can not be played MPs should report intimidation tactics to the police, says William Wragg Mr Wragg launched a stinging attack on the way the government has handled dissent among Tory MPs on Thursday, in another sign of worsening relations between Mr Johnson and his backbenchers. Speaking at a Commons committee that he chairs, the MP for Hazel Grove accused government whips of threatening those suspected of plotting with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. He also said he had received reports of government ministers, advisers and staff at No 10 ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass"" those suspected of lacking confidence in the PM. Downing Street not in control after day of chaos Why UK prime minister is under pressure to quit Mr Wragg claimed the reports ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" - and as well as contacting police, affected MPs should contact the Commons Speaker. After the appearance, Mr Wakeford - who defected to the Labour Party on Thursday - said he had been threatened into supporting the government when sitting as a Tory MP. ""I was threatened that I would not get the school for Radcliffe if I didn't vote one particular way,"" he told BBC North West Tonight. ""This is a town that's not had a high school for the best part of 10 years and how would you feel with holding back the regeneration of a town for a vote?"" He said the incident ""didn't sit comfortably"" and it led to him ""starting to question my place where I was and ultimately to where I am now"". Black books and dark arts, quiet words and not so quiet words. The art of persuasion is as old as the stones in Parliament's walls. But William Wragg's intervention stands out because it alleges blackmail, potential criminal wrongdoing and breaches of the ministerial code. One or two are whispering privately here that Mr Wragg is overcooking his argument and has long been outspoken about the prime minister. And a few are saying similar stuff publicly. It's a reminder that while the imminent pressure on Boris Johnson has eased for now, the anger and vitriol provoked by these rows is still very real, very live. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said ""serious allegations"" had been made, and MPs with concerns should write to him. He said government ministers and those who work for them ""are not above the criminal law,"" after Mr Wragg said MPs concerned about potential blackmail should contact the Metropolitan Police. But the Speaker added: ""The investigation of allegedly criminal conduct is a matter for the police and decisions about prosecution are for the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service]."" This video can not be played Christian Wakeford says he was threatened to vote in a certain way One rebel MP told the BBC that some dissenters had been threatened with funding cuts, whilst animpending shake-up of parliamentary boundariesdue next year had also been used to put down rebellion. ""It's been done to the weakest to make an example,"" they added. However, Tory MP Anthony Mangnall, said he had never been threatened, despite rebelling against the government on ""quite a lot of matters"". Ms Dorries also called Mr Wragg's accusations ""disappointing"" and told BBC West Midlands: ""That is nonsense because that is not how government works, and we are the party of government. ""The whips have no say over what happens in individual constituencies. ""And not only is it nonsense, it is just attention seeking behaviour from William Wragg, who has been a constant critic of the prime minister.""

TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings It follows a dramatic day in Westminster on Wednesday, when Tory MPChristian Wakeford defected to Labour, describing the PM as incapable of leading. Tory grandee and former ally of Mr Johnson David Davistold the PM: ""In the name of God, go."" So far six Conservative MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests. There are claims that the threshold of 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote and leadership election could soon be reached, but no official word has been given. However, some Conservatives have told the BBC the mood has changed, following the defection of Mr Wakeford. Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns - a close ally of Mr Johnson - claimed Tory MPs were ""stepping back"" from calling for the PM to go now, and were waiting for Ms Gray's report.

"Former Pope Benedict XVI failed to act over four child abuse cases when he was archbishop of Munich, a German probe into the Catholic Church has alleged. Pope Benedict, then called Josef Ratzinger, held the position from 1977 to 1982. He has denied the accusations. But a new report into historical abuse allegations carried out by a German law firm incriminated the former pontiff. Abuse continued under his tenure, it is alleged, and the accused priests remained active in church roles. The former pope, now aged 94, became the first Church leader to resign in more than 600 years in 2013, citing exhaustion. Since then, he has led a largely quiet life in the Vatican City and is known as pope emeritus. The new report from German law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl was commissioned by the Catholic Church. ""Two of these cases concern abuses committed during his tenure and sanctioned by the state,"" lawyer Martin Pusch said as he announced the report. ""In both cases, the perpetrators remained active in pastoral care."" Sex abuse and the Catholic Church New Vatican laws toughen sexual abuse punishment In one instance, it is alleged he knew about a priest accused of abusing boys who was transferred to his diocese, but who then continued to work in pastoral care roles - this often involves visiting and supporting people within the community. The former pope is reported to have submitted dozens of pages of answers to the law firm's questioning, in which he expressed support for the inquiry but denied any knowledge or lack of action around the abuse allegations. The report, however, contains minutes which strongly suggest he was present at a meeting at which the subject was discussed. The Vatican said in a statement that it would examine the details of the report once it had been published. ""As we reiterate the sense of shame and regret for the abuses on minors by priests, the Holy See expresses its support for all victims and it confirms the path to protect minors, guaranteed safe spaces for them,"" the Vatican added. A previous report into historical abuse in Germany concluded that more than 3,600 people nationwide had been abused by clergy members between 1946 and 2014. Many of the victims were very young and served as altar boys. The new report looking into the Munich and Freising areas specifically found at least 497 abuse victims from 1945 to 2019. In addition to the former pope, the report criticised other Church figures, including the region's current archbishop, Cardinal Reinhard Marx. He was found to have failed to act in two cases of alleged abuse. The cardinal already offered Pope Francis his resignation in June 2021, saying he should share responsibility for the ""catastrophe"" of abuse which was coming to light. Pope Francis, however,refused to accept the resignation. Days earlier, the pope hadchanged the Vatican's criminal laws, toughening the Church's stance on sexual abuse.

"Superdry have teamed up with influencers such as singer beabadoobee to drive sales among older teens Superdry's boss has warned that shoppers should expect higher prices due to rising costs and says the chain will have no more sales in its shops. Julian Dunkerton said it would increase prices on some clothing items by about 2% due to rising inflation. It hopes to offset price rises by cutting the number of items it puts on sale online too. ""We are a fantastic value brand and will remain so,"" Mr Dunkerton told the BBC. Other companies, such as Kingsmill bread-owner AB Foods,Greggs and Nexthave all said that spiralling costs of wages, manufacturing and raw materials mean they have either put prices up or are planning to do so in the future. Official figures released on Wednesdayshowed that soaring food costs and energy bills had pushed up the cost of living at its fastest rate in nearly 30 years. Inflation, which measures how costs change over time, jumped to 5.4% in the 12 months to December - up from 5.1% the month before,. Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral Superdry founder promises revival after Â£85m loss Superdry warns of uncertainty amid Covid sales hit But Mr Dunkerton's comments came as Superdry reported a return to profit, with trading helped by new clothing ranges and a social media push using influencers. It reported a pre-tax profit of Â£4m in the six months to late October - up from a nearly Â£19m loss one year before when non-essential shops were closed during lockdown. Sales across the company dropped, however, by 1.9%. The company said that was down to the fallout of the pandemic, as well as its move to reduce discounts. It pointed to bright spots in Christmas trading, with jacket sales up 40% year-on-year, for example. The company is also looking to draw in younger shoppers with a mix of different products, and Mr Dunkerton said he hoped the brand ""is just becoming cool again"". Superdry said that mini skirts and ""70s vibe"" flares had been performing well with older teens - one of their key target markets. To capture the imagination of younger fashionistas, it has stepped up its social media marketing on Instagram and TikTok, taking cues from the likes of online giants Boohoo and Asos. The company now works with about 2,000 influencers, up six-fold year-on-year, and said its Instagram followers had increased by nearly a quarter. Mr Dunkerton told the BBC that Superdry's launch on TikTok had gone well. ""That will see huge growth for us,"" he said. ""We only started on there in September and we've got nearly 100,000 followers already - it's a key way of talking to our teenage demographic."" Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 Superdry, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham, was set up by by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder, and went on to enjoy huge commercial success. But clashes followed between Mr Dunkerton and the board, leading to his resignation from the board and eventual return in 2019 to ""steady the ship"" after huge losses. Increasing engagement on social is understood to be a key part of his strategy, with the brand working with influencers and on tie-ups with celebrities such as Brooklyn Beckham and football superstar Neymar Jr. ""We want to build up our influencer base throughout Europe and start in American the tail end of this year. We will end up with an army of influencers because that's a key part of our strategy,"" Mr Dunkerton said. Its influencers are often sent free clothing, or might receive payment for their sponsored ads online. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""The battle for customers' attention is increasingly being fought online as the pandemic has accelerated the influence of digital across the entire customer journey. ""Retailers are leveraging the reach offered by influencers across social media platforms to connect with new customers and new markets."" Superdry's new flagship store on London's Oxford Street has also put selfies and reels at its centre. Having opened in November, it features an entire floor closed to the public, instead dedicated to hosting social stars in its showroom and a gin bar.

"Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, represented himself at the trial at the Royal Courts of Justice People owed an estimated Â£2m by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson have appointed an independent insolvency expert to try to recover their money before a March deadline. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, declared himself bankrupt last March. In July, a judge ordered him to pay Â£100,000 to a refugee schoolboy he had wrongly accused of attacking a girl. He also owes an estimated Â£1.5m in legal costs for the boy's lawyers. Tommy Robinson loses Syrian schoolboy libel case Robinson failed to convince the High Court his claims that Jamal Hijazi had attacked ""young English girls"" in his school in Huddersfield were true. The legal costs are before any accrued interest. Other creditors include HMRC, a former business partner and Barrow-In-Furness Borough Council. The anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate is fundraising to pay for the cost of the independent insolvency expert, Heath Sinclair of Richard Long & co. The expert has until 3 March to try to find any assets or money that Robinson could be hiding, otherwise he will come out of bankruptcy, and it may become harder to recover the money he owes. Bankruptcies are usually for 12 months, but the independent expert can apply to court to have the discharge from bankruptcy suspended. This can be for a lack of co-operation on the part of the bankrupt, for example. Until now the work has been done by the official receiver, but the creditors hope the independent expert will uncover more assets. The expert has the power to look at Robinson's bank records, to interview people under oath and apply for search warrants if necessary. He and his wife Jenna Lennon divorced in February last year, just before he declared himself bankrupt, and before he lost the libel case. She owns a large detached house in Bedfordshire where there have been extensive building works over the autumn and winter, including the creation of a gym in the old double garage, and a games room above a new garage being built in the garden. The house was worth Â£705,000 when she bought it in November 2020, although she does have a mortgage. Robinson has been seen at the house talking to builders, sometimes with his ex-wife and sometimes alone, according to anti-fascism activists. Hope not Hate believes he may have access to up to Â£3m in assets earned through property, investments, donations and book sales. It thinks the Bedfordshire house alone could now be worth Â£1.2m. The campaign group's chief executive Nick Lowles said it was helping to fund the independent insolvency expert, because Robinson's videos and online comments had ""turned Jamal's life upside down"". It added: ""Jamal and his family had to move, had to start all over again, got all sorts of threats. ""It just seems outrageous that the person who did that, and then lost a libel case, can walk away scot-free. ""So partly it's about holding him to account and giving some justice to Jamal. ""We need to demonstrate to him and others there are consequences for doing this. You cannot get away with making people's lives a misery, creating lies, dividing communities, whipping up hatred, inspiring others to do attacks and not be held accountable for your actions, and I think for us this is a way to hold him to account."" During his years as an activist espousing far-right views and campaigns, Robinson built up a strong social media following. He used crowdfunding techniques and advertising on his social media channels to earn money, but this dried up when he was banned by Facebook and other social media companies. His main outlet is now on Gettr, a platform set up by Jason Miller, a former aide to former US President Donald Trump. In November 2013, Robinson pleaded guilty to fraud, and he was subsequently jailed for 18 months. He also has convictions for stalking, assault, using someone else's passport, using threatening behaviour and contempt of court.

"Big banks, advertising firms and insurers have announced plans to return to the office after the government scrapped its work-from-home guidance for England with immediate effect. However, most said flexible working arrangements would remain in place. Some have questioned whether the move is premature and could worsen already-high staff absences. But others said city centres hit hard by Omicron would get a much needed boost as commuters returned. Banking group HSBC said its staff started returning to the office on Thursday, while Standard Chartered has asked employees to come in from Monday - although both lenders have flexible working arrangements in place. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs also plan to resume office working. Meanwhile Havas, a French advertising agency with 11,500 staff worldwide, told the BBC it would ""fully reopen"" its London office from Monday after more than a month of employees working from home. Latest figures suggest that 37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home in 2020,external, up from 27% the previous year. The government introduced its Plan B restrictions in December to battle the Omicron variant, but on Wednesday eased them saying infections had peaked nationally. Along with the end of working-from guidance, the requirement in England for mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passports will both be ditched from next Thursday. Face mask rules and Covid passes to end in England Working-from-home guidance shift 'may not help me' What are the new working from home rules? Chris Hirst, global head of creative at Havas, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Many of our employees really do want to come back into the office, but there are some people who are nervous and we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach to that. ""We'll be talking to those people individually and finding solutions that work for them."" Insurance firm Zurich, which employs 4,500 in the UK, said it was ""excited"" to welcome staff back to its offices but most would continue on a hybrid basis. ""We had a flexible working policy prior to the pandemic, but [Covid] meant suddenly everybody was experiencing the benefits and some of the downfalls and we've learnt a lot,"" chief operating officer John Keppel told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme. Alex, 28, says he can't wait for people at his law firm to go back to the office in the next month. He joined the company in November, when it was working on a hybrid basis, but virtually all staff have been working from home since mid December. ""I'm a new joiner and just getting started,"" he told the BBC. ""But it's been really difficult to learn about the company culture, make new connections and make an impression."" However, he does appreciate the flexibility of being able to work from home, and supports his firm's goal of moving to a 60:40 split between office and home working. ""Working from home can be more productive. Although now people have got used to doing it full time, I think some will be loath to give it up."" Network Rail said the number of people using its stations between 6:00 and 10.30 GMT on Thursday was up 10% compared with the same period last week. But the statistics show daily passenger numbers had been increasing even before the guidance to work from home in England was lifted yesterday afternoon. Thursday's figure was just 1% higher compared with Wednesday. Business groups have broadly welcomed the easing of Plan B restrictions in England, with the CBI calling for ""greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term"". Lord Stuart Rose, chairman of Asda and former boss of Marks and Spencer and Argos, hailed the decision to scrap the guidance. ""I cannot believe we have a nation sitting at home now cowered by this government, because they are fearful of this virus,"" he said. ""It is something we have to now live with."" According to the Times newspaper,,externalthe government has asked civil servants to go back to their desks as an example to other employers. But some have questioned the safety of the move at time when the NHS remains under pressure. The British Chambers of Commerce also urged the government to improve access to rapid testing so firms could bring staff back to workplaces with confidence. ""With infection rates still high, many firms are experiencing significant staff absences and will be cautious about teams rushing back to the office when that could result in further absences,"" BCC director general Shevaun Haviland said. ""Maintenance of testing capacity must also be a priority for government, with reports still reaching us of firms unable to access rapid testing at times when they need it."" Unions also said employers had to ensure a safe return to work, and provide flexible working when staff wanted it. The TUC called for a better sick pay offer from government amid concerns that many workers will be infected and have to take time off on statutory sick pay. Others, however, said the change in guidance was overdue for city centre retailers, which rely on commuter trade that has dried up over the last few months. Most workers do not expect full office return On Thursday, the City Pub Group, which has 46 sites, said it expected ""consumer confidence and consequently demand"" to grow once office workers return to work. And the Gym Group said demand was returning after a slow December, and would ""show further improvement"" due to the end of work from home guidance. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director said: ""Blanket work-from-home guidance has had significant downsides for city centre trade in sectors such as hospitality and retail."" According to BBC research in September, most peopledo not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would ""never return to offices at the same rate"".

According to the Times newspaper,,externalthe government has asked civil servants to go back to their desks as an example to other employers. But some have questioned the safety of the move at time when the NHS remains under pressure. The British Chambers of Commerce also urged the government to improve access to rapid testing so firms could bring staff back to workplaces with confidence. ""With infection rates still high, many firms are experiencing significant staff absences and will be cautious about teams rushing back to the office when that could result in further absences,"" BCC director general Shevaun Haviland said. ""Maintenance of testing capacity must also be a priority for government, with reports still reaching us of firms unable to access rapid testing at times when they need it."" Unions also said employers had to ensure a safe return to work, and provide flexible working when staff wanted it. The TUC called for a better sick pay offer from government amid concerns that many workers will be infected and have to take time off on statutory sick pay. Others, however, said the change in guidance was overdue for city centre retailers, which rely on commuter trade that has dried up over the last few months. Most workers do not expect full office return On Thursday, the City Pub Group, which has 46 sites, said it expected ""consumer confidence and consequently demand"" to grow once office workers return to work. And the Gym Group said demand was returning after a slow December, and would ""show further improvement"" due to the end of work from home guidance. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director said: ""Blanket work-from-home guidance has had significant downsides for city centre trade in sectors such as hospitality and retail."" According to BBC research in September, most peopledo not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would ""never return to offices at the same rate"".

"This video can not be played Child abuse survivors are still waiting on a state apology, five years after HIA inquiry Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers will make an official apology to survivors of child abuse in institutions on 11 March, it has been confirmed. The apology was recommended in the final report of the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry (HIAI). It was published five years ago. Paul Givan and Michell O'Neill will make the apology in parliament buildings on behalf of the executive. Officials will meet with survivors' groups over the coming weeks to discuss the event. The inquiry examined the period 1922-1995, and found there had been widespread and systemic abuse at institutions. The chair, the late Sir Anthony Hart, recommended compensation, an apology and a memorial. Campaigner Margaret McGuckin said many of those who wanted an apology have now died Margaret McGuckin, from the group Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abuse (SAVIA), said the announcement was ""welcome"" but had been a ""very long time coming"". ""I think it's happened because of the pressure we had to apply again,"" she said. ""It's unfortunate so many people who wanted an apology have gone to their graves blaming themselves and will never hear the words: 'It wasn't your fault, it was our fault.'"" 'Ten years' to process abuse redress applications Abuse survivors identified in 'massive' email error Kate Walmsley, who was sexually abused between the ages of eight and 12 at an institution in Londonderry, said: ""All I've wanted was for somebody to say sorry."" She explained how her experience had affected the rest of her life. Kate Walmsley was sexually abused between the ages of eight and 12 at an institution in Londonderry ""I just never felt I belonged anywhere. I still am lonely and feel I'm not accepted, and totally ignored."" Kate said she felt ""more traumatised"" by having to push for Sir Anthony Hart's recommendations to be implemented. Days after the Hart Report was published, the powersharing executive at Stormont collapsed - leaving Northern Ireland without a government for three years. Campaigners asked the then Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith to pass legislation at Westminster to set up the compensation scheme recommended by Sir Anthony Hart. The late Sir Anthony Hart recommended a compensation scheme Mr Smith did so in November 2019. The Stormont Executive was restored two months later. A review is currently being carried out into the financial redress scheme. It's understood Stormont officials have heard several different views from survivors about the value and timing of an apology. Confirming the date for an official apology, First Minister Paul Givan said: ""Victims and survivors of historical institutional abuse have our full support, and we are determined they will receive the acknowledgement, support, and redress they deserve. ""Our priority remains approaching an apology with care and sensitivity, and basing it upon the experience of victims and survivors."" Michelle O'Neill acknowledged there would be ""many different views"" on a public apology and said the date had been announced in advance so  that survivors and their families could give input. ""While no apology will make up for the shameful failures, and the pain that victims and survivors have endured as a result, we owe it to them to acknowledge the harm they suffered."" She added: ""The needs of victims and survivors are at the heart of this and we are working to ensure that we have the right support in place - before, during, and after the apology is made."" Survivors of the institutions in Northern Ireland travelled from Great Britain, Australia and other parts of the world to give evidence at the Hart Inquiry - which was the biggest investigation of its kind to be held in the UK at the time. Brian O'Donoghue now lives in Lancashire. When he talks about his childhood six decades ago - his pictures are sharp and his memories evidently vivid. He describes having meals in a cellar at Rubane House, in County Down, as feeling ""a bit like Oliver Twist to me"". Brian O'Donoghue recorded his experiences in a self-published memoir His initial impressions of the institution, which was run by the De La Salle Brothers, was that it was ""frightening"", he didn't have good clothes to wear and he wasn't fed very well. He was sexually abused and remembers how - at the age of nine - he ""didn't understand what was happening, but I knew it was wrong to be touched"". In his self-published memoir - written from the perspective of his boyhood self - Brian recorded one incident where two boys who tried to run away were punished. A partition between two classrooms was opened up, so everyone in the institution could be made to watch. He said they were made to strip to a pair of swimming trunks, and beaten in front of all the other boys ""until they jumped in the air and screamed"". ""There was sweat pouring off the Brother who did the beating - that was how much he put into it."" Brian was born in Limerick and was first put into an institution in the Republic of Ireland, after his mother ""went out for some milk of magnesia for the baby and didn't come back for two years"". After his time in Northern Ireland, he was also in a children's home in the north of England, which was ""totally different"". ""You weren't brutalised but any punishments were psychological - so you weren't spoken to, you were made an outcast,"" he said. Looking back on his life, he described himself as becoming ""fiercely independent"" because ""no-one's looked after me since I was a kid"". He has had depression for many years, and said his wife Marcia was ""the first person in my life who gave me stability"". He said he maintained a positive attitude to life - ""I get out there every day and make the best of it."" He is ""grateful"" to have received compensation through the Stormont scheme. On the prospect of a state apology in Northern Ireland, he said: ""Some people will say it should have come sooner - and it should have done. ""But that word - sorry - will make lots of people feel a bit better.""

"This video can not be played Superglue and metal files: How I tried to fix my teeth NHS dentistry is ""hanging by a thread"" with some patients facing two-year waits for check-ups, the British Dental Association has said. Department of Health data analysed by the BBC shows almost 1,000 dentists working in 2,500 roles across England and Wales left the NHS last year. One woman told the BBC how she had resorted to filing down and supergluing her own teeth. NHS England said patients who most needed care should be prioritised. Sharon Grey, from Suffolk, was forced to take matters into her own hands and turned to DIY dentistry after waiting for NHS treatment for over a year. ""I've filed them down with a metal file, I've superglued them back in and managed to superglue most of my mouth as well,"" she said. ""I've used Fixodent to try and hold a bridge onto my teeth that doesn't work either. I think I must have covered most things by now. ""I've worked my whole life. I've paid my national insurance. I've worked for the NHS even, and I was left in this situation. I think its diabolical."" Clinical Commissioning Group West Suffolk lost 21% of its dentists in the last year. The worst-affected area was NHS Portsmouth CCG, which lost 26% of its NHS dentists over 12 months. At least 10% of NHS dentists were lost in 28 other English CCGs. Pamela Carr has not been able to find an NHS dentist for more than a year Pamela Carr, 58, from Carlisle, has been looking for an NHS dentist to fix her root canal since November 2020. ""I've become used to the pain,"" she said. ""I can't afford the private care, and I've tried every practice within 30 miles. I phoned NHS England too. ""They said there's nothing they can do because there are no NHS dentists. That was the end of the conversation."" North Cumbria CCG, which covers Carlisle, lost 4% of its dentists in the last year. The worst-affected area was NHS Portsmouth CCG, which lost 26% of its NHS dentists over 12 months. At least 10% of NHS dentists were lost in 28 other English CCGs. One group of dental practices in Barnsley has failed to attract a single applicant for a number of full-time and part-time NHS dental posts vacant for almost four years. TSJ Smile clinical director Sarfraz Khan runs six practices in Barnsley. He told BBC Look North that rural-based groups found it harder to recruit, and have to offer higher wages to compete with city practices. Clinical director Sarfraz Khan has been unable to recruit dentists ""The work load in a city is less, but you get paid the same amount,"" said Mr Khan. ""You might get a young man who needs four fillings and an extraction. You get a band 2 payment for that. In the city for doing one filling, you get a band 2 payment for that. Which one would you choose? Less work, same pay. ""That's one of the issues we've got with the dental contract. For one role I've been advertising for nearly four years, with no one interested, yet I'm paying over the odds. ""If I can't get associates to come in to work, the waiting times are getting longer. Patients are waiting at least four to six weeks, some of whom are in a lot of pain."" The British Dental Association (BDA) and the charity Healthwatch have called for reform of the NHS dental contract. Until last year, NHS dentists in England and Wales had been using the units of dental activity (UDA) system. UDAs are used to measure a practice's activity. Courses of treatment - for example, a check-up or a filling, are banded into UDAs. Practices are set targets of UDAs to achieve, and if that target is missed, the contract holder and the practice can be forced to pay back money. Critics have claimed the UDA system does not incentivise preventative work and is a key reason for dentists leaving the health service. Wales moved away from the UDA system in 2021, but it is still in place in England. The BDA's General Dental Practice Committee chairman Shawn Charlwood wants UDAs scrapped in England. ""NHS dentistry is hanging by a thread,"" he said. The chair of the BDA's General Dental Practice Committee Shawn Charlwood ""Every dentist that is lost or every vacancy for NHS dentists affects thousands of patients. ""Ministers have failed to grasp that we can't have NHS dentistry without NHS dentists."" Concern has also been raised about the usefulness of NHS England'sFind a Dentist tool,external, which was created to help patients find an NHS dentist in their area. BBC analysis shows about 75% of practices in England had not updated the site to show whether they were accepting NHS patients or not within the last three months. Matthew Drake, 30, from Deal in Kent, used the tool to call dozens of dentists last summer when his gums became infected. He eventually got through to an emergency out of hours practice, but was told he did not qualify for treatment. ""It felt like I was getting passed around without getting anywhere,"" said Mr Drake. ""Being in pain wasn't enough of an emergency."" Mr Drake used all his savings to pay for private treatment but is now having problems with his wisdom teeth. Latest figures show NHS Kent and Medway CCG lost 7% of its dentists in the last year. ""I'm angry. I pay a lot of National Insurance and I can't get the treatment I need on the NHS. ""It feels like I'm in no man's land. I'm not quite poor enough to qualify for help, but I'm not rich enough to pay for private care."" Interim director of Healthwatch Chris McCann said the problems were increasing pressure on the NHS. Interim director of Healthwatch Chris McCann ""Information on practices can be out-dated,"" he said. ""We've seen some people having to contact up to 20 practices before finding someone to take them. ""The main impact will be the increase in waits for treatment. We've heard examples of people being told to wait up to two years for routine check-ups, and up to six weeks for emergency care. ""These lengthy waits can lead to more serious problems and increased pressure on the NHS. We've even seen people performing DIY extractions. ""There are children as young as five who are in pain and unable to access treatment."" An NHS England spokesman said it had taken ""unprecedented action"" to support NHS dentists throughout the pandemic including additional funding for practices unable to deliver their usual levels of activity, as well as setting up 600 urgent dental centres across England. ""People should continue to come forward for the dental care they need, and the care and treatment of people who need it most should be prioritised,"" he added. In Wales, some 6% of NHS dental posts were lost, with 83 fewer dentists working across health boards than the year before. The worst-affected area was the Swansea Bay University Health Board, which had 22% fewer NHS dentists compared with the year before. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it would meet the needs of patients through preventative care and increased access, supported by contract reform. She added: ""While the pandemic has paused some of this work, we will continue to support practices during the recovery period as focus is placed on increasing access to those most at risk."" The number of NHS and HSCNI dentists in Scotland and Northern Ireland has remained steady over the last three years.

"Antibiotics may no longer work because the bacteria they are intended to kill is becoming resistant More than 1.2 million people died worldwide in 2019 from infections caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics, according to the largest study of the issue to date. This is more than the annual death toll from malaria or Aids. Poorer countries are worst affected but antimicrobial resistance threatens everyone's health, the report says. Urgent investment in new drugs and using current ones more wisely are recommended to protect against it. The overuse of antibiotics in recent years for trivial infections means they are becoming less effective against serious infections. People are dying from common, previously treatable infections because the bacteria that cause them have become resistant to treatment. UK health officials recently warnedantimicrobial resistance (AMR) was a ""hidden pandemic""that could emerge in the wake of Covid-19 unless antibiotics were prescribed responsibly. The estimate of global deaths from AMR, published inthe Lancet,external, is based on an analysis of 204 countries by a team of international researchers, led by the University of Washington, US. They calculate up to five million people died in 2019 from illnesses in which AMR played a role - on top of the 1.2 million deaths it caused directly. In the same year, Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is thought to have caused 860,000 deaths and malaria 640,000. Lab test of antimicrobial resistance Most of the deaths from AMR were caused by lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, and bloodstream infections, which can lead to sepsis. MRSA (methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus) was particularly deadly, while E. coli, and several other bacteria, were also linked to high levels of drug resistance. Using patient records from hospitals, studies and other data sources, the researchers say young children are at most risk, with about one in five deaths linked to AMR being among the under-fives. Deaths from AMR were estimated to be: highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, at 24 deaths in every 100,000 lowest in high-income countries, at 13 in every 100,000 Prof Chris Murray, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said the new data revealed the true scale of antimicrobial resistance worldwide and was a clear signal immediate action was needed ""if we want to stay ahead in the race against antimicrobial resistance. Other experts say better tracking of resistance levels in different countries and regions is essential. Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, from the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, in Washington DC, said global spending on addressing AMR needed to rise to levels seen for other diseases. ""Spending needs to be directed to preventing infections in the first place, making sure existing antibiotics are used appropriately and judiciously, and to bringing new antibiotics to market,"" he said. Much of the world faced the challenge of poor access to affordable, effective antibiotics - and that needed to be taken seriously by political and health leaders everywhere, Dr Laxminarayan added.

"This video can not be played Australian Open 2022: Emma Raducanu out of Australian Open with Danka Kovinic defeat Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Emma Raducanu was warned by her team not to play in the Australian Open second round because of a blister on her racquet hand that hampered the Briton in the defeat by Danka Kovinic. The US Open champion, 19, raced into a 3-0 lead before needing treatment on her hand and losing the opening set. She fought back to win the second set but was beaten 6-4 4-6 6-3 by the world number 98 on Margaret Court Arena. Raducanu says she has been nursing the blister for about five days. She has been ""trying every solution"" to tape the affected area because it ""kept ripping off"". ""It has been a challenge, for sure,"" she told BBC Sport. ""The past few days I have been really hindered in my practice and couldn't hit any forehands or serves at all. ""Some people in my team didn't really want me to go out there. I wanted to go and fight and see how far that would take me."" However, Raducanu says the experience showed she is ""probably tougher than I thought in terms of playing through that much pain"". ""I also learnt that I have got some hand skills, even though some people tell me I've got the hands of a bricklayer,"" she added. ""If I can use these sort of hand skills, and improve it going forward and mix it with my aggressive game, I think I can be pretty dangerous."" Evans into third round as Watson loses Iga Swiatek on Melbourne sightseeing & work-life balance Tsitsipas and Rublev reach third round Andy Murray loses in straight sets to Taro Daniel in Melbourne Montenegro's Kovinic is into the last 32 of a Grand Slam for the first time. Raducanu had only lost one Grand Slam match before this meeting and while she may ultimately have been defeated, the Briton will surely have won even more admirers for her gutsy display. The teenager has been spending almost 12 hours on site every day to ""get my business done"", which she says means training, having lunch, doing recovery, more training, gym work and then more recovery. That extra work initially paid dividends as Raducanu delivered the perfect start, breaking in the opening game and storming into a 3-0 lead. She looked set to replicate her first-round meeting against Sloane Stephens, where she claimed the opening set without dropping a game, although she was then taken to a deciding set by the American for the first time in her Grand Slam career. The blister then started to affect Raducanu and, at 3-2 after Kovinic had responded by winning two games, the Briton took a medical timeout for treatment. She double faulted on her return to the court and looked tentative as Kovinic broke again to level and completed the turnaround by winning five games in a row. A toiling Raducanu strung together a series of cleverly constructed points to break for the third time, but that resistance was short lived as Kovinic closed out the set. If Kovinic believed the second set would continue as a similar procession then Raducanu, smiling through gritted teeth, had other ideas. The teenager seemed to be effectively playing with just a backhand at times, jabbing and slicing on her forehand side to minimise the discomfort as she opened up a 3-1 lead. First-round opponent Stephens, a former US Open champion herself, warned Raducanu after their meeting that the teenager will have to learn to deal with ""ups and downs"". But Raducanu is a star student and showed during this chapter of her early Grand Slam education that she can learn on the job, letting out a huge ""come on"" after her adapted approach made it 4-2. The world number 18 had a chance to extend that advantage with break point on Kovinic's serve, but the Montenegrin displayed tactical nous and composure of her own to hold. Raducanu appeared to be grimacing with every forehand yet still chalked up another two break points at 4-4 and converted a superb winner off the troublesome side. The guile and desire that made her the first British woman to win a Grand Slam since Virginia Wade at Wimbledon in 1977 then shone through. Raducanu complemented a punchy serve with aggressive groundstrokes to fend off two break-back points and take the second set, shaking her blistered hand in celebration. Kovinic came through in three sets in a match lasting two hours 38 minutes Kovinic took a long bathroom break before the decider, no doubt wondering how she had failed to close out the match in two sets against an injured opponent. Indeed it was Raducanu who missed early break points and then, on a sweltering day in Melbourne where temperatures touched 30C, the Briton began to look fatigued for the first time as Kovinic converted her own to open up a 3-1 lead. Both players looked on as the crowd cheered a seagull circling inside the arena, and it looked like the breather Raducanu needed, as she broke back to love. But it was Kovinic who outlasted her opponent in the final set. She teed up two match points and although she watched the first scream back past her off a Raducanu forehand winner, she then found the corner with a backhand to cap a fine display and reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. ""It was a really nice experience to play Emma here and make the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time after many years,"" said Kovinic, the world number 98. ""Emma has had amazing results, winning a Grand Slam at such a young age. She is an amazing talent. I'm just so happy I could play such a high level. ""I was a little bit low in my energy through the third set so I tried to focus on myself, not show much emotion and save my energy."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller There was a brief period, midway through the first set, when Emma Raducanu looked quite agitated about the blister that was preventing her playing her natural game. Unable to hit her usual topspin forehand, because of a red raw blister on her serving hand, she began to improvise. She hit virtually every single forehand with slice in the second set, and was able to level the match, even though she says she has been told in the past that she has the ""hands of a bricklayer"". The 19-year-old has gained some more invaluable Grand Slam experience here in Melbourne, even though her Australian Open debut lasted just two matches. She beat a fellow Grand Slam champion - Sloane Stephens - for the first time in the first round, and won a deciding set in a Slam, which was also a first. And then against Danka Kovinic she had to think on her feet in the face of adversity - and in the process developed a new trick which could prove very useful in future matches.

"Boris Johnson was asked about the claims on a visit to Somerset Boris Johnson says he has ""seen no evidence"" of blackmail in his party after claims by one of his own MPs. William Wragg - who has called on the PM to resign over parties at No 10 - said suspected plotters against the PM have been threatened with bad publicity and cuts to constituency funding. He has advised colleagues who feel threatened to go to the police. An ex-Tory MP who defected to Labour, Christian Wakeford, also saidhe was threatened over funding for a school. Mr Johnson told reporters on Thursday he had ""seen no evidence [and] heard no evidence"" of Mr Wragg's claims, but he would look into them. On Friday,the Times reported,externalrebels have met to discuss the tactics of government whips, the MPs in charge of party discipline. The newspaper reported the plotters discussed whether to make public text messages and other evidence of how they have been treated. Looks like checkmate for PM, says senior Tory MP What are whips and are MPs scared of them? Pie, pizza and curry - history's tasty political plots What is Sue Gray investigating? Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner called Mr Wragg's claims ""shocking"" and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of ""acting more like a mafia boss than a prime minister"". Scotland's First Minister, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, said: ""If Tories are threatening to withhold public investment from constituencies as a way of keeping MPs in line then, yes, that's blackmail and intimidation - but it is also corruption. ""The moral decay at the heart of Johnson's government may be even worse than we thought."" But Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries accused Mr Wragg of ""attention-seeking behaviour"", calling his accusations ""nonsense"". And Energy Minister Greg Hands, who used to work as a government whip, said Mr Wakeford was not a ""credible source"" because his defection meant his job was now to ""do down the Conservative Party"". He added that Mr Wragg's claims had ""not been borne out by anybody else"", adding: ""This is not something that happens."" This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries calls the blackmail accusations ""nonsense"" Mr Johnson is facing down an attempt from some Tory MPs to oust him as leader over lockdown parties held in Downing Street. He has called on potential rebels to wait for the outcome of civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into parties, expected next week, before passing judgement on him. But prominent Tory backbencher, Steve Baker,told the BBC's Political Thinking podcastthat it ""looks like checkmate"" for the prime minister. ""Honestly, at the moment, I'm looking to the cabinet for leadership,"" he told host Nick Robinson. ""At the moment, I'm afraid it does look like checkmate - but whether he can save himself, we'll see."" This video can not be played MPs should report intimidation tactics to the police, says William Wragg Mr Wragg launched a stinging attack on the way the government has handled dissent among Tory MPs on Thursday, in another sign of worsening relations between Mr Johnson and his backbenchers. Speaking at a Commons committee that he chairs, the MP for Hazel Grove accused government whips of threatening those suspected of plotting with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. He also said he had received reports of government ministers, advisers and staff at No 10 ""encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass"" those suspected of lacking confidence in the PM. Downing Street not in control after day of chaos Why UK prime minister is under pressure to quit Mr Wragg claimed the reports ""would seem to constitute blackmail"" - and as well as contacting police, affected MPs should contact the Commons Speaker. After the appearance, Mr Wakeford - who defected to the Labour Party on Thursday - said he had been threatened into supporting the government when sitting as a Tory MP. ""I was threatened that I would not get the school for Radcliffe if I didn't vote one particular way,"" he told BBC North West Tonight. ""This is a town that's not had a high school for the best part of 10 years and how would you feel with holding back the regeneration of a town for a vote?"" He said the incident ""didn't sit comfortably"" and it led to him ""starting to question my place where I was and ultimately to where I am now"". Black books and dark arts, quiet words and not so quiet words. The art of persuasion is as old as the stones in Parliament's walls. But William Wragg's intervention stands out because it alleges blackmail, potential criminal wrongdoing and breaches of the ministerial code. One or two are whispering privately here that Mr Wragg is overcooking his argument and has long been outspoken about the prime minister. And a few are saying similar stuff publicly. It's a reminder that while the imminent pressure on Boris Johnson has eased for now, the anger and vitriol provoked by these rows is still very real, very live. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said ""serious allegations"" had been made, and MPs with concerns should write to him. He said government ministers and those who work for them ""are not above the criminal law,"" after Mr Wragg said MPs concerned about potential blackmail should contact the Metropolitan Police. But the Speaker added: ""The investigation of allegedly criminal conduct is a matter for the police and decisions about prosecution are for the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service]."" This video can not be played Christian Wakeford says he was threatened to vote in a certain way One rebel MP told the BBC that some dissenters had been threatened with funding cuts, whilst animpending shake-up of parliamentary boundariesdue next year had also been used to put down rebellion. ""It's been done to the weakest to make an example,"" they added. However, Tory MP Anthony Mangnall, said he had never been threatened, despite rebelling against the government on ""quite a lot of matters"". Ms Dorries also called Mr Wragg's accusations ""disappointing"" and told BBC West Midlands: ""That is nonsense because that is not how government works, and we are the party of government. ""The whips have no say over what happens in individual constituencies. ""And not only is it nonsense, it is just attention seeking behaviour from William Wragg, who has been a constant critic of the prime minister.""

TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings It follows a dramatic day in Westminster on Wednesday, when Tory MPChristian Wakeford defected to Labour, describing the PM as incapable of leading. Tory grandee and former ally of Mr Johnson David Davistold the PM: ""In the name of God, go."" So far six Conservative MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests. There are claims that the threshold of 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote and leadership election could soon be reached, but no official word has been given. However, some Conservatives have told the BBC the mood has changed, following the defection of Mr Wakeford. Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns - a close ally of Mr Johnson - claimed Tory MPs were ""stepping back"" from calling for the PM to go now, and were waiting for Ms Gray's report.

"Covid certification checks in Northern Ireland began last month Stormont ministers have agreed to drop the use of vaccine passports in pubs, restaurants and cinemas in Northern Ireland from midday on Wednesday. The move is part of several relaxations to Northern Ireland's Covid rules. It means proof of Covid status will no longer be legally required in hospitality premises from 26 January. The system will remain in place for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance. Ministers have also agreed to remove rules on table service in hospitality businesses and the so-called ""rule of six"" per table from midday on Friday. It is understood that hospitality businesses will still be advised in guidance to retain use of Covid certification. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill announced the changes to the rules while on a visit to Londonderry Under the latest changes, the guidance limit of three households allowed to meet indoors in a home is also to be removed from Friday. Under the plan, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen from Wednesday with dancing and indoor standing events permitted again. The Stormont executive was advised by the Department of Health that the minimum self-isolation period for people testing positive for Covid-19 will be reduced to five full days, subject to negative lateral flow tests on days five and six of their isolation. Also from next Wednesday, the need for offices to ""take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing"" will be removed although risk assessments should be carried out. First Minister Paul Givan described the changes as a ""step in the right direction"" and said they reflected the changing circumstances in Northern Ireland. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""clear we were past the peak"" in terms of coronavirus case numbers and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. Proof of Covid certification has been legally required in certain settings in Northern Ireland since 13 December, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) the only party in the executive opposed to its use. Some representatives ofthe hospitality sector had criticised the move when it was imposed, saying it would affect their trade. Speaking on Thursday, Ken Sharpe, owner of Salty Dog hotel and restaurant in Bangor, County Down, said his turnover in December was down by 25% compared with two years ago. ""It was the introduction of Covid certification and other restrictions that really caused us to crash,"" he said. The decision by ministers to remove the requirement for Covid passports was welcomed by several trade bodies. Is the pandemic entering its endgame? What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? Self-isolation period set to be reduced Angela McGowan, the Northern Ireland director of the Confederation of British Industry, said companies would be hopeful that ""we are finally starting to turn the corner on Covid-19"". ""Removing indoor hospitality restrictions will come as a big relief to those companies desperate to start trading their way to recovery after a difficult festive period. ""The decision to limit the vaccine passport scheme to nightclubs will also be welcomed by Northern Ireland's significant food, drink and tourism sectors as we head into spring. ""The focus must now be on how we can safely live with the virus, grow the economy and stimulate investment."" Covid certification will no longer be required for entry to a bar from Wednesday The Campaign For Real Ale's Northern Ireland chairwoman Ruth Sloan said the easing of Covid rules was ""good news for our pubs, publicans and pub-goers"". ""The end of table-service only requirementsÂ will be particularly welcome, helping pubs toÂ operate at a decent capacity andÂ be able toÂ get enough money through the tillsÂ after months of devastating restrictions. ""However, ministers here and in Westminster will need to continue to support our local pubs, breweries and cider producersÂ to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels of trade."" At their meeting to agree the changes on Thursday, ministers were advised by health officials that there may be a ""secondary peak"" in cases in the next two weeks as a result of further spread in school age children. However the advice also states that it is likely that existing measures will be ""sufficient"" to manage hospital admissions and deaths are not expected to rise significantly, due to Omicron being less severe than previous variants. Mr Givan also said the next executive meeting on 10 February would be an ""important one"" when other measures would be discussed. He said he wanted to see movement on the wearing of masks. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon told BBC News NI's The View that she was content to agree with the recommendations. ""This is all as a result of the mammoth effort that the people of Northern Ireland have put in and the huge sacrifices that they have made to keep themselves safe, to keep their families safe and to keep everyone else safe,"" she said. But she was critical of a leak of an executive paper outlining what ministers would discuss in meeting, which she said had led to ""uncertainty [and] media speculation"". ""That was bad government on a good day and I think people deserve better than that,"" said the SDLP minister. There's no doubt that we are closer to the end of this pandemic than the beginning. While it was science, and chiefly the vaccination programme, that got us to this point, so did a huge amount of sacrifice and effort. That's why some experts are urging caution and stressing that it's not over yet. While easing of restrictions is welcomed, infection levels are still causing much concern. Infections have fallen but are still well above what they were at the height of the peak last winter - the big difference is that Omicron is affecting people much less severely. The executive has been warned that in the next fortnight, there could be a secondary peak in cases as a result of further spread among children. While not severely affected, children who test positive are off school, requiring parents to stay off work to be with them - an indirect impact causing huge staff absences across the public sector. As in other jurisdictions, politics is influencing what decisions are being taken - a delicate and difficult balance. Spring, however, is looking brighter. Scotland, England and Wales have already announced some easing of restrictions. A number of Covid measures in England are to end from 27 January, with the advice for people to work from home being dropped, along with Covid passports and the requirement to wear a face covering in public places. In Scotlandrules on table service in hospitality venues will be lifted from Monday, when nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen, whilein Wales a three-week plan for scrapping restrictionshas been set out.

"Prince Harry and Meghan are among the celebrities misused in fake investment adverts Fake endorsements from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are being used on social media to promote Bitcoin-related investment schemes. Photos and bogus interviews with Prince Harry and Meghan and other celebrities are being used to attract investors. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says it is increasing worries about scam advertisements. The number of consumers reporting possible scams to the watchdog has risen by more than 400% in five years. In 2021, there were more than 34,000 reports from consumers with suspicions about possibly fraudulent investment offers, the FCA says. In 2016, it had been 8,000. ""People should be very wary when they see investment ads offering high returns, even if they appear to be endorsed by celebrities,"" a spokeswoman for the financial services regulator said. The watchdog warns of growing concerns about get-rich-quick scams being advertised through social media or search engines. Fabricated interviews with Prince Harry and Meghan have previously been used in investment claims - and there appear to be new attempts to use their names in online articles promising instant profits, shared on social-media platforms. ""People earning millions from home by using Harry and Meghan latest advice,"" says one of the latest fake headlines, in a story also using the logos of news brands, including the BBC, the Daily Mail, the Sun, Forbes, Good Morning Britain and the Guardian. Another was headlined: ""Harry and Meghan shocked everyone in the studio by revealing how they making an extra Â£128,000 every month."" Fake Elon Musk Bitcoin scam cost man Â£400,000 'We lost our life savings in cryptocurrency scam' Articles claim falsely that in TV interviews the couple backed investment schemes related to Bitcoin and crypto-currency trading. ""I let the software run and my profits stacked up like pancakes,"" a supposed investor is quoted as saying. ""It feels incredible having money rush in this fast and hard."" Another says: ""My ex-girlfriend dumped me because I was too poor. ""Now I'm a multi-millionaire and I have an even better girlfriend."" The online articles carry bogus claims of the backing of other wealthy figures, including Bill Gates, Sir Richard Branson and Mark Zuckerberg. The investment articles, seen by the FCA, appear to be linked to a website in Eastern Europe. The website was contacted but has not replied - and the online link now goes to a general feature on the Royal Family. Representatives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been alerted. The FCA wants consumers to be more aware of the threat of scams and to check if a company is regulated in the UK and on thefinancial-services register,external. ""If it isn't, you are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong,"" the FCA spokeswoman said. There are warnings of increasing numbers of bogus adverts using celebrity endorsements Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime, says scammers are using social media to target a younger age group. This can involve ""fake testimonials"" and pictures of famous people to ""help the investment seem legitimate"", it says. In the financial year between April 2020 and March 2021, there were were 500 investment frauds found using bogus celebrity endorsements, with losses of over Â£10m, according to Action Fraud. Citizens Advice director of policy Matthew Upton said the ""consequences can be truly devastating"". ""These schemes are becoming ever-more sophisticated and can leave people feeling incredibly vulnerable and isolated - to the point where they can't even tell their family and friends what has happened,"" he added.

"People in England are being urged to return to offices, as advice to work from home is lifted The UK is entering a new chapter in its fight against Covid-19, the health secretary says Sajid Javid says it is the right time to ease Plan B restrictions in England as Omicron is in ""retreat"" From today, secondary pupils in England no longer have to wear face coverings in classrooms Compulsory face masks in public places and Covid passport rules will also end next Thursday NHS staff absences due to Covid are falling across the country In Northern Ireland, restrictions including Covid passes for pubs are being dropped from Wednesday Meanwhile, Boris Johnson continues to be under pressure over lockdown parties held at No 10 Edited by Becky Morton We're ending our live coverage of todayâs coronavirus developments. Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Malu Cursino, Chris Giles, Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Nathan Williams. The page was edited by Becky Morton. From all of us, have a good evening.  As we draw our live coverage to a close, here's a summary of the key coronavirus developments today: Daily Covid cases are continuing to fall, butthe number of deaths recorded is still rising. The average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test has been going up since the start of January. But, this is related to the number of people who started getting sick about a month ago, so lags behind the downward trend in daily cases. Hospital numbers also remain high. The most recent figures for the whole of the UK show 18,494 people were in hospital with Covid on 19 January, down from 19,796 a week earlier. Although the number of hospital patients has been rising recently, it remains below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. Fraud and errors in Covid business support schemes cost the public at least Â£16m, auditors have told members of the Scottish Parliament. Between 1% and 2% of the two main schemes - which paid out a total of Â£1.6bn - are thought to have been lost to fraud and error. Auditor General Stephen Boyle said the government had accepted a higher level of risk than usual given the urgent need to deliver support during the pandemic. Audit Scotland said that at the end of the last financial year, just over Â£1m had been recovered and 150 recovery cases were under way. A mother who nearly died from Covid after she gave birth says she wants to become an intensive care nurse to support those who ""literally gave me my life back"". Ellie Wright, 21 and from Walsall, contracted the virus when she was 30 weeks pregnant in January 2021. She became seriously ill in hospital, fighting Covid and pneumonia, and baby Leo had to be delivered by C-section 10 weeks prematurely. Ellie was placed in an induced coma that lasted three weeks and remembers saying ""who's that?"" when she saw her son for the first time. Find out more about her story here. Shaun Bailey pictured at a party at Conservative HQ during lockdown London mayor Sadiq Khanhas called on assembly member Shaun Bailey to quit from all his remaining positions, after it emerged he attended a party during the 2020 December lockdown. Bailey, who finished second after Khan in the mayoral election, has already left his roles as chairman of two key committees. The mayor says apologies offered by Bailey are ""mealy-mouthed"" and made ""because he was caught out"". ""His resignation as an assembly member must surely now be an inevitability. Londoners deserve much better representatives than that,"" Khan says. Bailey, who earlier went to his first assembly meeting since mid-December, hasn't responded. Last month, it was revealed that he attended a gathering at the Conservative Campaign Headquarters on 14 December 2020. Meanwhile in the US, outdoor clothing makerCarhartt is facing calls for a boycottamong those who are against its vaccine mandate for staff. This is happening amid a fierce debate in the country over Covid vaccines, after the US Supreme Court said the government can't force large companies to mandate jabs. In a memo to staff, Carhartt leaders said the court's decision had not changed the company's requirements, which went into effect for most of their staff in early January. ""We put workplace safety at the very top of our priority listâ¯andâ¯the Supreme Court's recentâ¯ruling doesn't impact that core value,"" wrote Carhartt's chief executive Mark Valade. After copies of the message were circulated on social media, prominent conservative figures weighed in. Attorney Molly McCann, who has represented Donald Trump, wrote on Twitter. ""Boycott Carhartt until they break.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We've got a bit more reaction now to secondary school pupils in England no longer having to wear face coverings in classrooms. Kevin Sexton, head teacher of Chesterfield High School in Crosby, Merseyside, says he wants face masks to remain compulsory in classrooms until the spring, adding that schools did not get enough warning of the rule changes. Sexton tells the BBC that teachers had to work late last night to make arrangements for the change, which was announced yesterday, and that the workload is âtaking its tollâ. But Mike Hobday, from the National Deaf Children's Society, has welcomed the news. He says it will come as a ""huge relief to England's 45,000 deaf children, who tell us that face masks have left them struggling to learn and left out of conversations with their friends"". This morning, Health Secretary Sajid Javid defended the move, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while infections were high, case rates were falling nationally and that ministers had to consider the impact of mask-wearing on children's education. The number of Covid cases recorded in the UK is continuing to fall, with the total reported over the past seven days down by 32.8% on the previous week. However, the lag between people catching the virus and then becoming seriously ill means deaths are still rising. The weekly figure is up slightly by 1.8% on the previous week. The UK has reported 107,364 new Covid cases and 330 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  It's just been confirmed that some Covid restrictions are being eased
in Northern Ireland: Ministers in Northern Ireland have agreed to scrap the use of Covid passes in pubs, restaurants and cinemas from next Wednesday,BBC News NI understands. But proof of Covid status will still be needed in nightclubs, and indoor unseated and partially seated events with 500 or more people. First Minister Paul Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill are due to hold a news briefing shortly. We'll bring you the main updates here oryou can follow our Northern Ireland live page for more in-depth coverage. A union has expressed its anger after the government said people donât need to wear face masks at universities and colleges in England from next Thursday. Instead staff, students and visitors are being told they can choose to wear them ""voluntarily"" but masks will no longer be advised in lecture halls and classrooms, after Plan B measures end next week. Unions have described the move as ""irresponsible"". Jo Grady, University and College Union secretary, says while Covid cases remain high âbasic measures such as face masksâ¦ should continue to be in place"". Anastasia Karamalidou, a senior lecturer in criminology at the University of the West of England, Bristol, says the decision is âdisappointingâ, adding the âremoval of masks endangers student and staff physical and mental health"". While some may be celebrating the
rolling back of Covid restrictions in England, Bernie McGreavey in West
Yorkshire is not. Bernie, who has an inflammatory arthritic
condition that makes her clinically extremely vulnerable, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the changes
are ""really worrying"" for her and make her feel like a ""second-class
citizen"". Even before the changes, she had
to do a ""risk assessment"" before deciding to go somewhere, she says, ending
up sticking to places she knows are, for example, well-ventilated. ""Today, I've been out to a
local shopping centre with my niece,"" Bernie says, adding that most people were wearing masks. ""This time next week I will
probably not be going to that shopping centre, because the majority of people will
not be wearing masks."" Is now
the right time to drop restrictions? ""For me, it feels too
much too soon,"" Bernie says. Commuters at Waterloo station in London this morning As more people start to return to the office, Network Rail has reported an increase in passengers this morning. Figures show the number of people using its stations between 6:00 and 10.30 GMT was up 10% compared with the same period last week. Thatâs an increase from 275,000 to 303,000 people. But the statistics show daily passenger numbers had been increasing even before the guidance to work from home in England was lifted yesterday afternoon. Todayâs figure was just 1% higher compared with yesterday. As we've been reporting,ministers in Northern Ireland are considering plans to relax some Covid rules. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she is ""cautiously optimistic"" and while the pandemic is not over, she believes Northern Ireland has passed the peak of the Omicron wave. As a result, she says ministers believe they now have the ""space"" to reverse some of the curbs, which were introduced after Christmas to combat Omicron. However, she adds: ""It is a positive picture but I would ask people not to be complacent yet, we still have a journey to travel."" After the Stormont executive meets later, she says ministers hope to be able to say ""positive things that will be welcomed by both individuals and also by the hospitality sector"". First Minister Paul Givan has said he wants to see the use of Covid certification lifted entirely - but the BBC has been told Covid passes will still be required for entry to nightclubs. Breast screening is just one of many ways of picking up cancers People are being urged not to put off seeking help for worrying cancer symptomsbecause of pressures on the health service due to Covid. NHS England chiefs say record numbers were seen for check-ups before Omicron hit - and despite the current situation cancer is being prioritised. There have been nearly 50,000 fewer cancer diagnoses across the UK since the start of the pandemic, Macmillan Cancer Support say. This risks an increase in late-stage diagnoses, reducing survival chances. The plea comes as pressure on hospitals is starting to ease and the number of patients being admitted to hospital with Covid begins to fall. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Classes were suspended at Hong Kong's primary schools last Friday All secondary schools in Hong Kong are to close from
Monday because of rising Covid-19 infections, the city's education bureau has said. âThe epidemic
situation is getting severe,â it said, and advises that from next week, schools
âflexibly deploy various teaching modes and provide respective support to
sustain studentsâ learning at homeâ. Nursery and primary
school classes were already suspended in the city last Friday and Hong Kong has moved to impose new restrictions over the last couple of
weeks. On 7 Jan, bars
and gyms were ordered to closed, and a 6pm restaurant curfew was introduced.
Hong Kong has also this month introduced bans on flights from multiple
countries, including the UK. The government
has warned this week of âan imminent threat of both the Delta and Omicron
mutant strains spreading in the communityâ .
Sixteen local cases were recorded on Tuesday, two of unknown origins. Boris Johnson has said he has not seen any evidence to support claims the government has tried to blackmail its own MPswho have plotted to remove him as leader. William Wragg, one of those calling on the PM to resign over lockdown parties held at Downing Street, said rebels had faced ""pressures and intimidation"" from ministers. Christian Wakeford, who on Wednesday defected from the Conservatives to Labour, said he was threatened over funding for a school. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Rutherford Diagnostic Centre in Taunton, the prime minister said: ""What I am focused on is what we're doing to deal with the number one priority of the British people, which is coming through Covid."" The prime minister added that the government was looking ""absolutely ruthlessly"" at waiting lists. BBC Radio 4's Today programme has been speaking to Peter Marks, head of major nightclub firm Rekom
UK. He says he's happy he won't be having to ask customers in England for a Covid pass any more,with rules being ditched from next week. Marks says he's always believed nightclubs are ""no worse"" than
any other hospitality or indoor setting in terms of risk. But people are always
suggesting that clubs should be first to close, and last to open - or that they should face restrictions, he says. ""We've really got to get the confidence back in our customers,""
he says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
