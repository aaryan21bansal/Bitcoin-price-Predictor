"Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Sadie Sink in Stranger Things season four After enjoying a long reign as the king of streaming, Netflix faces a tough fight to keep its crown. It lost almost a million subscribers between April and July as more people decided to quit the service. The streaming giant has now lost members for two quarters in a row, but the drop was smaller than it feared. Asked what slowed the exodus, the firm's boss Reed Hastings, said: ""If there was a single thing, we might say 'Stranger Things.'"" The new season of the hit drama has been a phenomenal success, and may have helped stem the exodus of Netflix customers. The company reported its first subscriber loss since 2011 in April, news that was followed by hundreds of job cuts and a sharp drop in its share price. Rivals are challenging its dominance, while price hikes have taken a toll. Why some viewers are switching off Netflix Young people cut back on video streaming services Netflix and Microsoft team up for cheaper service The subscriber losses reported on Tuesday were the biggest in the firm's history, with the US and Canada seeing the highest number of cancellations in the past three months, followed by Europe. Guy Bisson, executive director at Ampere Analysis, said it was ""inevitable"" that Netflix would start to see its grip on the market loosen. ""When you're the leader, there's only one direction to go, especially when a large amount of competition launches, which is what Netflix has seen in the last couple of years,"" he said. It is a stark change for Netflix, which enjoyed years of seemingly unstoppable growth, as it revolutionised the way people around the world consumed entertainment. Its position as a global giant was cemented when the pandemic hit in 2020 and people, stuck at home with few other options for entertainment, flocked to monster hits like Squid Game and The Crown. But as pre-pandemic habits return, Netflix has struggled to attract new sign-ups - and maintain the loyalty of existing members, especially as the rising cost of living leads to people cutting back. The company also faces fierce competition from the likes of Apple TV, HBO Max, Amazon Prime and Disney+. Netflix was once the disruptor, making video rental stores like Blockbuster redundant. But the disruptor is fast becoming the disrupted. Netflix's move to make its service more expensive has also put off some customers. A ""standard"" plan in the US - which allows people in the same home to watch on two devices simultaneously - now costs $15.49, up from $14 in January and just $11 in 2019. In the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased since January by Â£1 a month to Â£6.99 and Â£10.99 respectively. In 2021 Squid Game became the most-watched series globally in Netflix history ""At some point, yes, they're going to reach a threshold where a significant number of people say enough is enough,"" Mr Bisson said. ""Because of the additional choice... price hikes are a more risky strategy."" For now, surveys suggest that Netflix is managing to lure back a higher share of deserters than its rivals. Many households also continue to identify it as the streaming option they would retain if forced to have only one. In all, the company had roughly 220 million subscribers at the end of June - still well north of its closest competition. But the company, long accustomed to posting double digit growth, is grappling with its most serious slowdown in years, with revenue in the April-June quarter of $7.9bn, up just 8.6% year-on-year. The firm's share price has dropped more than 60% so far this year, as investors sour on its prospects. ""Netflix's subscriber loss was expected but it remains a sore point for a company that is wholly dependent on subscription revenue from consumers,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Ross Benes. ""Netflix is still the leader in video streaming but unless it finds more franchises that resonate widely, it will eventually struggle to stay ahead of competitors that are after its crown."" Shares climbed more than 7% in after-hours trade on relief that the losses were not larger. The firm had warned it could lose as many as two million subscribers. Netflix has said it will jumpstart growth with a new ads-supported service and by clamping down on password sharing - which one study estimated was costing Netflix $6bn a year. It isalready charging more for sharing accountsin some countries in central and South America. It hopes to replicate this model around the world. However, the company has known about problems with passwords sharing for years, and has so far failed to find a solution. In its shareholder update, the company said it was ""encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America"". It said it expected its less expensive, ad-supported option to launch in early 2023, starting in ""a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant"". ""Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering,"" the company said. The ad service has the potential to attract both existing customers inclined to cancel over price hikes, as well as new households hesitant to commit to a subscription, Mr Bisson said. It should be possible for Netflix to make the same amount of money - or more - per user than it did by relying on subscriptions, he added. ""Assuming they get it right - and by getting it right I mean the price ... and the amount of advertising on it - then it's potentially a strong strategic move for them,"" he said. But he said Netflix's most critical task is ensuring it has strong material for people to watch - a job that has grown harder as it pushes to reach an increasingly broad audience. New sign-ups in the US, for example, are coming from an increasingly older crowd, with different tastes than the younger viewers who were early streaming converts. ""They're increasingly competing for that generalist audience, so the breadth of content that is needed becomes much wider and that's why I think people are saying 'there's now a lot of stuff I don't like',"" Mr Bisson said. ""It's a very big challenge."" Netflix needs ""more frequent hits"", said Eric Steinberg of Whip Media, adding that Netflix also has room to experiment staggering its releases to keep a hold on its subscribers. The company has already taken steps in that direction by releasing episodes of the fourth season of Stranger Things in two batches this year, but the ""pressure is on"" he said. ""They don't have the sandpit to themselves anymore,"" he said. ""In an inflationary environment like the one we're in and also great programming [at the competition], people are going to re-evaluate how much they're willing to pay.""

"Doctors in England will be given mandatory training to better treat female medical conditions under wider plans to improve women's health. Free access to NHS fertility treatment will be expanded and there will be more funding for mobile breast cancer screening. The government said the changes, part of its women's health strategy, were based on responses from 100,000 people. But critics said more must be done to close the ""gender gap"" in NHS services. The government opened acall for evidence in Spring 2021,externalto collect views on women's health from members of the public, academics, charities and campaigners. Women in England live on average four years longer than men but spend more of their life in poor health, which can limit their ability to work and participate in day-to-day activities. Sexism has previously been blamed for a disproportionate rise in gynaecology waiting lists andfailings around the prescribing of hormone replacement therapy(HRT). Sleepless nights for women due to HRT shortage HRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK women ""We heard from women that the system doesn't listen to them when they come forward and ask for help with their healthcare needs,"" Minister for Women's Health Maria Caulfield told BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour. ""These are women often juggling jobs, young families and caring responsibilities, and unless we make it work from them they will continue to face barriers seeking help."" The government said that individuals responding to the consultation felt there was a lack of understanding among some medical professionals about health conditions which only affect women. From the 2024/25 academic year, mandatory teaching and assessment specifically relating to women's health will be introduced for all medical students and new doctors. The government said it also plans to: Provide Â£10 million funding for breast cancer screening to pay for 25 mobile units in areas with low testing rates Update guidance around the treatment of severe endometriosis, a debilitating condition which affects one in 10 women where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes Introduce a pregnancy loss certificate in England, providing legal recognition when a baby dies within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy Encourage the expansion of dedicated women's health hubs so maternity, gynaecology and sexual health services can be accessed in a single place Miriam Levin, health and care programme director at the charity Engage Britain, welcomed ""any steps"" to tackle health inequalities, but said the government had to ensure that women's concerns would be properly listened to. This video can not be played 'You've either got a vagina or a voice' -  Sharon shares her experiences with other women at her local salon ""We hear stories of women suffering with a vast range of problems, from endometriosis to menopause, and often feeling as though they're dismissed or not taken seriously by some health professionals,"" she said. ""The only way this strategy can succeed is for the government to take a fresh approach - by hearing what female patients have to say, then putting their experiences at the very heart of delivering it."" Under the plans, there will also be changes to the rules around fertility treatment in England: In the future, couples considering IVF should be able to see how NHS provision in their local area compares with other parts of the country. It will be possible to access NHS fertility treatment if one half of a couple has already had a child from a previous relationship, something that has proved difficult in much of England. Female same-sex couples will no longer have to pay for artificial insemination at a private clinic to prove they are having difficulty conceiving before being able to access IVF services on the NHS. Sarah Norcross, director of the fertility charity PET, welcomed the decision to remove some barriers to IVF access but said it was ""incredibly disappointing"" that there was no plan to tackle the ""postcode lottery"" of treatment in different parts of England. ""The commitment to improve transparency in relation to the availability of IVF does not equate to giving women the chance to try to have a baby,"" she said. Health Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""Our health and care system only works if it works for everyone. It is not right that 51% of our population are disadvantaged in accessing the care they need, simply because of their sex.""

"More than 115,000 Royal Mail workers have voted to go on strike in a dispute over pay. Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed the action on Tuesday after ballot papers were sent out three weeks ago. Any strike dates are yet to be decided but the CWU said if a walk out goes ahead, it could amount to the biggest ever action taken by its members. Royal Mail said it was ""disappointed"" by the vote. ""In the event of industrial action, we have contingency plans to minimise customer disruption and will work to keep people, businesses and the country connected,"" a statement said. The CWU is the latest of several unions to ballot for strikes in recent weeks as the cost of living soars. Workers on the railways and at airports are also in pay disputes with employers, with prices for goods in the UK rising at the fastest rate in 40 years. The union said postal workers ""will not budge"" until they receive a ""dignified, proper pay rise"". Responding to a tweet in which Royal Mail said it was ""disappointed"" at the vote, the CWU tweeted ""dry your eyes mate"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some 97.6% of members from a 77% turnout voted in favour of striking. The union has demanded Royal Mail group enters into negotiations to secure a ""straight, no-strings pay increase for workers"". Why is everyone going on strike? Royal Mail warns it will put prices up again Dave Ward, CWU general secretary said there will now be a ""small window"" for talks to avoid walkouts before strike dates are set. But he said Royal Mail's chief executive and board ""should seriously consider their futures"" as the ballot was ""also a vote of no confidence"". ""While bosses rake in Â£758m in profit and shareholders take Â£400m, workers are expected to take a serious real-terms pay cut,"" he added. ""Postal workers won't accept their living standards being hammered by bosses who are typical of business leaders today - overpaid, underqualified, out of their depth."" Royal Mail said it had offered workers a ""deal worth up to 5.5% for CWU grade colleagues, the biggest increase we have offered for many years, which the CWU rejected"". ""Despite nearly three months of talks, the CWU have not engaged in any meaningful discussion on the changes we need to make to adapt,"" a statement added. It is understood that after talks ended between the CWU and Royal Mail, the company announced it would give members a non-conditional 2% pay increase backdated to 1 April. The union has been told a 3.5% is available subject to further talks and agreements, which would total a 5.5% rise. Terry Pullinger, deputy CWU general secretary, said the union wanted negotiations with Royal Mail, but claimed this was ""rejected"", leaving reps with ""no choice but to fight their disgraceful imposition"". Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May and is forecast to go higher later this year. But while there have been calls for pay rises, there are concerns thathigher wages to cope with the current cost of living could fuel further inflation.

"A US judge has ordered that Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk go to trial in October, a blow to the world's richest man who had asked for a delay. Mr Musk walked away from his $44bn (Â£36bn) bid to buy Twitter earlier in July, prompting the company to sue him. Twitter hopes that the court will order Mr Musk to complete the takeover at the agreed price of $54.20 per share. The tech billionaire has accused Twitter of withholding information about fake accounts. His legal team has called for the trial to be held early next year due to its complexities, but Twitter asked for a September date. On Tuesday, a judge in the state of Delaware agreed with the company and said a delay to the trial would cast a ""cloud of uncertainty"". ""Delay threatens irreparable harm,"" Chancellor Kathaleen St Jude McCormick said. ""The longer the delay, the greater the risk."" Who is Elon Musk? Why did Musk get cold feet on Twitter? The lawsuit accused Mr Musk of a ""long list"" of violations ahead of the potential merger and argued that he had ""cast a pall"" over the company. At the hearing on Tuesday, Twitter's lead counsel William Savitt said the ongoing uncertainty about whether the takeover would go forward or not ""inflicts harm on Twitter everyday"". There is a theory that Musk still wants to buy Twitter, he's just trying to knock down the price. If that's the case, his lawyers are spectacularly good poker players. Mr Musk's legal team wanted this trial to happen next year. They claimed they needed more time to dig through data on spam accounts. Clearly though this is also a stalling strategy. They repeated Mr Musk's assertion that Twitter may have more fake accounts than it claims. That is a hugely damaging accusation - and a strange thing to say if Mr Musk were still interested in purchasing the company at a lower price. Twitter's reputation has already taken a huge hit. Twitter's revenues are almost entirely based on ads. The fewer real people on the platform, the less money it can make. Bots don't have wallets. That's why Twitter wants this process sorted quickly. By far the best case scenario for the company is that Mr Musk buys it for $54.20 a share - and that it happens as soon as possible. That's why this judgement is good news for Twitter. The judge sided with Twitter's lawyers - that a ruling needed to be reached quickly. It heaps more pressure on Mr Musk, who is faced with the bizarre prospect of having to buy a company he no longer wishes to acquire. However, in practice this will likely put more pressure on Mr Musk to settle, pay Twitter some money, and move on. ""Musk has been and remains contractually obligated to use his best efforts to close the deal,"" Mr Savitt said. ""What he's doing is exactly the opposite. It's sabotage."" A lawyer for Mr Musk, Andrew Rossman, argued that he remains one of Twitter's most significant shareholders. He said the case should go to trial next year on a ""sensible"" schedule that would give both sides time to prepare. Since Mr Musk began questioning the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter's platform in May, the company has seen its share prices fall from highs of $50 per share. The company's shares currently stand at about $39.45 - well below the $54.20 per share at which it hopes to close the merger. A self-described ""free speech absolutist"", Mr Musk has vowed to ease restrictions on content if the company were under his ownership. He has also called for the company to be more open about how it presents tweets to users and how tweets are promoted to larger audiences.

Emma Grayson, 22, said she felt ""very scared"" and ""uncomfortable"" during the incident on Sunday evening. Ms Grayson videoed some of the encounter and later posted it on the social media app TikTok. She said she wanted to raise awareness of the type of situation she and her friends often find themselves in. The man approached her on Newport Road in Cardiff at about 21:00 BST on Sunday. The women groped and laughed at in the street Street harassment 'part of puberty' In the video, which the Cardiff Metropolitan University fashion marketing student titled ""NO means NO"", the man keeps propositioning and following her, despite her repeatedly saying she wants to be left alone. She filmed about a minute of the ten-minute long encounter, during which he said things to her such as: ""I saw you for the first time and liked you"", ""I have a lot of money"" and ""How much do you want?"" Emma was approached walking along Newport Road, which leads from the city centre Emma said: ""It was a very scary situation because I didn't know if he had anything on him like a weapon. ""I don't know this guy so I couldn't just assume that he didn't have anything on him. ""It was best for me just to stay calm and that's how I dealt with it.

Emma said she felt particularly uncomfortable when the man came close to her face and asked: ""why don't you want to talk to me?"". She said, in her experience, it was ""an extreme case of harassment"" but generally it is a problem she and her friends have experienced many times before.

""Because of social media, it has got more exposure, people are speaking up on it and I think it's important that people tell their peers how it makes them feel,"" she said. ""But I have had it from all age groups, it doesn't matter how old or how young people are. It needs to be talked about.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Graham Brady announces Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race Liz Truss has narrowed the gap with Tory leadership rival Penny Mordaunt, as they battle to secure a place in the run-off vote among members. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak again topped the latest MPs' ballot with 118 votes, suggesting he is likely to secure a spot in the final two places. Ms Mordaunt came second with 92, only six votes ahead of Ms Truss with 86. Kemi Badenoch, who came last with 59 votes, has been knocked out of the contest. The three remaining candidates face a further vote by MPs on Wednesday to decide who will make the final two. Voting will then be thrown open to 160,000 Tory party members to pick the winner, who will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister on 5 September. The surprising joviality of Tory leadership votes Who could be the next prime minister? BBC to host TV debate for last two Tory candidates Contenders need to bag 119 votes from Tory MPs to get into the run-off, suggesting former chancellor Mr Sunak is likely to secure a place. Foreign secretary Liz Truss closed the gap on Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt in Tuesday's vote, gaining 15 more MP votes to Mordaunt's gain of 10. The pair will now go all out to grab the votes of those MPs who backed Ms Badenoch, as they bid to secure a place in the run-off. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is backing Ms Truss, said the result showed she ""has the momentum"" and had garnered support from a wide range of Conservative MPs. Tory MP Maria Miller, a Mordaunt supporter, said her candidate would offer a ""fresh choice"" for members and said her campaign would now focus on wooing Badenoch supporters. Little known beyond Tory circles at the start of the race, former equalities minister Ms Badenoch has been the breakthrough candidate of the contest. She won support and gained attention with her straight-talking approach and emphasis on cultural issues that have divided the party in recent years. Her departure from the contest will trigger a scramble among remaining candidates to secure the support of the 59 MPs backing her on Tuesday. Badenoch backer Ben Bradley predicted her voters could go ""in all directions,"" and he had not yet decided whom to back in Wednesday's vote. It comes as: The BBC announced it willbroadcast a live TV debatewith the final two candidates on Monday Ms Mordaunt pledged to scrap house building targets for councils, and channel development away from ""precious greenfields"" Ms Truss promised that if elected she would increase UK defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday evening has been cancelled, after Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss declined to take part. Instead, the remaining hopefuls will look to garner support from Tory MPs during a hustings hosted by the Onward think tank and the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs representing seats in the north of England. The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second. Rishi Sunak only gained three votes, showing that while he's been in front from the start it's not a runaway lead. It's a very tight race and at this point, impossible to call.

"One boy was placed with a company which moves children between narrowboats and caravans similar to this one Children in care are still being illegally placed in unregulated homes in England, including on narrowboats and in caravans, BBC News has learned. We found a 12-year-old boy was placed at a campsite for weeks, more than 100 miles from his siblings and school. Such placements were banned for under-16s, but there are concerns exemptions for holidays are being exploited. The Department for Education says it is Ofsted's job to prosecute companies running unlawful children's homes. Local authorities are breaking the law by placing children under the age of 16 in unregulated homes. It is also illegal for companies to run unregistered children's homes, although there are exemptions allowing firms to run placements that are not regulated, such as for holidays or leisure activities. A BBC News investigation has found such placements are being widely used. We found at least 120 children, including one child aged 10, had been placed in unregulated homes. Ofsted says these are not meant to allow the child to be moved between temporary placements, but there is no law or guidance defining these activities. Tents have previously been used by other companies. A 14-year-old boy was placed in this unregulated placement above a shop in Portsmouth The 12-year-old boy was recently placed in unregulated care for at least six weeks with a company that moves children between its narrowboats and caravans. Despite being under the care of Worcestershire County Council, he was placed in a caravan on a campsite, in Lancashire, more than 100 miles away from his siblings and his school.â¯ The boy had been moved between a number of children's homes before his most recent home was closed at short notice for staffing reasons. He was then moved into a caravan run by Bear Care Services. In contrast, his brother has been in a stable foster placement for years. When contacted by the BBC, the company said the placement was needed because of a ""massive shortage of registered provision"".â¯ It said it was operating lawfully because placements in mobile homes, such as caravans and narrowboats, do not need to be registered. However, Worcestershire County Council did not deny it was breaking the law in placing the child in an unregulated setting. It described the accommodation as a ""crisis"" placement, despite the length of his stay. The government said there was no such thing in law. The BBC has also learned of another case where a 14-year-old known to be at risk of jumping out of windows was placed without safeguards in an unregulated home above a shop. In total, the BBC received responses from 141 local authorities in England to Freedom of Information requests. More than 50 admitted placing at least 120 children in unregulated homes.â¯ Many refused to provide the real number of children placed in unregulated homes because they said the data was the personal information of the child. Some placements include restrictions on the movements and freedoms of children for their own welfare, which are occasionally granted by a High Court judge when there is no suitable accommodation available. This means highly vulnerable children are placed in homes with the least scrutiny of standards. Katharine Sacks-Jones, chief executive of Become, a charity for children in care, said the situation was ""a national scandal"". ""It's just tragic to hear that you've discovered so many children who are being placed in settings which are unsuitable for them"", she added. Carolyne Willow, director of the children's charity, Article 39, added: ""A young child moving from caravan to caravan defies understanding of what a holiday is. ""The government needs to amend the legislation to make it absolutely clear what constitutes holiday accommodation for children in care."" Unregulated children's homes banned from September Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Children as young as 11 illegally housed In 2019, BBC News revealed that an11-year-old had been placed in unregulated care, and found that older childrenfaced organised abusein homes. When the government announced its ban, Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson said: ""The BBC highlighted something that just needed to be changed."" But while placing under-16s in an unregulated home is now unlawful, no legal action has been taken against any council. The Department for Education declined to answer whether it had failed to properly legislate against the use of unregulated placements.â¯ In a statement, it said: ""Ofsted can prosecute providers operating as children's homes without the required registration and it holds local councils to account for the quality of care and accommodation they provide to vulnerable children"", it added.â¯â¯ But BBC News has learned that Ofsted has not brought any prosecutions against companies for running an unregistered children's home.â¯â¯Ofsted says it has not been provided with additional powers it was promised, such as the ability to fine providers directly. It said that local authorities faced ""significant challenges"" in finding the right homes. Have you had an experience of unregulated homes?

"This video can not be played Emma Grayson posted a video on TikTok of a man who followed and propositioned her A video showing a student being harassed by a man on a Cardiff street has been watched more than two million times. Emma Grayson, 22, said she felt ""very scared"" and ""uncomfortable"" during the incident on Sunday evening. Ms Grayson videoed some of the encounter and later posted it on the social media app TikTok. She said she wanted to raise awareness of the type of situation she and her friends often find themselves in. The man approached her on Newport Road in Cardiff at about 21:00 BST on Sunday. The women groped and laughed at in the street Street harassment 'part of puberty' In the video, which the Cardiff Metropolitan University fashion marketing student titled ""NO means NO"", the man keeps propositioning and following her, despite her repeatedly saying she wants to be left alone. She filmed about a minute of the ten-minute long encounter, during which he said things to her such as: ""I saw you for the first time and liked you"", ""I have a lot of money"" and ""How much do you want?"" Emma was approached walking along Newport Road, which leads from the city centre Emma said: ""It was a very scary situation because I didn't know if he had anything on him like a weapon. ""I don't know this guy so I couldn't just assume that he didn't have anything on him. ""It was best for me just to stay calm and that's how I dealt with it. I don't think I realised how bad it was until I watched it back."" Since she put the video on Tiktok, it has had over two million views but Emma says she has been surprised by the negative comments some people have made on the video. Cardiff cyclist confronts driver over 'disgusting' comments Is harassment making women quit the gym? ""People were saying 'she must have been wearing a skimpy outfit', 'she was asking for it'. ""From that short clip of a minute, I don't know how people have assumed that stuff. ""I didn't expect them to comment on that. I thought they would comment on his behaviour, not mine."" Emma said she felt particularly uncomfortable when the man came close to her face and asked: ""why don't you want to talk to me?"". She said, in her experience, it was ""an extreme case of harassment"" but generally it is a problem she and her friends have experienced many times before. She added that she sometimes finds herself crossing the road to avoid certain situations. ""It happens a lot, not just in Cardiff, our whole lives. Since the age of 14 even. Emma Grayson was subjected to a 10-minute stream of harassment ""I can vividly remember being in my school uniform and people cat calling me, shouting 'you're beautiful', just inappropriate things, especially at a young age. ""Even now, it's all the time really for me and my friends,"" she said. Emma hopes her experience can be part of a wider conversation about inappropriate behaviour. ""Because of social media, it has got more exposure, people are speaking up on it and I think it's important that people tell their peers how it makes them feel,"" she said. ""But I have had it from all age groups, it doesn't matter how old or how young people are. It needs to be talked about.""

"With a heatwave predicted to bring temperatures above 41C to parts of the UK over the next few days, how can the nation keep cool and carry on? Temperatures could be thehighest ever recorded in the UKthis week, beating the current record temperature from 2019, when a high of 38.7C was recorded in Cambridge. The Met Office has issued ared extreme heat warning,externalfor many parts of England, from London and the south-east up to York and Manchester. Amber warnings are also currently in place across the rest of England, all of Wales, and parts of Scotland. For those hoping to be given a day off, unfortunately, there are currentlyno laws in the UK,externalabout when it is too hot to work. Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. It can, however, be too cold to work. Government guidance recommends a minimum working temperature of 16C (61F), or 13C, if employees are doing physical work. As avoiding work in the heat isn't an option, then there's the inevitable dilemma of what to wear. But can you wear flip-flops to work?Staff should have a relaxed dress code during the heatwave, union says. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

If you can't see the calculator,tap here,external That's the million dollar question. On sticky nights, drifting off can seem impossible. How to sleep in hot weather What you should - and shouldn't do - to stay cool Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Send your photos/videos of the hot weather toyourpics@bbc.co.uk A big part of the problem is humidity, which makes it hard for sweat to evaporate. To try and keep your bedroom as cool as possible, shut your blinds or curtains during the day - although doing so with metallic blinds and dark curtains could make the room hotter. You could also open windows on the shady side of your home and close them on the sunny side - and then open all the windows before going to bed to get a thorough breeze. That's not an option open to everyone, so an electric fan can be a handy substitute. A fan will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating. Other recommendations include: Putting reflective material or shades outside bedroom windows Having a lukewarm shower before bed Using thin cotton sheets Wearing lightweight materials for bed as they can keep you cooler - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners Putting your sheets in the freezer for a spell before you go to bed When it comes to children, the NHS says a cool bath before bedtime can help. Pyjamas and bedclothes should be kept to a minimum, and if a baby kicks off its bedcovers during the night then they could sleep in just a nappy - babies sleep most comfortably when their room is between 16C (61F) and 20C (68F). As if you don't have enough to think about with a baby, a heatwave brings an added risk of dehydration, sunburn and sunstroke. The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight, and older infants should be kept out of the sun as much as possible, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Sun cream with a high sun protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids and the NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual, but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. As tempting as it might be to strip off, you may be at greater risk of sunburn which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. It's best to choose light colours over dark - which absorb heat more - and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will also help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. This is fast becoming the first question asked when extreme weather events strike - and the answer remains the same. It is almost impossible to say that a specific event, like the current hot spell, is caused by global heating. However there are some very strong connections to human-induced warming that increase the likelihood of such weather. Last year's blazing summer in the UKwas said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likelybecause of emissions from human activity. And the Met Office also said warm spells in the UK have more than doubled in length - increasing from 5.3 days in the 1961-1990 period to more than 13 days in the decade from 2008 to 2017. The heatwave also follows on from a previousrecord-breaking June across Europe, which was 1C above the long term trend and an incredible 3C above the average from 1850-1900. When researchers carried out a rapid analysis to see the impact of climate change on the June heatwave,they concluded it was made at least five times more likelyby warming. It may well be that the current period of extremely hot weather is purely down to natural variability, said BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath. But even if so, the fingerprints of fossil fuel burning are heavily influencing the background - and making such events much more likely. Strawberries are among the foods recommended during a heatwave Hydration is key. Our bodies sweat more in hot weather, so it is really important to restock lost water levels. Don't rely on your physical thirst to judge how dehydrated you are as it's not a very good indicator(urine colour,externalis better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. And try not to consume too much alcohol. The NHS says good drink options include water, lower-fat milks and tea and coffee. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down.,external More tips on what to eat in a heatwave from BBC Good Food,external Dogs in particular struggle in the hot weather because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do, and those breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating. The RSPCA has a series of tips,externalfor keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. These include avoiding leaving animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, which, even just for a short while, can be fatal due to rising temperatures. It also says it is best to walk a dog early in the morning or late in the evening when it is cooler, as paws can burn on a hot pavement. Exercise can also increase the risk of heatstroke. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer For those pets kept in cages, hutches, fish tanks or other enclosures, they should be kept out of direct sunlight. And it's not just humans who need sun cream, it might also be beneficial to apply some to your pet. Animals' exposed spots, such as ears and noses, are vulnerable to sunburn and - just like people - sun damage can lead to skin cancer. The Blue Cross saywhite cats are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer,externalfrom sunlight exposure than others. This video can not be played Dog owners have been urged to check pavements using the ""seven-second test"" This video can not be played Humidity explainer Most people in the UK aren't used to such extreme temperatures, which can cause heat exhaustion and, more seriously, heatstroke. Signs of heat exhaustion can include tiredness or weakness, feeling faint or dizzy, having muscle cramps or feeling sick. If left untreated, the more serious symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation and even a loss of consciousness. Those suffering the signs of heat exhaustion should go to a cool place with air conditioning or shade, use a cool, wet sponge or flannel and drink fluids - ideally water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. NHS guidance on dealing with heatstroke,external If you choose to exercise, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. Aim to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. The risk of sunburn depends on how sensitive your skin is, and how strong the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays are. The UV index will vary, depending on where you are in the world, the time of year, what the weather is like, the time of day, and how high up you are compared to sea level. During the UK's summer months, the sun's UV rays are strongest between 11:00 and 15:00. Cancer Research UK suggests,externalusing a simple ""shadow rule"" to estimate the strength of the sun. It suggests that if your shadow is shorter than your height, the sun's UV rays are strong - and you are therefore more likely to burn. How much sun cream to use and what to do if you burn There are lots of ""extended wear"" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use ""once a day"", or claiming to last for eight hours. But dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a ""satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing"" and that it should be reapplied at least every two hours, no matter what SPF it is. There are lots of places that rate sunscreen brands, including consumer websiteWhich?,external. However,the British Association of Dermatologists,external(BAD) says in general you should look for two ratings on bottles of sun creams. The sun emits two types of ultraviolet rays - UVA (most commonly responsible for premature ageing and wrinkles) and UVB (which causes most sunburn). The BAD says you need to be protected from both. The sun protection factor (SPF) offers guidance on a cream's protection against UVB rays, while a star system indicates the level of protection against UVA rays.

Forecasters say temperatures should drop on Wednesday to more normal levels for the time of year. An ice cream van at Luss was doing a roaring trade in the warm weather Most of Scotland saw high temperatures on Monday, with Edinburgh and Aberdeenshire passing the 30C mark. The heatwave continued overnight with a high of 20.5C (68.9F) at Dundrennan, Kirkcudbrightshire, just 0.4C off the Scottish record of 20.9 C (69.6F) registered on 26 July 2019. And the temperatures continued to build through the morning with the mercury in the Scottish Borders rising into the low 30s by lunchtime. Unofficial weather stations were picking up temperatures of 35-36C mid-afternoon before the 19-year record was beaten by 1.9C. Mark Wilson, of the Met Office, said it was ""officially the highest temperature recorded in Scotland since records began"". The mercury rose higher than it has ever gone in the south of Scotland Elsewhere in Scotland the highest temperatures were recorded at Eskdalemuir (32.3C) and Threave (31.2C), both in Dumfries and Galloway, earlier on Tuesday. Records were broken across the UK, with barometers hitting hit 40.3C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, at 16:00 BST. In Wales, Hawarden in Flintshire registered 36.2C, provisionally the second highest temperature on record in Wales, but below Monday's 37.1C. Met Office chief of science and technology Prof Stephen Belcher said exceeding 40C was ""virtually impossible"" in an undisrupted climate, but due to climate change ""driven by greenhouse gasses"" such extreme temperatures had become a reality. Are soaring temperatures linked to climate change? Should Scotland be worried about heatwaves? He said if there continued to be high emissions ""we could see temperatures like this every three years"". The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) warned the wildfire risk in southern and eastern parts of Scotland had been raised to ""very high"". FRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Bruce Farquharson said: ""At this time of year, the ground vegetation is a combination of green growth, with a relatively high moisture content, and dead vegetation lying on top, which can easily ignite and spread quickly over a large area."" Farm workers joined firefighters in creating a fire break to extinguish a large blaze in a field at Hadden Farm near Kelso on Tuesday afternoon. Allow Twitter content?

"Patty from Arkansas was among those enjoying the balmy conditions in Orkney While temperatures soar torecord breaking levels across many parts of the UK- there are some corners escaping the heatwave - including Orkney. Look up ""balmy"" in the dictionary, and it'll say something like ""mild or temperate"". Just at the moment, it might as well go on to say ""see Orkney"", with top temperatures of about 20C expected on Tuesday. Which is pretty good. But nothing like the 34C predicted in the Scottish borders. Or the 40.2C recorded at Heathrow in London earlier. Fair to say some people here feel the Orkney islands are missing out. One woman told me she's feeling chilly. ""I've still got a vest on"", she giggled. But others are revelling in the conditions. George and Alison Reid chose a nice (but not too hot) day to get married in Kirkwall New bride Alison Reid has just married George at the Kirkwall and St Ola Town Hall. As friends showered them with confetti, she tells me she owns an ice cream shop, and she's hoping it'll be doing a roaring trade while she's otherwise engaged. Follow the latest on the UK heatwave Patty from Arkansas was tucking into an Orkney ice cream, and musing on temperatures back at home that were already over 37C before she left the USA to come to Scotland. And a group of visitors from Vienna had sought out a shady table outside Kirkwall's ""Daily Scoop"", to plan their four days in Orkney and enjoy a cold drink. They said they were loving the weather - so long as it doesn't rain. Susanna, Michaela and Susanna from Austria said the conditions were good - with the rain holding off Jodie(mum), Reagan (left) and Yara enjoying a day at Scapa Beach, just outside the centre of Kirkwall But why aren't the Northern Isles getting the record breaking temperatures that are hitting so much of the rest of mainland England and Scotland - collectively known in Orkney as ""south""? BBC Scotland weather presenter Joy Dunlop toldBBC Radio Orkney,externalthat ""exceptionally hot air from North Africa and the Sahara has been lingering, and over the last few days a southerly air flow has been drawing this very hot air northwards throughout the UK. ""Neither Orkneynor Shetlandhas experienced these exceptionally high temperatures, due to this very hot air not quite making its way far north enough."" She added: ""Your weather is being steered by a low pressure system to the north west, with a series of weather fronts moving in bringing more in the way of unsettled conditions, rain and a fresher air flow.""

"Vladimir Putin met his Iranian and Turkish counterparts in Tehran on Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin met Turkish and Iranian leaders in Tehran on Tuesday - only his second foreign trip since he launched the invasion of Ukraine in February. Unblocking Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea was high on the agenda - Mr Putin said progress had been made. The civil war in Syria was also discussed, with Turkey and Russia historically backing opposing sides. The summit was a chance for Mr Putin to show he still has international allies. Speaking after his meeting with the Russian president, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran and Moscow should strengthen their ties, and suggested that the West was to blame for the war in Ukraine. ""If you did not take the initiative, the other side would have caused the war with its own initiative,"" Mr Khamenei told Mr Putin. The US said the Russian leader's visit to Iran showed how isolated Russia has become in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Invading your neighbour, a sovereign independent country, tends to lose you friends. And Russia's lost plenty after invading Ukraine. In the West Moscow has achieved pariah status. But the Kremlin is keen to show that international sanctions have failed to isolate Russia, the world's largest country, and that some of its friends are sticking around. Like Turkey and Iran. Russia will use the three-way summit on Syria to try to demonstrate it retains powerful allies and geo-political influence. But we're not talking BFF (best friends forever). Turkey and Iran are also Russia's rivals. Turkey and Russia are on opposing sides in Syria and in Libya; they are competing for influence in the South Caucasus; Turkish combat drones have been supporting the Ukrainian military. As for Iran, it's competing with Russia in global energy markets. True, Russia, Turkey and Iran do have some common interests. But that is no guarantee of  long-lasting friendship. In Tehran, Mr Putin also held his first face-to-face meeting since the start of the war with the leader of a Nato country, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Despite being a key member of the Western military alliance, Turkey has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow, with Mr Erdogan's government seeking to play the role of mediator. Most recently, Ankara has been trying to negotiate an end to the grain blockade in the Black Sea, which is stopping millions of tonnes of desperately needed grain from leaving Ukraine and being delivered to countries around the world. Russia's Black Sea fleet is said to be stopping any shipments getting in or out, and the BBC has documentedmounting evidence that Moscow's forces have stolen and exported Ukrainian grain.Other routes have been heavily mined. On Tuesday, Mr Putin said progress had been made on the issue, and thanked Mr Erdogan for mediating the talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Later the Russian president told journalists that Moscow would facilitate the export of Ukrainian grain, if ""all restrictions related to air deliveries for the export of Russian grain"" were lifted. The three countries' leaders also discussed the long-running war in Syria, with Iran and Russia supporting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey backing rebel forces. Turkey has threatened to launch a fresh offensive in northern Syria against US-backed Kurdish militants, a move which both Iran and Russia oppose. The operation is part of Mr Erdogan's plans to create a 30km (20 mile) safe zone along Turkey's border with Syria. Mr Erdogan said he expects support from Russia and Iran ""in its fight against terrorism"". Last week, the UN Security Council agreed to re-authorise cross-border deliveries of aid to rebel-held Syria for six months after Russia had initially blocked a proposal for a one-year extension.

Ms Grayson videoed some of the encounter and later posted it on the social media app TikTok.

Emma was approached walking along Newport Road, which leads from the city centre Emma said: ""It was a very scary situation because I didn't know if he had anything on him like a weapon.

"Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Sadie Sink in Stranger Things season four After enjoying a long reign as the king of streaming, Netflix faces a tough fight to keep its crown. It lost almost a million subscribers between April and July as more people decided to quit the service. The streaming giant has now lost members for two quarters in a row, but the drop was smaller than it feared. Asked what slowed the exodus, the firm's boss Reed Hastings, said: ""If there was a single thing, we might say 'Stranger Things.'"" The new season of the hit drama has been a phenomenal success, and may have helped stem the exodus of Netflix customers. The company reported its first subscriber loss since 2011 in April, news that was followed by hundreds of job cuts and a sharp drop in its share price. Rivals are challenging its dominance, while price hikes have taken a toll. Why some viewers are switching off Netflix Young people cut back on video streaming services Netflix and Microsoft team up for cheaper service The subscriber losses reported on Tuesday were the biggest in the firm's history, with the US and Canada seeing the highest number of cancellations in the past three months, followed by Europe. Guy Bisson, executive director at Ampere Analysis, said it was ""inevitable"" that Netflix would start to see its grip on the market loosen. ""When you're the leader, there's only one direction to go, especially when a large amount of competition launches, which is what Netflix has seen in the last couple of years,"" he said. It is a stark change for Netflix, which enjoyed years of seemingly unstoppable growth, as it revolutionised the way people around the world consumed entertainment. Its position as a global giant was cemented when the pandemic hit in 2020 and people, stuck at home with few other options for entertainment, flocked to monster hits like Squid Game and The Crown. But as pre-pandemic habits return, Netflix has struggled to attract new sign-ups - and maintain the loyalty of existing members, especially as the rising cost of living leads to people cutting back. The company also faces fierce competition from the likes of Apple TV, HBO Max, Amazon Prime and Disney+. Netflix was once the disruptor, making video rental stores like Blockbuster redundant. But the disruptor is fast becoming the disrupted. Netflix's move to make its service more expensive has also put off some customers. A ""standard"" plan in the US - which allows people in the same home to watch on two devices simultaneously - now costs $15.49, up from $14 in January and just $11 in 2019. In the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased since January by Â£1 a month to Â£6.99 and Â£10.99 respectively. In 2021 Squid Game became the most-watched series globally in Netflix history ""At some point, yes, they're going to reach a threshold where a significant number of people say enough is enough,"" Mr Bisson said. ""Because of the additional choice... price hikes are a more risky strategy."" For now, surveys suggest that Netflix is managing to lure back a higher share of deserters than its rivals. Many households also continue to identify it as the streaming option they would retain if forced to have only one. In all, the company had roughly 220 million subscribers at the end of June - still well north of its closest competition. But the company, long accustomed to posting double digit growth, is grappling with its most serious slowdown in years, with revenue in the April-June quarter of $7.9bn, up just 8.6% year-on-year. The firm's share price has dropped more than 60% so far this year, as investors sour on its prospects. ""Netflix's subscriber loss was expected but it remains a sore point for a company that is wholly dependent on subscription revenue from consumers,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Ross Benes. ""Netflix is still the leader in video streaming but unless it finds more franchises that resonate widely, it will eventually struggle to stay ahead of competitors that are after its crown."" Shares climbed more than 7% in after-hours trade on relief that the losses were not larger. The firm had warned it could lose as many as two million subscribers. Netflix has said it will jumpstart growth with a new ads-supported service and by clamping down on password sharing - which one study estimated was costing Netflix $6bn a year. It isalready charging more for sharing accountsin some countries in central and South America. It hopes to replicate this model around the world. However, the company has known about problems with passwords sharing for years, and has so far failed to find a solution. In its shareholder update, the company said it was ""encouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America"". It said it expected its less expensive, ad-supported option to launch in early 2023, starting in ""a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant"". ""Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering,"" the company said. The ad service has the potential to attract both existing customers inclined to cancel over price hikes, as well as new households hesitant to commit to a subscription, Mr Bisson said. It should be possible for Netflix to make the same amount of money - or more - per user than it did by relying on subscriptions, he added. ""Assuming they get it right - and by getting it right I mean the price ... and the amount of advertising on it - then it's potentially a strong strategic move for them,"" he said. But he said Netflix's most critical task is ensuring it has strong material for people to watch - a job that has grown harder as it pushes to reach an increasingly broad audience. New sign-ups in the US, for example, are coming from an increasingly older crowd, with different tastes than the younger viewers who were early streaming converts. ""They're increasingly competing for that generalist audience, so the breadth of content that is needed becomes much wider and that's why I think people are saying 'there's now a lot of stuff I don't like',"" Mr Bisson said. ""It's a very big challenge."" Netflix needs ""more frequent hits"", said Eric Steinberg of Whip Media, adding that Netflix also has room to experiment staggering its releases to keep a hold on its subscribers. The company has already taken steps in that direction by releasing episodes of the fourth season of Stranger Things in two batches this year, but the ""pressure is on"" he said. ""They don't have the sandpit to themselves anymore,"" he said. ""In an inflationary environment like the one we're in and also great programming [at the competition], people are going to re-evaluate how much they're willing to pay.""

"The guys look shocked but they must've known Luca was going to get his fair share of pies A domestic abuse charity has spoken to ITV about ""misogynistic and controlling behaviour"" on Love Island. Women's Aid said it was forced to act after being tagged in so many social posts about the show by viewers. It has also criticised producers for missing out ""an understanding of controlling behaviour in relationships"" in its inclusion training for contestants. ITV said it was ""always looking at how we expand and evolve on this training"". This year's Love Island has seen a big backlash from viewers over the way the male islanders are treating the women. It is rare to reach the end of each night's show without seeing one of the boys as a top trend, and not for the right reasons. Women's Aid communications chief Teresa Parker said the charity was ""being tagged into a stream of Twitter posts, with viewers highlighting the misogyny and controlling behaviour being shown on screen"". Over the last few days Luca has accused his partner Gemma of ""flirting"" with Casa Amor ""bombshell"" Billy, despite her insisting she wasn't interested in him in Sunday's movie night episode. Luca's family released a statement on his Instagram in response to criticism, saying ""when he watches it back, he will be embarrassed and deeply apologetic"". The girls also used the pie challenge to show Dami what they thought of his behaviour His pal Dami has also been slammed for shouting at Summer and calling her ""fake"" after he shared a three-way kiss with her and another ""bombshell"" in Casa Amor. Even early favourite Davide - who kissed two girls during Casa Amor - has come under fire for constantly calling Ekin-Su a ""liar"" during their regular arguments. Women's Aid said all of the above had led it to seek out ITV bosses to talk about the concerns it had about the show. The charity said producers had shared information on their inclusion training - coaching given to all islanders around appropriate behaviours and sensitive topics including disability and race. ""But what appears to be missing is specific information on abusive relationships and an understanding of controlling behaviour in relationships,"" Teresa Parker said. ""It is vital that producers know when to intervene and challenge unacceptable behaviour."" They might've been all smiles here but Luca was criticised for his ""Tasha who?"" comments on movie night Teresa said Women's Aid had offered to help and were ""in conversation with ITV and the Love Island producers about what we can do moving forward to help address this"". ""ITV can play an important role here, by dealing with something that is clearly an ongoing issue for the show, and at Women's Aid we want to help where we can,"" she said. Another domestic abuse charity, Refuge,has also tweeted that,external""the misogyny and casual sexism witnessed on this series... is extremely concerning"". ""The double standards, gaslighting and coercive control being displayed by the men in the villa is hugely problematic,"" it added. Love Island's Tasha becomes first deaf contestant Rugby team unsure on Jacques return after Love Island exit Love Island could change second-hand buying habits Former contestant Jacques was criticised for the way he treated his partner Paige before he quit the villa. He has since come out and said he was left broken by the showbut claimed producers pressed him to carry on,external. In response to Women's Aid's comments, an ITV spokesman said: ""We cannot stress highly enough how seriously we treat the emotional well-being of all of our islanders. ""Welfare is always our greatest concern, and we have dedicated welfare producers and psychological support on hand at all times, who monitor and regularly speak to all of the islanders in private and off-camera. ""Ahead of this series, contributors on the show were offered video training and guidance covering inclusive language around disability, sexuality, race and ethnicity, behaviours and microaggressions.

"Patty from Arkansas was among those enjoying the balmy conditions in Orkney While temperatures soar torecord breaking levels across many parts of the UK- there are some corners escaping the heatwave - including Orkney. Look up ""balmy"" in the dictionary, and it'll say something like ""mild or temperate"". Just at the moment, it might as well go on to say ""see Orkney"", with top temperatures of about 20C expected on Tuesday. Which is pretty good. But nothing like the 34C predicted in the Scottish borders. Or the 40.2C recorded at Heathrow in London earlier. Fair to say some people here feel the Orkney islands are missing out. One woman told me she's feeling chilly. ""I've still got a vest on"", she giggled. But others are revelling in the conditions. George and Alison Reid chose a nice (but not too hot) day to get married in Kirkwall New bride Alison Reid has just married George at the Kirkwall and St Ola Town Hall. As friends showered them with confetti, she tells me she owns an ice cream shop, and she's hoping it'll be doing a roaring trade while she's otherwise engaged. Follow the latest on the UK heatwave Patty from Arkansas was tucking into an Orkney ice cream, and musing on temperatures back at home that were already over 37C before she left the USA to come to Scotland. And a group of visitors from Vienna had sought out a shady table outside Kirkwall's ""Daily Scoop"", to plan their four days in Orkney and enjoy a cold drink. They said they were loving the weather - so long as it doesn't rain. Susanna, Michaela and Susanna from Austria said the conditions were good - with the rain holding off Jodie(mum), Reagan (left) and Yara enjoying a day at Scapa Beach, just outside the centre of Kirkwall But why aren't the Northern Isles getting the record breaking temperatures that are hitting so much of the rest of mainland England and Scotland - collectively known in Orkney as ""south""? BBC Scotland weather presenter Joy Dunlop toldBBC Radio Orkney,externalthat ""exceptionally hot air from North Africa and the Sahara has been lingering, and over the last few days a southerly air flow has been drawing this very hot air northwards throughout the UK. ""Neither Orkneynor Shetlandhas experienced these exceptionally high temperatures, due to this very hot air not quite making its way far north enough."" She added: ""Your weather is being steered by a low pressure system to the north west, with a series of weather fronts moving in bringing more in the way of unsettled conditions, rain and a fresher air flow."" So it looks like Orkney will continue to escape the heatwave's grip for now.

temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent
redesign, and the image on the right is not from the current heat wave. Meterologist Aidan McGivern explained that temperature symbols and
colour scale were tweaked to make it more accessible to those, like him, who
are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds. The fire that broke out in Wennington is still burning, and London Fire Brigade are still at the scene this evening. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village, with the blaze igniting buildings and fields nearby. Around 100 firefighters have been working to bring it under control. But the BBC's Nick Johnson, who is in Wennington, says the situation has become more reassuring in the last half hour. He adds that it appears as if fire crews are starting to pack up and return to their engines after six hours of tackling the blaze. One firefighter helping to extinguish the blaze described the conditions as ""absolute hell"". Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Paris Here in Paris, itâs reached 41C. Walking around the city is
incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people
have brought fans along with them. In the capitalâs famous Tulleries garden, people have been taking
shade under some of the parkâs trees, making use of all available seating.
Thankfully the water fountains are still working. Meanwhile
at Paris' Gare du Nord station this afternoon, queues of people were seen waiting
for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly. Stephen RyanBBC News Greek
authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says. Paul KirbyDigital Europe editor The ferocious heatwave that has gripped Western Europe has shifted north and temperatures have climbed towards 40C in several areas. Parishas hit 40C today for only the third time on record.Germanyis having its hottest day of the year so far, and theNetherlandshas recorded its hottest 19 July ever, with 38.9C in Maastricht. One of the big supermarkets has halted home deliveries. The forest fires further south are still burning in France, Spain and Portugal, though. A BBC team has visited one of the five campsites that have burned down in the southwestern Gironde region and you can see what little is left. This video can not be played Heatwave: Surveying the damage after French fires InSpain, which has seen some of the highest temperatures on the continent, more than 60,000 hectares of land have burned in just a week. A fire also broke out in the dunes at theBelgiancoastal resort of De Haan on Tuesday, setting several vehicles alight. Italianforecasters are warning of temperatures as high as 40 to 42C between Wednesday and Friday. Experts at Italy's IlMeteo say new crevasses are opening up on Alpine peaks and ice is melting even on top of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. Todayâs extreme heat has certainly taken its toll on travel, with Network
Rail saying todayâs passenger train numbers are around 40% lower than this time
last week. There have been severe disruptions with all services to and from London
Euston suspended because of a lineside fire caused by overhead electric
cables brought down in Harrow. Similar problems with overhead lines meant trains were trapped on
the tracks in Rugby, Birmingham and Carlisle, resulting in the emergency
evacuations of passengers. As weâve been reporting, there were no rail services into or out
of Kingâs Cross today, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services running north
of London. Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record today, the Met Office says in a Tweet. The national record of 38.7C (101.6F) was topped in places such as Coningsby in Lincolnshire, and Gringley on the Hill, Nottinghamshire. Allow Twitter content?

We've now heard from his niece that the police have gone in to rescue him. Elsewhere in the village, a number of residents are worried about their pets, and there's concern for the livestock in a couple of nearby farms. There's a sense of the village being encircled by flames â it is boiling hot and tinder dry. But remarkably, villagers are very good-spirited, perhaps because there's a sense they really helped each other out in their moment of need. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Tobias Ellwood has been stripped of the party whip, meaning he will no longer sit as a Tory MP A senior Tory MP has been suspended from the parliamentary party after he missed a vote of confidence in Boris Johnson's government. Tobias Ellwood has had the whip removed and will not be able to vote in the Conservative leadership election. Mr Ellwood said he was ""sorry"" to lose the whip but argued he was unable to return from a meeting in Moldova. The government won the vote and the prime minister is due to continue in his role until a successor is elected. Mr Ellwood, a former minister who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, said he had a meeting with the president of Moldova on Monday and had been ""unable to secure return travel due to unprecedented disruption both here and in the UK"". ""I am very sorry to lose the whip but will now continue my meetings in Ukraine promoting the prime minister's efforts here and specifically seeking to secure the reopening of Odessa port - so vital grain exports can recommence,"" Mr Ellwood said in a statement. Tory MPs to vote again in leadership race Who could be the next prime minister? Mason: Sunak ahead but Tory race still very much on Russia invaded Ukraine in February and its forces have blockaded some Black Sea ports, including the key grain-exporting city of Odesa.

Meanwhile, the UK government survived a vote of confidence in itself on Monday, winning by 349 votes to 238, a majority of 111. Other Tory MPs did not vote on Monday's confidence motion, but only Mr Ellwood has had the party whip removed. The Tory Whips Office said other MPs who could not make the vote were ""paired appropriately"". Pairing is an arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties to not vote on a particular issue. This enables an MP to be absent without affecting the result of the vote as they effectively cancel each other out. Mr Ellwood's suspension prevented him for voting in the fourth leadership ballot of Tory MPs, who whittled down the candidates to three on Tuesday. He is supporting trade minister Penny Mordaunt, who is currently in second place ahead of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is being backed by allies of Mr Johnson. Ms Mordaunt's team have dismissed the whips' argument,with one backer telling BBC Newsnight's Nick Watt,external""why didn't they do that for Tobias? He was visiting Moldova"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, an ally of Mr Johnson, said suggestions that the prime minister was trying to remove a vote for Ms Mordaunt by stripping the whip from Mr Ellwood were ""wholly untrue"". ""Every single MP of every party is under no illusion regarding the price to be paid in not voting during a Gov confidence motion,""Ms Dorries wrote in a tweet,external.

This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has ""no idea"" why the Labour leader âinsistedâ in holding a confidence motion in the government In an unusual move, the government called the vote after it rejected a Labour motion that made reference to the prime minister. The vote could have triggered a general election had the government lost, although that would have required dozens of Conservative MPs to side with Labour and other opposition parties. It means Mr Johnson will carry on as prime minister until a new Tory leader is elected and replaces him in September this year.

"A pay rise of at least 4.5% has been proposed for NHS staff by a review body, although the decision rests with the Welsh government The Welsh government has saidÂ UK ministers are not providing the ""full funding necessary for fair pay rises for public sector staff"". An NHS pay review body has proposed that NHS staff get at least a 4.5% pay rise, with lowest earners getting up to 9.3%. Welsh ministers said they would speak to trade unions on Wednesday before announcing their plans. The UK government has agreed to the NHS rise in England. It plans to fund pay rises from existing budgets, which means it is likely the Welsh government will not receive extra funding and will also have to find the cash from elsewhere. The UK government said ""it is vital that we don't increase the country's debt further"". Millions of workers get below-inflation pay rises Big pay rises could push prices up, says minister Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? A 5% pay rise for police officers was also announced in England and Wales.Â The current UK inflation rate is 9.1%, with the Bank of England predicting inflation could reach more than 11% later this year.Â Who sets pay in Wales is complicated. While the NHS pay review body makes recommendations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the decision whether to follow them rests with the Welsh government. Teachers' pay is handled by the Welsh government with a separate body making proposals in Wales. Pay increases of between 5% and 8.9% have been awarded to teachers in England. A decision in Wales is expected soon. NASUWT, the teaching union, has threatened industrial action if teachers are not given a 12% rise. AÂ Welsh government spokesperson said:Â ""The UK government's financial settlement for Wales falls far short of what is required. ""We continue to press them to pass on the full funding necessary for fair pay rises for public sector workers. ""Without this, we face considerable challenges and difficult decisions. ""However, we remain committed to the pay review bodies processes and to working in social partnership with unions and employers to deliver the best possible outcome within the current funding we have available to us.""Â The spokesperson added that Health Minister Eluned Morgan ""is reviewing the NHS pay review bodies' recommendations and discussing with trade unions prior to announcing her decision as soon as possible"".Â A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said: ""Pay awards this year strike a careful balance between recognising the vital importance of public sector workers, whilst delivering value for the taxpayer, not increasing the country's debt further and being careful not to drive even higher prices in the future."" In a further response, a UK government spokesperson said: ""The 2021 Spending Review set the largest funding settlement for the Welsh government since devolution. ""It provides the Welsh government with around 20% higher funding per person than equivalent UK government funding for England. ""It is vital that we don't increase the country's debt further, which already costs Â£83bn a year in interest payments alone.""

"Apple has been hit with a lawsuit in the US over Apple Pay. The tech giant is being accused of using its market power in the mobile phone industry to fend off competition from other payment card issuers. Theclass-action complaint,externalwas filed in a federal court in California by Affinity Credit Union, an Iowa-based chartered credit union. Apple did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. According to the complaint, Apple ""coerces"" consumers who use its smartphones, smart watches and tablets into using its own wallet for contactless payments, unlike makers of Android-based devices that let consumers choose wallets, such as Google Pay and Samsung Pay. The complaint alleges that Apple prevents consumers from using competing mobile wallets capable of offering competing tap and pay solutions. Iowa's Affinity Credit Union said Apple's anti-competitive conduct forced the more than 4,000 banks and credit unions that use Apple Pay to pay at least $1 billion in excess fees annually for the privilege. It also said Apple's conduct minimised the incentive for the California-based company to make Apple Pay work better and make it more resistant to security breaches. ""Apple's conduct harms not only issuers, but also consumers and competition as a whole,"" Affinity Credit Union said. ""If Apple faced competition, it could not sustain these substantial fees."" The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, and a halt to Apple's alleged anti-competitive conduct. Apple already faces a possible heavy fine after European Union regulators on 2 May said it had abused its dominance in iOS devices and mobile wallets, by refusing to give payment rivals access to its technology. According to the complaint, Apple charges issuers a 0.15% fee on credit transactions and a flat 0.5 cent fee on debit transactions using Apple Pay, while Android-based rivals charge nothing. The plaintiff is represented by the law firms Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Sperling and Slater. Last August, they helped obtain a $100 million settlement for smaller iOS developers which claimed Apple overcharged them on commissions. In discussing the European Union's probe of Apple's mobile payment policies in May, the bloc's digital chief Margrethe Vestager said Apple claimed it couldn't provide access to NFC for security reasons. In Europe, most payments in shops made with a mobile phone rely on a wireless technology called 'Near Field Communication' - NFC. This functionality enables communication between a customer's mobile phone and the shop's payments terminal - allowing 'tap and go'. ""Our investigation to date did not reveal any evidence that would point to such a higher security risk,"" Vestager saidon the EU's website,external. ""On the contrary, evidence on our file indicates that Apple's conduct cannot be justified by security concerns."" Allegations that Google overcharged millions of app users in the UK are also set to go to trial. The suit is being brought by a consumer affairs campaigner, Liz Coll, on behalf of almost 20 million British users of Google's Play Store. Her aim is to compensate UK Android smartphone and tablet users for years of alleged overcharging by Google and infringement of competition law. She said: ""We are confident our claim is a good one. ""Google Play Store's imposition of a headline 30% charge on our digital purchases is unlawful and unjustifiable, and we look forward to arguing the case for UK consumers at trial."" Google said it would defend the claim.

"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Graham Brady announces Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race Liz Truss has narrowed the gap with Tory leadership rival Penny Mordaunt, as they battle to secure a place in the run-off vote among members. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak again topped the latest MPs' ballot with 118 votes, suggesting he is likely to secure a spot in the final two places. Ms Mordaunt came second with 92, only six votes ahead of Ms Truss with 86. Kemi Badenoch, who came last with 59 votes, has been knocked out of the contest. The three remaining candidates face a further vote by MPs on Wednesday to decide who will make the final two. Voting will then be thrown open to 160,000 Tory party members to pick the winner, who will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister on 5 September. The surprising joviality of Tory leadership votes Who could be the next prime minister? BBC to host TV debate for last two Tory candidates Contenders need to bag 119 votes from Tory MPs to get into the run-off, suggesting former chancellor Mr Sunak is likely to secure a place. Foreign secretary Liz Truss closed the gap on Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt in Tuesday's vote, gaining 15 more MP votes to Mordaunt's gain of 10. The pair will now go all out to grab the votes of those MPs who backed Ms Badenoch, as they bid to secure a place in the run-off. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is backing Ms Truss, said the result showed she ""has the momentum"" and had garnered support from a wide range of Conservative MPs. Tory MP Maria Miller, a Mordaunt supporter, said her candidate would offer a ""fresh choice"" for members and said her campaign would now focus on wooing Badenoch supporters. Little known beyond Tory circles at the start of the race, former equalities minister Ms Badenoch has been the breakthrough candidate of the contest. She won support and gained attention with her straight-talking approach and emphasis on cultural issues that have divided the party in recent years. Her departure from the contest will trigger a scramble among remaining candidates to secure the support of the 59 MPs backing her on Tuesday. Badenoch backer Ben Bradley predicted her voters could go ""in all directions,"" and he had not yet decided whom to back in Wednesday's vote. It comes as: The BBC announced it willbroadcast a live TV debatewith the final two candidates on Monday Ms Mordaunt pledged to scrap house building targets for councils, and channel development away from ""precious greenfields"" Ms Truss promised that if elected she would increase UK defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday evening has been cancelled, after Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss declined to take part. Instead, the remaining hopefuls will look to garner support from Tory MPs during a hustings hosted by the Onward think tank and the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs representing seats in the north of England. The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second.

"Staff member David Jimenez erects a parasol at London Fields Lido It was expected that Scotland would dodge the extreme heat forecast for England and Wales - yet the amber alert has crept north of the border. The Met Office warning means there could be danger to life or potential serious illness and meteorologists have warned there could be record breaking temperatures. But that said, we are still experiencing a less severe heatwave compared to our southern neighbours where an unprecedented red extreme heat warning has been issued. This, perhaps, is nothing new. Scotland has always been colder and wetter on average than England - but is the gap changing? Meteorologists say, not exactly - but the latest conditions could be due to warmer air ""spilling"" further north when there is a heatwave in places like France, Spain and North Africa. BBC Scotland weather forecaster Joy Dunlop said this was the simple explanation for more extreme weather further south. Temperature passes 30C in parts of Scotland Warnings of 'heat apocalypse' in parts of France Temperatures rising rapidly as over 40C predicted Last week, she said there was high pressure in the south which keeps conditions solid and settled, but Scotland experienced a series of weather fronts coming in from the west, which bring cloud and rain from the Arctic. On Monday and Tuesday, she said, Scotland would experience warmer weather as the hot air travels higher towards the central belt - however, there still would be a difference of around 20C between the northern isles and the hottest parts of England.

As a result of the recent spikes in temperature, scientists from The Physiological Society - whose focus is to understand how the body works - have called for heatwaves to be named just like storms. They say this will help communicate the severity of forecasts and help people understand how to protect themselves from extreme heat - particularly the elderly and young children who are more vulnerable. The measure has recently been introduced for the first time in the Spanish city Seville - and is necessary because heatwaves are becoming more widespread and kill more people than storms do, the scientists added. Mike Tipton, the society's group co-ordinator, said although Scotland is not affected by heatwaves now, this will change over time - and people should be prepared. Seville is the first city in the world to name heatwaves, classifying them into three categories so people can better understand their severity He said: ""The likelihood is that these will spread over more of the UK. Also, you've got plenty of people travelling through Scotland - particularly in the months to come - on holiday in regions that will be really very warm to the point where they're life threatening for some individuals, particularly the elderly and young children."" Mr Tipton added that people with fair skin are also among the most susceptible to sunburn, adding: ""It's not something that countries that are not currently being impacted by heat shouldn't worry about."" BBC Scotland forecast Joy Dunlop added: ""As the world is getting warmer, the likelihood of heatwaves increases. We need to be prepared for this - understanding how they affect both people and infrastructure is a huge part of dealing with the issue. ""With Scotland being further away from the continent / Sahara, the likelihood of us getting this extreme heat is lower. but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't prepare for conditions that for us, are hotter than normal, as substantial changes in working practices and daily routines may to be required."" Britain has been slowly getting warmer since the 19th Century. In the past three decades, the UK has become 0.9C warmer. The 10 hottest years since 1884 have all happened since 2002. And none of the coldest years has been recorded this century. It is not possible for meteorologists to tie single weather events such as the current heatwave to climate change. But experts are in no doubt that climate change is causing global temperatures to rise. This has brought more extreme weather, including record-breaking high temperatures across the world. But periods of intense heat do occur within natural weather patterns. The temperatures of 36C in England would be an all-time record in Scotland, where the record is currently the 32.9C recorded at Greycrook in the Borders in 2003. Scotland has also recorded some extremely high summer temperatures in recent years. Last summer, for example, much of Scotland enjoyed warmer conditions than the south east of England, when compared with the average temperatures over the last 30 years. But it is also important to note that all four seasons have seen warmer average temperatures in the past decade than in the years from 1961 to 1990. By far the largest changes in average temperature in Scotland over the past 40 years have been seen in the winter. The average temperatures in England have risen further in the winter and spring than in the summer and autumn. But the Met Office said that, when taken over the year, Scotland sometimes experiences a greater rise in temperatures than England.

"Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race She came last in the latest round of voting by Conservative MPs with 59 votes Ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak wins the fourth round with 118 votes, three more than last time Trade minister Penny Mordaunt is second with 92 votes, gaining 10 votes since yesterday Although Foreign Secretary Liz Truss came third with 86 votes, she gained 15 votes - more than any other candidate - and is closing in on Mordaunt By Wednesday night we'll be left with just two candidates; Tory members then pick the winner who'll be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles Today's live page was brought to you by: Aoife Walsh, Jack Burgess, Richard Morris, Dulcie Lee, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. We are pausing our live coverage of the Tory leadership race shortly. But before we go, here's a recap of the latest developments on another busy day in Westminster:  We will finally know which two candidates have made it through to the last round of the Tory leadership contest tomorrow afternoon, with it largely expected to be Rishi Sunak versus Liz Truss or Penny Mordaunt. Voting begins at 1pm and closes at 3pm, with results announced at 4pm by Sir Graham Brady who is chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. At that point, over the course of the summer, Conservative party members will vote for the next prime minister. We will know the result by 5 September at the latest. Read more here.  A YouGov survey of 725 Conservative party members suggests former chancellor Rishi Sunak could lose the race to be the next PM to all of his remaining rivals. The survey suggests Foreign Secretary Liz Truss would beat Sunak by 54% to 35% if they stood against each other. It says Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt would also beat him 51% to 37% if they were both in the final two.  Tory leadership candidates are now taking part in more private hustings with the Northern Research Group of Conservative MPs and the Onward think tank ahead of tomorrow's vote. Rishi Sunak took the floor first, followed by Penny Mordaunt, who said she was feeling ""good"" as she entered the room. Liz Truss will speak to the groups later. Campaigners backing Liz Truss to be the next Tory leader are urging Kemi Badenoch's supporters to unite behind the foreign secretary. ""Kemi Badenoch has run a fantastic campaign and contributed enormously to the battle of ideas throughout this contest,"" a Truss campaign spokeswoman said. ""Now is the time for the party to unite behind a candidate who will govern in a Conservative way and who has shown she can deliver time and again."" Penny Mordaunt, who finished in second place in the latest ballot with 92 votes, has thanked colleagues who have supported her leadership campaign. She says: ""This afternoon colleagues once again put their trust in me and I cannot thank them enough. We are so nearly across the finish line. ""I am raring to go and excited to put my case to members across the country and win."" She praised Kemi Badenoch who was knocked out of the contest earlier. Her 59 votes will be crucial in deciding which candidates make the final two tomorrow. ""I want to pay tribute to my friend Kemi Badenoch who electrified the leadership contest with her fresh thinking and bold policies. She and I both know that the old way of government isn't working as it should,"" Mordaunt says. ""Voters want change and we owe it to them to offer a bold new vision for this country"". Conservative MP Ben Bradley says he will probably ""ignore the calls and have a glass of wine instead"" as he still hasn't decided who to back in the leadership election, now that the candidate he was supporting, Kemi Badenoch, has been knocked out He says over the last 12 days Badenoch has ""done an incredible job,"" and he wants to see her in the next cabinet. ""I'm disappointed that the prime minister's going,"" he says, ""in the current climate"" people are looking for ""something different"". He says his constituents like Badenoch's views as she speaks ""common sense"". He says he thinks ""Penny [Mordaunt's campaign] seems to have stalled in the last few days... there are more anti-Penny people than there are anti-Liz [Truss] people"". Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster In the corridors of parliament, the remaining
campaign teams are trying to put positive spins on the results. Liz Truss is making up ground on Penny Mordaunt but one of the Trade Ministerâs
backers stresses that âshe is still in second place"". She might have only just been eliminated, but the scramble for Kemi Badenochâs
votes is well under way. One of her supporters tells me heâs âdisappointedâ that sheâs been knocked out but expresses pride in her campaign. âSheâll be Prime Minister one dayâ, he
says. The same MP says the other campaign teams have already been phoning him: âItâs
like relatives turning up at the reading of a will.â He also tells me there is an âanyone but Rishiâ camp in the party. Many MPs admit there is tactical voting going on, making it very difficult to
predict what happens next. Kemi Badenochhas said on Twitter,externalshe's ""grateful"" to her colleagues and the Conservative Party members who supported her leadership bid. After being knocked out of the contest this afternoon, she praised the progress her campaign made, saying it began ""less than two weeks ago"". ""What we've achieved demonstrates the level of support for our vision of change for our country and for the Conservative Party"", she says. She finished her tweet by saying ""Thank you"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Although she's left the race, Kemi Badenoch is undoubtedly the breakthrough candidate of this campaign. She won support and gained attention with her straight talking approach, pitch for honesty and firm grasp of complex issues. While other candidates scrapped about whether to cut taxes, Badenoch was clearly trying to set a new agenda. Whether colleagues agreed with her or not, many admired her command of social and cultural issues which have divided the party. One MP, backing a rival candidate, described her as ""the new darling of the right"" With a group of 59 MPs behind her, she could still have a big influence on the outcome of the race by openly backing one of the remaining contenders. Maria Miller MP says she is ""absolutely"" confident Penny Mordaunt can take on Rishi Sunak if she secures a place in the final two tomorrow. Miller says Mordaunt's team will be focusing on trying to win over those who were supporting Kemi Badenoch, who was eliminated from the contest this afternoon. ""We'll be continuing to press Penny's strong policies on the economy and the fact that she is really a fresh choice for our membership to be able to have on their final ballet paper,"" Miller says. She adds Tory MPs want ""more than anything else"" to win the next general election and Mordaunt is the strongest candidate to do that. Former Tory leader and Liz Truss-backer Iain Duncan Smith has been telling the BBC he thinks she ""has the momentum"" after Kemi Badenoch was knocked out of the contest during the latest round of voting. He said he believes Truss has ""garnered a wide range of support"" among Conservative MPs and her supporters ""cover everybody"". She came third in the latest ballot, with 86 votes, and is through to tomorow's final vote. She picked up 15 new supporters compared to the previous round - that's around half of people who had been backing Tom Tugendhat who left the contest yesterday. Meanwhile Rishi Sunak won today's vote with 118 - Penny Mordaunt came second with 92. After making it through to the final round of MPsâ voting, Liz Trussâs backers will now be shoring up her support to try to secure a place in the final two. They'll be buoyed by the latest result - she's narrowed the gap between herself and her rival Penny Mordaunt, who remains in second place but just six votes ahead. Truss has set out a markedly different vision for the UK than the apparent man to beat, Rishi Sunak, promising immediate tax cuts and the reversal of the rise in National Insurance. The foreign secretary sought support from the right of the party, and early into her bid won the backing of Johnson loyalists Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. Weâll find out in about 24 hoursâ time whether sheâs succeeded in finding enough support to get her over the line.

Sir Graham Brady has just been announcing the results of the latest round of voting.  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second. Rishi Sunak only gained three votes, showing that while he's been in front from the start it's not a runaway lead. It's a very tight race and at this point, impossible to call.  Kemi Badenochhas been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunaksecured the most votes in the fourth ballot among Tory MPs, withPenny Mordauntcoming second. The votes were as follows:  The three remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where MPs will pick a final two candidates. Voting will then be thrown open to all Conservative Party members to pick the winner, after a series of hustings throughout August. The new Conservative Party leader and prime minister will be announced on 5 September. Former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting with 59 votes. Badenoch is seen as being on the right of the party and stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform while arguing for the state to be slimmed down. Before the contest began, the 42-year-old was rarely mentioned as a major contender to succeed Boris Johnson, but she saw off some big names early in the race, placing fourth in Monday's round of voting. Team Badenoch had been hoping to gain enough momentum to surpass her rival Liz Truss, after she trailed the foreign secretary by just 13 votes on Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate since 2001 when taking into account rising prices, official figures show. Between March and May, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.8% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation - the fastest drop since records began. Household budgets are being hit by soaring food, fuel and energy costs, with inflation at a 40-year high. Pay growth was much higher for the private sector than the public sector. For March to May, average total pay for the private sector was 7.2% higher than the same period last year, before taking account of inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). For the public sector the figure was 1.5%. Pay including bonuses was down 0.9% when adjusted for inflation. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices It comes as the government is due to unveil this year's pay deal for 2.5 million public sector workers,including teachers, nurses, doctors, police officers and members of the armed forces. Unions are calling for wages to reflect the cost of living - but ministers have signalled the pay deal will not match price rises, warning this would push inflation even higher. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 9.1% in May, the highest level in 40 years, and is expected to climb further by the autumn. James Reed, chairman of Reed, one of the UK's largest recruitment businesses, said the UK was seeing ""a two-speed workforce"", with big pay offers being made to people with certain skills. ""So you might be seeing 25% plus pay offer increases to get people to move jobs. But then we're seeing other parts of the economy where pay hasn't moved much at all and that is concerning because more and more people will end up living in in-work poverty,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Virgin Money is the latest company to offer a one-off payment to help employees cope with the rising cost of living, with all staff on a salary of Â£50,000 or less to get a Â£1,000 lump sum in August. Firms including Lloyds Bank have also offered similar payments. Max Poynton says his doughnut firm is finding it difficult to recruit new staff With job vacancies at near record highs, many sectors are struggling to recruit. Max Poynton, operations director at Project D, a doughnut firm in Derby, said it was particularly hard to find experienced people. ""I think a lot of people after the pandemic have gone and retrained, upskilled themselves and the same pool of people that was there before maybe isn't there anymore."" He knows staff are struggling, with some ride-sharing on their way into work to save money. Some have asked directly for a pay rise but with the business facing increased costs on everything from electricity to diesel to flour and icing, he says it is simply not an option. ""I'd love to be able to say yes but at the moment it's tough to offer any sort of pay rises, especially with the uncertainty of not knowing how much our costs are going to increase over the next six months."" Dan Bond is feeling the impact of rising prices Dan Bond, who works in the doughnut factory, said his last pay rise was in April when the minimum wage went up. Since then Dan, who drives to work, has seen a huge rise in the cost of filling up his tank. However, he is unsure whether he would ask his employer for a pay rise. ""I know they're also experiencing hard times,"" he said. ""So do I put that pressure on as well?"" Business groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said companies were struggling with higher wage demands from staff and that salary increases were beginning to hold back growth and investment. Jane Gratton, from the BCC, told the Commons Business Committee small businesses were losing candidates to other employers offering higher pay and were worried about how they could compete with bigger firms. But Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the committee workers were facing a ""pay crisis"" and the argument that the country was in a ""pay inflation spiral"" was ""nonsense"". The jobs market is still hot, with unemployment down and vacancies up near records. However, the ONS says it doesn't see evidence of the dreaded ""wage-price"" spiral that would entrench the current high rates of inflation. Indeed the flip side of that is the biggest real squeeze on pay since these records were first collected two decades ago, and probably for significantly before that too. Pay settlements are not ""inflationary"" as they are not exceeding inflation. Though there is some evidence in certain sectors and local settings, with worker shortages, of unionised workplaces securing double digit pay rises. Other workplaces in construction and manufacturing see employers paying retention bonuses and cost of living lump sums. On average, while not inflationary, these settlements are high in cash terms. It is notable too that from March to May, average total pay including bonuses was up 7.2% in the private sector compared to the previous year, but up just 1.5% in the public sector. Little wonder that those in the public sector say that some of the visible chaos seen in social care and the health system reflects low-paid public sector workers jumping ship to better paid jobs at the likes of supermarkets and Amazon. This reduction in the social care workforce is crippling the sector enough to cause queues of ambulances unable to offload patients into hospitals unable to discharge their patients. Much of this boils down to a singular factor, not even discussed in the current contest to run the country - significant shortages of labour. Job vacancies continued to increase between April and June - up 6,900 compared to the previous quarter - although the rate is slowing. The accommodation and food service sectors saw the biggest rise but this was offset by falls in other industries, including wholesale and retail trade and motor vehicle repairs. ONS head of labour market and household statistics, David Freeman, said demand for labour was ""clearly still very high"", with unemployment falling again and another record low for redundancies. For March to May, the unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%, a fall of 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous three-month period. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the figures ""underline how strong our jobs market continues to be"". But he added: ""I am acutely aware that rising prices are affecting how far people's hard-earned income goes, so we are providing help for households through cash grants and tax cuts."" However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the Conservatives had ""failed to grow the economy, which has left people more exposed to inflation and the cost-of-living crisis"".

Weâll find out in about 24 hoursâ time whether sheâs succeeded in finding enough support to get her over the line.

This video can not be played Kemi Badenoch has failed to make the final three in the Conservative leadership contest after receiving the lowest number of votes from MPs. Sir Graham Brady has just been announcing the results of the latest round of voting.  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second. Rishi Sunak only gained three votes, showing that while he's been in front from the start it's not a runaway lead. It's a very tight race and at this point, impossible to call.  Kemi Badenochhas been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunaksecured the most votes in the fourth ballot among Tory MPs, withPenny Mordauntcoming second. The votes were as follows:  The three remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where MPs will pick a final two candidates. Voting will then be thrown open to all Conservative Party members to pick the winner, after a series of hustings throughout August. The new Conservative Party leader and prime minister will be announced on 5 September. Former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting with 59 votes. Badenoch is seen as being on the right of the party and stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform while arguing for the state to be slimmed down. Before the contest began, the 42-year-old was rarely mentioned as a major contender to succeed Boris Johnson, but she saw off some big names early in the race, placing fourth in Monday's round of voting. Team Badenoch had been hoping to gain enough momentum to surpass her rival Liz Truss, after she trailed the foreign secretary by just 13 votes on Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate since 2001 when taking into account rising prices, official figures show. Between March and May, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.8% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation - the fastest drop since records began. Household budgets are being hit by soaring food, fuel and energy costs, with inflation at a 40-year high. Pay growth was much higher for the private sector than the public sector. For March to May, average total pay for the private sector was 7.2% higher than the same period last year, before taking account of inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). For the public sector the figure was 1.5%. Pay including bonuses was down 0.9% when adjusted for inflation. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices It comes as the government is due to unveil this year's pay deal for 2.5 million public sector workers,including teachers, nurses, doctors, police officers and members of the armed forces. Unions are calling for wages to reflect the cost of living - but ministers have signalled the pay deal will not match price rises, warning this would push inflation even higher. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 9.1% in May, the highest level in 40 years, and is expected to climb further by the autumn. James Reed, chairman of Reed, one of the UK's largest recruitment businesses, said the UK was seeing ""a two-speed workforce"", with big pay offers being made to people with certain skills. ""So you might be seeing 25% plus pay offer increases to get people to move jobs. But then we're seeing other parts of the economy where pay hasn't moved much at all and that is concerning because more and more people will end up living in in-work poverty,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Virgin Money is the latest company to offer a one-off payment to help employees cope with the rising cost of living, with all staff on a salary of Â£50,000 or less to get a Â£1,000 lump sum in August. Firms including Lloyds Bank have also offered similar payments. Max Poynton says his doughnut firm is finding it difficult to recruit new staff With job vacancies at near record highs, many sectors are struggling to recruit. Max Poynton, operations director at Project D, a doughnut firm in Derby, said it was particularly hard to find experienced people. ""I think a lot of people after the pandemic have gone and retrained, upskilled themselves and the same pool of people that was there before maybe isn't there anymore."" He knows staff are struggling, with some ride-sharing on their way into work to save money. Some have asked directly for a pay rise but with the business facing increased costs on everything from electricity to diesel to flour and icing, he says it is simply not an option. ""I'd love to be able to say yes but at the moment it's tough to offer any sort of pay rises, especially with the uncertainty of not knowing how much our costs are going to increase over the next six months."" Dan Bond is feeling the impact of rising prices Dan Bond, who works in the doughnut factory, said his last pay rise was in April when the minimum wage went up. Since then Dan, who drives to work, has seen a huge rise in the cost of filling up his tank. However, he is unsure whether he would ask his employer for a pay rise. ""I know they're also experiencing hard times,"" he said. ""So do I put that pressure on as well?"" Business groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said companies were struggling with higher wage demands from staff and that salary increases were beginning to hold back growth and investment. Jane Gratton, from the BCC, told the Commons Business Committee small businesses were losing candidates to other employers offering higher pay and were worried about how they could compete with bigger firms. But Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the committee workers were facing a ""pay crisis"" and the argument that the country was in a ""pay inflation spiral"" was ""nonsense"". The jobs market is still hot, with unemployment down and vacancies up near records. However, the ONS says it doesn't see evidence of the dreaded ""wage-price"" spiral that would entrench the current high rates of inflation. Indeed the flip side of that is the biggest real squeeze on pay since these records were first collected two decades ago, and probably for significantly before that too. Pay settlements are not ""inflationary"" as they are not exceeding inflation. Though there is some evidence in certain sectors and local settings, with worker shortages, of unionised workplaces securing double digit pay rises. Other workplaces in construction and manufacturing see employers paying retention bonuses and cost of living lump sums. On average, while not inflationary, these settlements are high in cash terms. It is notable too that from March to May, average total pay including bonuses was up 7.2% in the private sector compared to the previous year, but up just 1.5% in the public sector. Little wonder that those in the public sector say that some of the visible chaos seen in social care and the health system reflects low-paid public sector workers jumping ship to better paid jobs at the likes of supermarkets and Amazon. This reduction in the social care workforce is crippling the sector enough to cause queues of ambulances unable to offload patients into hospitals unable to discharge their patients. Much of this boils down to a singular factor, not even discussed in the current contest to run the country - significant shortages of labour. Job vacancies continued to increase between April and June - up 6,900 compared to the previous quarter - although the rate is slowing. The accommodation and food service sectors saw the biggest rise but this was offset by falls in other industries, including wholesale and retail trade and motor vehicle repairs. ONS head of labour market and household statistics, David Freeman, said demand for labour was ""clearly still very high"", with unemployment falling again and another record low for redundancies. For March to May, the unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%, a fall of 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous three-month period. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the figures ""underline how strong our jobs market continues to be"". But he added: ""I am acutely aware that rising prices are affecting how far people's hard-earned income goes, so we are providing help for households through cash grants and tax cuts."" However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the Conservatives had ""failed to grow the economy, which has left people more exposed to inflation and the cost-of-living crisis"". UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011 Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Queen's Greatest Hits is a perennial best-seller Queen have made UK chart history by becoming the first act to sell seven million copies of an individual album. Their first Greatest Hits collection, from 1981, is now owned by one in every four households in the UK, said the Official Charts Company. The record, which features classic singles like We Will Rock You and Bohemian Rhapsody, has been a perennial best-seller for years. It recently spent its 1,000th week on the UK album chart. Queen guitarist Brian May called the latest achievement ""joyous news"". ""No album has done this before in history,"" he said in a statement. ""Thank you, we appreciate it."" Drummer Roger Taylor added: ""The British public and their infinitely-great taste have made this the biggest-selling album in history. ""Thank you very much; we're humbled and honoured. We salute you!"" Queen's first Greatest Hits album features the songs Bohemian Rhapsody, Bicycle Race and We Are The Champions Queen's Greatest Hits leads the all-time album chart by almost a million copies, ahead of Abba's 1992 compilation album Gold. ""When it was released for the first time in 1981, career-spanning packages such as Greatest Hits were relatively rare, the preserve of only the very biggest acts,"" noted Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts. ""There is no doubt that its massive success has done as much as any other release to turn hits packages into the omnipresent album concept that they are today."" Queen's second Greatest Hits album, released in October 1991, a month before the death of singer Freddie Mercury - is also the UK's tenth biggest record, with sales around the four million mark. Abba Gold spends record 1,000 weeks in UK chart Classic Queen cover art sold for more than Â£28k Queen top UK album chart after 25-year break Bo Rhap is the oldest video to get 1bn views Back in 2014, Queen's Greatest Hits became the first album to surpass six million sales in the UK. At the time, the chart only counted ""pure"" sales - ie vinyl, cassette, CD and downloads. A year later, audio streams were incorporated into the calculations, with every 1,000 song streams converted into one album ""sale"". Since then, Queen's Greatest Hits has accumulated 1.26 billion total UK streams, equating to roughly 1.26 million sales (the actual figure will be lower, due to balancing measures applied by chart compilers). The album's most-streamed track is Bohemian Rhapsody, which boasts 240 million UK streams and counting, the chart company said. The band's back catalogue received a massive boost from the release of the Oscar-winning Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody in 2018. On Spotify, Queen are currently the 31st most-streamed act in the world, ahead of other classic artists like The Beatles, who place 44th, and Michael Jackson, who is 68th. According to the accounts filed by the band's company, Queen Productions Ltd, sales and streams of their music generated Â£39m in royalties in the last financial year. However, Sir Elton John has warned that the constant presence of greatest hits compilations on the album charts is starving newer acts of opportunities. ""The albums chart is full of things like me, Abba and Queen,""he told Music Week,external. ""The odd thing comes through, like Sam Fender or Harry Styles, or you get a new artist coming in at number three and then disappearing. ""It's depressing - there are a lot of good albums that deserve to be in the albums chart, like Juanita Euka, Sharon Van Etten, Angel Olsen. What I want to know is, why aren't they there?

"Sunscreen and ice cream sales soared in the UK as families prepared for the record-breaking heatwave. Sun care sales were up 66% and ice cream 14% in the four weeks to 10 July, research firm Kantar said. It predicts millions of pounds of extra spending on fans, paddling pools and water bottles as UK temperatures hit record highs. But grocery price rises are at a near-record 9.9%, and food bills are set to rise by Â£454 this year, Kantar said. Households stocked up on summer essentials in those four weeks in June and July as the Met Office predicted extreme heat across much of the UK. On Tuesday a temperature of 40.2C was recorded for the first time at London Heathrow -but some places are expected to reach up to 42C later. The last time the UK sweltered in a similar heatwave, July 2019, sales of fans, paddling pools and reusable water bottles shot up. About Â£10.9m extra was spent during the hottest week on those three items alone. ""We expect to see similar if not even bigger numbers this time around,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? But with price rises hitting their second fastest pace on record over those four weeks, people will be ""feeling the pinch during our first restriction-free summer since 2019"", Mr McKevitt said. Typical summer barbecue staples of burgers, halloumi and coleslaw cost 13%, 17% and 14% more than they did this time last year. ""Buying enough for a typical family barbecue, shoppers will have to put aside Â£9.94 rather than the Â£9.01 they spent last year,"" he said. As food prices soar, the Kantar analysis suggested that people are increasingly turning away from branded products and towards own-label items. Sainsbury's said in July its customers wereswitching to own-brand productsand cutting back on non-essential spending. ""It's a complex picture and the grocers are busy negotiating with their suppliers to mitigate impact at the tills as far as possible,"" Mr McKevitt said. Tesco recently had a public spat with supplier Kraft Heinz, which meant products such as itsbeans disappeared from Tesco's shelves for a while.It's also in dispute with food giant Mars over the price of itsWhiskas cat food. People also increasingly shopped at the German discounters Aldi and Lidl in those four weeks, with Morrisons and Waitrose especially losing market share. Aldi is continuing to gain ground, and got closer to overtaking Morrisons as the fourth biggest UK supermarket chain. Food prices are rising rapidly as energy and fuel costs continue to jump. Over the four weeks to 10 July grocery prices rose at 9.9%, the fastest pace since 2008, the analyst firm said. That means an item that cost Â£10 in the same period last year would have gone up to Â£10.99. Kantar expects that pace to get even faster over the coming weeks, hitting a record high as supply chain issues continue to drive up costs. In June, official figures showedinflation rising at its fastest rate for 40 yearsas energy and fuel prices continued to soar. Energy prices were already rising as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, but the war in Ukraine has helped push fuel costs to record highs. Russia's war in Ukraine has also severely restricted wheat and maize supplies, which are used to make bread and cereals, from two of the world's biggest exporters, helping to push up food costs. Fertilizer costs have also shot up. The pace of price rises isoutstripping how fast wages are going up, and people are tightening their belts.

Emma Grayson, 22, said she felt ""very scared"" and ""uncomfortable"" during the incident on Sunday evening. Ms Grayson videoed some of the encounter and later posted it on the social media app TikTok. She said she wanted to raise awareness of the type of situation she and her friends often find themselves in. The man approached her on Newport Road in Cardiff at about 21:00 BST on Sunday. The women groped and laughed at in the street Street harassment 'part of puberty' In the video, which the Cardiff Metropolitan University fashion marketing student titled ""NO means NO"", the man keeps propositioning and following her, despite her repeatedly saying she wants to be left alone. She filmed about a minute of the ten-minute long encounter, during which he said things to her such as: ""I saw you for the first time and liked you"", ""I have a lot of money"" and ""How much do you want?"" Emma was approached walking along Newport Road, which leads from the city centre Emma said: ""It was a very scary situation because I didn't know if he had anything on him like a weapon. ""I don't know this guy so I couldn't just assume that he didn't have anything on him. ""It was best for me just to stay calm and that's how I dealt with it. I don't think I realised how bad it was until I watched it back.""

Emma said she felt particularly uncomfortable when the man came close to her face and asked: ""why don't you want to talk to me?"". She said, in her experience, it was ""an extreme case of harassment"" but generally it is a problem she and her friends have experienced many times before.

""Because of social media, it has got more exposure, people are speaking up on it and I think it's important that people tell their peers how it makes them feel,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fields and buildings ablaze in London and south-east A major incident has been declared due to a spate of fires across London,where temperatures have exceeded 40C for the first time. More than 400 firefighters have been battling at least nine blazes that began on Tuesday afternoon. The number of casualties and houses destroyed is not yet known. London Fire Brigade (LFB) assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith said it had to investigate every incident before it could give an ""accurate picture"". He said Tuesday night into Wednesday morning would be ""critical"" in ensuring the fires were kept under control. London Ambulance Service has said the total number of people taken to hospital may not be known until Wednesday. Homes in Wennington, east London, were evacuated after a grass fire spread to properties and left several gutted by flames. Two people were also taken to hospital following a fire in Dagenham. Homes have been left damaged by the Wennington fire LFB is asking people to only call 999 if there is an emergency or if there is an immediate risk to life. It has also urged people not to have barbecues or bonfires in public parks or at home due to the scale of the challenge facing crews. The Met Police, which has provided vehicle support to the firefighters, said some of the fires would require an ongoing presence through the night. Mr Smith said: ""We've had a range of incidents today, obviously a number of which have been the result of the tinderbox dry woodland and grassland both in central London and in the suburbs. ""This has caused rapid fire spread which has impacted on properties, people's homes, schools, churches and other types of buildings. ""At the moment, because of the sheer number of incidents we've been attending, we will be pulling all of that information together and making sure every incident is thoroughly investigated. ""Once we've done that we'll be able to give an accurate picture of exactly the incidents we've attended, how many homes have been affected and if there have been any casualties."" Two houses, a car wash and several vehicles caught fire in Kenton As temperatures in the capital soared to above 40C, LFB sent: Thirty fire engines and 175 firefighters to a grass fire on Pea Lane in Upminster, where smoke billowed over the M25 motorway Twelve engines to Uxbridge Road in Pinner to tackle a fire involving garden fencing and trees Ten engines to a restaurant fire on Green Lanes in Southgate, where about 70 firefighters remain at the scene Eight engines to a grass fire on Oaks Road, Croydon Eight engines to a grass fire on Ballards Road, Dagenham Twelve engines to a fire at The Broadway, Wembley Six engines to a grass fire on Sunningfields Crescent, Hendon Four engines to a grass fire over an area of about one hectare (2.5 acres) of woodland and undergrowth on Chapel View in Croydon Four engines to a fire on Sidcup Road, Eltham Ten fire engines to Hawthorne Avenue, Kenton, where a car wash, two semi-detached houses and nine vehicles are completely alight Firefighters had the fire in Upminster under control by 15:07 BST, the LFB said. Some 200 people were evacuated from a nearby caravan site and 60 gas cylinders were removed to a safe area as a precaution, as some cylinders can explode when exposed to heat. The blaze in Wembley, where a shop with flats above was alight and about 50 people were evacuated, was later brought under control. The ground floor of a shop in Eltham was destroyed in one fire Firefighters attended a fire on Dartford Marshes Residents in Wennington told the BBC about eight homes and possibly the local church had been destroyed in the fire. One woman was seen crying hysterically saying: ""Oh my God - the house is gone"", while her family tried to comfort her. Janet Hickey, 70, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, said she was forced to leave all her cancer drugs behind when they were evacuated. She said: ""I'm terminally ill so it's not great to lose all that. I'm also an artist and all my paintings are there."" Mrs Hickey shared the home with her husband Patrick, 71, for 50 years. He said: ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" This video can not be played A grass fire is seen spreading smoke around Shirley Hills Timothy Bassett said the fire was thought to have started in the back garden of one home. ""Literally within no time at all, with the winds and everything, it just got horrendous,"" he said. One woman said her uncle had been stuck in a home and had started digging a trench to protect it from the flames. Emergency services have since rescued him. A firefighter working at the scene described the conditions as being like ""absolute hell"". Residents in Wennington said they believed about eight homes had been destroyed The blaze in Ballards Road, Dagenham, began as a grassfire before spreading to a range of properties and a workshop. LFB said a man and a woman had been treated in hospital for smoke inhalation. Firefighters' leave and training was cancelled in order to maximise the brigade's response to the surge in emergencies, it said. Fire crews in Wennington described conditions as being ""absolute hell"" Borough Commander Paul McClenaghan said tackling the fire in Wennington had been an arduous task. ""Our firefighters are working in incredibly hot, difficult conditions. ""There are cylinders involved in the fire which is adding to the challenge for crews. ""The fire is creating lots of thick smoke and we would advise local residents to close doors and windows."" Numerous emergency services are at the scene in Wennington Firefighters are also tacklinga blaze on Dartford Marshes,near the border of Bexleyheath. BBC News reporter Harry Low, who was at the scene, said much of the land in the surrounding area had been scorched. Euston Station was evacuated following a trackside electrical fire earlier. There are also no trains out of Euston following a trackside fire. Train services running out of London King's Cross and London St Pancras International have also been cancelled due to the heat.

"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Graham Brady announces Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race Liz Truss has narrowed the gap with Tory leadership rival Penny Mordaunt, as they battle to secure a place in the run-off vote among members. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak again topped the latest MPs' ballot with 118 votes, suggesting he is likely to secure a spot in the final two places. Ms Mordaunt came second with 92, only six votes ahead of Ms Truss with 86. Kemi Badenoch, who came last with 59 votes, has been knocked out of the contest. The three remaining candidates face a further vote by MPs on Wednesday to decide who will make the final two. Voting will then be thrown open to 160,000 Tory party members to pick the winner, who will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister on 5 September. The surprising joviality of Tory leadership votes Who could be the next prime minister? BBC to host TV debate for last two Tory candidates Contenders need to bag 119 votes from Tory MPs to get into the run-off, suggesting former chancellor Mr Sunak is likely to secure a place. Foreign secretary Liz Truss closed the gap on Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt in Tuesday's vote, gaining 15 more MP votes to Mordaunt's gain of 10. The pair will now go all out to grab the votes of those MPs who backed Ms Badenoch, as they bid to secure a place in the run-off. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who is backing Ms Truss, said the result showed she ""has the momentum"" and had garnered support from a wide range of Conservative MPs. Tory MP Maria Miller, a Mordaunt supporter, said her candidate would offer a ""fresh choice"" for members and said her campaign would now focus on wooing Badenoch supporters. Little known beyond Tory circles at the start of the race, former equalities minister Ms Badenoch has been the breakthrough candidate of the contest. She won support and gained attention with her straight-talking approach and emphasis on cultural issues that have divided the party in recent years. Her departure from the contest will trigger a scramble among remaining candidates to secure the support of the 59 MPs backing her on Tuesday. Badenoch backer Ben Bradley predicted her voters could go ""in all directions,"" and he had not yet decided whom to back in Wednesday's vote. It comes as: The BBC announced it willbroadcast a live TV debatewith the final two candidates on Monday Ms Mordaunt pledged to scrap house building targets for councils, and channel development away from ""precious greenfields"" Ms Truss promised that if elected she would increase UK defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday evening has been cancelled, after Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss declined to take part. Instead, the remaining hopefuls will look to garner support from Tory MPs during a hustings hosted by the Onward think tank and the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs representing seats in the north of England. The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second. Rishi Sunak only gained three votes, showing that while he's been in front from the start it's not a runaway lead. It's a very tight race and at this point, impossible to call.

"Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race She came last in the latest round of voting by Conservative MPs with 59 votes Ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak wins the fourth round with 118 votes, three more than last time Trade minister Penny Mordaunt is second with 92 votes, gaining 10 votes since yesterday Although Foreign Secretary Liz Truss came third with 86 votes, she gained 15 votes - more than any other candidate - and is closing in on Mordaunt By Wednesday night we'll be left with just two candidates; Tory members then pick the winner who'll be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles Today's live page was brought to you by: Aoife Walsh, Jack Burgess, Richard Morris, Dulcie Lee, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. We are pausing our live coverage of the Tory leadership race shortly. But before we go, here's a recap of the latest developments on another busy day in Westminster:  We will finally know which two candidates have made it through to the last round of the Tory leadership contest tomorrow afternoon, with it largely expected to be Rishi Sunak versus Liz Truss or Penny Mordaunt. Voting begins at 1pm and closes at 3pm, with results announced at 4pm by Sir Graham Brady who is chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. At that point, over the course of the summer, Conservative party members will vote for the next prime minister. We will know the result by 5 September at the latest. Read more here.  A YouGov survey of 725 Conservative party members suggests former chancellor Rishi Sunak could lose the race to be the next PM to all of his remaining rivals. The survey suggests Foreign Secretary Liz Truss would beat Sunak by 54% to 35% if they stood against each other. It says Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt would also beat him 51% to 37% if they were both in the final two.  Tory leadership candidates are now taking part in more private hustings with the Northern Research Group of Conservative MPs and the Onward think tank ahead of tomorrow's vote. Rishi Sunak took the floor first, followed by Penny Mordaunt, who said she was feeling ""good"" as she entered the room. Liz Truss will speak to the groups later. Campaigners backing Liz Truss to be the next Tory leader are urging Kemi Badenoch's supporters to unite behind the foreign secretary. ""Kemi Badenoch has run a fantastic campaign and contributed enormously to the battle of ideas throughout this contest,"" a Truss campaign spokeswoman said. ""Now is the time for the party to unite behind a candidate who will govern in a Conservative way and who has shown she can deliver time and again."" Penny Mordaunt, who finished in second place in the latest ballot with 92 votes, has thanked colleagues who have supported her leadership campaign. She says: ""This afternoon colleagues once again put their trust in me and I cannot thank them enough. We are so nearly across the finish line. ""I am raring to go and excited to put my case to members across the country and win."" She praised Kemi Badenoch who was knocked out of the contest earlier. Her 59 votes will be crucial in deciding which candidates make the final two tomorrow. ""I want to pay tribute to my friend Kemi Badenoch who electrified the leadership contest with her fresh thinking and bold policies. She and I both know that the old way of government isn't working as it should,"" Mordaunt says. ""Voters want change and we owe it to them to offer a bold new vision for this country"". Conservative MP Ben Bradley says he will probably ""ignore the calls and have a glass of wine instead"" as he still hasn't decided who to back in the leadership election, now that the candidate he was supporting, Kemi Badenoch, has been knocked out He says over the last 12 days Badenoch has ""done an incredible job,"" and he wants to see her in the next cabinet. ""I'm disappointed that the prime minister's going,"" he says, ""in the current climate"" people are looking for ""something different"". He says his constituents like Badenoch's views as she speaks ""common sense"". He says he thinks ""Penny [Mordaunt's campaign] seems to have stalled in the last few days... there are more anti-Penny people than there are anti-Liz [Truss] people"". Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster In the corridors of parliament, the remaining
campaign teams are trying to put positive spins on the results. Liz Truss is making up ground on Penny Mordaunt but one of the Trade Ministerâs
backers stresses that âshe is still in second place"". She might have only just been eliminated, but the scramble for Kemi Badenochâs
votes is well under way. One of her supporters tells me heâs âdisappointedâ that sheâs been knocked out but expresses pride in her campaign. âSheâll be Prime Minister one dayâ, he
says. The same MP says the other campaign teams have already been phoning him: âItâs
like relatives turning up at the reading of a will.â He also tells me there is an âanyone but Rishiâ camp in the party. Many MPs admit there is tactical voting going on, making it very difficult to
predict what happens next. Kemi Badenochhas said on Twitter,externalshe's ""grateful"" to her colleagues and the Conservative Party members who supported her leadership bid. After being knocked out of the contest this afternoon, she praised the progress her campaign made, saying it began ""less than two weeks ago"". ""What we've achieved demonstrates the level of support for our vision of change for our country and for the Conservative Party"", she says. She finished her tweet by saying ""Thank you"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Although she's left the race, Kemi Badenoch is undoubtedly the breakthrough candidate of this campaign. She won support and gained attention with her straight talking approach, pitch for honesty and firm grasp of complex issues. While other candidates scrapped about whether to cut taxes, Badenoch was clearly trying to set a new agenda. Whether colleagues agreed with her or not, many admired her command of social and cultural issues which have divided the party. One MP, backing a rival candidate, described her as ""the new darling of the right"" With a group of 59 MPs behind her, she could still have a big influence on the outcome of the race by openly backing one of the remaining contenders. Maria Miller MP says she is ""absolutely"" confident Penny Mordaunt can take on Rishi Sunak if she secures a place in the final two tomorrow. Miller says Mordaunt's team will be focusing on trying to win over those who were supporting Kemi Badenoch, who was eliminated from the contest this afternoon. ""We'll be continuing to press Penny's strong policies on the economy and the fact that she is really a fresh choice for our membership to be able to have on their final ballet paper,"" Miller says. She adds Tory MPs want ""more than anything else"" to win the next general election and Mordaunt is the strongest candidate to do that. Former Tory leader and Liz Truss-backer Iain Duncan Smith has been telling the BBC he thinks she ""has the momentum"" after Kemi Badenoch was knocked out of the contest during the latest round of voting. He said he believes Truss has ""garnered a wide range of support"" among Conservative MPs and her supporters ""cover everybody"". She came third in the latest ballot, with 86 votes, and is through to tomorow's final vote. She picked up 15 new supporters compared to the previous round - that's around half of people who had been backing Tom Tugendhat who left the contest yesterday. Meanwhile Rishi Sunak won today's vote with 118 - Penny Mordaunt came second with 92. After making it through to the final round of MPsâ voting, Liz Trussâs backers will now be shoring up her support to try to secure a place in the final two. They'll be buoyed by the latest result - she's narrowed the gap between herself and her rival Penny Mordaunt, who remains in second place but just six votes ahead. Truss has set out a markedly different vision for the UK than the apparent man to beat, Rishi Sunak, promising immediate tax cuts and the reversal of the rise in National Insurance. The foreign secretary sought support from the right of the party, and early into her bid won the backing of Johnson loyalists Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. Weâll find out in about 24 hoursâ time whether sheâs succeeded in finding enough support to get her over the line.

The new Conservative Party leader and prime minister will be announced on 5 September. Former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting with 59 votes. Badenoch is seen as being on the right of the party and stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform while arguing for the state to be slimmed down. Before the contest began, the 42-year-old was rarely mentioned as a major contender to succeed Boris Johnson, but she saw off some big names early in the race, placing fourth in Monday's round of voting. Team Badenoch had been hoping to gain enough momentum to surpass her rival Liz Truss, after she trailed the foreign secretary by just 13 votes on Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

One MP, backing a rival candidate, described her as ""the new darling of the right"" With a group of 59 MPs behind her, she could still have a big influence on the outcome of the race by openly backing one of the remaining contenders. Maria Miller MP says she is ""absolutely"" confident Penny Mordaunt can take on Rishi Sunak if she secures a place in the final two tomorrow. Miller says Mordaunt's team will be focusing on trying to win over those who were supporting Kemi Badenoch, who was eliminated from the contest this afternoon. ""We'll be continuing to press Penny's strong policies on the economy and the fact that she is really a fresh choice for our membership to be able to have on their final ballet paper,"" Miller says. She adds Tory MPs want ""more than anything else"" to win the next general election and Mordaunt is the strongest candidate to do that. Former Tory leader and Liz Truss-backer Iain Duncan Smith has been telling the BBC he thinks she ""has the momentum"" after Kemi Badenoch was knocked out of the contest during the latest round of voting. He said he believes Truss has ""garnered a wide range of support"" among Conservative MPs and her supporters ""cover everybody"". She came third in the latest ballot, with 86 votes, and is through to tomorow's final vote. She picked up 15 new supporters compared to the previous round - that's around half of people who had been backing Tom Tugendhat who left the contest yesterday. Meanwhile Rishi Sunak won today's vote with 118 - Penny Mordaunt came second with 92. After making it through to the final round of MPsâ voting, Liz Trussâs backers will now be shoring up her support to try to secure a place in the final two. They'll be buoyed by the latest result - she's narrowed the gap between herself and her rival Penny Mordaunt, who remains in second place but just six votes ahead. Truss has set out a markedly different vision for the UK than the apparent man to beat, Rishi Sunak, promising immediate tax cuts and the reversal of the rise in National Insurance. The foreign secretary sought support from the right of the party, and early into her bid won the backing of Johnson loyalists Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. Weâll find out in about 24 hoursâ time whether sheâs succeeded in finding enough support to get her over the line. Find out more about Truss - including the time she played Margaret Thatcher in a play -here. This video can not be played Kemi Badenoch has failed to make the final three in the Conservative leadership contest after receiving the lowest number of votes from MPs. Sir Graham Brady has just been announcing the results of the latest round of voting.  Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second. Rishi Sunak only gained three votes, showing that while he's been in front from the start it's not a runaway lead. It's a very tight race and at this point, impossible to call.  Kemi Badenochhas been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunaksecured the most votes in the fourth ballot among Tory MPs, withPenny Mordauntcoming second. The votes were as follows:  The three remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where MPs will pick a final two candidates. Voting will then be thrown open to all Conservative Party members to pick the winner, after a series of hustings throughout August. The new Conservative Party leader and prime minister will be announced on 5 September. Former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting with 59 votes. Badenoch is seen as being on the right of the party and stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform while arguing for the state to be slimmed down. Before the contest began, the 42-year-old was rarely mentioned as a major contender to succeed Boris Johnson, but she saw off some big names early in the race, placing fourth in Monday's round of voting. Team Badenoch had been hoping to gain enough momentum to surpass her rival Liz Truss, after she trailed the foreign secretary by just 13 votes on Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Artwork: The single-engine vehicles would be reusable. They would return after a mission Aeroengineers are to investigate the potential of hypersonic technologies for use by British armed forces. Russia, China and the US are all developing missiles that can travel through the atmosphere at many times the speed of sound, making them very difficult to track and shoot down. The UK project, announced at the Farnborough Air Show, would look to develop a super-fast, uncrewed air vehicle that could deliver payloads at great distance and then return to be used again. The team behind the venture includes Rolls-Royce, the RAF, the defence research agency DSTL and the Oxfordshire company Reaction Engines. It's also got the backing of the UK's National Security Strategic Investment Fund. UK to boost research on hypersonic missile defence Could Chinaâs hypersonic missile spark a new arms race? The consortium has already begun its work and will aim to fly a demonstrator ""well within this decade"". A model of this, which might approach the size of a Hawk trainer jet and is codenamed ""Concept V"", was unveiled at the show. Air Vice-Marshal Linc Taylor, the RAF's Chief of Staff Air Capability, won't discuss the applications for such a system, but says the UK has some novel technologies that could allow it do things differently to those seen elsewhere in the world, and at much lower cost. ""One of the things we believe will have value in our future way of war-fighting, changing the way we fight, is in reusable hypersonics,"" he told reporters. ""At the moment we're exploring the technologies. If they do come to fruition, we will then go, 'Okay, this does have utility, we have the evidence behind it', and then we'll develop it."" Reaction Engines unveiled a scale version of the Concept V at Farnborough The Hypersonic Air Vehicle Experimental (HVX) Programme will be using innovations in air-breathing propulsion developed over many years by Reaction Engines for a reusable spaceplane. Essentially, this will see pre-cooler heat-exchangers put on the front of a jet engine to allow it to achieve velocities in excess of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound; approaching 4,000mph). At these hypersonic speeds, the temperature generated inside a gas turbine would begin to melt components unless they were cooled in some way or made from exotic materials. ""Thermal management is absolutely key to this project. Because, as you all know, the faster you go, the hotter it gets, and we're talking about a vehicle that potentially could travel a mile a second in terms of speed and where temperatures would be in excess of 1,000 degrees centigrade,"" explained Mark Thomas from Reactions Engines. ""That's what our cooling technology allows. It takes that heat threat away and drops the temperature from 1,000 degrees, or above, to ambient in less than a blink of an eye."" Along with Rolls-Royce, Reaction Engines had started investigating this approach in 2018, using an EJ200, the gas turbine that powers the RAF's Eurofighter-Typhoon fighter. They'll take the lessons learned from that exercise but apply them to a smaller, undisclosed jet engine. A pre-cooler will rapidly chill the air flow entering an engine The model unveiled at the show is indicative only. How it would actually look is uncertain at the moment. The HVX programme will prove the engine architecture first and then wrap an appropriate air frame around it. ""There are many challenges in producing this vehicle. One is enabling the engine to perform efficiently at those high speeds, not just survive them,"" said Ed Gower, who leads the HVX programme at Reaction Engines. ""The key USP to what we're doing here is that it's not a missile; it's something that is able to return sub-sonically. Because of that it will need to operate at high speed and low speed, which is obviously what distinguishes it from something like a ramjet on a missile,"" he told BBC News. Air Vice-Marshal Linc Taylor said the concept must be delivered for a cost that's much less than would normally be expected for an experimental plane - much less than Â£400m. ""One of the things we're looking at is how can we do this for a fraction of the cost that our adversaries might spend in this area,"" he explained.

"Olena Zelenska's visit to Washington comes after nearly five months of war in Ukraine Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, is in the US for a series of high-level meetings and an address to Congress. Her visit comes four months after her husband, President Volodymyr Zelensky, made a virtual speech to Congress, pressing for more military equipment. Ms Zelenska met Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday and is due to hold talks with her counterpart Jill Biden on Tuesday, the White House said. She is due to deliver remarks to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Tuesday's encounter will be the second time the two first ladies have met, after Dr Biden made an unannounced visit to Ukraine in May. Ms Zelenska has no official portfolio in the Ukrainian government. But after nearly five months of Russia's war in Ukraine, Kyiv is keen to seek more military aid and political backing from the US. Congress has already approved nearly $40bn (Â£33bn) in aid to Ukraine that is due to be fully delivered by the end of September. On Monday, Ms Zelenska also met Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development. The agency has given billions of dollars to support Ukraine's government and for humanitarian needs, as well as working to tackle a global food shortage aggravated by Russia's war.

"Vladimir Putin met his Iranian and Turkish counterparts in Tehran on Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin met Turkish and Iranian leaders in Tehran on Tuesday - only his second foreign trip since he launched the invasion of Ukraine in February. Unblocking Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea was high on the agenda - Mr Putin said progress had been made. The civil war in Syria was also discussed, with Turkey and Russia historically backing opposing sides. The summit was a chance for Mr Putin to show he still has international allies. Speaking after his meeting with the Russian president, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran and Moscow should strengthen their ties, and suggested that the West was to blame for the war in Ukraine. ""If you did not take the initiative, the other side would have caused the war with its own initiative,"" Mr Khamenei told Mr Putin. The US said the Russian leader's visit to Iran showed how isolated Russia has become in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Invading your neighbour, a sovereign independent country, tends to lose you friends. And Russia's lost plenty after invading Ukraine. In the West Moscow has achieved pariah status. But the Kremlin is keen to show that international sanctions have failed to isolate Russia, the world's largest country, and that some of its friends are sticking around. Like Turkey and Iran. Russia will use the three-way summit on Syria to try to demonstrate it retains powerful allies and geo-political influence. But we're not talking BFF (best friends forever). Turkey and Iran are also Russia's rivals. Turkey and Russia are on opposing sides in Syria and in Libya; they are competing for influence in the South Caucasus; Turkish combat drones have been supporting the Ukrainian military. As for Iran, it's competing with Russia in global energy markets. True, Russia, Turkey and Iran do have some common interests. But that is no guarantee of  long-lasting friendship. In Tehran, Mr Putin also held his first face-to-face meeting since the start of the war with the leader of a Nato country, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Despite being a key member of the Western military alliance, Turkey has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow, with Mr Erdogan's government seeking to play the role of mediator. Most recently, Ankara has been trying to negotiate an end to the grain blockade in the Black Sea, which is stopping millions of tonnes of desperately needed grain from leaving Ukraine and being delivered to countries around the world. Russia's Black Sea fleet is said to be stopping any shipments getting in or out, and the BBC has documentedmounting evidence that Moscow's forces have stolen and exported Ukrainian grain.Other routes have been heavily mined. On Tuesday, Mr Putin said progress had been made on the issue, and thanked Mr Erdogan for mediating the talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Later the Russian president told journalists that Moscow would facilitate the export of Ukrainian grain, if ""all restrictions related to air deliveries for the export of Russian grain"" were lifted. The three countries' leaders also discussed the long-running war in Syria, with Iran and Russia supporting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey backing rebel forces. Turkey has threatened to launch a fresh offensive in northern Syria against US-backed Kurdish militants, a move which both Iran and Russia oppose. The operation is part of Mr Erdogan's plans to create a 30km (20 mile) safe zone along Turkey's border with Syria. Mr Erdogan said he expects support from Russia and Iran ""in its fight against terrorism"". Last week, the UN Security Council agreed to re-authorise cross-border deliveries of aid to rebel-held Syria for six months after Russia had initially blocked a proposal for a one-year extension.

"Beihai is a popular tourist destination in China More than 2,000 tourists have been stranded in a Chinese coastal city after a surge in coronavirus cases. Officials in Beihai locked down urban areas and ordered the mass testing of its 1.9m residents over the weekend. It comes as concerns grow about the impact of China's ""zero-Covid"" policy on the world's second largest economy. Last week, official figures showed the country's economy shrank in the second quarter of this year as Covid-19 restrictions hit firms and consumers. Beihai, which is a popular summer destination in China's southern Guangxi region, recorded more than 450 infections in the five days to 16 July. While that level of cases may seem low by international standards it is considered high under the Chinese government's approach to the pandemic. On Sunday, Beihai's local government said tourists who had not been in contact with anyone who had contracted the virus, or visited medium or high-risk areas, would be allowed to leave if they showed a negative Covid-19 test. The rest must stay in the city and be quarantined, officials told a news conference. China economy shrinks on zero-Covid policy China to repay customers after mass bank protests One tourist on holiday in Beihai expressed her frustration in a comment on the social media platform Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, which has received more than 2,700 likes. ""I just finished my 3 months lockdown in Shanghai. I just came to Beihai for a breath of fresh air, did I annoy anyone?"" she said. Elsewhere in China authorities are stepping up measures to combat rising Covid cases. On Monday, Shanghai's local government said it would require residents in more than half of its 16 districts to be tested for the virus, after holding similar tests last week. The major financial, trade and manufacturing centre onlyreopened in Juneafter a two-month lockdown. It is one of several large Chinese cities that are tackling new clusters of infections. The Covid situation in China has ""worsened slightly on a national level"" over the past week, Japanese banking giant Nomura said in a note on Monday. ""Based on our own survey, 41 cities are currently implementing full or partial lockdowns or some kind of district-based control measures, which involve stringent measures restricting the mobility of local residents,"" analysts Ting Lu, Jing Wang and Harrington Zhang said. ""These 41 cities make up 18.7% of China's population and 22.8% of China's GDP [Gross Domestic Product],"" they added. On Friday, government data showed thecountry's economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of this yearas widespread coronavirus lockdowns had a major impact on businesses and consumers. GDP fell by 2.6% in the three months to the end of June from the previous quarter. Large cities across China, including Shanghai, were put into full or partial lockdowns during this period as the country continues to pursue its zero-Covid policy. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy.

A YouGov survey of 725 Conservative party members suggests former chancellor Rishi Sunak could lose the race to be the next PM to all of his remaining rivals. The survey suggests Foreign Secretary Liz Truss would beat Sunak by 54% to 35% if they stood against each other. It says Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt would also beat him 51% to 37% if they were both in the final two.  Tory leadership candidates are now taking part in more private hustings with the Northern Research Group of Conservative MPs and the Onward think tank ahead of tomorrow's vote. Rishi Sunak took the floor first, followed by Penny Mordaunt, who said she was feeling ""good"" as she entered the room. Liz Truss will speak to the groups later. Campaigners backing Liz Truss to be the next Tory leader are urging Kemi Badenoch's supporters to unite behind the foreign secretary. ""Kemi Badenoch has run a fantastic campaign and contributed enormously to the battle of ideas throughout this contest,"" a Truss campaign spokeswoman said. ""Now is the time for the party to unite behind a candidate who will govern in a Conservative way and who has shown she can deliver time and again."" Penny Mordaunt, who finished in second place in the latest ballot with 92 votes, has thanked colleagues who have supported her leadership campaign. She says: ""This afternoon colleagues once again put their trust in me and I cannot thank them enough. We are so nearly across the finish line. ""I am raring to go and excited to put my case to members across the country and win."" She praised Kemi Badenoch who was knocked out of the contest earlier. Her 59 votes will be crucial in deciding which candidates make the final two tomorrow. ""I want to pay tribute to my friend Kemi Badenoch who electrified the leadership contest with her fresh thinking and bold policies. She and I both know that the old way of government isn't working as it should,"" Mordaunt says. ""Voters want change and we owe it to them to offer a bold new vision for this country"". Conservative MP Ben Bradley says he will probably ""ignore the calls and have a glass of wine instead"" as he still hasn't decided who to back in the leadership election, now that the candidate he was supporting, Kemi Badenoch, has been knocked out He says over the last 12 days Badenoch has ""done an incredible job,"" and he wants to see her in the next cabinet. ""I'm disappointed that the prime minister's going,"" he says, ""in the current climate"" people are looking for ""something different"". He says his constituents like Badenoch's views as she speaks ""common sense"". He says he thinks ""Penny [Mordaunt's campaign] seems to have stalled in the last few days... there are more anti-Penny people than there are anti-Liz [Truss] people"". Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster In the corridors of parliament, the remaining
campaign teams are trying to put positive spins on the results. Liz Truss is making up ground on Penny Mordaunt but one of the Trade Ministerâs
backers stresses that âshe is still in second place"". She might have only just been eliminated, but the scramble for Kemi Badenochâs
votes is well under way. One of her supporters tells me heâs âdisappointedâ that sheâs been knocked out but expresses pride in her campaign. âSheâll be Prime Minister one dayâ, he
says. The same MP says the other campaign teams have already been phoning him: âItâs
like relatives turning up at the reading of a will.â He also tells me there is an âanyone but Rishiâ camp in the party. Many MPs admit there is tactical voting going on, making it very difficult to
predict what happens next. Kemi Badenochhas said on Twitter,externalshe's ""grateful"" to her colleagues and the Conservative Party members who supported her leadership bid. After being knocked out of the contest this afternoon, she praised the progress her campaign made, saying it began ""less than two weeks ago"". ""What we've achieved demonstrates the level of support for our vision of change for our country and for the Conservative Party"", she says. She finished her tweet by saying ""Thank you"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Although she's left the race, Kemi Badenoch is undoubtedly the breakthrough candidate of this campaign. She won support and gained attention with her straight talking approach, pitch for honesty and firm grasp of complex issues. While other candidates scrapped about whether to cut taxes, Badenoch was clearly trying to set a new agenda. Whether colleagues agreed with her or not, many admired her command of social and cultural issues which have divided the party. One MP, backing a rival candidate, described her as ""the new darling of the right"" With a group of 59 MPs behind her, she could still have a big influence on the outcome of the race by openly backing one of the remaining contenders. Maria Miller MP says she is ""absolutely"" confident Penny Mordaunt can take on Rishi Sunak if she secures a place in the final two tomorrow. Miller says Mordaunt's team will be focusing on trying to win over those who were supporting Kemi Badenoch, who was eliminated from the contest this afternoon. ""We'll be continuing to press Penny's strong policies on the economy and the fact that she is really a fresh choice for our membership to be able to have on their final ballet paper,"" Miller says. She adds Tory MPs want ""more than anything else"" to win the next general election and Mordaunt is the strongest candidate to do that. Former Tory leader and Liz Truss-backer Iain Duncan Smith has been telling the BBC he thinks she ""has the momentum"" after Kemi Badenoch was knocked out of the contest during the latest round of voting. He said he believes Truss has ""garnered a wide range of support"" among Conservative MPs and her supporters ""cover everybody"". She came third in the latest ballot, with 86 votes, and is through to tomorow's final vote. She picked up 15 new supporters compared to the previous round - that's around half of people who had been backing Tom Tugendhat who left the contest yesterday. Meanwhile Rishi Sunak won today's vote with 118 - Penny Mordaunt came second with 92. After making it through to the final round of MPsâ voting, Liz Trussâs backers will now be shoring up her support to try to secure a place in the final two. They'll be buoyed by the latest result - she's narrowed the gap between herself and her rival Penny Mordaunt, who remains in second place but just six votes ahead. Truss has set out a markedly different vision for the UK than the apparent man to beat, Rishi Sunak, promising immediate tax cuts and the reversal of the rise in National Insurance. The foreign secretary sought support from the right of the party, and early into her bid won the backing of Johnson loyalists Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg.

Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The placings haven't changed but a close look at the numbers tells us how unpredictable this contest is. Thirty one votes were up for grabs from Tom Tugendhat's supporters after he was eliminated in the last round. It's clear they haven't moved as a block as all the candidates have gained votes. Liz Truss has kept up her momentum but not enough to leapfrog Penny Mordaunt who picked up enough votes to stay in second. Rishi Sunak only gained three votes, showing that while he's been in front from the start it's not a runaway lead. It's a very tight race and at this point, impossible to call.  Kemi Badenochhas been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunaksecured the most votes in the fourth ballot among Tory MPs, withPenny Mordauntcoming second. The votes were as follows:  The three remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where MPs will pick a final two candidates. Voting will then be thrown open to all Conservative Party members to pick the winner, after a series of hustings throughout August. The new Conservative Party leader and prime minister will be announced on 5 September. Former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting with 59 votes. Badenoch is seen as being on the right of the party and stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform while arguing for the state to be slimmed down. Before the contest began, the 42-year-old was rarely mentioned as a major contender to succeed Boris Johnson, but she saw off some big names early in the race, placing fourth in Monday's round of voting. Team Badenoch had been hoping to gain enough momentum to surpass her rival Liz Truss, after she trailed the foreign secretary by just 13 votes on Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Voting has closed in the latest Tory MPs' ballot to decide the two leadership candidates to be put to a vote of members. One of the four remaining contenders - Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss, and Kemi Badenoch - will be eliminated after Tuesday's vote. Mr Sunak looks almost certain to make the final two, with the other three candidates vying for second place. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat was knocked out after Monday's vote of MPs. A result from Tuesday's vote is expected around 15.00 BST. A further vote will follow on Wednesday to pick the final two contenders. Tory party members will then pick the winner after a summer of campaigning by the two final contenders, with a result announced on 5 September. The BBC has announced that it willbroadcast a live TV debatewith the final two candidates on Monday, with the broadcaster confirming all four remaining candidates have agreed to take part if they make it to the final two. Sunak tops Tory poll, as Tugendhat eliminated Who could be the next prime minister? Mason: Sunak ahead but Tory race still very much on Backbench MP Mr Tugendhat was eliminated after receiving 31 votes, down one from his performance in the second round last Thursday. The other candidates placed in the same order as on Thursday, with former chancellor Mr Sunak coming out on top having gained 14 votes for a total of 115. Trade Minister Ms Mordaunt dropped one vote but held onto second place with 82 votes, while Foreign Secretary Ms Truss gained seven votes to bring her total up to 71. Ms Badenoch, a former equalities minister, placed fourth with 58 votes, up nine from the previous round. Following Monday's vote, a source close to Ms Badenoch's campaign said she had ""greater momentum"" than her main rivals for the second spot, and the contest was ""all to play for"". The source added that Ms Truss had ""only added seven votes"" and ""hasn't made a breakthrough"", and Ms Mordaunt had ""gone backwards"". But Ms Mordaunt described her vote as ""steady"", and she was ""thrilled to be in second place once more"". A source within Ms Truss's campaign told the BBC she was ""confident"" of making it through to the final round. ""MPs who don't want Rishi Sunak to be PM need to think about who is most likely to beat him in the final two, and can turn the economy round and win an election. Liz is the best bet,"" they added. A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled after Mr Sunak and Ms Truss declined to take part, and amid concern among senior Tories that airing disagreements in public could damage the party. In seven weeks' time, we will have a new prime minister. For centuries in this country, with a few exceptions, we have collectively been in the habit of getting white men to run the place. We now know for certain that that isn't going to happen this time around. We are now down to the final quartet: former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch. And so to Round Four. Read Chris's analysis in full As the scramble for MPs' votes continues, Ms Mordaunt has pledged that is she wins power, at least half the UK's new nuclear and hydrogen energy capacity will be located in northern Britain. In anarticle for the Daily Telegraph,external, she has also pledged to replace house building targets for councils with ""incentives"" to build more, and channel development away from ""precious greenfields"". Meanwhile, Ms Truss has promised that if elected she would increase UK defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030, to guard against the threats of an ""increasingly dangerous world"". Earlier, Boris Johnson held his final Cabinet meeting, telling ministers schools should remain open and transport systems should keep running during the current heatwave. And he said it was right the UK was pushing for the target of net zero. At the end of cabinet, ministers gave him six first editions of Winston Churchill's books on World War Two.

Voting will then be thrown open to all Conservative Party members to pick the winner, after a series of hustings throughout August. The new Conservative Party leader and prime minister will be announced on 5 September. Former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting with 59 votes. Badenoch is seen as being on the right of the party and stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform while arguing for the state to be slimmed down. Before the contest began, the 42-year-old was rarely mentioned as a major contender to succeed Boris Johnson, but she saw off some big names early in the race, placing fourth in Monday's round of voting. Team Badenoch had been hoping to gain enough momentum to surpass her rival Liz Truss, after she trailed the foreign secretary by just 13 votes on Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Mike Harvey grows enough veg on his allotment to feed his family all year round The rising cost of food is strengthening arguments for Wales to grow more of its own vegetables. Higher energy prices and the war in Ukraine have caused the price of frozen vegetables to skyrocket - a trend one economist said would continue. Wales uses only a fraction of its land to grow vegetables and the amount has halved since 1998. But higher prices could make vegetables more viable for farmers and force some people to grow their own. ""I love growing food for me and for other people,"" said farmer Katherine Langton. ""I never realised as a kid that you could do farming as a job. As soon as I realised that this was kind of a viable option for someone, I thought 'hang on, this is what I should do'."" From lockdown hobby to life-changing business What's happening to pick-your-own fruit farms? Along with her partner David Langton, the 27-year-old started a business in 2020, renting a two-acre field in Crickhowell, Powys, and growing fruit, vegetables and flowers. They supply weekly boxes of vegetables and fruit to 60 families, sell in the town's market and donate any unsold veg to a nearby food bank. Katherine and David Langton grow vegetable for about 60 families Katherine and David did not grow up in farming families, so ""watched a lot of YouTube videos"" to get to grips. They live near their crops in a caravan and have plans to expand in the future. There is enough work for them to employ extra workers, for about 40 hours a week. Their story runs counter to the trend in Wales in recent decades. The rising cost of living could see more people growing their own vegetables, like these potatoes at an allotment in Blaenau Gwent Official figures indicated since 1998 the amount of agricultural land used to grow vegetables and salad halved, from 587 hectares to 298 hectares last year. The number of regular and casual farmer workers also fell, from 16,610 to 12,448. Dr Huw Dixon, of Cardiff University, said food prices would continue to go up because of the energy that goes into production, from fuel in a farmer's tractor to the electricity in processing plants. The invasion of Ukraine, a major food exporter, is pushing prices even higher, he added. ""Also there is climate change... droughts in France, which is one of the biggest grain producers, and floods in India which exports a lot of wheat,"" he said. ""Harvests across the world are being affected."" Prof Dixon said farmers needed help to produce more fruit and vegetables and everyone should be trying to grow their own food. Katherine Langton says she never considered growing vegetables as a job when she was younger The allotment in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, was created during World War One to help families feed themselves. A century later it is again full of a huge variety of vegetables and feeding families trying to make ends meet. Mike Harvey says growing your own vegetables is not hard Mike Harvey one of the allotment owners, said: ""It is not difficult, you take a pack of carrot seed, 200 in the pack. I had two packets, that's 400 carrots, potentially."" Mike and his allotment neighbour Dai Lewis grow potatoes, onions, beans, carrots, and tomatoes and produce enough to see them through most of the year with enough leftover to give plenty away. ""Fresh stuff tastes better than what you get in the supermarkets because what you grow in a container out the back garden has not been sprayed,"" he added. Dai Lewis digging up fresh spuds at his allotment in Brynmawr You do not even need a garden, Mr Harvey said, explaining how you can grow vegetables on a patio or in a yard using an old dustbin or even, like him, an old bathtub. Growing a row of stick beans and spuds in the garden was a central part of rural and valleys life a generation ago. But some large farmers said they would struggle to make money growing vegetables. ""We would have to do 20 acres to make it worthwhile,"" said Tom Rees, 33, who farms with his father, uncle, brother and cousin at Pendoylan, Vale of Glamorgan. They raise cows and sheep on a 950-acre farm, large by Welsh standards, growing barley and maize to feed their livestock. Farmer Tom Rees says right now he is better off raising livestock ""We would need a huge level of investment to grow the vegetable crops and store them in temperature-controlled storage,"" Mr Rees said. ""We'd be better off doing what we are doing."" He explained they would have to hire extra workers for a twenty-acre vegetable operation. ""Getting hold of labour is hard enough in the UK since Brexit,"" Mr Rees said. ""I'm better putting my knowledge into growing beef."" The Welsh government recentlypublished the support it proposes to give farmers,externalin the future. Growing vegetables and fruit will get some support, but it is too early to know how many farmers will take up the challenge or whether the demands of the wider food industry make that too much of a problem for them.

"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate since 2001 when taking into account rising prices, official figures show. Between March and May, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.8% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation - the fastest drop since records began. Household budgets are being hit by soaring food, fuel and energy costs, with inflation at a 40-year high. Pay growth was much higher for the private sector than the public sector. For March to May, average total pay for the private sector was 7.2% higher than the same period last year, before taking account of inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). For the public sector the figure was 1.5%. Pay including bonuses was down 0.9% when adjusted for inflation. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices It comes as the government is due to unveil this year's pay deal for 2.5 million public sector workers,including teachers, nurses, doctors, police officers and members of the armed forces. Unions are calling for wages to reflect the cost of living - but ministers have signalled the pay deal will not match price rises, warning this would push inflation even higher. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 9.1% in May, the highest level in 40 years, and is expected to climb further by the autumn. James Reed, chairman of Reed, one of the UK's largest recruitment businesses, said the UK was seeing ""a two-speed workforce"", with big pay offers being made to people with certain skills. ""So you might be seeing 25% plus pay offer increases to get people to move jobs. But then we're seeing other parts of the economy where pay hasn't moved much at all and that is concerning because more and more people will end up living in in-work poverty,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Virgin Money is the latest company to offer a one-off payment to help employees cope with the rising cost of living, with all staff on a salary of Â£50,000 or less to get a Â£1,000 lump sum in August. Firms including Lloyds Bank have also offered similar payments. Max Poynton says his doughnut firm is finding it difficult to recruit new staff With job vacancies at near record highs, many sectors are struggling to recruit. Max Poynton, operations director at Project D, a doughnut firm in Derby, said it was particularly hard to find experienced people. ""I think a lot of people after the pandemic have gone and retrained, upskilled themselves and the same pool of people that was there before maybe isn't there anymore."" He knows staff are struggling, with some ride-sharing on their way into work to save money. Some have asked directly for a pay rise but with the business facing increased costs on everything from electricity to diesel to flour and icing, he says it is simply not an option. ""I'd love to be able to say yes but at the moment it's tough to offer any sort of pay rises, especially with the uncertainty of not knowing how much our costs are going to increase over the next six months."" Dan Bond is feeling the impact of rising prices Dan Bond, who works in the doughnut factory, said his last pay rise was in April when the minimum wage went up. Since then Dan, who drives to work, has seen a huge rise in the cost of filling up his tank. However, he is unsure whether he would ask his employer for a pay rise. ""I know they're also experiencing hard times,"" he said. ""So do I put that pressure on as well?"" Business groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said companies were struggling with higher wage demands from staff and that salary increases were beginning to hold back growth and investment. Jane Gratton, from the BCC, told the Commons Business Committee small businesses were losing candidates to other employers offering higher pay and were worried about how they could compete with bigger firms. But Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the committee workers were facing a ""pay crisis"" and the argument that the country was in a ""pay inflation spiral"" was ""nonsense"". The jobs market is still hot, with unemployment down and vacancies up near records. However, the ONS says it doesn't see evidence of the dreaded ""wage-price"" spiral that would entrench the current high rates of inflation. Indeed the flip side of that is the biggest real squeeze on pay since these records were first collected two decades ago, and probably for significantly before that too. Pay settlements are not ""inflationary"" as they are not exceeding inflation. Though there is some evidence in certain sectors and local settings, with worker shortages, of unionised workplaces securing double digit pay rises. Other workplaces in construction and manufacturing see employers paying retention bonuses and cost of living lump sums. On average, while not inflationary, these settlements are high in cash terms. It is notable too that from March to May, average total pay including bonuses was up 7.2% in the private sector compared to the previous year, but up just 1.5% in the public sector. Little wonder that those in the public sector say that some of the visible chaos seen in social care and the health system reflects low-paid public sector workers jumping ship to better paid jobs at the likes of supermarkets and Amazon. This reduction in the social care workforce is crippling the sector enough to cause queues of ambulances unable to offload patients into hospitals unable to discharge their patients. Much of this boils down to a singular factor, not even discussed in the current contest to run the country - significant shortages of labour. Job vacancies continued to increase between April and June - up 6,900 compared to the previous quarter - although the rate is slowing. The accommodation and food service sectors saw the biggest rise but this was offset by falls in other industries, including wholesale and retail trade and motor vehicle repairs. ONS head of labour market and household statistics, David Freeman, said demand for labour was ""clearly still very high"", with unemployment falling again and another record low for redundancies. For March to May, the unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%, a fall of 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous three-month period. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the figures ""underline how strong our jobs market continues to be"". But he added: ""I am acutely aware that rising prices are affecting how far people's hard-earned income goes, so we are providing help for households through cash grants and tax cuts."" However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the Conservatives had ""failed to grow the economy, which has left people more exposed to inflation and the cost-of-living crisis"".

"The London Fire Brigade declares a major incident after a number of fires break out in areas around the capital A major blaze in the village of Wennington, in east London, burns fields and sets homes alight The UK records its hottest-ever temperature, with 40.3C recorded in Coningsby in Lincolnshire Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record of 38.7C recorded in Cambridge in July 2019, the Met Office says People in the capital are urged not to have barbeques or bonfires due to the risk of fire The extreme heat is fuelled by climate change which is making heatwaves more intense, frequent and likely, scientists warn Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are also seeing temperatures soar, while wildfires still threaten parts of southwest France and Spain Edited by Emma Owen and Jeremy Gahagan We're going to leave our live coverage of the heatwave here for today. For a full overview of the day's events, read our main storyhere. And to see how hot it'll be overnight tonight,check out BBC Weather's latest forecast. Today's page was written by Adam Durbin, Krystyna Gajda, Laura Gozzi, James Harness, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Alex Therrien, Emma Owen, Chris Giles and Jeremy Gahagan. Today the UK officially reached 40C â something the Met Office said was ""virtually impossible"" in an undisrupted climate. But with human-induced climate change, such extreme temperatures have now become a reality. Let's take look at the day:  Get your latest weather forecasthere. Want more?WatchThe UKâs Hottest Day, A New Normal?with BBC Weatherâs Nick Miller on BBC iPlayer now Smoke columns rise from the grassland fires in Dartford, Kent Firefighters have been tackling many fires across the country, including a number in and around the capital, leading to London Fire Brigade declaring a major incident. Some of these include: Merlyn ThomasBBC climate change disinformation specialist A Met Office meteorologist has debunked a misleading map
which has been gaining traction on social media. The image above, designed to downplay the heatwave and cast
doubt on climate change, spread on groups and accounts including some that post
debunked weather conspiracy theories. But the comparison is misleading. For one thing, the map on
the left appears to be an older BBC map which did not use colour zones for
temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent
redesign, and the image on the right is not from the current heat wave. Meterologist Aidan McGivern explained that temperature symbols and
colour scale were tweaked to make it more accessible to those, like him, who
are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds. The fire that broke out in Wennington is still burning, and London Fire Brigade are still at the scene this evening. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village, with the blaze igniting buildings and fields nearby. Around 100 firefighters have been working to bring it under control. But the BBC's Nick Johnson, who is in Wennington, says the situation has become more reassuring in the last half hour. He adds that it appears as if fire crews are starting to pack up and return to their engines after six hours of tackling the blaze. One firefighter helping to extinguish the blaze described the conditions as ""absolute hell"". Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Paris Here in Paris, itâs reached 41C. Walking around the city is
incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people
have brought fans along with them. In the capitalâs famous Tulleries garden, people have been taking
shade under some of the parkâs trees, making use of all available seating.
Thankfully the water fountains are still working. Meanwhile
at Paris' Gare du Nord station this afternoon, queues of people were seen waiting
for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly. Stephen RyanBBC News Greek
authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says. Paul KirbyDigital Europe editor The ferocious heatwave that has gripped Western Europe has shifted north and temperatures have climbed towards 40C in several areas. Parishas hit 40C today for only the third time on record.Germanyis having its hottest day of the year so far, and theNetherlandshas recorded its hottest 19 July ever, with 38.9C in Maastricht. One of the big supermarkets has halted home deliveries. The forest fires further south are still burning in France, Spain and Portugal, though. A BBC team has visited one of the five campsites that have burned down in the southwestern Gironde region and you can see what little is left. This video can not be played Heatwave: Surveying the damage after French fires InSpain, which has seen some of the highest temperatures on the continent, more than 60,000 hectares of land have burned in just a week. A fire also broke out in the dunes at theBelgiancoastal resort of De Haan on Tuesday, setting several vehicles alight. Italianforecasters are warning of temperatures as high as 40 to 42C between Wednesday and Friday. Experts at Italy's IlMeteo say new crevasses are opening up on Alpine peaks and ice is melting even on top of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. Todayâs extreme heat has certainly taken its toll on travel, with Network
Rail saying todayâs passenger train numbers are around 40% lower than this time
last week. There have been severe disruptions with all services to and from London
Euston suspended because of a lineside fire caused by overhead electric
cables brought down in Harrow. Similar problems with overhead lines meant trains were trapped on

evacuations of passengers. As weâve been reporting, there were no rail services into or out
of Kingâs Cross today, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services running north
of London. Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record today, the Met Office says in a Tweet.

We've now heard from his niece that the police have gone in to rescue him. Elsewhere in the village, a number of residents are worried about their pets, and there's concern for the livestock in a couple of nearby farms. There's a sense of the village being encircled by flames â it is boiling hot and tinder dry. But remarkably, villagers are very good-spirited, perhaps because there's a sense they really helped each other out in their moment of need. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate since 2001 when taking into account rising prices, official figures show. Between March and May, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.8% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation - the fastest drop since records began. Household budgets are being hit by soaring food, fuel and energy costs, with inflation at a 40-year high. Pay growth was much higher for the private sector than the public sector. For March to May, average total pay for the private sector was 7.2% higher than the same period last year, before taking account of inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). For the public sector the figure was 1.5%. Pay including bonuses was down 0.9% when adjusted for inflation. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices It comes as the government is due to unveil this year's pay deal for 2.5 million public sector workers,including teachers, nurses, doctors, police officers and members of the armed forces. Unions are calling for wages to reflect the cost of living - but ministers have signalled the pay deal will not match price rises, warning this would push inflation even higher. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 9.1% in May, the highest level in 40 years, and is expected to climb further by the autumn. James Reed, chairman of Reed, one of the UK's largest recruitment businesses, said the UK was seeing ""a two-speed workforce"", with big pay offers being made to people with certain skills. ""So you might be seeing 25% plus pay offer increases to get people to move jobs. But then we're seeing other parts of the economy where pay hasn't moved much at all and that is concerning because more and more people will end up living in in-work poverty,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Virgin Money is the latest company to offer a one-off payment to help employees cope with the rising cost of living, with all staff on a salary of Â£50,000 or less to get a Â£1,000 lump sum in August. Firms including Lloyds Bank have also offered similar payments. Max Poynton says his doughnut firm is finding it difficult to recruit new staff With job vacancies at near record highs, many sectors are struggling to recruit. Max Poynton, operations director at Project D, a doughnut firm in Derby, said it was particularly hard to find experienced people. ""I think a lot of people after the pandemic have gone and retrained, upskilled themselves and the same pool of people that was there before maybe isn't there anymore."" He knows staff are struggling, with some ride-sharing on their way into work to save money. Some have asked directly for a pay rise but with the business facing increased costs on everything from electricity to diesel to flour and icing, he says it is simply not an option. ""I'd love to be able to say yes but at the moment it's tough to offer any sort of pay rises, especially with the uncertainty of not knowing how much our costs are going to increase over the next six months."" Dan Bond is feeling the impact of rising prices Dan Bond, who works in the doughnut factory, said his last pay rise was in April when the minimum wage went up. Since then Dan, who drives to work, has seen a huge rise in the cost of filling up his tank. However, he is unsure whether he would ask his employer for a pay rise. ""I know they're also experiencing hard times,"" he said. ""So do I put that pressure on as well?"" Business groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said companies were struggling with higher wage demands from staff and that salary increases were beginning to hold back growth and investment. Jane Gratton, from the BCC, told the Commons Business Committee small businesses were losing candidates to other employers offering higher pay and were worried about how they could compete with bigger firms. But Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the committee workers were facing a ""pay crisis"" and the argument that the country was in a ""pay inflation spiral"" was ""nonsense"". The jobs market is still hot, with unemployment down and vacancies up near records. However, the ONS says it doesn't see evidence of the dreaded ""wage-price"" spiral that would entrench the current high rates of inflation. Indeed the flip side of that is the biggest real squeeze on pay since these records were first collected two decades ago, and probably for significantly before that too. Pay settlements are not ""inflationary"" as they are not exceeding inflation. Though there is some evidence in certain sectors and local settings, with worker shortages, of unionised workplaces securing double digit pay rises. Other workplaces in construction and manufacturing see employers paying retention bonuses and cost of living lump sums. On average, while not inflationary, these settlements are high in cash terms. It is notable too that from March to May, average total pay including bonuses was up 7.2% in the private sector compared to the previous year, but up just 1.5% in the public sector. Little wonder that those in the public sector say that some of the visible chaos seen in social care and the health system reflects low-paid public sector workers jumping ship to better paid jobs at the likes of supermarkets and Amazon. This reduction in the social care workforce is crippling the sector enough to cause queues of ambulances unable to offload patients into hospitals unable to discharge their patients. Much of this boils down to a singular factor, not even discussed in the current contest to run the country - significant shortages of labour. Job vacancies continued to increase between April and June - up 6,900 compared to the previous quarter - although the rate is slowing. The accommodation and food service sectors saw the biggest rise but this was offset by falls in other industries, including wholesale and retail trade and motor vehicle repairs. ONS head of labour market and household statistics, David Freeman, said demand for labour was ""clearly still very high"", with unemployment falling again and another record low for redundancies. For March to May, the unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%, a fall of 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous three-month period. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the figures ""underline how strong our jobs market continues to be"". But he added: ""I am acutely aware that rising prices are affecting how far people's hard-earned income goes, so we are providing help for households through cash grants and tax cuts."" However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the Conservatives had ""failed to grow the economy, which has left people more exposed to inflation and the cost-of-living crisis"".

"Inflation will be brought back under control by the government, Nadhim Zahawi said in his first speech as chancellor. The government will deliver ""sound public finances"" to help achieve that, Mr Zahawi said. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high of 9.1% and expected to rise further by the autumn. In his speech, Mr Zahawi set out aims for a post-Brexit shake up of financial services regulation. The priorities include changing regulation ""so that UK insurers have more flexibility to invest in long-term assets like infrastructure"". Mr Zahawi was appointed chancellor earlier this month following the resignation of Rishi Sunak and during a period of political upheaval that eventually led to the resignation of Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party. He stood for the party leadership but failed to attract enough support. In his Mansion House speech on Tuesday, Mr Zahawi said that despite the ""short-term uncertainty"" he would focus on providing ""stability, reassurance and continuity"". While the cost of living looms large over every decision made by the new chancellor, however long his stay is at Number 11, the main point of the Mansion House speech is to push a plan to repeal hundreds of pieces of retained EU law. The aim is to reform, in particular, EU solvency laws for insurers that the chancellor argues restricts the flexibility to invest in long-term infrastructure. This continues Rishi Sunak's agenda for the Bank of England to promote the growth and competitiveness of the financial services industry. Some fears were expressed that such moves could see more risks taken with financial stability. And a new Finance Bill is thought to contain more power for the government to overrule some Bank of England regulatory decisions. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey also addressed the same City audience, and they are keen to hear from both men, amid fears about a rapidly slowing economy, about exactly how inflation will be brought back under control. Official figures released last week showed the economy grew faster than expected in May, by 0.5%, after shrinking in April and March. However, businesses are reporting that higher running costs are leading them to put up prices for customers. And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, some economists say there still a risk the economy could fall into a recession. Cutting UK taxes now would be a mistake, says IMF UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Mr Zahawi set out three core priorities in his speech - controlling inflation; creating the conditions for a private sector recovery; and a ""post-Brexit vision"" for financial services. He said the government would concentrate on ""delivering sound public finances to avoid pushing up demand still further, providing help for households as they deal with the worst price rises in over a generation"". ""And, where we can, easing the supply constraints that are the underlying cause of high inflation."" Regarding financial services, Mr Zahawi said that Brexit would allow opportunities for the financial services industry. He committed to repealing ""hundreds of pieces of retained EU law and replacing them with a coherent and agile approach to financial regulation that is right for us"". Labour's Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq, said: ""All we have here are more woolly promises from a chancellor whose central pledge so far has been to ransack public services and provide a plethora of unfunded tax cuts. ""It has been six years since the Brexit vote, and the government still has nothing to offer the City other than rhetoric, empty promises and desperate threats to undermine the independence of our world-leading financial services regulators."" Mick McAteer, a former board member of the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said the government seemed ""intent on bringing in measures that will seriously compromise the independence"" of regulators. He told the BBC that proposals requiring regulators to promote the competitiveness of the City of London around the world would put pressure on them to reduce regulations, which was ""really bad news"" for consumer protection and the economy. Responding to Chancellor's speech, David Postings, Chief Executive of UK Finance, said: ""The Chancellor's vision in his Mansion House speech is for the UK to have a strong and internationally competitive banking and finance sector, which we strongly welcome. ""To ensure the sector continues to be successful, alongside maintaining the pace of reform, there needs to be a keen focus on international competitiveness from the next government,"" he added.

"Amazon is taking legal action against the administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups, the BBC has learned. It says the groups are generating fake reviews on Amazon marketplaces in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan. The tech giant says the groups offer money or free goods in exchange for reviews being posted on Amazon. One of the groups, removed earlier this year by Facebook's parent company Meta, had 43,000 members. It was called ""Amazon Product Review"". Once the people in the group had purchased selected products and left their reviews, the administrators would refund them. A wide range of goods was involved, including car stereos and camera tripods. Large numbers of reviews, especially positive ones, boost sellers' visibility on Amazon's platforms - as well as placing them higher up on search engine results. Amazon sellers can legitimately pay for services that promise to boost their ratings online, without necessarily knowing that this will be carried out in the form of fake reviews. The group admins disguised key phrases that would otherwise have been flagged by Meta's automated tools designed to seek out rule-breaking, Amazon said. One example shared was a Facebook post offering ""R*fnd Aftr R*vew"" (refund after review). Around half of the groups were taken down by Meta once they were reported by Amazon. However, Amazon told the BBC the administrators of all of them were being targeted. ""Pro-active legal action targeting bad actors is one of many ways we protect customers by holding bad actors accountable,"" said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon vice president of selling partner services. An example of one of the groups Amazon says was incentivising fake reviews The legal action has been filed at a court in Washington King County, near Amazon's Seattle headquarters. Meta said in a statement: ""Groups that solicit or encourage fake reviews violate our policies and are removed. We are working with Amazon on this matter and will continue to partner across the industry to address spam and fake reviews."" Earlier this year Amazonpursued four companies it accused of deliberately flooding its shopping platform with fake reviews. Undernew proposals currently under consideration in the UKit would become illegal to pay someone to write or host fake reviews.

"The London Fire Brigade declares a major incident after a number of fires break out in areas around the capital A major blaze in the village of Wennington, in east London, burns fields and sets homes alight The UK records its hottest-ever temperature, with 40.3C recorded in Coningsby in Lincolnshire Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record of 38.7C recorded in Cambridge in July 2019, the Met Office says People in the capital are urged not to have barbeques or bonfires due to the risk of fire The extreme heat is fuelled by climate change which is making heatwaves more intense, frequent and likely, scientists warn Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are also seeing temperatures soar, while wildfires still threaten parts of southwest France and Spain Edited by Emma Owen and Jeremy Gahagan We're going to leave our live coverage of the heatwave here for today. For a full overview of the day's events, read our main storyhere. And to see how hot it'll be overnight tonight,check out BBC Weather's latest forecast. Today's page was written by Adam Durbin, Krystyna Gajda, Laura Gozzi, James Harness, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Alex Therrien, Emma Owen, Chris Giles and Jeremy Gahagan. Today the UK officially reached 40C â something the Met Office said was ""virtually impossible"" in an undisrupted climate. But with human-induced climate change, such extreme temperatures have now become a reality. Let's take look at the day:  Get your latest weather forecasthere. Want more?WatchThe UKâs Hottest Day, A New Normal?with BBC Weatherâs Nick Miller on BBC iPlayer now Smoke columns rise from the grassland fires in Dartford, Kent Firefighters have been tackling many fires across the country, including a number in and around the capital, leading to London Fire Brigade declaring a major incident. Some of these include: Merlyn ThomasBBC climate change disinformation specialist A Met Office meteorologist has debunked a misleading map
which has been gaining traction on social media. The image above, designed to downplay the heatwave and cast
doubt on climate change, spread on groups and accounts including some that post
debunked weather conspiracy theories. But the comparison is misleading. For one thing, the map on
the left appears to be an older BBC map which did not use colour zones for
temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent
redesign, and the image on the right is not from the current heat wave. Meterologist Aidan McGivern explained that temperature symbols and
colour scale were tweaked to make it more accessible to those, like him, who
are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds. The fire that broke out in Wennington is still burning, and London Fire Brigade are still at the scene this evening. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village, with the blaze igniting buildings and fields nearby. Around 100 firefighters have been working to bring it under control. But the BBC's Nick Johnson, who is in Wennington, says the situation has become more reassuring in the last half hour. He adds that it appears as if fire crews are starting to pack up and return to their engines after six hours of tackling the blaze. One firefighter helping to extinguish the blaze described the conditions as ""absolute hell"". Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Paris Here in Paris, itâs reached 41C. Walking around the city is
incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people
have brought fans along with them. In the capitalâs famous Tulleries garden, people have been taking
shade under some of the parkâs trees, making use of all available seating.
Thankfully the water fountains are still working. Meanwhile
at Paris' Gare du Nord station this afternoon, queues of people were seen waiting
for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly.

authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says. Paul KirbyDigital Europe editor The ferocious heatwave that has gripped Western Europe has shifted north and temperatures have climbed towards 40C in several areas. Parishas hit 40C today for only the third time on record.Germanyis having its hottest day of the year so far, and theNetherlandshas recorded its hottest 19 July ever, with 38.9C in Maastricht. One of the big supermarkets has halted home deliveries. The forest fires further south are still burning in France, Spain and Portugal, though. A BBC team has visited one of the five campsites that have burned down in the southwestern Gironde region and you can see what little is left. This video can not be played Heatwave: Surveying the damage after French fires InSpain, which has seen some of the highest temperatures on the continent, more than 60,000 hectares of land have burned in just a week. A fire also broke out in the dunes at theBelgiancoastal resort of De Haan on Tuesday, setting several vehicles alight. Italianforecasters are warning of temperatures as high as 40 to 42C between Wednesday and Friday. Experts at Italy's IlMeteo say new crevasses are opening up on Alpine peaks and ice is melting even on top of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. Todayâs extreme heat has certainly taken its toll on travel, with Network
Rail saying todayâs passenger train numbers are around 40% lower than this time
last week. There have been severe disruptions with all services to and from London
Euston suspended because of a lineside fire caused by overhead electric
cables brought down in Harrow. Similar problems with overhead lines meant trains were trapped on
the tracks in Rugby, Birmingham and Carlisle, resulting in the emergency
evacuations of passengers. As weâve been reporting, there were no rail services into or out
of Kingâs Cross today, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services running north
of London. Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record today, the Met Office says in a Tweet. The national record of 38.7C (101.6F) was topped in places such as Coningsby in Lincolnshire, and Gringley on the Hill, Nottinghamshire. Allow Twitter content?

"With a heatwave predicted to bring temperatures above 41C to parts of the UK over the next few days, how can the nation keep cool and carry on? Temperatures could be thehighest ever recorded in the UKthis week, beating the current record temperature from 2019, when a high of 38.7C was recorded in Cambridge. The Met Office has issued ared extreme heat warning,externalfor many parts of England, from London and the south-east up to York and Manchester. Amber warnings are also currently in place across the rest of England, all of Wales, and parts of Scotland. For those hoping to be given a day off, unfortunately, there are currentlyno laws in the UK,externalabout when it is too hot to work. Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. It can, however, be too cold to work. Government guidance recommends a minimum working temperature of 16C (61F), or 13C, if employees are doing physical work. As avoiding work in the heat isn't an option, then there's the inevitable dilemma of what to wear. But can you wear flip-flops to work?Staff should have a relaxed dress code during the heatwave, union says. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

How to sleep in hot weather What you should - and shouldn't do - to stay cool Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Send your photos/videos of the hot weather toyourpics@bbc.co.uk A big part of the problem is humidity, which makes it hard for sweat to evaporate. To try and keep your bedroom as cool as possible, shut your blinds or curtains during the day - although doing so with metallic blinds and dark curtains could make the room hotter. You could also open windows on the shady side of your home and close them on the sunny side - and then open all the windows before going to bed to get a thorough breeze. That's not an option open to everyone, so an electric fan can be a handy substitute. A fan will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating. Other recommendations include: Putting reflective material or shades outside bedroom windows Having a lukewarm shower before bed Using thin cotton sheets Wearing lightweight materials for bed as they can keep you cooler - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners Putting your sheets in the freezer for a spell before you go to bed When it comes to children, the NHS says a cool bath before bedtime can help. Pyjamas and bedclothes should be kept to a minimum, and if a baby kicks off its bedcovers during the night then they could sleep in just a nappy - babies sleep most comfortably when their room is between 16C (61F) and 20C (68F). As if you don't have enough to think about with a baby, a heatwave brings an added risk of dehydration, sunburn and sunstroke. The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight, and older infants should be kept out of the sun as much as possible, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Sun cream with a high sun protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids and the NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual, but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. As tempting as it might be to strip off, you may be at greater risk of sunburn which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. It's best to choose light colours over dark - which absorb heat more - and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will also help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. This is fast becoming the first question asked when extreme weather events strike - and the answer remains the same. It is almost impossible to say that a specific event, like the current hot spell, is caused by global heating. However there are some very strong connections to human-induced warming that increase the likelihood of such weather. Last year's blazing summer in the UKwas said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likelybecause of emissions from human activity. And the Met Office also said warm spells in the UK have more than doubled in length - increasing from 5.3 days in the 1961-1990 period to more than 13 days in the decade from 2008 to 2017. The heatwave also follows on from a previousrecord-breaking June across Europe, which was 1C above the long term trend and an incredible 3C above the average from 1850-1900. When researchers carried out a rapid analysis to see the impact of climate change on the June heatwave,they concluded it was made at least five times more likelyby warming. It may well be that the current period of extremely hot weather is purely down to natural variability, said BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath. But even if so, the fingerprints of fossil fuel burning are heavily influencing the background - and making such events much more likely. Strawberries are among the foods recommended during a heatwave Hydration is key. Our bodies sweat more in hot weather, so it is really important to restock lost water levels. Don't rely on your physical thirst to judge how dehydrated you are as it's not a very good indicator(urine colour,externalis better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. And try not to consume too much alcohol. The NHS says good drink options include water, lower-fat milks and tea and coffee. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down.,external More tips on what to eat in a heatwave from BBC Good Food,external Dogs in particular struggle in the hot weather because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do, and those breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating. The RSPCA has a series of tips,externalfor keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. These include avoiding leaving animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, which, even just for a short while, can be fatal due to rising temperatures. It also says it is best to walk a dog early in the morning or late in the evening when it is cooler, as paws can burn on a hot pavement. Exercise can also increase the risk of heatstroke. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer For those pets kept in cages, hutches, fish tanks or other enclosures, they should be kept out of direct sunlight. And it's not just humans who need sun cream, it might also be beneficial to apply some to your pet. Animals' exposed spots, such as ears and noses, are vulnerable to sunburn and - just like people - sun damage can lead to skin cancer. The Blue Cross saywhite cats are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer,externalfrom sunlight exposure than others. This video can not be played Dog owners have been urged to check pavements using the ""seven-second test"" This video can not be played Humidity explainer Most people in the UK aren't used to such extreme temperatures, which can cause heat exhaustion and, more seriously, heatstroke. Signs of heat exhaustion can include tiredness or weakness, feeling faint or dizzy, having muscle cramps or feeling sick. If left untreated, the more serious symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation and even a loss of consciousness. Those suffering the signs of heat exhaustion should go to a cool place with air conditioning or shade, use a cool, wet sponge or flannel and drink fluids - ideally water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. NHS guidance on dealing with heatstroke,external If you choose to exercise, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. Aim to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. The risk of sunburn depends on how sensitive your skin is, and how strong the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays are. The UV index will vary, depending on where you are in the world, the time of year, what the weather is like, the time of day, and how high up you are compared to sea level. During the UK's summer months, the sun's UV rays are strongest between 11:00 and 15:00. Cancer Research UK suggests,externalusing a simple ""shadow rule"" to estimate the strength of the sun. It suggests that if your shadow is shorter than your height, the sun's UV rays are strong - and you are therefore more likely to burn. How much sun cream to use and what to do if you burn There are lots of ""extended wear"" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use ""once a day"", or claiming to last for eight hours. But dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a ""satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing"" and that it should be reapplied at least every two hours, no matter what SPF it is. There are lots of places that rate sunscreen brands, including consumer websiteWhich?,external. However,the British Association of Dermatologists,external(BAD) says in general you should look for two ratings on bottles of sun creams. The sun emits two types of ultraviolet rays - UVA (most commonly responsible for premature ageing and wrinkles) and UVB (which causes most sunburn). The BAD says you need to be protected from both. The sun protection factor (SPF) offers guidance on a cream's protection against UVB rays, while a star system indicates the level of protection against UVA rays.

"Katie Melua has said uncertainty over touring in Europe has cost her record sales The government should appoint a touring ""tsar"" to unravel the red tape facing British musicians in Europe, a cross-party group of MPs and peers has said. They would need to tackle the soaring costs of obtaining visas and transporting instruments that bands have encountered since Brexit. Some orchestras face bills of Â£5,000 every time they play abroad, said the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music. It added the industry faced a ""crisis"" that required ""urgent"" action. The call came in a major report into the state of touring post-Brexit, which warned that musicians and their crew were ""facing more costs, more complications and getting fewer opportunities"" since the UK left the EU at the end of January 2020. ""It's over two years since Brexit, yet there is still a mountain of red tape,"" said Labour MP Kevin Brennan, who chairs the all-party group. ""Ultimately, it's a self-inflicted wound that doesn't have to be there."" In response, a spokesperson said the government was ""supporting the UK's brilliant musicians to adapt to the new arrangements and make touring easier"". Rock band White Lies became painfully aware of the situation in April. The group, who have a huge live following in Europe, had to cancel the first date of their 2022 tour, after their equipment was caught up in border checks at Dover. ""It was a real disaster,"" drummer Jack Lawrence-Brown recalled. ""Our truck containing all of our equipment and all of the lights and the stage for the show got stuck in an enormous two or three-day-long queue - and there was no chance of the driver getting onto a boat in time to make the show happen, which was pretty devastating."" White Lies criticised the ""painful and unworkable"" regulations facing UK musicians Lawrence-Brown said the band built extra time into their schedule to account for any post-Brexit delays, but it still wasn't enough. ""I just don't know how a newer band, with less resources than us, would ever cope with that kind of situation,"" he added. ""We can just about shrug it off financially, but on a European tour we need every show to happen really for it to be a success. And as soon as you pull a show, it loses us money, so it was a big dampener to start a seven week tour without the first show."" UK stars urge action over post-Brexit touring Musicians fear being priced out of European tours Sir Elton John fears musicians face 'catastrophe' The impact on new bands was also raised by Sir Elton John, who told the All-Party Parliamentary Group that the government had squandered a ""golden opportunity"" to fix the issues around touring during the Covid lockdown. ""While some progress has been made that opportunity has been allowed to slip,"" he said in a written statement. ""The heartbeat and future of our vibrant industry face finding themselves stranded in Dover through no fault of their own."" Last year, more than 200 artists including Radiohead, Rick Astley and Little Mix launched a campaign called #LetTheMusicMove, which argued that restrictions on touring Europe ""threaten the future success of British music"" and could result in the ""collapse of the industry"". Singer Katie Melua told the campaign she had turned down several European TV appearances due to uncertainty over travel restrictions. ""Naturally, this has an impact on streaming numbers and physical record sale figures,"" she added. Elton John has led calls for government action on the issue The live music business is estimated to employ 30,000 people in the UK. British artists play four times as many gigs in the EU as the US; and it is estimated that 80% of the touring buses that operate across the UK and Europe are based on British shores. The new report, also called Let The Music Move, said the bureaucracy that has sprung up since Brexit was ""clogging the arteries of the sector"" and was ""hampering the competitiveness"" of British bands. It was authored by a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs and members of the House of Lords, whose recommendations included: The appointment of a ""Touring Tsar"" to steer the Government's response to the crisis. Working with the EU to create a Cultural Touring Agreement that would exempt musicians and their crew from red tape. The creation of a temporary support fund to help the industry deal with increased costs. An expansion of the number of border points where goods passports and music instrument certificates can be checked. Mr Brennan said that musicians hadn't been a ""big enough priority"" for the government. ""Although it's true that it [touring] has become a little bit easier in some countries than it was immediately after Brexit, it's still an extremely complicated and patchy picture,"" he told BBC News. ""Musicians have faced this cacophony of bureaucracy, of different bits of government, trying to sort out different problems that have arisen from us leaving the European Union without a comprehensive settlement for touring musicians and other artists. ""So our report says there needs to be someone at the heart of government, who's in charge of sorting all these things out."" In a statement to the BBC, a government spokesperson said: ""Following our engagement, 24 EU member states including the biggest touring markets such as Spain, France, Germany and the Netherlands have confirmed they offer visa and work permit-free routes for UK performers and other creative professionals. ""We continue to engage with the few remaining countries which do not offer visa or work permit-free routes."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.
