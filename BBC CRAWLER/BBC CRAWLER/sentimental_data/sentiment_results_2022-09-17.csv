"The Crown of Scotland (l) on Her Majesty's coffin in Edinburgh was replaced by the Imperial State Crown in London King Charles has done two things simultaneously this week that reveal much about what kind of reign he aspires to. First, he has led the nation in the ritualising of its sorrow - a sorrow that has been quietly expressed and subdued but it is nonetheless real. And second he has signalled to us in the clearest terms possible that this is a reign that will put the future of the Union - the integrity of the United Kingdom itself - at the heart of its concerns. In choosing to visit Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, as well as return to London, King Charles has demonstrated how fully the Royal Family and household have understood the nature of the United Kingdom as a Union state - a partnership of nations. Everywhere he went there were gestures of respect and, indeed, affection for the distinctiveness of each of the three devolved nations. And in that, as in much else, he is following what he called, in Northern Ireland, the ""shining example"" set by his mother. We saw the coffin of the Queen for the first time as it slipped through the gates of Balmoral in its glass-sided hearse. She is the first reigning monarch to die in Scotland in nearly 500 years. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she had famously remarked in life; now she was performing the same service in death. The cortege made its way slowly through royal Deeside, slowing down to pass through towns and villages, where the people know her not just as the Queen, but as their neighbour. She had known this landscape since she was a child: Aboyne, Ballater, Banchory, Peterculter, through Aberdeen to Bridge of Muchalls, Stonehaven and south to the Scottish capital. They stood by the side of the road as the cortege passed, in quiet contemplation. What was the symbolism of this measured progress through the green spaces, the little neighbourhoods, she loved, if not to say: ""I am rooted here; this has been my home."" For that's what Balmoral was - a private home and not a royal residence. She made no secret of the fact that she loved it more than any place in the world. It was where she found respite from the burdens of state and the unyielding gaze of the public. The new Queen Elizabeth with a young Prince Charles at Balmoral in September 1952 I have been struck all week by that gaze. It has followed the new King and those closest to him throughout. Other than a brief time at Highgrove spent in quiet contemplation, King Charles and the Queen Consort have spent almost every waking hour since the Queen died in the public eye. This, at a time when they and their family are carrying what must be an intense private sorrow. This is a family on whose grief the eyes of the world intrude. Duty calls them to sublimate their private sorrow to the imperatives and demands of public ritual This, too, is surely the legacy of the late Queen - it is the steadfastness and constancy with which she adhered to her idea of public service, now visible in her son. Crowds gathered in the streets of Edinburgh's magnificent old town as her coffin was taken to lie in the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the monarch's official residence in Scotland. You could sense the intimacy and informality of that journey from Balmoral gradually yielding to the rituals of statehood and official mourning. History seeps from every stone of that house. This was where the Queen's ancestor King James VI of Scotland learned, in the middle of the night, that he had inherited the throne of England on the death of the first Elizabeth, thus uniting the two kingdoms under one Crown for the first time. In that sense, the Queen was brought to lie in rest in the building that could be said to be the birthplace of the first Kingdom of Great Britain. The Royal Household's attention to the sensibilities and distinctiveness of the three devolved nations of the UK has been striking, not just this week, but for many years. When, in 1999, the Queen opened the first Scottish Parliament in 300 years, she gave permission for the then presiding officer to refer to her by what he called her proper title - Elizabeth, Queen of Scots. Mother and son sharing a laugh at the Braemar Highland Gathering in 2012 She, herself, when she was in Scotland, referred to her son and heir not as the Prince of Wales but as the Duke of Rothesay, his Scottish title. When they took the Queen's coffin to lie in rest at St Giles' Cathedral, they placed upon it the Crown of Scotland, the centrepiece of the Scottish crown jewels. It is 500 years old, the oldest surviving royal crown in Britain and Ireland, made for the Queen's ancestor King James V. Consider the symbolism - it is a gesture toward the distinctiveness of Scotland and its historic nationhood. What have we learned about the kind of reign that the King aspires to? This week, above all, he has sought visibility; like his mother he wants to be seen, to forge a strong link between Crown and people. It was those moments outside, in the street, among the people crowding to see him, hands stretched out to take his, that he seemed to come alive. These were the moments - moments of easy informal engagement - that seemed to energise and excite him. We watched him at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, being addressed by Sinn Fein leaders who do not recognise the legitimacy of his Crown in their country. And yet they spoke to him with sympathy for his loss, and spoke with immense warmth about his late mother. In May 2022's election, for the first time, nationalist Sinn Fein won most seats to the Northern Ireland Assembly Alex Maskey, the Sinn Fein speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a man who was twice interned without trial during the Troubles, stood in the Throne Room at Hillsborough and spoke directly to the British King of the leadership qualities of his late mother. He also praised the role those qualities had played in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. He said she had deployed gestures that seemed small, but which had an enormous impact in promoting reconciliation. King Charles replied that he would seek to follow what he called his mother's ""shining example"" in bringing together ""those whom history has separated"". King Charles with Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, Alex Maskey of Sinn Fein - and the party's Vice President Michelle O'Neill The last leg of his tour was to the country whose title, he said, he had borne with pride for more than half a century: the title Prince of Wales, one he now passes to his own heir. His relationship with Wales is intimate. As a student he learned Welsh here, and spoke Welsh at his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969. Here, bilingualism is part of the distinctive character of the country. He and the Queen Consort attended a Service of Prayer and Reflection for the life of Queen Elizabeth, at which the First Minister, Mark Drakeford, read from the First Book of Kings in Welsh. It incudes the verse: ""And now, Oh Lord, you have made your servant King."" Llandaff Cathedral, where, the service took place, is almost 1,000 years old. It was rebuilt after being bombed in the Cardiff blitz. It connects us - and the Royal Family - to the great shared British experience of the World War Two. Queen Elizabeth's visit here in 1960 marked its restoration, a symbol of the long recovery from war and its aftermath that characterised the early years of her reign. Queen Elizabeth, too, hugged the devolved nation close. She made multiple visits to the Scottish Parliament, and attended every opening of the Welsh Assembly and Senedd. But among the cheers from the crowds Charles encountered in Wales, there were also boos and chants of ""Not my King"". This dissent was an echo of pockets of anti-monarchy protests in other places throughout the week. ""I think the biggest danger to the union is arrogance around its continuation,"" Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University told me the day before the King's visit to Cardiff. ""I suspect the monarchy has got perhaps even greater sensitivity than politicians to this because there's a real sense of understanding the cultural and political heritages of each of the nations is very different,"" she said. In Cardiff, King Charles smiled with members of the public after a service at Llandaff Cathedral in memory of his mother The Queen received a similar welcome when she visited the village of Treherbert on her birthday in April 1989 She said the Queen had reflected that in her remarks when she was opening the National Assembly and then the Senedd and expected King Charles to do the same. And he did. Here, too, he spoke of his late mother's - and his own - affection for the country. Perhaps more telling there was the gesture toward the distinctiveness of the character of the country. On the floor of the Senedd, he replied to a motion of condolence from members of the assembly in both languages. ""Through all the years of her reign,"" he said, ""the land of Wales could not have been closer to my mother's heart. I know she took immense pride in your many great achievements - even as she also felt with you deeply in time of sorrow. ""It must surely be counted the greatest privilege to belong to a land that could inspire such devotion. I am resolved to honour that selfless example, in the spirit of the words by which I have always tried to live my own life: 'Ich Dien, I Serve'."" When his mother came to the throne in 1952, the integrity of the United Kingdom was a given. It is telling that King Charles has chosen, as the first act of his reign, to tour the devolved nations. For the landscape is changing. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, a party that seeks to lead Northern Ireland out of the Kingdom and into the Republic, is now the biggest single party. In Scotland, support for independence remains a little below 50 per cent, and has much higher support among the young. Which of his many homes will King Charles live in? How Maori remember the Queen Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' The early decades of Queen Elizabeth's reign were characterised by the long, slow contraction of British imperial power overseas and, in the end, the dissolution of the Empire - an outcome that would have shocked and dismayed earlier generations. It was her leadership that transformed the Empire into the Commonwealth. Most of its members chose to become republics. Fourteen Commonwealth realms remain, in which King Charles becomes head of state, including Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. King Charles will be alert to the possibility that that process could resume, with the potential that some of those realms will also become republics. He will also be alert to the possibility that his own reign could come to be defined by the loosening of the bonds that have traditionally held the Union together. Queen Elizabeth was a powerful force for unity. She came to embody much of the character of Britain itself. We looked at her and saw a set of values - though each of us would have defined those values differently - around which the country cohered. She was the last living royal link with WW2, perhaps the founding shared experience of the modern British identity. King Charles III enters Buckingham Palace for the first time as the new monarch, accompanied by the Queen Consort What will happen to that legacy, to the way of being British that she reflected back to us, when this period of mourning is over and she begins to slip into the middle distance of our collective memory? That the new king inherits a powerful legacy of public affection for his mother has been clear this week. But the enthusiasm of those who turned out in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, London and across the country will not disguise for long the strains that the country is under. King Charles signalled to us this week that he intends to put the future of the Union at the heart of his reign. The Royal household will not make the mistake of seeing those crowds as incontrovertible proof that the Union is secure. We can expect this to be a reign that will hug the devolved nations of the Kingdom close. What next?

"Protests have broken out at the funeral of a woman who died after being arrested by Iran's morality police. Mahsa Amini, 22, died on Friday, days after eyewitnesses said she was beaten in a police van in Tehran - allegations denied by police. Some women at the ceremony reportedly removed their headscarves in protest at the compulsory wearing of hijabs. Mourners chanted ""death to the dictator"", with videos showing police later firing on a crowd. The funeral took place in Ms Amini's hometown, Saqez, in the western province of Kurdistan. According to videos published on social media, locals gathered very early in the morning to prevent Iranian security forces rushing through the burial in secret to avoid protests. Reports suggested that some angry protesters marched toward the local governor's office to protest about the death. According to videos received and verified by the BBC Persian Service, the security forces opened fire on protesters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were also reports of injuries and arrests. In videos published on Twitter, security forces can be seen guarding the governor's office and arresting protesters trying to get close to the building. A picture of Ms Amini's gravestone was published on social media. It reads: ""You didn't die. Your name will be a code [rallying call]."" Ms Amini was arrested on Tuesday by the morality police for allegedly not complying with the strict dress code on head coverings. According to eyewitnesses, she was beaten while inside a police van and slipped into a coma later. Iranian police denied the allegations, saying she had ""suffered a sudden heart failure"". Ebrahim Raisi, Iran's hardline president, has asked the ministry of the interior to launch an investigation into the death. Kasra Hospital in Northern Tehran said in a statement that Ms Amini was admitted on 13 September showing ""no vital signs"". The statement was later removed from the hospital's social media after hardline social media accounts accused hospital staff of being ""anti-regime agents"". Iranian TV also aired CCTV footage of Ms Amini under arrest. Human rights activists accused state TV of censoring the footage to create a false story. According to Netblocks, a watchdog organization that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, the internet connection has been disrupted in various locations in Iran since news of Ms Amini's death came out, including in the capital, Tehran, and Saqez. Many users said they could not upload videos on Instagram or send content over WhatsApp. Iranian state-controlled Sharq newspaper reported that Tehran's very low internet speed disrupted the stock market on Saturday.

Since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, women have been legally required to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. In recent years, Iran has seen several campaigns against the compulsory hijab, but a crackdown by Iran's morality police on women accused of not complying with the dress code has caused opponents of the policy to call for action. Recently, the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejeie, suggested that foreign powers are behind the campaign, instructing intelligence agencies to find the ""hands behind the naked veil"". Earlier in the summer, President Raisi also promised to crack down on the ""promotion of organized corruption in the Islamic society"", directly referring to the campaign. In recent months, Iranian state TV has showed televised confessions of women arrested for not following the strict dress code. Many Iranians blame the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, for the crackdown. A speech by him is being shared on social media in which he praises the role of the morality police and the way it operates.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people can be seen on the streets in footage filmed at the scene Large-scale disorder broke out in Leicester on Saturday, with police and community leaders calling for calm. Officers tried to hold back crowds amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Police said two arrests had been made, and that the trouble flared up after ""an unplanned protest"". It is the latest ofseveral incidents, including violence after an India and Pakistan cricket match on 28 August. A significant police operation will remain in the area in the coming days. Suleman Nagdi, of the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations told the BBC: ""What we have seen on the streets is very alarming. ""There have been problems in the community since the India and Pakistan cricket match and while that game often sparks gatherings they have not in the past turned this ugly. ""We need calm - the disorder has to stop and it has to stop now. There are some very dissatisfied young men who have been causing havoc. ""We need to get the message out that this must end and try to do this through parents and grandparents talking to their sons."" Sanjiv Patel, who represents Hindu and Jain temples across Leicester, said he was deeply saddened and shocked by Saturday night's disorder. He said: ""We have lived in harmony in the city for many decades but over the past few weeks it is clear there are things that need to be discussed around the table to get out what people are unhappy about. ""Resorting to violence is not the way to deal with this. ""We are horrified and deplore what was going on (yesterday) and across the last two weeks. ""Across the Hindu and Jain community and with our Muslim brothers and sisters and leaders we are consistently saying 'calm minds, calm heads'."" He warned people to be wary of disinformation on social media. He added: ""Violence is not a solution to anything. This has to be a time for peace, calm and engagement."" Police said one man was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and another on suspicion of possession of a bladed article. They remain in police custody. Leicestershire's chief constable was among the police officers on the ground Leicester city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said:  ""I don't think anyone saw the confrontation (on Saturday) as a likely outcome and police had been given reassurance things were calming down a lot. ""Things got very nasty indeed last night and I am very worried on behalf of the people who were caught up in it and I was impressed by the way police responded to it - it can't have been an easy task."" He added: ""It's mostly young men in their late teens and early 20s and I have heard suggestions people have come in (to the city) from outside looking for an opportunity to have a set-to. ""It's very worrying for people in the areas where this has happened."" Sir Peter said it was important community leaders continued to try to de-escalate the situation but he acknowledged it was a challenge to get through to young people. Speaking on Saturday night, Leicestershire Police's temporary chief constable Rob Nixonsaid in a video,external: ""We've had numerous reports of an outbreak of disorder in parts of the East Leicester area of the city. ""We have got officers there, we are taking control of that situation, there are additional officers that are en route, and dispersal powers, and stop and search powers have been authorised. ""Please do not get involved, we are calling for calm."" Police said they were ""taking control"" of the situation Community leaders from East Leicester were on the ground with officers, and were calling for calm and encouraging people to go home, the force added. In the early hours on Sunday, police said the situation was calming and ""under control"", and large number of searches had been carried out. ""Several incidents of violence and damage have been reported to the police and are being investigated,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are aware of a video circulating showing a man pulling down a flag outside a religious building on Melton Road, Leicester. ""This appears to have taken place while police officers were dealing with public disorder in the area. The incident will be investigated."" A woman who witnessed Saturday's disturbances said there were people wearing balaclavas or with masks over their faces, and with hoods pulled up. She told the BBC they were ""just everywhere, it was like crowds walking away from a football match"". ""There were police blocking the road; officers literally stood shoulder to shoulder blocking Uppingham Road,"" she said. Footage online showed police attempting to hold back crowds as objects including bottles were thrown. A resident from Green Lane Road said what she witnessed on Saturday evening was ""very intimidating"". ""The whole situation seemed really out of control,"" she said. ""The police were there but it didn't seem like they had a great handle on things. ""People were still feeling very scared, unsure and uncertain, and with everything else that's gone on recently, there's also a lot of tension building up in the few weeks that we've had this happen and unfold.""

We looked at her and saw a set of values - though each of us would have defined those values differently - around which the country cohered. She was the last living royal link with WW2, perhaps the founding shared experience of the modern British identity. King Charles III enters Buckingham Palace for the first time as the new monarch, accompanied by the Queen Consort What will happen to that legacy, to the way of being British that she reflected back to us, when this period of mourning is over and she begins to slip into the middle distance of our collective memory? That the new king inherits a powerful legacy of public affection for his mother has been clear this week. But the enthusiasm of those who turned out in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, London and across the country will not disguise for long the strains that the country is under. King Charles signalled to us this week that he intends to put the future of the Union at the heart of his reign. The Royal household will not make the mistake of seeing those crowds as incontrovertible proof that the Union is secure. We can expect this to be a reign that will hug the devolved nations of the Kingdom close. What next?

"This video can not be played Watch: The Queen's grandchildren take part in the historic vigil The Queen's eight grandchildren, including the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex, have stood vigil around her coffin as she lies in state at Westminster Hall. At King Charles's request, Prince Harry wore military uniform, for the first time since 2020. Prince Harry has worn civilian clothes at public events since the Queen died. It is the first time in history that the grandchildren of a monarch have taken part in the ceremony. The King's sons William and Harry were joined by Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, the children of Princess Anne, as well as Prince Andrew's daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn, who are Prince Edward's children. At 44, Peter Philips is the oldest of the Queen's grandchildren, while the youngest, James, Viscount Severn, is 14. In silence and with their heads bowed, the eight cousins stood at different points around the coffin as crowds continued to file past. Prince William stood at the head of the Queen's coffin with his brother at the opposite end. The Earl and Countess of Wessex, the parents of Louise and James, looked on from a platform facing the coffin. Prince Harry wore a Blues and Royals uniform The grandchildren's vigil started at 18:01 BST and lasted for just under 15 minutes. On Friday evening, the Queen's children, including the King, took part in a similar vigil,standing guard for about 10 minutes. Ahead of the vigil, Beatrice and Eugenie paid tribute to their ""dear Grannie"", saying: ""It has been the honour of our lives to have been your granddaughters and we're so very proud of you."" In a joint statement, they said the Queen was ""our matriarch, our guide, our loving hand on our backs leading us through this world"" and that they already miss her ""terribly"". They went on: ""Thank you for making us laugh, for including us, for picking heather and raspberries, for marching soldiers, for our teas, for comfort, for joy. ""You, being you, will never know the impact you have had on our family and so many people around the world. ""The world mourns you and the tributes would really make you smile. They are all too true of the remarkable leader you are."" The pair told the Queen they were ""so happy you're back with Grandpa"" and added that ""our dear Uncle Charles, the King, will continue to lead in your example as he too has dedicated his life to service"". This was another poignant image, mixing the grandeur of a public ceremony with the intimacy of personal family memories. The Queen's grandchildren were standing vigil around her coffin, with the queue of people flowing either side of them. The people who had queued for many hours, bringing their own memories, shared the big silence of Westminster Hall with the royal grandchildren. Prince Harry wore a Blues and Royals uniform and wearing the same uniform, on the other side of the coffin, was his brother Prince William. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie took their place in the vigil. In a tribute this afternoon they'd talked of the loss of ""our dearest grannie"". With the tap-tap-tap of a soldier's sword on the stone, time was up. They finished their vigil and followed Prince William back out of the hall. The vigil on Saturday was the first time Prince Harry had been seen in military uniform since stepping back as a working royal in 2020. He served two tours in Afghanistan as part of the Army. He now lives in California with his wife Meghan and their two children. The Duke of Sussex was wearing the Blues and Royals No 1 uniform, the same uniform as his brother. Prince William has completed more than seven years of full-time military service, including three-and-a-half years as a search and rescue pilot. Prince Harry stood at the opposite end of the coffin to his brother, the Prince of Wales Prince Andrew was also allowed to wear his military uniform as he stood guard on Friday. The 62-year-old stepped down as a working royal in 2019, after facing questions over his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The prince was laterstripped of his military titles. Earlier on Saturday, Prince William and his father King Charleswent to Lambeth, south Londonto shake hands and greet people queuing to view the Queen lying in state. The Earl and Countess of Wessex conducted their own walkabout outside Buckingham Palace. The Queen will lie in state at Westminster Hall until her funeral on Monday. The queue to see the coffin stretches as far as Southwark Park and has previously seen wait times of over 24 hours. Officials have warned that the queue will be closed before 06:30 BST on Monday, so that people do not join the line and fail to reach Westminster Hall in time. On Saturday afternoon, organisers announced that the accessible queue has reached full capacity, with all time slots now allocated.

"A planned meeting between Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden before the Queen's funeral has been cancelled, Downing Street has said. No 10 said a ""full bilateral meeting"" between the PM and Mr Biden would instead take place at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. It is thought holding the talks after the period of national mourning would allow more wide-ranging discussions. Ms Truss met her counterparts from New Zealand and Australia on Saturday. The prime minister held informal talks with Jacinda Ardern and Australian premier Anthony Albanese at Chevening House in Kent. And Number 10 confirmed Ms Truss will see Irish Taoiseach [prime minister] MicheÃ¡l Martin, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, and Polish President Andrzej Duda at Downing Street on Sunday. Although she met Mr Biden when she was foreign secretary, next week's UN meeting with him in New York will be Ms Truss's first as UK prime minister. How the Queen's funeral day will unfold Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' Monday's funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend. It is providing Ms Truss with an opportunity to meet foreign counterparts less than two weeks after taking office. But Downing Street had stressed that talks this weekend would not be formal bilateral meetings because of the official 10-day mourning period following the death of the Queen. It would not be issuing summaries of the discussions as would normally happen after the PM's meetings with foreign leaders, No 10 added. As a former foreign secretary, Liz Truss is not exactly new to rubbing shoulders with world leaders. She'll see a lot of them over this weekend. Meeting them as prime minister, though, is different and the first meeting with the US president is always the biggest for a new PM. When Liz Truss and Joe Biden do sit down, it will be closely scrutinised for any indications of the health, or otherwise, of the ""special relationship"". I'm told that holding it after the official mourning period means it can be much more focused on business rather than reflecting on the Queen. There is a lot of business to tackle. Joe Biden is no fan of Liz Truss's approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol, for a start. The US has suggested it is ""not conducive"" to the other not-so-small matter of a trade deal. All this will have to wait though, until later in the week. In advance of her talks with Ms Truss, Ms Ardern said the death of the Queen would be the ""focus of conversation"", and they were also likely to discuss Ukraine and the UK'sfree trade agreement with New Zealand.announced last October. It was thought the meeting between Ms Truss and Mr Albanese focused on trade, after thesigning of a deal between the UK and Australia in December. Ms Truss also held a phone call with the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, on Saturday in which he expressed his condolences on the death of the Queen. The meeting with the Irish Republic's prime minister comes at a time of strained relations with the EU over post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland. The UK is refusing to apply some of the checks it signed up to in the Brexit withdrawal deal, prompting aseries of lawsuits from the EU. Liz Truss met Joe Biden in Glasgow last November, when he attended the COP 26 climate summit Mr Martin has expressed concern about legislation Ms Truss introduced as foreign secretary enabling the UK to alter the legal commitments it signed up to in the exit treaty in 2019. Ms Truss is expected to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks at the UN meeting in New York next week. The state funeral service in Westminster Abbey on Monday is expected to be attended by hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including politicians and royalty. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list for the funeral ceremony but is not thought likely to attend. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that no decision had been made on whether they would be sending a delegation, although press reports have suggested China's vice-president will attend. Ms Truss is expected to have a phone call with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman on Saturday evening. The de factoruler's invitation to the Queen's funeral has sparked protestsfrom human rights campaigners.

"This video can not be played Watch: The Queen's grandchildren take part in the historic vigil The Queen's eight grandchildren, including the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex, have stood vigil around her coffin as she lies in state at Westminster Hall. At King Charles's request, Prince Harry wore military uniform, for the first time since 2020. Prince Harry has worn civilian clothes at public events since the Queen died. It is the first time in history that the grandchildren of a monarch have taken part in the ceremony. The King's sons William and Harry were joined by Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, the children of Princess Anne, as well as Prince Andrew's daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn, who are Prince Edward's children. At 44, Peter Philips is the oldest of the Queen's grandchildren, while the youngest, James, Viscount Severn, is 14. In silence and with their heads bowed, the eight cousins stood at different points around the coffin as crowds continued to file past. Prince William stood at the head of the Queen's coffin with his brother at the opposite end. The Earl and Countess of Wessex, the parents of Louise and James, looked on from a platform facing the coffin. Prince Harry wore a Blues and Royals uniform The grandchildren's vigil started at 18:01 BST and lasted for just under 15 minutes. On Friday evening, the Queen's children, including the King, took part in a similar vigil,standing guard for about 10 minutes. Ahead of the vigil, Beatrice and Eugenie paid tribute to their ""dear Grannie"", saying: ""It has been the honour of our lives to have been your granddaughters and we're so very proud of you."" In a joint statement, they said the Queen was ""our matriarch, our guide, our loving hand on our backs leading us through this world"" and that they already miss her ""terribly"". They went on: ""Thank you for making us laugh, for including us, for picking heather and raspberries, for marching soldiers, for our teas, for comfort, for joy. ""You, being you, will never know the impact you have had on our family and so many people around the world. ""The world mourns you and the tributes would really make you smile. They are all too true of the remarkable leader you are."" The pair told the Queen they were ""so happy you're back with Grandpa"" and added that ""our dear Uncle Charles, the King, will continue to lead in your example as he too has dedicated his life to service"". This was another poignant image, mixing the grandeur of a public ceremony with the intimacy of personal family memories. The Queen's grandchildren were standing vigil around her coffin, with the queue of people flowing either side of them. The people who had queued for many hours, bringing their own memories, shared the big silence of Westminster Hall with the royal grandchildren. Prince Harry wore a Blues and Royals uniform and wearing the same uniform, on the other side of the coffin, was his brother Prince William. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie took their place in the vigil. In a tribute this afternoon they'd talked of the loss of ""our dearest grannie"". With the tap-tap-tap of a soldier's sword on the stone, time was up. They finished their vigil and followed Prince William back out of the hall. The vigil on Saturday was the first time Prince Harry had been seen in military uniform since stepping back as a working royal in 2020. He served two tours in Afghanistan as part of the Army. He now lives in California with his wife Meghan and their two children. The Duke of Sussex was wearing the Blues and Royals No 1 uniform, the same uniform as his brother. Prince William has completed more than seven years of full-time military service, including three-and-a-half years as a search and rescue pilot. Prince Harry stood at the opposite end of the coffin to his brother, the Prince of Wales Prince Andrew was also allowed to wear his military uniform as he stood guard on Friday. The 62-year-old stepped down as a working royal in 2019, after facing questions over his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The prince was laterstripped of his military titles. Earlier on Saturday, Prince William and his father King Charleswent to Lambeth, south Londonto shake hands and greet people queuing to view the Queen lying in state. The Earl and Countess of Wessex conducted their own walkabout outside Buckingham Palace. The Queen will lie in state at Westminster Hall until her funeral on Monday. The queue to see the coffin stretches as far as Southwark Park and has previously seen wait times of over 24 hours. Officials have warned that the queue will be closed before 06:30 BST on Monday, so that people do not join the line and fail to reach Westminster Hall in time.

"The Queen meeting Mohammed Bin Salman in 2018, before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi The UK's invitation to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed Bin Salman, to attend the Queen's funeral has sparked a storm of protest from human rights campaigners. A declassified CIA report concluded that the crown prince had authorised the murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The Saudi crown prince and his government denied this, but he has been seen as something of a pariah in the West and has not been to Britain since. Until now. Sources close to the Saudi Embassy confirmed the prince, known as ""MBS"", would be coming to London this weekend, but it was unclear if he would attend the actual funeral on Monday. Hatice Gengiz, the fiancÃ©e of the murdered Saudi journalist, said the invitation was a stain on the memory of Queen Elizabeth II. She called for him to be arrested when he lands in London, although she doubted this would happen. The pressure group Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) has accused Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies of using the Queen's funeral as a way to - in their words - ""whitewash"" their human rights records. The group estimates that since the start of the disastrous war in Yemen eight years ago, Britain has sold the Saudi-led coalition fighting there more than $23bn worth of arms. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Yemen: Why is there a war there? Scant political freedoms have also disappeared completely since MBS became crown prince in 2017, with hefty prison sentences handed down to critics of government, even just for social media posts. At the same time, paradoxically, the crown prince has embarked on a massive programme of social liberalisation. Cinemas and public entertainment, long banned in the Kingdom for being deemed ""un-Islamic"", have reopened. On MBS's orders, women are now allowed to drive and the desert kingdom has played host to international sporting and music events, including a concert by the DJ David Guetta. Saudi Arabia, despite its heavily-criticised human rights record, remains a staunch ally of Britain in the Gulf, where it is seen by the West as a bulwark against Iran's aggressive expansionism. It buys western weapons, employs thousands of expatriate workers, hosts the annual Hajj pilgrimage and helps to steady the oil price. All of which partly explain why international criticism of the crown prince is muted at most.

"Dignitaries from around the world are travelling to London ahead of Monday's funeral Chinese leaders will be invited to attend the Queen's lying-in-state, the UK Parliament has now confirmed. This is despite some MPs saying they were assured this week by the Commons Speaker that a Chinese delegation would not be welcome in Westminster Hall, sources told the BBC. China's ambassador to the UK is barred from Parliament over Chinese sanctions on five MPs and two peers. That ban will stay in place but will not be extended to other officials. The BBC said itunderstood the Chinese delegation would be banned from Westminster Hall, after following up the storyfirst reported on the Politico website,external. Some MPs sanctioned by China then indicated that they had been assured by the Commons Speaker that a Chinese delegation would not be given access to Westminster Hall. Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' Who are the Uyghurs? On Friday, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, believing the ambassadorial ban had been extended to all representatives of the Chinese state, said he would like to ""applaud"" Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. ""He's standing firm, and I think the government should have stood firm as well,"" he told BBC News. Sir Ian was one offive MPs placed under Chinese sanctions last yearfor accusing Beijing of mistreating Uyghur Muslims. Sir Iain andother senior parliamentarianshave been urging Foreign Secretary James Cleverly to withdraw the invitation extended to the Chinese government to attend the Queen's funeral. Asked if the Chinese delegation would in fact be banned from Westminster Hall, a Parliamentary spokesperson said: ""The head of states (or their representatives) who have been invited to attend the state funeral in Westminster Abbey are also invited to attend the lying-in-state in Westminster Hall."" Sir Lindsay has declined to comment on access to Westminster Hall, telling the BBC on Friday: ""It's better I don't comment because everything has security implications. It would be wrong of me to do so."" Control of Westminster Hall is shared between the Lord Great Chamberlain - who is appointed by the monarch - and the speakers of both the Commons and the Lords. It is not the sole jurisdiction of the Commons Speaker, particularly when Buckingham Palace and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office are involved, as they are during major state occasions. Last year,China imposed travel bans and asset freezes on nine Britons- including the seven parliamentarians. That led to China's ambassador being banned from Parliament by Sir Lindsay and House of Lords Speaker Lord McFall. Queen Elizabeth will lie in state in Westminster Halluntil she is buried on Monday. According to convention, all countries with which the UK has diplomatic relationsshould be invited to state funerals. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list for the funeral ceremony but is not thought likely to attend. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that no decision had been made on whether they will be sending a delegation, although press reports have suggested China's vice president will attend.

"A planned meeting between Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden before the Queen's funeral has been cancelled, Downing Street has said. No 10 said a ""full bilateral meeting"" between the PM and Mr Biden would instead take place at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. It is thought holding the talks after the period of national mourning would allow more wide-ranging discussions. Ms Truss met her counterparts from New Zealand and Australia on Saturday. The prime minister held informal talks with Jacinda Ardern and Australian premier Anthony Albanese at Chevening House in Kent. And Number 10 confirmed Ms Truss will see Irish Taoiseach [prime minister] MicheÃ¡l Martin, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, and Polish President Andrzej Duda at Downing Street on Sunday. Although she met Mr Biden when she was foreign secretary, next week's UN meeting with him in New York will be Ms Truss's first as UK prime minister. How the Queen's funeral day will unfold Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' Monday's funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend. It is providing Ms Truss with an opportunity to meet foreign counterparts less than two weeks after taking office. But Downing Street had stressed that talks this weekend would not be formal bilateral meetings because of the official 10-day mourning period following the death of the Queen. It would not be issuing summaries of the discussions as would normally happen after the PM's meetings with foreign leaders, No 10 added. As a former foreign secretary, Liz Truss is not exactly new to rubbing shoulders with world leaders. She'll see a lot of them over this weekend. Meeting them as prime minister, though, is different and the first meeting with the US president is always the biggest for a new PM. When Liz Truss and Joe Biden do sit down, it will be closely scrutinised for any indications of the health, or otherwise, of the ""special relationship"". I'm told that holding it after the official mourning period means it can be much more focused on business rather than reflecting on the Queen. There is a lot of business to tackle. Joe Biden is no fan of Liz Truss's approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol, for a start. The US has suggested it is ""not conducive"" to the other not-so-small matter of a trade deal. All this will have to wait though, until later in the week. In advance of her talks with Ms Truss, Ms Ardern said the death of the Queen would be the ""focus of conversation"", and they were also likely to discuss Ukraine and the UK'sfree trade agreement with New Zealand.announced last October. It was thought the meeting between Ms Truss and Mr Albanese focused on trade, after thesigning of a deal between the UK and Australia in December. Ms Truss also held a phone call with the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, on Saturday in which he expressed his condolences on the death of the Queen. The meeting with the Irish Republic's prime minister comes at a time of strained relations with the EU over post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland. The UK is refusing to apply some of the checks it signed up to in the Brexit withdrawal deal, prompting aseries of lawsuits from the EU. Liz Truss met Joe Biden in Glasgow last November, when he attended the COP 26 climate summit Mr Martin has expressed concern about legislation Ms Truss introduced as foreign secretary enabling the UK to alter the legal commitments it signed up to in the exit treaty in 2019. Ms Truss is expected to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks at the UN meeting in New York next week. The state funeral service in Westminster Abbey on Monday is expected to be attended by hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including politicians and royalty. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list for the funeral ceremony but is not thought likely to attend. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that no decision had been made on whether they would be sending a delegation, although press reports have suggested China's vice-president will attend. Ms Truss is expected to have a phone call with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman on Saturday evening. The de factoruler's invitation to the Queen's funeral has sparked protestsfrom human rights campaigners. A declassified CIA report concluded that he had authorised the murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi - allegations denied by the crown prince.

"One of the cheetahs from Namibia released in a national park in India on Saturday Cheetahs are set to roam in India for the first time since they were declared officially extinct in 1952. A group of eight cats arrived from Namibia on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on Saturday. They will undergo a month-long quarantine before being released in a national park in central India. Cheetahs formerly shared jungles with other big cats like lions and tigers but disappeared 70 years ago. They are the world's fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds of 70 miles (113km) an hour. This is the first time a large carnivore is being moved from one continent to another and being reintroduced in the wild. The cheetahs were released into the wild by PM Modi At least 20 cheetahs are coming to India from South Africa and Namibia, home to more than a third of the world's 7,000 cheetahs. The first batch of eight  - five females and three males, aged between two and six years - arrived from Windhoek in Namibia to the Indian city of Gwalior on Saturday. Inside India's plan to bring back extinct cheetahs Wildlife experts, veterinary doctors and three biologists accompanied the animals as they made the transcontinental journey in a modified passenger Boeing 747 plane. From Gwalior, the cheetahs were transferred by helicopter to Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh state, where they were released by a delegation led by Mr Modi. The cheetahs made the transcontinental journey in a modified Boeing 747 passenger plane Spread over a 289-square-mile area, the Kuno National Park is a sprawling sanctuary with prey like antelope and wild boars for the wild cats. An electrified enclosure, with 10 compartments ranging in size, has been built for the animals to quarantine before being released in the wild. Each cheetah will be given a dedicated team of volunteers, which will monitor it and keep tabs on the animal's movement. Satellite radio collars have been put on each cheetah for their geolocation updates. The cheetahs were released in the Kuno National Park in central India Experts say that a combination of hunting, habitat loss and food scarcity had led to the cheetah's disappearance in India. Studies show that at least 200 cheetahs were killed in India, largely by sheep and goat herders, during the colonial period. Some of them were eliminated through bounty hunting because the cats would enter villages and kill livestock. The cheetah is the only large mammal to become extinct in the country since its independence from British rule. This video can not be played The world's fastest land animal is poised to make a comeback in India India has been making efforts to reintroduce cheetahs since the 1950s. An effort in the 1970s from Iran was unsuccessful after the Shah of Iran was deposed and the negotiations stopped. Proponents of the project say that the reintroduction of cheetahs will build up local economies and help restore ecosystems that support the big cats. Cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds of 70 miles (113km) an hour But some worry that relocation of animals is always fraught with risks and releasing the cheetahs into a park might put them in harm's way. Cheetahs are delicate animals who avoid conflict, and are targeted by competing predators. And the Kuno park has a sizeable leopard population which could kill cheetah cubs. There is also a possibility that the cheetahs can stray outside the boundaries and get killed by people or other animals. However, officials say the fears are unfounded as cheetahs are highly adaptable animals, and claim that the shortlisted site has been fully examined for habitat, prey and potential for man-animal conflict. A combination of hunting, habitat loss and food scarcity led to the cheetah's disappearance in India The first cheetah in the world to be bred in captivity was in India during the rule of Mughal emperor Jahangir. His father, Akbar, recorded that there were 10,000 cheetahs during his time. He reigned from 1556 to 1605. Much later, research suggested the number of cheetahs had dropped to a couple of hundred by the 19th Century - and the cat was reportedly sighted for the last time in India 70 years ago.

"The Crown of Scotland (l) on Her Majesty's coffin in Edinburgh was replaced by the Imperial State Crown in London King Charles has done two things simultaneously this week that reveal much about what kind of reign he aspires to. First, he has led the nation in the ritualising of its sorrow - a sorrow that has been quietly expressed and subdued but it is nonetheless real. And second he has signalled to us in the clearest terms possible that this is a reign that will put the future of the Union - the integrity of the United Kingdom itself - at the heart of its concerns. In choosing to visit Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, as well as return to London, King Charles has demonstrated how fully the Royal Family and household have understood the nature of the United Kingdom as a Union state - a partnership of nations. Everywhere he went there were gestures of respect and, indeed, affection for the distinctiveness of each of the three devolved nations. And in that, as in much else, he is following what he called, in Northern Ireland, the ""shining example"" set by his mother. We saw the coffin of the Queen for the first time as it slipped through the gates of Balmoral in its glass-sided hearse. She is the first reigning monarch to die in Scotland in nearly 500 years. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she had famously remarked in life; now she was performing the same service in death. The cortege made its way slowly through royal Deeside, slowing down to pass through towns and villages, where the people know her not just as the Queen, but as their neighbour. She had known this landscape since she was a child: Aboyne, Ballater, Banchory, Peterculter, through Aberdeen to Bridge of Muchalls, Stonehaven and south to the Scottish capital. They stood by the side of the road as the cortege passed, in quiet contemplation. What was the symbolism of this measured progress through the green spaces, the little neighbourhoods, she loved, if not to say: ""I am rooted here; this has been my home."" For that's what Balmoral was - a private home and not a royal residence. She made no secret of the fact that she loved it more than any place in the world. It was where she found respite from the burdens of state and the unyielding gaze of the public. The new Queen Elizabeth with a young Prince Charles at Balmoral in September 1952 I have been struck all week by that gaze. It has followed the new King and those closest to him throughout. Other than a brief time at Highgrove spent in quiet contemplation, King Charles and the Queen Consort have spent almost every waking hour since the Queen died in the public eye. This, at a time when they and their family are carrying what must be an intense private sorrow. This is a family on whose grief the eyes of the world intrude. Duty calls them to sublimate their private sorrow to the imperatives and demands of public ritual This, too, is surely the legacy of the late Queen - it is the steadfastness and constancy with which she adhered to her idea of public service, now visible in her son. Crowds gathered in the streets of Edinburgh's magnificent old town as her coffin was taken to lie in the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the monarch's official residence in Scotland. You could sense the intimacy and informality of that journey from Balmoral gradually yielding to the rituals of statehood and official mourning. History seeps from every stone of that house. This was where the Queen's ancestor King James VI of Scotland learned, in the middle of the night, that he had inherited the throne of England on the death of the first Elizabeth, thus uniting the two kingdoms under one Crown for the first time. In that sense, the Queen was brought to lie in rest in the building that could be said to be the birthplace of the first Kingdom of Great Britain. The Royal Household's attention to the sensibilities and distinctiveness of the three devolved nations of the UK has been striking, not just this week, but for many years. When, in 1999, the Queen opened the first Scottish Parliament in 300 years, she gave permission for the then presiding officer to refer to her by what he called her proper title - Elizabeth, Queen of Scots. Mother and son sharing a laugh at the Braemar Highland Gathering in 2012 She, herself, when she was in Scotland, referred to her son and heir not as the Prince of Wales but as the Duke of Rothesay, his Scottish title. When they took the Queen's coffin to lie in rest at St Giles' Cathedral, they placed upon it the Crown of Scotland, the centrepiece of the Scottish crown jewels. It is 500 years old, the oldest surviving royal crown in Britain and Ireland, made for the Queen's ancestor King James V. Consider the symbolism - it is a gesture toward the distinctiveness of Scotland and its historic nationhood. What have we learned about the kind of reign that the King aspires to? This week, above all, he has sought visibility; like his mother he wants to be seen, to forge a strong link between Crown and people. It was those moments outside, in the street, among the people crowding to see him, hands stretched out to take his, that he seemed to come alive. These were the moments - moments of easy informal engagement - that seemed to energise and excite him. We watched him at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, being addressed by Sinn Fein leaders who do not recognise the legitimacy of his Crown in their country. And yet they spoke to him with sympathy for his loss, and spoke with immense warmth about his late mother. In May 2022's election, for the first time, nationalist Sinn Fein won most seats to the Northern Ireland Assembly Alex Maskey, the Sinn Fein speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a man who was twice interned without trial during the Troubles, stood in the Throne Room at Hillsborough and spoke directly to the British King of the leadership qualities of his late mother. He also praised the role those qualities had played in bringing peace to Northern Ireland.

King Charles with Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, Alex Maskey of Sinn Fein - and the party's Vice President Michelle O'Neill The last leg of his tour was to the country whose title, he said, he had borne with pride for more than half a century: the title Prince of Wales, one he now passes to his own heir.

Queen Elizabeth's visit here in 1960 marked its restoration, a symbol of the long recovery from war and its aftermath that characterised the early years of her reign. Queen Elizabeth, too, hugged the devolved nation close. She made multiple visits to the Scottish Parliament, and attended every opening of the Welsh Assembly and Senedd. But among the cheers from the crowds Charles encountered in Wales, there were also boos and chants of ""Not my King"". This dissent was an echo of pockets of anti-monarchy protests in other places throughout the week. ""I think the biggest danger to the union is arrogance around its continuation,"" Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University told me the day before the King's visit to Cardiff. ""I suspect the monarchy has got perhaps even greater sensitivity than politicians to this because there's a real sense of understanding the cultural and political heritages of each of the nations is very different,"" she said. In Cardiff, King Charles smiled with members of the public after a service at Llandaff Cathedral in memory of his mother The Queen received a similar welcome when she visited the village of Treherbert on her birthday in April 1989 She said the Queen had reflected that in her remarks when she was opening the National Assembly and then the Senedd and expected King Charles to do the same. And he did. Here, too, he spoke of his late mother's - and his own - affection for the country. Perhaps more telling there was the gesture toward the distinctiveness of the character of the country. On the floor of the Senedd, he replied to a motion of condolence from members of the assembly in both languages. ""Through all the years of her reign,"" he said, ""the land of Wales could not have been closer to my mother's heart. I know she took immense pride in your many great achievements - even as she also felt with you deeply in time of sorrow. ""It must surely be counted the greatest privilege to belong to a land that could inspire such devotion. I am resolved to honour that selfless example, in the spirit of the words by which I have always tried to live my own life: 'Ich Dien, I Serve'."" When his mother came to the throne in 1952, the integrity of the United Kingdom was a given. It is telling that King Charles has chosen, as the first act of his reign, to tour the devolved nations. For the landscape is changing. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, a party that seeks to lead Northern Ireland out of the Kingdom and into the Republic, is now the biggest single party. In Scotland, support for independence remains a little below 50 per cent, and has much higher support among the young. Which of his many homes will King Charles live in? How Maori remember the Queen Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' The early decades of Queen Elizabeth's reign were characterised by the long, slow contraction of British imperial power overseas and, in the end, the dissolution of the Empire - an outcome that would have shocked and dismayed earlier generations. It was her leadership that transformed the Empire into the Commonwealth. Most of its members chose to become republics. Fourteen Commonwealth realms remain, in which King Charles becomes head of state, including Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. King Charles will be alert to the possibility that that process could resume, with the potential that some of those realms will also become republics. He will also be alert to the possibility that his own reign could come to be defined by the loosening of the bonds that have traditionally held the Union together. Queen Elizabeth was a powerful force for unity. She came to embody much of the character of Britain itself. We looked at her and saw a set of values - though each of us would have defined those values differently - around which the country cohered. She was the last living royal link with WW2, perhaps the founding shared experience of the modern British identity. King Charles III enters Buckingham Palace for the first time as the new monarch, accompanied by the Queen Consort What will happen to that legacy, to the way of being British that she reflected back to us, when this period of mourning is over and she begins to slip into the middle distance of our collective memory? That the new king inherits a powerful legacy of public affection for his mother has been clear this week. But the enthusiasm of those who turned out in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, London and across the country will not disguise for long the strains that the country is under. King Charles signalled to us this week that he intends to put the future of the Union at the heart of his reign. The Royal household will not make the mistake of seeing those crowds as incontrovertible proof that the Union is secure. We can expect this to be a reign that will hug the devolved nations of the Kingdom close. What next?

"White plumage is popular in the songbird trade Uniquely coloured songbirds are at high risk of extinction, because they are in demand as pets, research has shown. The petsongbird trade in Asia has already driven several species close to extinction,with birds targeted primarily for their beautiful voices. Now a study has revealed that particular colours of plumage put birds at greater risk of being taken from the wild and sold. Researchers say breeding birds in captivity for the trade could help. ""That won't work for all species,"" said lead researcher Prof Rebecca Senior, from the University of Durham. ""But there's hope that we could shift the sourcing [of some pet birds] - so they're captive-bred rather than caught in the wild."" Why scientists are freezing threatened species Endangered bird 'has forgotten its song' Sold for a song: The forest birds captured for their tuneful voices Supplying, rather than fighting, the songbird trade might prove controversial, but these researchers say it could be a practical way to prevent species from being lost from the wild. Caged birds are sold in their thousands in markets like this one in Jakarta The study,published in the journal Current Biology,,externalalso showed that if the most desirable birds continued to be taken from the wild, the populations left in Asia's tropical forests would gradually become ""more drab"". The most striking, uniquely coloured birds would be the first to be lost. To understand the threats to wild birds, Prof Senior and her colleagues carried out what was essentially a stocktake of the species - and the colours - most commonly bought and sold in the songbird markets of Asia. ""We found that species that had a more unique colour - something not similar to other birds - are more likely to be traded,"" she explained. ""And there are particular categories of colour that tend to be more common in the trade - azure (sometimes described as sky blue) and yellow. Pure white is quite common, too."" The scientists also simulated the impact of the trade - removing the most commonly traded species from the wild population. This showed that continued songbird trapping would result in ""more brown and less blue"" plumage in Asia's tropical forests. In parts of Asia, Indonesia in particular, the impact of the trade has been labelled a conservation crisis. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) set up a specialist groupin an effort to prevent the extinction of species that are threatened by the trade,external. Owning songbirds is deeply rooted in local culture in Indonesia. Bird-singing competitions are hugely popular and, at a national level, can offer prizes worth tens of thousands of pounds. Many conservationists have concluded that fighting the trade is pointless. ""Rather than go in all guns blazing and say, 'you can't take these birds that have been an important part of your culture for so long',"" said Prof Senior, ""we could identify the species that are at risk and try to shift the sourcing to captive-bred birds. ""There is definitely potential for that to fill the high demand that exists.""

"Hackers have told the BBC they carried out a destructive cyber-attack against Holiday Inn owner Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) ""for fun"". Describing themselves as a couple from Vietnam, they say they first tried a ransomware attack, then deleted large amounts of data when they were foiled. They accessed the FTSE 100 firm's databases thanks to an easily found and weak password, Qwerty1234. An expert says the case highlights the vindictive side of criminal hackers. UK-based IHG operates 6,000 hotels around the world, including the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent brands. On Monday last week, customers reported widespread problems with booking and check-in. For 24 hours IHG responded to complaints on social media by saying that the company was ""undergoing system maintenance"". Then on the Tuesday afternoonit told investors,externalthat it had been hacked. ""Booking channels and other applications have been significantly disrupted since yesterday,"" it said in an official notice lodged with the London Stock Exchange. Holiday Inn hotels hit by cyber-attack Holiday Inn hotels hit by payment hack The hackers, calling themselves TeaPea, contacted the BBC on the encrypted messaging app, Telegram, providing screenshots as evidence that they had carried out the hack. The images, which IHG has confirmed are genuine, show they gained access to the company's internal Outlook emails, Microsoft Teams chats and server directories. ""Our attack was originally planned to be a ransomware but the company's IT team kept isolating servers before we had a chance to deploy it, so we thought to have some funny [sic]. We did a wiper attack instead,"" one of the hackers said. A wiper attack is a form of cyber-attack that irreversibly destroys data, documents and files. The average wage in Vietnam is about $300 (Â£270) per month Cyber-security specialist Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security at Forescout, said the incident was a cautionary tale as, even though the company's IT team initially found a way to fend them off, the hackers were still able to find a way to inflict damage. ""The hackers' change of tactic seems born out of vindictive frustration,"" he said. ""They couldn't make money so they lashed out, and that absolutely betrays the fact that we are not talking about 'professional' cybercriminals here."" IHG says customer-facing systems are returning to normal but that services may remain intermittent. The hackers are showing no remorse about the disruption they have caused the company and its customers. ""We don't feel guilty, really. We prefer to have a legal job here in Vietnam but the wage is average $300 per month. I'm sure our hack won't hurt the company a lot."" The hackers say no customer data was stolen but they do have some corporate data, including email records. This video can not be played Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work? TeaPea say they gained access to IHG's internal IT network by tricking an employee into downloading a malicious piece of software through a booby-trapped email attachment. They also had to bypass an additional security prompt message sent to the worker's devices as part of a two-factor authentication system. Qwerty1234 is a popular password because it comprises the first six letters and the first four numbers of an English keyboard The criminals then say they accessed the most sensitive parts of IHG's computer system after finding login details for the company's internal password vault. ""The username and password to the vault was available to all employees, so 200,000 staff could see. And the password was extremely weak,"" they told the BBC. Surprisingly, the password was Qwerty1234, which regularly appears on lists of most commonly used passwords worldwide. ""Sensitive data should only be available to employees who need access to that data to do their job, and they should have the minimum level of access [needed] to use that data,"" said Mr Ferguson, after seeing the screenshots. ""Even a highly complex password is just as insecure as a simple one if it is left exposed."" An IHG spokeswoman disputed that the password vault details were not secure, saying that the attacker had to evade ""multiple layers of security"", but would not give details about the extra security. ""IHG employs a defence-in-depth strategy to information security that leverages many modern security solutions,"" she added.

"Health experts are reporting a surge in dengue, malaria and severe gastric infections Recent flooding in Pakistan ""completely crushed"" homes and left people digging for possessions buried several feet deep, an aid volunteer has said. Waqar Hussain, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, travelled to the country with charity organisation Action For Humanity. He visited a village in the Dera Ismail Khan district and said: ""It was like there was no happiness in the village."" Around 33 million people have been affected by the flash flooding. It came in the Monsoon season over the last monthwhich has left almost 1,400 people dead and millions homeless.

"The Crown of Scotland (l) on Her Majesty's coffin in Edinburgh was replaced by the Imperial State Crown in London King Charles has done two things simultaneously this week that reveal much about what kind of reign he aspires to. First, he has led the nation in the ritualising of its sorrow - a sorrow that has been quietly expressed and subdued but it is nonetheless real. And second he has signalled to us in the clearest terms possible that this is a reign that will put the future of the Union - the integrity of the United Kingdom itself - at the heart of its concerns. In choosing to visit Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, as well as return to London, King Charles has demonstrated how fully the Royal Family and household have understood the nature of the United Kingdom as a Union state - a partnership of nations. Everywhere he went there were gestures of respect and, indeed, affection for the distinctiveness of each of the three devolved nations. And in that, as in much else, he is following what he called, in Northern Ireland, the ""shining example"" set by his mother. We saw the coffin of the Queen for the first time as it slipped through the gates of Balmoral in its glass-sided hearse. She is the first reigning monarch to die in Scotland in nearly 500 years. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she had famously remarked in life; now she was performing the same service in death. The cortege made its way slowly through royal Deeside, slowing down to pass through towns and villages, where the people know her not just as the Queen, but as their neighbour. She had known this landscape since she was a child: Aboyne, Ballater, Banchory, Peterculter, through Aberdeen to Bridge of Muchalls, Stonehaven and south to the Scottish capital. They stood by the side of the road as the cortege passed, in quiet contemplation. What was the symbolism of this measured progress through the green spaces, the little neighbourhoods, she loved, if not to say: ""I am rooted here; this has been my home."" For that's what Balmoral was - a private home and not a royal residence. She made no secret of the fact that she loved it more than any place in the world. It was where she found respite from the burdens of state and the unyielding gaze of the public. The new Queen Elizabeth with a young Prince Charles at Balmoral in September 1952 I have been struck all week by that gaze. It has followed the new King and those closest to him throughout. Other than a brief time at Highgrove spent in quiet contemplation, King Charles and the Queen Consort have spent almost every waking hour since the Queen died in the public eye. This, at a time when they and their family are carrying what must be an intense private sorrow. This is a family on whose grief the eyes of the world intrude. Duty calls them to sublimate their private sorrow to the imperatives and demands of public ritual This, too, is surely the legacy of the late Queen - it is the steadfastness and constancy with which she adhered to her idea of public service, now visible in her son.

King Charles III enters Buckingham Palace for the first time as the new monarch, accompanied by the Queen Consort What will happen to that legacy, to the way of being British that she reflected back to us, when this period of mourning is over and she begins to slip into the middle distance of our collective memory? That the new king inherits a powerful legacy of public affection for his mother has been clear this week. But the enthusiasm of those who turned out in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, London and across the country will not disguise for long the strains that the country is under. King Charles signalled to us this week that he intends to put the future of the Union at the heart of his reign. The Royal household will not make the mistake of seeing those crowds as incontrovertible proof that the Union is secure. We can expect this to be a reign that will hug the devolved nations of the Kingdom close. What next?

"One of the cheetahs from Namibia released in a national park in India on Saturday Cheetahs are set to roam in India for the first time since they were declared officially extinct in 1952. A group of eight cats arrived from Namibia on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on Saturday. They will undergo a month-long quarantine before being released in a national park in central India. Cheetahs formerly shared jungles with other big cats like lions and tigers but disappeared 70 years ago. They are the world's fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds of 70 miles (113km) an hour. This is the first time a large carnivore is being moved from one continent to another and being reintroduced in the wild. The cheetahs were released into the wild by PM Modi At least 20 cheetahs are coming to India from South Africa and Namibia, home to more than a third of the world's 7,000 cheetahs. The first batch of eight  - five females and three males, aged between two and six years - arrived from Windhoek in Namibia to the Indian city of Gwalior on Saturday. Inside India's plan to bring back extinct cheetahs Wildlife experts, veterinary doctors and three biologists accompanied the animals as they made the transcontinental journey in a modified passenger Boeing 747 plane. From Gwalior, the cheetahs were transferred by helicopter to Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh state, where they were released by a delegation led by Mr Modi. The cheetahs made the transcontinental journey in a modified Boeing 747 passenger plane Spread over a 289-square-mile area, the Kuno National Park is a sprawling sanctuary with prey like antelope and wild boars for the wild cats. An electrified enclosure, with 10 compartments ranging in size, has been built for the animals to quarantine before being released in the wild. Each cheetah will be given a dedicated team of volunteers, which will monitor it and keep tabs on the animal's movement. Satellite radio collars have been put on each cheetah for their geolocation updates. The cheetahs were released in the Kuno National Park in central India Experts say that a combination of hunting, habitat loss and food scarcity had led to the cheetah's disappearance in India. Studies show that at least 200 cheetahs were killed in India, largely by sheep and goat herders, during the colonial period. Some of them were eliminated through bounty hunting because the cats would enter villages and kill livestock. The cheetah is the only large mammal to become extinct in the country since its independence from British rule. This video can not be played The world's fastest land animal is poised to make a comeback in India India has been making efforts to reintroduce cheetahs since the 1950s. An effort in the 1970s from Iran was unsuccessful after the Shah of Iran was deposed and the negotiations stopped. Proponents of the project say that the reintroduction of cheetahs will build up local economies and help restore ecosystems that support the big cats. Cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds of 70 miles (113km) an hour But some worry that relocation of animals is always fraught with risks and releasing the cheetahs into a park might put them in harm's way. Cheetahs are delicate animals who avoid conflict, and are targeted by competing predators. And the Kuno park has a sizeable leopard population which could kill cheetah cubs. There is also a possibility that the cheetahs can stray outside the boundaries and get killed by people or other animals. However, officials say the fears are unfounded as cheetahs are highly adaptable animals, and claim that the shortlisted site has been fully examined for habitat, prey and potential for man-animal conflict. A combination of hunting, habitat loss and food scarcity led to the cheetah's disappearance in India The first cheetah in the world to be bred in captivity was in India during the rule of Mughal emperor Jahangir. His father, Akbar, recorded that there were 10,000 cheetahs during his time. He reigned from 1556 to 1605. Much later, research suggested the number of cheetahs had dropped to a couple of hundred by the 19th Century - and the cat was reportedly sighted for the last time in India 70 years ago.

"Health experts are reporting a surge in dengue, malaria and severe gastric infections Recent flooding in Pakistan ""completely crushed"" homes and left people digging for possessions buried several feet deep, an aid volunteer has said. Waqar Hussain, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, travelled to the country with charity organisation Action For Humanity. He visited a village in the Dera Ismail Khan district and said: ""It was like there was no happiness in the village."" Around 33 million people have been affected by the flash flooding. It came in the Monsoon season over the last monthwhich has left almost 1,400 people dead and millions homeless. Pakistan's National Disaster Management Agency said that included more than 400 children, with at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage has been caused. It has had a devastating impact on the communities in the Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Mr Hussain, who is one of several British people to travel to Pakistan to help, said around 90% of the homes in the village he visited had been ""significantly destroyed"". ""This same area was affected by the last floods in 2010, but this one was three times as worse,"" he added. He said people need food, water buckets, kitchen equipment and mosquito nets, plus other essentials. Pakistan has declared a state of emergency as health officials warn of a looming health crisis Haris Saleem, chairman of Worcester Muslim Welfare Association, which has been raising money to help survivors, said the situation was only getting worse. The country has declared a state of emergencyas health officials warn of a looming health crisis.with cases of dengue fever and gastric infections rising. ""The situation in Pakistan is still very bad, after the floods have all gone, diseases will be present due to a lack of clean drinking water,"" Mr Saleem said. ""These people have lost absolutely everything, it's a very difficult and hard time for them."" The association was accepting donations online for those directly affected, he said. ""We've already raised Â£15,000 online in two weeks, but we're hoping people will continue donating financially until things settle down,"" Mr Saleem added.

"A planned meeting between Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden before the Queen's funeral has been cancelled, Downing Street has said. No 10 said a ""full bilateral meeting"" between the PM and Mr Biden would instead take place at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. It is thought holding the talks after the period of national mourning would allow more wide-ranging discussions. Ms Truss met her counterparts from New Zealand and Australia on Saturday. The prime minister held informal talks with Jacinda Ardern and Australian premier Anthony Albanese at Chevening House in Kent. And Number 10 confirmed Ms Truss will see Irish Taoiseach [prime minister] MicheÃ¡l Martin, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, and Polish President Andrzej Duda at Downing Street on Sunday. Although she met Mr Biden when she was foreign secretary, next week's UN meeting with him in New York will be Ms Truss's first as UK prime minister. How the Queen's funeral day will unfold Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' Monday's funeral will be one of the biggest diplomatic events of recent years, with some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries expected to attend. It is providing Ms Truss with an opportunity to meet foreign counterparts less than two weeks after taking office. But Downing Street had stressed that talks this weekend would not be formal bilateral meetings because of the official 10-day mourning period following the death of the Queen. It would not be issuing summaries of the discussions as would normally happen after the PM's meetings with foreign leaders, No 10 added. As a former foreign secretary, Liz Truss is not exactly new to rubbing shoulders with world leaders. She'll see a lot of them over this weekend. Meeting them as prime minister, though, is different and the first meeting with the US president is always the biggest for a new PM. When Liz Truss and Joe Biden do sit down, it will be closely scrutinised for any indications of the health, or otherwise, of the ""special relationship"". I'm told that holding it after the official mourning period means it can be much more focused on business rather than reflecting on the Queen. There is a lot of business to tackle. Joe Biden is no fan of Liz Truss's approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol, for a start. The US has suggested it is ""not conducive"" to the other not-so-small matter of a trade deal. All this will have to wait though, until later in the week. In advance of her talks with Ms Truss, Ms Ardern said the death of the Queen would be the ""focus of conversation"", and they were also likely to discuss Ukraine and the UK'sfree trade agreement with New Zealand.announced last October. It was thought the meeting between Ms Truss and Mr Albanese focused on trade, after thesigning of a deal between the UK and Australia in December. Ms Truss also held a phone call with the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, on Saturday in which he expressed his condolences on the death of the Queen. The meeting with the Irish Republic's prime minister comes at a time of strained relations with the EU over post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland. The UK is refusing to apply some of the checks it signed up to in the Brexit withdrawal deal, prompting aseries of lawsuits from the EU. Liz Truss met Joe Biden in Glasgow last November, when he attended the COP 26 climate summit Mr Martin has expressed concern about legislation Ms Truss introduced as foreign secretary enabling the UK to alter the legal commitments it signed up to in the exit treaty in 2019. Ms Truss is expected to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks at the UN meeting in New York next week. The state funeral service in Westminster Abbey on Monday is expected to be attended by hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including politicians and royalty. Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia and Belarus have not been invited - whilst Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua have been asked to only send a senior diplomat. China's President Xi Jinping is on the guest list for the funeral ceremony but is not thought likely to attend. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that no decision had been made on whether they would be sending a delegation, although press reports have suggested China's vice-president will attend. Ms Truss is expected to have a phone call with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman on Saturday evening. The de factoruler's invitation to the Queen's funeral has sparked protestsfrom human rights campaigners. A declassified CIA report concluded that he had authorised the murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi - allegations denied by the crown prince.

"US President Joe Biden has warned that the risk of a nuclear ""Armageddon"" is at its highest level for 60 years. Mr Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""not joking"" when he warned that Moscow would use ""all means we have"" to defend Russian territory. Mr Putin has also said that the US created a ""precedent"" by using nuclear weapons in World War Two. But analysts suggest Mr Putin's words should probably be interpreted as a warning to other countries not to escalate their involvement in Ukraine, rather than signalling any desire to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons have existed for almost 80 years and many countries see them as a deterrent that continues to guarantee their national security. All figures for nuclear weapons are estimates but, according to the Federation of American Scientists, Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads - the devices that trigger a nuclear explosion - though this includes about 1,500 that are retired and set to to be dismantled. Of the remaining 4,500 or so, most are considered strategic nuclear weapons - ballistic missiles, or rockets, which can be targeted over long distances. These are the weapons usually associated with nuclear war. The rest are smaller, less destructive nuclear weapons for short-range use on battlefields or at sea. But this does not mean Russia has thousands of long-range nuclear weapons ready to go. Experts estimate around 1,500 Russian warheads are currently ""deployed"", meaning sited at missile and bomber bases or on submarines at sea. Nine countries have nuclear weapons: China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the US and the UK. China, France, Russia, the US and the UK are also among 191 states signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Under the agreement, they have to reduce their stockpile of nuclear warheads and, in theory, are committed to their complete elimination. And it has reduced the number of warheads stored in those countries since the 1970 and 80s. India, Israel and Pakistan never joined the NPT - and North Korea left in 2003. Israel is the only country of the nine never to have formally acknowledged its nuclear programme - but it is widely accepted to have nuclear warheads. Ukraine has no nuclear weapons and, despite accusations by President Putin, there is no evidence it has attempted to acquire them. IN-DEPTH:Biden says nuclear risk highest for 60 years ANALYSIS:Putin's dream of victory slipping away ON THE GROUND:Ukraine war in maps READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Nuclear weapons are designed to cause maximum devastation. The extent of the destruction depends on a range of factors, including: the size of the warhead how high above the ground it detonates the local environment But even the smallest warhead could cause huge loss of life and lasting consequences. The bomb that killed up to 146,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War Two, was 15 kilotons. And nuclear warheads today can be more than 1,000 kilotons. Little is expected to survive in the immediate impact zone of a nuclear explosion. After a blinding flash, there is a huge fireball and blast wave that can destroy buildings and structures for several kilometres. The argument for maintaining large numbers of nuclear weapons has been having the capacity to completely destroy your enemy would prevent them from attacking you. The most famous term for this became mutually assured destruction (Mad). Though there have been many nuclear tests and a constant increase in their technical complexity and destructive power, nuclear weapons have not been used in an armed confrontation since 1945. Russian policy also acknowledges nuclear weapons solely as a deterrent and lists four cases for their use: the launch of ballistic missiles attacking the territory of the Russian Federation or its allies the use of nuclear weapons or other types of weapons of mass destruction against the Russian Federation or its allies an attack on critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation that threatens its nuclear capability aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy The shadow of nuclear weapons has hung over this conflict from its earliest days - and that has been a deliberate choice on the part of Vladimir Putin. He has raised their use at moments when he has been on the back foot - for instance after the failure of his initial February plan to quickly overthrow the Ukrainian government and now again when a Ukrainian offensive has driven his forces back, His hope will be that a reminder of the devastating power of these weapons will intimidate and deter his opponents and force them to rethink how far they are willing to push. There is also a domestic motive - the Russian population will be worried by the partial mobilisation and Putin's own claims that Nato is somehow threatening Russia itself. Talking about nuclear weapons is a way of reassuring domestic opinion that despite this dark turn, the country remains capable of defending itself. Russian military doctrine says nuclear weapons will only be used if the Russian state itself is threatened. It was notable that Putin framed their use in a defensive sense responding to what he claimed were Western nuclear threats. His reference to this not being a 'bluff' referred to a situation when Russia's territorial integrity was threatened. An important question is how far Russia sees its territory extending after the upcoming referenda in Ukrainian territory. All of this suggests that the use of nuclear weapons is far from imminent or even likely. While the possibility of their use can not be dismissed, especially if Putin feels the security of the state threatened, the response from the West for the moment will likely be to watch closely Russia's actual behaviour rather than the rhetoric and to remain focused on their strategy.

"This recuitment advert, pinned to the door of a GP surgery in St Petersburg, says 'To serve Russia is the real job!' Russia's retreat from Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, has exposed key weaknesses in the supplies and staffing of the nation's armed forces, Russian veterans and military bloggers say. ""You have no idea how tired I am to say hello to someone in the morning and then have to identify his remains later the same day,"" one Russian officer serving as a marine in Ukraine reportedly confided over the phone to a former colleague back home, who published it on his Telegram channel. ""Just yesterday two of my sniper groups were destroyed by a tank. Three men died instantly, the fourth one fought for his life for an hour and a half, another one in critical condition was taken to hospital. We have hardly any men left and we are holding a front line dozens of kilometres long."" While Russian officials and state media are trying to play down the Russian forces' retreat from Kharkiv, individual war reporters, veterans and influential military bloggers are acknowledging numerous challenges within closed messaging channels. Blogs and Telegram channels are littered with stories of inadequate equipment and personnel, compounded by a rigid operational hierarchy. One Telegram channel, sharing experiences of soldiers in the field in Ukraine shortly after the latest retreat, describes how even deploying a small surveillance drone needs to be approved by a senior officer or a general, considerably slowing down understanding of enemy positions. Another channel on Telegram, reportedly run by a Russian special forces veteran, has posted a photo of a Russian soldier sporting an arm patch embroidered with the words: ""There is no opponent worse than your own commander who is aâ¦"" using an expletive to describe him. There is no way of knowing where and when the image was shot, but what is significant is that it has been widely shared by both veterans and forces in the field, suggesting it reflects popular opinion among the country's rank and file. Despite rumours of low morale, Russian war reporters and paramilitary soldiers serving in Ukraine are not suggesting that widespread desertion in the field contributed to the latest rout in eastern Ukraine. They say it is much more likely that units simply obeyed an order to retreat. Some Russian fighters on another channel joke bitterly that the ""special military operation"" - as the Russian government publicly terms it - ""has no goals, it only has a path"". There are not only concerns about poor leadership. Basic equipment appears to be in such short supply that it is having to be crowdfunded. Dozens of public social media groups are collecting money for a whole range of kit -  everything from drones to socks and underwear. One of them, called ""The People's Front"", says it has raised about 1.5bn roubles (Â£15m, $17m) over the past three months, and has already spent it on uniforms, helmets and flak jackets, as well as first-aid kits, binoculars and thermal imagers. Despite such fundraising, hundreds of pleas have been posted online from dozens of military units - including pilots of Russia's most modern fighter jets - for specific items, such as fire-proof uniforms, torches and two-way radios. But the issue is not just a lack of equipment, it is a lack of troops. While there are no signs of imminent compulsory conscription, there has been a push for recruitment - described by the government as an ""informal mobilisation"" - since soon after the country's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defence started posting adverts on popular job websites in early March, something which was rarely done before the war. On one website there are more than 7,000 military vacancies listed -for gunners,external, mortar crew and other combat-focused roles. None of the adverts mention the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Recruitment flyers have also been posted through doors, and displayed on public transport and outside residential apartment blocks and even psychiatric hospitals. This advert inviting men to sign up was shared on the social media page of a nursery in St Petersburg Drafting centres have also resorted to phoning soldiers who have left or retired to ask them to re-join, some of those contacted told the BBC. One soldier who fought in Chechnya in the 1990s says he and his friends were called three or four times. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, says he finally agreed but later refused to sign the contract, put off by what appeared to be poor conditions. Possibly to make the proposition of serving more attractive, the minimum contract length has been slashed from three years to three months, and the upper age limit for a first contract raised from 40 to 60 years old. Advertised monthly salaries range from 100,000-450,000 roubles (Â£1,000-Â£4,500, $1,139-$5,125) - a tempting proposition, despite the dangers of deployment, for those with poor job prospects in economically deprived areas of the country. Russia is believed to be sending several of these scratch units to Ukraine every 10 days, following training of just a week or less. Two separate sources on the front line told the BBC that such units, comprising short-term military contractors and fighters from the Wagner mercenary group - the head of which has beenfilmed recruiting in a central Russian prison- constitute the bulk of Russia's current frontline force. There are reports that those signing contracts may not all be doing so willingly. Russian human rights activists allege there have been cases of men in Chechnya being pressured into joining up by the authorities. Russian independent journalists have reported that up to 500 convicts have also been enlisted. One prisoner, Konstantin Tulinov, was lauded in state media after he was killed during combat in July. Tulinov had served multiple sentences, the latest one for torturing inmates in Russian prisons. Whilst these challenges are being discussed within closed groups, there has been no official acknowledgement of the retreat. On his private Telegram channel, influential state war reporter Yevgeny Poddubny suggested that the latest rout exposed long-running issues. ""The situation is really hard for our troops. The problems which have been discussed both in the public space and during confidential meetings have become obvious."" But there is no evidence that this message is making its way to the top. Poddubny and several other war reporters were seen speaking briefly with President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the St Petersburg economic forum in June. While it is not clear exactly what they managed to explain to the president, lack of supplies remains a key issue for the Russian military.

"Queues are likely at London Underground and train stations on Monday as people travel to see the Queen's funeral. Monday will see one of the UK's biggest transport operations with more than a million people expected to travel to the capital, Transport for London said. Major London train stations are staying open all night, with extra services being put on - some through the night. However, railway lines between Slough and Paddington have been blockeddue to overhead wire damage. The problem is affecting services run by Great Western Railway, Heathrow Express and the Elizabeth Line, and is disrupting travel from Heathrow Airport and Reading into London. Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy has warned that trains will be ""extremely busy"", particularly in London on Monday afternoon and evening following Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral. ""To help us provide the best possible experience and avoid lengthy queues at stations we're asking people not to rush home after the funeral and the processions, but to take their time and experience London on this memorable day,"" he said. Transport staff will be around to help elderly or vulnerable passengers and are advising people to keep an eye on the most up-to-date travel information. On Sunday, footfall at London stations was up 10% from a week earlier, but some stations saw even bigger rises with Waterloo and Charing Cross up by more than 20%. Watch live: Queen Elizabeth II's lying-in-state Heathrow cancels flights on Monday for funeral Andy Byford, commissioner of Transport for London (TfL) said: ""The day of the funeral will be one of the busiest, biggest, challenges TfL has ever faced,"" He said the capital had seen ""huge numbers of additional passengers"" since the Queen died at Balmoral on 8 September, but demand will ""reach a climax"" on Monday. He said: ""We're ready for probably one of the busiest days Transport for London has ever faced...we're preparing for potentially a million people just within the footprint of the royal palaces and Hyde Park."" London train stations including Victoria, Waterloo, Charing Cross and Euston will be open throughout the night across the Bank Holiday weekend. Three Tube stations - Westminster, St James's Park and Hyde Park Corner - will be closed for most of Monday morning to avoid being overcrowded. Some stations will also have stationary ""welfare trains"" so people have somewhere to shelter at all hours. Many shops, restaurants and toilets will remain open in train stations as well. LNER, which is not running ""night trains"", has already announced an Azuma train will be stationed at London King's Cross station all night, with staff on-hand to assist. Avanti is also putting on extra charter services to help ease congestion between Manchester and London. Four extra services will run on Monday. Transport for London has set up a special control centre in Southwark TfL says it will invite customers on its services to observe the two-minute silence at around 11:55 on Monday. TfL says buses will pull over for it, if it is safe and practical to do so, and switch their engines off. The Underground, Overground and other rail services in London will also invite passengers to take part but services will continue to run. As it will be a bank holiday, peak travel restrictions have been lifted. What will be open on the day of the Queen's funeral? Day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Although trains and Tubes have been busy in the past few days, particularly in central London around mourning events, overall passenger usage remains below pre-Covid levels. Many commuters and business people are thought to have stayed away from the city centre. Anyone who bought Anytime, Off-Peak, or Super Off-Peak train tickets can get full refunds during the mourning period if the tickets were bought before the Queen's death was announced. Road closures and diversions are expected to continue for several days after Monday, as event infrastructure is removed, TfL said. National Highways is also warning people to allow extra time travelling in out of London, as motorways and major roads will be very busy. Motorists are advised to avoid central London because of road closures. Motorway service stations will remain open, although there might be reduced levels of services at some locations on Monday. Heathrow Airport has also warned people to take public transport instead of driving to the airport on Monday because of road closures around Windsor. What is open on the day of the Queen's funeral?

"The queue to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall has reopened after entry was officially paused for seven hours, the government has said. But mourners have been warned to expect waiting times of at least 19-and-a-half hours and cold overnight temperatures. Despite the official statement people told the BBC they had managed to join the queue throughout the day. The line is now about five miles (8km) long, stretching to Southwark Park in south-east London. Thousands have paid their respects to the Queen, who is lying in state at Westminster until 06:30 BST on Monday. A separate queue for people with accessibility needs has been paused until midday on Saturday, the government said. The Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) had said entrance to the main queue had been paused around 10:00 this morning after it had grown on Thursday and overnight into Friday. However, people locally said the park and entrance to the line were only closed for around 30 minutes, with another queue then forming outside the park before the gates were soon reopened. At 17:05 the government announced that entry to the queue, at Southwark Park, had been resumed. The government has said entry could be closed again should capacity be reached once more. Regular updates arebeing published on Twitter,external, with a live queue trackeralso available on YouTube,external. The Met Office has said overnight temperatures were expected to be as low as 8C (46F) and the government has said warm clothing is recommended. On Friday evening all entry slots had been allocated for the queue for people with accessibility needs, the DCMS said. ""For everyone's comfort, please do not attempt to join the accessible queue before midday tomorrow,"" the department said. Earlier, Andrea, who is disabled and joined the queue with her mother, told BBC Radio 5 Live they had been abruptly told to ""go home because we're not going to let anybody else through"". ""We tried to speak to some of the stewards, and they were very nice but they just kept repeating the mantra that we had to return home and that they weren't going to let anybody else come in to get a timed slot,"" she said - adding she thought people had joined the line for people with accessibility needs after the closure of the main queue. ""I find it a bit ironic that the main queue is allowed to go on, it's just been temporarily suspended, but we've been told to go home and come back the next day - when we're disabled,"" she said.

One of those who did manage to make it onto it was former England footballer David Beckham who told the BBC he had waited for more than 12 hours to ""celebrate the amazing life of our Queen"". He shared doughnuts and crisps with fellow mourners and posed for photographs while waiting in line, before bowing before the Queen's coffin once he had entered the hall. London Ambulance Service said it had treated 435 members of the public along the queue route over the past two days, with 42 of those requiring hospital treatment. The majority of incidents were faints and collapses resulting in head injuries, the service said. Meanwhile, a man has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Courtafter two women were allegedly sexually assaultedin the queue to attend the Queen's lying-in-state.

"White plumage is popular in the songbird trade Uniquely coloured songbirds are at high risk of extinction, because they are in demand as pets, research has shown. The petsongbird trade in Asia has already driven several species close to extinction,with birds targeted primarily for their beautiful voices. Now a study has revealed that particular colours of plumage put birds at greater risk of being taken from the wild and sold. Researchers say breeding birds in captivity for the trade could help. ""That won't work for all species,"" said lead researcher Prof Rebecca Senior, from the University of Durham. ""But there's hope that we could shift the sourcing [of some pet birds] - so they're captive-bred rather than caught in the wild."" Why scientists are freezing threatened species Endangered bird 'has forgotten its song' Sold for a song: The forest birds captured for their tuneful voices Supplying, rather than fighting, the songbird trade might prove controversial, but these researchers say it could be a practical way to prevent species from being lost from the wild. Caged birds are sold in their thousands in markets like this one in Jakarta The study,published in the journal Current Biology,,externalalso showed that if the most desirable birds continued to be taken from the wild, the populations left in Asia's tropical forests would gradually become ""more drab"". The most striking, uniquely coloured birds would be the first to be lost. To understand the threats to wild birds, Prof Senior and her colleagues carried out what was essentially a stocktake of the species - and the colours - most commonly bought and sold in the songbird markets of Asia. ""We found that species that had a more unique colour - something not similar to other birds - are more likely to be traded,"" she explained. ""And there are particular categories of colour that tend to be more common in the trade - azure (sometimes described as sky blue) and yellow. Pure white is quite common, too."" The scientists also simulated the impact of the trade - removing the most commonly traded species from the wild population. This showed that continued songbird trapping would result in ""more brown and less blue"" plumage in Asia's tropical forests. In parts of Asia, Indonesia in particular, the impact of the trade has been labelled a conservation crisis. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) set up a specialist groupin an effort to prevent the extinction of species that are threatened by the trade,external. Owning songbirds is deeply rooted in local culture in Indonesia. Bird-singing competitions are hugely popular and, at a national level, can offer prizes worth tens of thousands of pounds. Many conservationists have concluded that fighting the trade is pointless. ""Rather than go in all guns blazing and say, 'you can't take these birds that have been an important part of your culture for so long',"" said Prof Senior, ""we could identify the species that are at risk and try to shift the sourcing to captive-bred birds. ""There is definitely potential for that to fill the high demand that exists.""

"Police denied eyewitness reports that Mahsa Amini had been beaten A 22-year-old Iranian woman has died days after being arrested by morality police for allegedly not complying with strict rules on head coverings. Eyewitnesses said Mahsa Amini was beaten while inside a police van when she was picked up in Tehran on Tuesday. Police have denied the allegations, saying Ms Amini had ""suddenly suffered a heart problem"". It is the latest in a series of reports of brutality against women by authorities in Iran in recent weeks. Ms Amini's family say that she was a healthy young woman with no medical conditions that would explain a sudden heart problem. However, they were informed she had been taken to hospital a few hours after her arrest and the family said she had been in a coma before she died on Friday. Tehran police said Ms Amini had been arrested for ""justification and education"" about the hijab, the headscarf which is mandatory for all women to wear. Her death comes in the wake of growing reports of repressive acts against women, including those judged not to be complying with Islamic dress code being barred from entering government offices and banks. Many Iranians, including pro-government individuals, are expressing their outrage on social media platforms regarding the very existence of the morality police, also known as Guidance Patrols, and are using hashtags that translate as Murder Patrols. Videos have emerged on social media appearing to show officers detaining women, dragging them on the ground, and forcefully whisking them away. Many Iranians blame the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, directly.  An old speech of his is being reshared on social media in which he justifies the role of the morality police and insists that under Islamic rule, women must be forced to observe the Islamic dress code. The latest episode will only deepen the divide between a large part of Iran's young and vibrant society and its radical rulers, a rift that seems ever harder to mend. Iran's headscarf video sparks mixed reaction Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what? The Girls of Revolution Street.
