"Ariana Grande's latest album Thank U, Next has broken a UK chart record after debuting at number one. It had the most streams of an album by a female artist in a week - breaking a record she set herself with 2018's Sweetener. Ariana is also occupying both the top and second spots on the official singles chart. She's the first female artist in UK singles chart history to replace herself at number one. Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored is the new number one, with 7 Rings dropping to two after holding the top spot for the last three weeks. Ariana also becomes only the second female artist to fill the top two spots at the same time. The last was Madonna, who was at number one and two simultaneously in August 1985 with Into The Groove and Holiday. Thank U, Next's pole position is no surprise. According tothe Official Charts Company,external, it had been outselling the rest of the top five albums combined. Yet the success of Ariana's latest is particularly remarkable given how short the gap has been between her previous album and this one. Her last record, Sweetener, was released just six months ago, in August 2018. The intervening months have been turbulent for the 25-year-old. Her ex-boyfriend Mac Millerdied after an accidental overdose. Shortly after, she and her former fiance Pete Davidson broke off their engagement. Ariana took some time out, stopped doing promo for the album and asked her team for a break. ""I said, 'I'm not going anywhere, I'm not doing anything. Please give me some time,""she recalled last week in an interview,externalwith Zach Sang, ""and they were so respectful of that and wonderfully supportive"". But she was back in the studio soon enough, and in November released the hugely popular Thank U, Next - a song which referenced not just her split from Davidson, but several of her exes, who she sang she was ""so thankful"" for. However, considering she was only three months into the Sweetener album campaign with several songs already on the radio, throwing a brand new one into the mix was highly unusual. Another new song, Imagine, followed a month later, before the monster hit that was 7 Rings was unleashed in January. These weren't necessarily intended to form a whole new record, but, Ariana explained: ""I was just like, wow, I love all of these so much, this is like an album."" The creative team who had worked on Sweetener were accordingly called back to work on the new project. ""I called the same people back, a month-and-a-half later [after completing Sweetener], and they were like, 'why are we here?',"" Ariana explained to Sang. ""And I was like, 'I wanna play you an album'."" The rest of Thank U, Next was recorded in just two weeks. ""The first week we already had nine songs or so,"" songwriter Victoria MonÃ©ttold Rolling Stone,external. Mac Miller and Pete Davidson are both referenced in the lyrics of Thank U, Next ""Then we spent the next week cleaning them up, adding more things, doing production, cutting a few more songs."" The album was released last Friday, not long after it was completed, and went straight to the top of the download and streaming charts around the world. All the conventional rules were being broken - her team were nonchalant about crowding the market with two album releases in quick succession, and Ariana didn't do a single press or broadcast interview to promote the new record aside from her YouTube chat with Sang. And yet, by the end of its first sales week, Billboard reported Thank U, Next wasprojected to sell,external330,000 in the US, having been revised up from its original estimates. This is a full 100,000 more than Sweetener managed in its first week. Rather than becoming a victim of audience fatigue or radio burnout, something which often plagues over-exposed pop stars, Ariana seemed to have actively becomemorepopular in the short time that passed between albums. The last singer of equivalent profile to churn out albums at this rate was Rihanna. She released one album a year for four years while she was enjoying her most popular era between 2009 and 2012. Ariana recorded a BBC One special with Davina McCall last year in one of her few UK interviews Some have argued the increased success of Thank U, Next in comparison with Sweetener is down to a subtle change in direction from Ariana, who has a songwriting credit on every song on the new album. While there's no drastic adjustment to the music itself, as the catchy R&B-tinged pop hooks have broadly remained the same, there appears to be a difference in the lyrics. Many have noticed that the lyrics are far more specific and personal to Ariana than any she has previously performed. ""It's the most Taylor Swift album she's ever released,""suggested Perez Hilton,external. He continued: ""She has done for the first time what Taylor Swift has always done, which is turn her life into really personal songs which chronicle certain periods of their lives."" Thank U, Nextis the most obvious example of this personal touch - literally name checking all of her famous exes one by one. Ghostindeals with crying over a previous relationship in front of a new boyfriend. ""I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again over him,"" Ariana sings, inwhat is likely a reference,externalto her relationships with Miller and Davidson. She continues: ""I'm putting you through more than one ever should."" OnFake Smile, she sings: ""I read the things they write about me, hear what they're saying on the TV, it's crazy. I know it's the life that I chose... If I'm hard, I ain't gon' lie about it."" Rather than the slightly more vague or generic lyrics of her previous hits (no shade), these were lines nobody else could sing. ""The singles leading up to her new album aggressively fed the gossip machine,"" wrote Jon Caramanica inThe New York Times,external. ""[They] ensured that just as Ariana's music was reaching its peak popularity, she was also the subject of continuous meta-musical conversation."" Some have likened Ariana's more personal recent lyrics to those of Taylor Swift Some of her fans are so keen on the newly-released songs, they've started a campaign to boycott 7 Rings -which Ariana herself has acknowledged.,external But it's not because they don't like the song or have turned against her - but because fans are mobilising behind Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored, hoping its chart success could match itshuge popularity on YouTube,external. Break Up With Your Girlfriend is the only one of the new songs that came with its own music video, effectively making it the follow-up single to 7 Rings - not that declaring something an official single matters much any more in the age of streaming. Even a public spat with the Grammy Awards on the weekend of the album's release hasn't dented her popularity. Ariana had been due to perform at the biggest night in the music calendar last Sunday, but she and organisers reportedly fell out over which songs she would sing. Then, once an agreement had almost been reached, executive producer Ken Ehrlich claimed she had struggled to get a performance together in time for the ceremony. Ariana refuted that, writing on Twitter: ""I can pull together a performance overnight and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity and self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend."" Many felt it was the ceremony's loss. ""The Grammys need Ariana Grande more than she needs them,""pointed out Courtney E Smith in Refinery 29,external. And it didn't stop Ariana from taking home (or rather, getting delivered) her first ever Grammy - best pop vocal album for Sweetener. It was a nice, er, sweetener, for the album to receive before the singer embarks on a world tour in support of it later this year. Considering she now has two albums' worth of new material, she's probably struggling with the set list.

"Dick Churchill was described as ""tenacious, resilient and incredibly brave"" The last surviving member of the real-life Great Escape team has died. Former squadron leader Dick Churchill was one of 76 airmen whose escape from the Stalag Luft III camp in Nazi Germany in 1944 was immortalised in the Hollywood film starring Steve McQueen. Mr Churchill, who lived in Crediton, Devon, died on Wednesday, aged 99. Chief of the Air Staff Sir Stephen Hillier said: ""He was from a selfless generation who offered bravery and sacrifice to secure our freedom."" ""On behalf of the RAF as a whole I would like to offer my condolences to the friends and family of Flt Lt Richard 'Dick' Churchill, one of the RAF personnel involved in the Great Escape. ""He will be sorely missed. Per Ardua [the RAF motto].""

"Prof Djikeng's thinking was moulded by his childhood experiences A researcher in Edinburgh is leading efforts to develop gene-edited farm animals for poor farmers in Africa. Prof Appolinaire Djikeng is developing cows, pigs and chickens that are resistant to diseases and more productive. Among them are cattle that have been gene edited to be heat-resistant. Details of the project were given atthe American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting,externalin Washington DC. Prof  Djikeng is the director of the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health. He believes that gene editing along with more targeted traditional cross-breeding will lead to healthy, productive livestock that will transform the lives of some of the very poorest people in the world. ""We can drive out poverty in some of the most vulnerable communities,"" he told BBC News. ""We are talking about smallholders with just one, two or three animals. ""If the animals die or are not producing to their potential, it means no income for the smallholder's family and the risk of falling into absolute poverty."" African cattle are less productive than western breeds Prof Djikeng speaks from personal experience. His father was just such a subsistence farmer who reared pigs on a small farm in western Cameroon. He told me how each August his father would have a pig ready to sell to pay the year's school fees so he could go to class in September. But one year in the mid-80s, there was an epidemic of African swine fever and Prof Djikeng's father had no pigs to sell. Luckily, his mother kept chickens for just such an emergency, and Prof Djikeng was able to continue his education and become an eminent scientist. But, he told me, the incident had taught him how children's prospects are based on livestock in Africa and how easily they can be robbed of their futures when disease strikes. ""Growing up, I understood that if you are farming and you are that vulnerable, there has to be something there to help, perhaps resilient animals, disease-resistant animals, and developing the best practices. ""At the time, the science was not good enough to make a difference. And it was my commitment to change that. It was a personal mission."" These gene-edited piglets are resistant to a lethal lung disease Prof Djikeng's centre was funded by the Gates Foundation. Bill Gates visited some of the world-leading livestock research institutes around Edinburgh in 2014. He saw that the key to giving farmers like Prof Djiken's father more security was to harness research to create more resilient livestock. Prof Djikeng and his team are working closely with African research institutes to identify local problems and to help them find solutions. He is aware more than most that a colonialist, top-down approach would not work. His team is currently focussing on developing chickens that are resistant to Newcastle disease and dairy cattle resistant to East Coast fever. One approach is to make cows whose coats repel the ticks that spread the disease. There is also a collaboration with a US firm, Acceligen, to produce cattle that are able to cope better with heat. The company has identified a gene that makes a breed found in the US Virgin Islands, called Senapol, naturally heat-resistant. A heat-resistant, high-producing US dairy calf The gene gives the animals a sparse amount of hair and they sweat more. This gives them a slick coat and so reduces their body temperature by at least 0.5C compared with a cow without the gene. The firm has spliced in what it calls the ""slick gene"" into an embryo of a Red Angus, a US dairy breed. A calf called Genselle was born in Minnesota and transferred to a ranch in Brazil, where temperatures can reach 45C. The firm will begin thorough scientific trials with Genselle and two non-gene-edited Red Angus calves to see what impact, if any, the change has made. But the company's chief scientific officer, Dr Tad Sonstegard, told BBC News that the initial signs were that Genselle was settling in well with her new surroundings. ""She acts like a normal animal with no signs of heat stress in what is now the middle of summer in Brazil. And that is very unusual,"" he said. The company has used gene editing instead of traditional cross-breeding because Senapols are relatively poor milk producers. And so it would probably take decades of cross-breeding to develop a high-milk-producing cow that was heat-resistant. The campaign group Compassion in World Farming, hassubmitted evidence,externalto a review of the technology by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics. It opposes the use of the technology to simply boost industrial livestock production in advanced economies, because the process requires modified embryos to be surgically implanted into a surrogate animal to create a new variety of gene-edited animal. CIWF argues that efforts to create disease-resistance could be better addressed by keeping farm animals in better conditions. And it says that using gene-edited animals to boost food production is also misconceived because, it argues, feeding cereals to animals is wasteful and intensive livestock production increased CO2 emissions. The organisation's research manager, Phil Brooke, told BBC News that it was vital to support smallholder farmers in Africa, who are struggling to maintain an income from their animals. ""However, we see gene editing as an invasive technology to be avoided wherever possible in favour of traditional breeding,"" he said. ""Whatever technology is used, it should be applied in ways that are not detrimental to the animals. ""It is good to breed animals that are adapted to their environment but, for example, heat-tolerance should not be used to keep too many chickens in a shed. ""Likewise, disease-resistance shouldn't be used to keep animals in overcrowded conditions in which disease would otherwise be likely to spread."" Prof Bruce Whitelaw, of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, who works closely with Prof Djikeng, says that they are both sympathetic to such concerns. ""In Africa, the scrutiny by the farmer on their animals is much higher than in the western world. If you have five animals, they are really important to you an if three of them die, that is catastrophic. ""The project is to improve the genetics of animals through traditional breeding if possible and if we can't we will use gene editing. That has to be good for the animal; in turn that has to be good for the farmer.""

"Alex Younger, head of MI6, said people returning from Syria warzones should be investigated The head of MI6 has warned that the Islamic State group is reorganising for more attacks despite its military defeat in Syria. Alex Younger, the UK's intelligence chief, also told of his concern about jihadists returning to Europe with ""dangerous"" skills and connections. They should expect to be investigated and possibly prosecuted, he said. His comments come after Shamima Begum, a teenager who ran away to join IS, said she wants to return to the UK. Ms Begum, now aged 19 and pregnant with her third child, said she had no regrets about travelling to Syria in 2015 but wanted to have her baby in Britain. Mr Younger told the Munich Security Conference that so far the return of IS militants had proved a ""completely manageable problem"", but he warned that it was complex and unpredictable. IS teen's return to UK 'could be prevented' Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? ""We are very concerned about this because all experience tells us that once someone has put themselves in that sort of position they are likely to have acquired the skills and connections that make them potentially very dangerous,"" he said. AsIS faces the loss of its last strongholds in Syria, Mr Younger said it was likely to return to ""asymmetric"" terrorist attacks, rather than conventional warfare, and it would be harder for spies to penetrate the group now. The organisation has proved itself ""adept at inspiring attacks rather than directing them"", he said. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 He also warned of a ""resurgence"" of Al-Qaeda,the terror network responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the US which had been eclipsed by IS in recent years. ""It is definitely not down and out,"" said Mr Younger. In wide-ranging comments, he also said: The UK should avoid using a single company for its new 5G mobile phone networks, after concerns thatequipment from Huawei could be used for spying by the Chinese government Russian intelligence agencies, blamed for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, are a ""standing threat"" and ""very little is off limits"" to them The UK's commitment to European security was ""unconditional"", despite Brexit, and that ""lives had been saved"" in the past year because of cooperation between Britain and other EU countries Security chiefs could use a temporary exclusion order to block jihadists returning from Syria, such as Ms Begum, from entering the UK. The controversial legal tool bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. by Frank Gardner, BBC News security correspondent Britain's MI6 spy chief Alex Younger has chosen a rare appearance at this year's Munich Security Conference to deliver two messages. These are that intelligence co-operation with key partners France and Germany does not end with Brexit, and secondly that the threat from the Islamic State group while diminished, has not disappeared with its caliphate. His French and German counterparts shared a podium with him today but, being rather more media-shy, they declined to speak on the record. The overall impression, though, was of Europe's three premier spy chiefs determined to present a united face against terrorism, Russian intervention, cyber attacks and any suspect technology from China. Yet the shadow of Brexit still loomed over this gathering. Intelligence officials admit that without a formal agreement in place there is a risk that legal protocols may soon prevent the sharing of vital data, making counter-terrorism and the protection of populations that much harder. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he ""would not hesitate"" to prevent the return of IS supporters. But Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. Ms Begumtold the Times,externalthat she had lost two children to illness and was scared of losing her unborn baby in the refugee camp where she was living - and has offered to ""do anything required"" to return home. This video can not be played We asked people in Bethnal Green, where Shamima Begum previously went to school, whether the teenager should be allowed back to the UK She was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, who left the UK for Syria in February 2015. Ms Begum escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a camp in northern Syria. IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

"The car hit a tree in Croftmeadow Court Two boys, aged 12 and 13, have been arrested after a six-year-old girl was hurt in a car crash. The girl was a passenger in the car which hit a tree in Croftmeadow Court, Northampton, at 16:40 GMT on Thursday. The boys were arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and and failing to stop. Northamptonshire Police said the girl was taken to Northampton General Hospital with minor injuries. A spokeswoman for East Midlands Ambulance Service said crews were called to reports of a ""road traffic collision"".

"Andrew Hill denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence A pilot accused of killing 11 men in the Shoreham air crash has rejected claims he flew too close to buildings at previous displays. During cross examination at the Old Bailey, Andrew Hill, 54, defended his performances at three air shows. He is accused of ""serious negligence"" when flying the Hawker Hunter jet which crashed on 22 August 2015. The court has heard he hasno memory of the crash, and denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Mr Hill, from Sandon in Hertfordshire, denied claims he had flown too close to buildings in a display at Duxford and the 2014 Shoreham Airshow. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC claimed he flew over the Imperial War Museum at Duxford and then in 2014 too close to Lancing College at Shoreham. After showing footage of the 2014 flight, he said: ""You were about to fly over Lancing College."" Mr Hill said he did not agree. The court heard in an earlier statement that Mr Hill had said: ""I'm surprised by how far away from Lancing College I was."" Shoreham pilot has 'no memory' of tragedy Shoreham pilot denies thrill-seeking Errors made during Shoreham re-enactment Mr Hill also denied carrying out ""a dangerous manoeuvre"" at Southport in 2014. Mr Kark said: ""This is 23 September 2014, three weeks after the Duxford practice, two and a half weeks after Shoreham, seven days after the Duxford show. ""We have looked at the various criticisms. I think it's fair to say you don't accept any of them - overflying the Imperial War Museum, overflying Lancing College."" Mr Hill replied: ""I'm totally happy I was a significant distance from Lancing College."" Referring to the museum claim, Mr Hill said: ""I can't confirm or deny it from the evidence I have seen."" Andrew Hill's Hawker Hunter jet was too low when he performed a loop, the court has been told Mr Kark reminded jurors the court had previously heard from test pilot Dave Southwood, a prosecution expert witness, that the Hawker Hunter should have a minimum ""jet pipe temperature"" - the temperature in the exhaust pipe - of at least 580C before take off, and checking it was required as part of the permit to fly. He said Mr Hill had taken off for the Duxford and Shoreham flights for 2014 at around 550C. Mr Kark told the court Mr Southwood had said if the temperature did not reach the minimum on take off it ""can indicate a problem, that the engine is not getting full power... that means you can run out of runway and crash"". Mr Hill said he had not been taught that element of aircraft maintenance and the requirement was not in his edition of the pilot's notes, so he did not check the minimum temperature on take off, only the maximum. Mr Kark told the court the requirement was also printed on flight reference cards Mr Hill carried in his pocket during the Shoreham air show in 2015. Mr Hill insisted he had never seen this rule and said: ""I for whatever reason had not picked this up."" The trial continues.

"Alex Younger, head of MI6, said people returning from Syria warzones should be investigated The head of MI6 has warned that the Islamic State group is reorganising for more attacks despite its military defeat in Syria. Alex Younger, the UK's intelligence chief, also told of his concern about jihadists returning to Europe with ""dangerous"" skills and connections. They should expect to be investigated and possibly prosecuted, he said. His comments come after Shamima Begum, a teenager who ran away to join IS, said she wants to return to the UK. Ms Begum, now aged 19 and pregnant with her third child, said she had no regrets about travelling to Syria in 2015 but wanted to have her baby in Britain. Mr Younger told the Munich Security Conference that so far the return of IS militants had proved a ""completely manageable problem"", but he warned that it was complex and unpredictable. IS teen's return to UK 'could be prevented' Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? ""We are very concerned about this because all experience tells us that once someone has put themselves in that sort of position they are likely to have acquired the skills and connections that make them potentially very dangerous,"" he said. AsIS faces the loss of its last strongholds in Syria, Mr Younger said it was likely to return to ""asymmetric"" terrorist attacks, rather than conventional warfare, and it would be harder for spies to penetrate the group now. The organisation has proved itself ""adept at inspiring attacks rather than directing them"", he said. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 He also warned of a ""resurgence"" of Al-Qaeda,the terror network responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the US which had been eclipsed by IS in recent years. ""It is definitely not down and out,"" said Mr Younger. In wide-ranging comments, he also said: The UK should avoid using a single company for its new 5G mobile phone networks, after concerns thatequipment from Huawei could be used for spying by the Chinese government Russian intelligence agencies, blamed for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, are a ""standing threat"" and ""very little is off limits"" to them The UK's commitment to European security was ""unconditional"", despite Brexit, and that ""lives had been saved"" in the past year because of cooperation between Britain and other EU countries Security chiefs could use a temporary exclusion order to block jihadists returning from Syria, such as Ms Begum, from entering the UK. The controversial legal tool bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. by Frank Gardner, BBC News security correspondent Britain's MI6 spy chief Alex Younger has chosen a rare appearance at this year's Munich Security Conference to deliver two messages. These are that intelligence co-operation with key partners France and Germany does not end with Brexit, and secondly that the threat from the Islamic State group while diminished, has not disappeared with its caliphate. His French and German counterparts shared a podium with him today but, being rather more media-shy, they declined to speak on the record. The overall impression, though, was of Europe's three premier spy chiefs determined to present a united face against terrorism, Russian intervention, cyber attacks and any suspect technology from China. Yet the shadow of Brexit still loomed over this gathering. Intelligence officials admit that without a formal agreement in place there is a risk that legal protocols may soon prevent the sharing of vital data, making counter-terrorism and the protection of populations that much harder. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he ""would not hesitate"" to prevent the return of IS supporters. But Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. Ms Begumtold the Times,externalthat she had lost two children to illness and was scared of losing her unborn baby in the refugee camp where she was living - and has offered to ""do anything required"" to return home. This video can not be played We asked people in Bethnal Green, where Shamima Begum previously went to school, whether the teenager should be allowed back to the UK She was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, who left the UK for Syria in February 2015. Ms Begum escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a camp in northern Syria. IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

"The teenager accused of murdering six-year-old Alesha MacPhail once told a friend he ""might kill 1 day for the lifetime experience"". A 16-year-old girl said he made the comment in a Facebook Messenger chat after she started a conversation about a crime documentary. The witness told police about the post, from 2017, after the 16-year-old boy was arrested. The boy denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha on 2 July last year. He cannot be named because he is under the age of 18. It is alleged that Alesha was taken from the home her grandparents shared with her father on the Isle of Bute. Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman A post-mortem examination revealed that the child suffered 117 injuries - although the court previously heard some could have been caused by vegetation in the area where she was found. She died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. Another 16-year-old girl told the High Court in Glasgow, the accused sent a selfie-style video to a Snapchat group with the message: ""Found the guy who has done it."" The girl said that post was sent hours after Alesha's body was discovered in a wooded area on the island. The witness said it was posted to about 25 young people who were part of the Snapchat group. The jury heard the silent footage was shot in a bathroom and featured the top half of the accused's body but not his face. The second young witness, who messaged the accused about the crime documentary, also said he privately contacted her just three hours after Alesha was found dead. She said: ""During the conversation he started to get anxious and he said the police were going to blame it on him."" Under cross examination by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, said she accepted the conversation about killing someone was ""fantasy"". The trial went on to hear from another friend, who said the accused was ""feeling suicidal"" hours before Alesha's body was found. He said the accused hosted a party at the home he shared with his parents on 1 July last year which was attended by about 15 people. The 16-year-old witness said the party broke up after midnight but he went back to the accused's house to get his bag. He told prosecutor Iain McSporran QC his friend was lying in his bed and was not in good state of mind. He told the witness he was concerned about his mother's drinking. The teenager added: ""He was telling me he was depressed and he was thinking about harming himself. I felt quite worried for him."" The witness asked the accused if he wanted him to stay the night or if he wanted to stay at his house, which was nearby, but he declined. He said the boy seemed to be better by the time they parted company. The witness, who got home at about 01:30, added: ""He told me he was going to get stoned and go to his bed."" The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared The teenager also told the court the accused was wearing grey jogging trousers and a black Nike zip-up hoodie. The boy was also a member of the Snapchat group that received a video from the accused, hours after Alesha's body was found. His recollection is that the footage featured the accused's voice, as opposed to a text caption. The jury were told the boy was heard saying: ""I have found where the murderer was hiding."" He then pointed to himself in the bathroom mirror. Under cross examination, the boy was questioned further by Mr McConnachie about the accused's demeanour when he returned to the house after leaving the party. The witness said: ""He said he was feeling suicidal."" The teenager and another young witness told the court the accused was physically strong and lifted weights at home and in the gym. The jury also heard evidence that the boy had a ""dark sense of humour"". Two of three men contacted by the accused in a bid to source cannabis gave evidence and confirmed they received messages from him the early hours of 2 July. But, like Alesha's father Robert MacPhail, they confirmed they did not meet the accused in the early hours of that morning to supply him with the drug. The court previously heard that a boy's hooded top was discarded in a skip despite being recovered on a shoreline days after Alesha's body was found. The trial heard that dog walker Zareya MacGillivray contacted police on 6 July last year after spotting the black Nike youth XL garment on the Isle of Bute. It was recovered by Sgt Anthony Hannah, using gloves and an evidence bag. But the jury heard the officer later put it in a skip behind Rothesay Police Station after consulting with a colleague. Sgt Hannah said the discovery came after the arrest of the 16-year-old suspect. He added: ""At that time we had no information that there was anything outstanding from the inquiry."" Alesha had been staying with her father and grandparents on the Isle of Bute Under cross examination by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, he denied his actions had been ""reckless"". Sgt Hannah told the court the top was found about half a mile outside the designated parameters set by search advisers for the investigation. It was removed from the skip when the inquiry team was made aware of it. The court also heard about a knife that was found on the shore opposite Alesha's grandparents' house. Coastguard volunteer Peter Morrison, 39, from Rothesay, told the court he was called out to carry out a shoreline search at 06:55. He said that opposite the house where Alesha had been staying, he found ""what looked like a kitchen knife"". Mr Morrison said he did not touch the knife - which he believed had been in the sea and left onshore by the receding tide - but noted its location before continuing to search for Alesha. He later told police who cordoned off the area. The accused teenager has also been charged with attempting to hide evidence. He has claimed it was Toni McLachlan, the partner of Alesha's father, who killed the child. During her evidence to the court on Wednesday, Ms McLachlan insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death, telling jurors: ""I loved her to pieces."" Before the case adjourned for the day, Mr McSporran told the court he expected to conclude the prosecution case by Tuesday. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"Chicago police have released two men arrested in connection with an alleged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett. The US TV star needed hospital treatment last month aftera suspected racist and homophobic attack. A police spokesperson said on Friday the men were released without charge and were no longer being classified as suspects. Jussie Smollett said he'd been ""forever changed"" by the alleged attack, which took place on 29 January. The 36-year-old actor has said two white men hurling racial and homophobic insults punched him, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck. Earlier,police had dismissed local media reports that the alleged attack was a hoax, and said Mr Smollett continued to be treated as a victim, not a suspect. Who are themen arrested? Two men, Nigerian brothers, were arrested in connection with the incident on Wednesday. They had worked as Empire extras, sometimes going to the gym with the actor, their lawyer said. They had been picked up at Chicago's O'Hare airport, returning from a trip to Nigeria,  their lawyer told US media. ""When they first learned about what happened to [Jussie] they were horrified,"" Gloria Schmidt told CBS Chicago. ""This is someone they've worked with, so they don't want to see somebody go through that."" A police spokesman initially said they were treating the unidentified men as ""potential suspects"" as there was ""probable cause"" that they may have engaged in a crime. No further details were given. This video can not be played Attacked actor 'has tasted brutality of hatred' On Thursday, police had searched their home. At least one of the brothers worked on Empire, police confirmed. Representatives for Smollett have not yet commented on the latest developments in the case. But recounting the night publicly for the first time, he told US network ABC he had hesitated to call police after it happened because of pride. ""We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak."" When police came he says he left the rope around his neck and was still wearing clothes that smelled of bleach. ""I went down to where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened."" Chemical thrown on TV star in 'hate crime' Jussie Smollett: I'm the gay Tupac Police release CCTV in US actor attack case The actor said he had just got back to Chicago that day, and after getting home realised there was no food in the house. He said he had ended up at a Subway sandwich shop getting some food - something people have questioned as strange. He told Good Morning America it was ""ridiculous"" that people thought he would lie about his reasons for being outside at 2am in freezing temperatures. ""Subway is open 24 hours for a reason, so that when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to Subway,"" he said. He said he thought he would've been doubted less if he had said his alleged attacker ""was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black"". ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now."" Chicago police released this CCTV image of two ""people of interest"" in the case There were claims he had told police his attackers were wearing the Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats that are associated with President Donald Trump. ""I never said that. I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae."" But the attackers did say ""This is MAGA country"", he said. The actor said he thought he had been targeted because he was outspoken about President Trump - who when asked about the attack said ""That's horrible, it doesn't get worse"". ""I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,"" Mr Smollett said of Mr Trump's comments. Writers of Empire have stood behind the actor since the attack - and after reports that plans to write him off the show had led to the hoax, they came out in support of him again.

"This video can not be played Climate march schoolchildren: 'We need change and we need it now' Pupils from around the UK went ""on strike"" on Friday as part of a global campaign for action on climate change. Students around the country walked out of schools to call on the government to declare a climate emergency and take active steps to tackle the problem. Organisers Youth Strike 4 Climate said protests took place in more than 60 towns and cities, with an estimated 15,000 taking part. They carried placards, some reading: ""There is no planet B."" 'Why we skipped school' Children's climate rallies gain momentum Belgian children step up climate protest Climate strikes: Will they have an impact? The action was part of a much wider global movement, known as Schools 4 Climate Action. Itbegan with 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunbergskipping class to sit outside government buildings in September, accusing her country of not following the Paris Climate Agreement. Pupils across the UK took the day off school Since then, tens of thousands of children across Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia have been inspired to hold their own demonstrations. The biggest protests were held in London, Brighton, Oxford and Exeter, the UK Student Climate Network said. The group, which helped coordinate the protests, hasfour key demands,external: The government should declare a ""climate emergency"" It should also inform the public about the seriousness of the situation The national curriculum should be reformed to include ""the ecological crisis"" The age of voting should be lowered to 16 so younger people can be involved in decision-making around environmental issues. Greta tweeted about the UK protests, writing: ""British PM says that the children on school strike are 'wasting lesson time'. That may well be the case. ""But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. And that is slightly worse."" Scottish children strike 'to save planet' Hundreds protest in Cardiff Belfast rally calls for action They used home-made placards to get their message across A Downing Street spokeswoman said that, while it was important for young people to engage with issues like climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils. The National Association of Head Teachers,externalsaid it did not condone children missing school to take part in the action and that ""nothing is more important than a child's education"".

Placards contained messages about global warming and fossil fuels Christina (right) - whose surname the BBC has chosen not to use, in common with the other young protesters - says she's worried for her future In London, 15-year-old Christina said the issue was too big to ignore. ""A lot of us are very good, obedient students but when it comes to climate change, it's really important,"" she said. ""The youth of our time tend to get pushed to one side.

Eleven-year-old Hannah Jane's mum wrote a letter to the head teacher asking for her permission to give her daughter the day off Banners filled London's Parliament Square By BBC education reporter Judith Burns Some of those involved staged a sit-down protest Teenagers brandishing brightly-coloured posters packed Parliament Square chanting ""save our planet"". Many were keen to point out it is their generation who will be left to pick up the pieces of our civilisation's waste and pollution. They don't feel the government is listening to scientists' warnings on climate change. Without a vote, protests like this one are their only option, they say. Some climbed onto statues but were quickly ordered down by police. The organisers had planned a revision session to show the protestors take their education seriously but instead, shortly after noon, some of the teenagers, sat down on a crossing, blocking traffic. Again they moved on quickly, but took an unplanned walk up Whitehall. Most of the protesters left the square and marched to Downing Street. The protest is good-humoured, but the organisers' plans have been abandoned. By about 13:30 only a noisy hardcore of a few hundred demonstrators remained, determined to cause maximum disruption to traffic outside the Palace of Westminster. Small groups staged sit-down protests across junctions, surrounding buses, shouting ""engines off"" at drivers and climbing traffic lights. As police dispersed one group another would form. I saw one young man arrested for obstruction - but he said he was not a school student. Some stopped traffic passing in Parliament Square Hundreds of young protesters chanted for climate justice in Cambridge. One of them was 10-year-old Zachary, who attended with his mother.

We were talking about it in our class, so we just came along.""

"Andrew Hill denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence A pilot accused of killing 11 men in the Shoreham air crash has rejected claims he flew too close to buildings at previous displays. During cross examination at the Old Bailey, Andrew Hill, 54, defended his performances at three air shows. He is accused of ""serious negligence"" when flying the Hawker Hunter jet which crashed on 22 August 2015. The court has heard he hasno memory of the crash, and denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Mr Hill, from Sandon in Hertfordshire, denied claims he had flown too close to buildings in a display at Duxford and the 2014 Shoreham Airshow. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC claimed he flew over the Imperial War Museum at Duxford and then in 2014 too close to Lancing College at Shoreham. After showing footage of the 2014 flight, he said: ""You were about to fly over Lancing College."" Mr Hill said he did not agree. The court heard in an earlier statement that Mr Hill had said: ""I'm surprised by how far away from Lancing College I was."" Shoreham pilot has 'no memory' of tragedy Shoreham pilot denies thrill-seeking Errors made during Shoreham re-enactment Mr Hill also denied carrying out ""a dangerous manoeuvre"" at Southport in 2014. Mr Kark said: ""This is 23 September 2014, three weeks after the Duxford practice, two and a half weeks after Shoreham, seven days after the Duxford show. ""We have looked at the various criticisms. I think it's fair to say you don't accept any of them - overflying the Imperial War Museum, overflying Lancing College."" Mr Hill replied: ""I'm totally happy I was a significant distance from Lancing College."" Referring to the museum claim, Mr Hill said: ""I can't confirm or deny it from the evidence I have seen."" Andrew Hill's Hawker Hunter jet was too low when he performed a loop, the court has been told Mr Kark reminded jurors the court had previously heard from test pilot Dave Southwood, a prosecution expert witness, that the Hawker Hunter should have a minimum ""jet pipe temperature"" - the temperature in the exhaust pipe - of at least 580C before take off, and checking it was required as part of the permit to fly. He said Mr Hill had taken off for the Duxford and Shoreham flights for 2014 at around 550C. Mr Kark told the court Mr Southwood had said if the temperature did not reach the minimum on take off it ""can indicate a problem, that the engine is not getting full power... that means you can run out of runway and crash"". Mr Hill said he had not been taught that element of aircraft maintenance and the requirement was not in his edition of the pilot's notes, so he did not check the minimum temperature on take off, only the maximum. Mr Kark told the court the requirement was also printed on flight reference cards Mr Hill carried in his pocket during the Shoreham air show in 2015. Mr Hill insisted he had never seen this rule and said: ""I for whatever reason had not picked this up."" The trial continues.

"Anthony Payne, 80, was described as a ""decent, ordinary bloke"" by his friend A friend of one of three men in their 80s found dead in Exeter has described how he found his body - and an antique pistol next to him. Keith Baker, 68, who found Anthony Payne dead at the 80-year-old's Bonhay Road home on Monday, said he found the gun on the bed nearby. Twins Dick and Roger Carter, 84, were found dead in Cowick Lane the next day. Police previously said a gun was not used. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion on murder. Detectives have until 22:00 GMT to question him. A forensic tent remains outside the property where Anthony Payne was found dead on Monday Mr Baker said Anthony Payne, known as Tony, had been living with him since September and they had known each other for years. He said he had not seen his friend since Saturday, and went to the house in Bonhay Road, where Mr Payne had lived previously, to see if he was there feeding his cats. Mr Baker told the BBC he found Mr Payne on his bedroom floor between his bed and the wall. ""I tried to feel a pulse but I couldn't get anywhere near his neck, that's how bad he was jammed in there,"" he said. Mr Baker said there was an antique pistol on the bed but he thought it was too old to have been fired. ""I could see there was something seriously wrong so I called an ambulance,"" he added. Mr Payne had worked on a farm after leaving school, before doing National Service in the Army, and later did building work, according to Mr Baker. Outside of work Mr Payne was a big Exeter City fan who enjoyed maintaining his allotment and looking after his cats, particularly one called Boxer, who was the ""apple of his eye"", Mr Baker said. He added: ""He was a decent, ordinary 80-year-old bloke and I say it with affection but he was a bit of a curmudgeon."" Keith Baker said he had known Anthony Payne for years A friend of one of the twin brothers who were murdered said he ""wouldn't have done anything to harm anybody"". Martyn Liddon, who runs Exeter-based charity Men in Sheds, said he became friends with Dick Carter when talking to him on the bus. He said the brothers were both recluses and he could not understand what had happened. ""When I heard about it I had tears in my eyes,"" he added. ""I was totally gutted because they wouldn't have done anything to harm anybody."" The crime scenes are being guarded by police as tributes are left outside Police were first called to Bonhay Road at 15:00 on Monday where Mr Payne's body was found. Officers then found the Carter brothers dead about 1.5 miles (2.4km) away at 13:00 on Tuesday. The levels of violence involved in the deaths led detectives to link the deaths. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall Murdered men in 80s had 'head injuries' Twins among three men in 80s found dead On Wednesday, Det Ch Insp Roy Linden said ""significant police resources"" had been committed to the investigation and officers were managing more than 155 ""priority lines of inquiry"" and had seized nearly 300 exhibits.

"Metro Bank has taken top spot in an official survey of customers' satisfaction with their banks, with the Royal Bank of Scotland ranked bottom. Despite Metro's share price having been hit, in part, by errors in the way it accounted for some of its lending, the bank overtook First Direct to go top. Some 83% of its personal customers said they would recommend the bank to their family and friends. The rankings are published every six months by the UK's competition body. Banks must prominently display the results in branches, on websites and apps, with the aim to encourage competition on customer service. Don't bank on it: Why we fail to switch our accounts FCA boss: 'No such thing as free banking' The rankings are drawn from the views of 16,000 people (1,000 from each bank), who were asked how likely they would be to recommend their account provider to friends and family. For personal banking, Metro Bank - which started operating in the UK in 2010 - was the most popular. It has had a relatively tough few months in terms of its share price, but was second in the customer satisfaction ratings six months ago and has now taken top spot. A Metro Bank spokesman said: ""Our offering is simple. We believe in providing the very best in service and convenience for both consumers and businesses, and this latest set of results speaks for itself."" It has switched positions from six months ago with First Direct, with the Nationwide Building Society maintaining its position in third. The Royal Bank of Scotland was bottom of the 16 banks onthe list,external. It scored poorly on services in branches. On the day that its parent company RBS announceda doubling in annual profits, the survey revealed that fewer than half (47%) of Royal Bank of Scotland personal current account customers said they would recommend the bank. Among the various categories, TSB - which suffered a major IT failure that led to the departure of its chief executive last year - finished bottom of online and mobile banking services. Clydesdale Bank was bottom on the ranking of overdraft services. HSBC-owned First Direct, which has no branches, was top of both these categories. Nearly 20,000 small businesses were also asked about customer service at banks, resulting ina ranking of 14 banks,external. Swedish import Handelsbanken was ranked top with an 85% satisfaction rating, with a particularly strong showing in the relationship and account management category (91%). Metro Bank was second and Santander third. TSB was bottom of the 14. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, which published the results, said: ""We introduced this survey last August so that people can see exactly how well banks are treating their customers. ""If people are unhappy with the customer service they are currently getting, I would encourage them to look at the results and think about switching to a better performing bank.""

"John Stalker was the former deputy-chief constable of Greater Manchester Police A senior British police officer who led a controversial investigation into an alleged shoot-to-kill policy by the Royal Ulster Constabulary has died. John Stalker, the former deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, died aged 79, a family statement said. He was replaced as officer in charge of the RUC investigation after allegations he was associating with criminals in Manchester in 1986. He was later exonerated and became a journalist in his retirement. Mr Stalker joined Manchester City Police in 1956 and first made his mark as a young detective during the investigation into the Moors murders in the 1960s. He developed the photographs and listened to the tapes made by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley as 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was sexually tortured and murdered. In 1978 his appointment aged 38 as detective chief superintendent with Warwickshire Police made him the youngest to hold that rank in the country. Paying tribute, his eldest daughter Colette Cartwright said: ""He is fondly remembered by many as going above and beyond the call of duty and was committed to making a difference for those most in need."" Mr Stalker rose to national prominence when he was taken off the investigation into alleged extra-judicial killings of suspected paramilitaries that had taken place in north Armagh in Northern Ireland in 1982, after a critical interim report into the circumstances surrounding the shootings. Among the complaints were claims he attended social events attended by members of the so-called ""Quality Street gang"" - a group of Manchester's leading villains. There were also behind-the-scenes fears that a Masonic plot within the police against Mr Stalker could be revealed during one of the most controversial episodes of the Troubles, according to newly declassified files that were released in 2016. He was taken off the case at the moment he believed he was about to obtain an MI5 tape of one of the shootings. Former Manchester Central MP Tony Lloyd, who raised Mr Stalker's case in Parliament in the 1980s, said he was ""a man of great integrity who was treated unjustly"". Mr Lloyd, who now represents Rochdale, added: ""He was an excellent police officer.""

"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A British woman who fled to Syria as a schoolgirl to join the Islamic State group could be prevented from returning to the UK, the home secretary has said. ""My message is clear,"" Sajid Javidtold the Times,external: ""If you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return."" He added that if Shamima Begum, 19, did come home she could be prosecuted. Ms Begum, who is pregnant, told the paper she had no regrets but wanted to have her baby in the UK. ""We must remember that those who left Britain to join Daesh were full of hate for our country,"" Mr Javid said. ""If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted."" Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Mr Javid added that there were a range of measures available to ""stop people who pose a serious threat from returning to the UK, including depriving them of their British citizenship or excluding them from the country"". Security chiefs in London could also control Ms Begum's possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. The controversial legal tool bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. However Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Analysis: What can the UK do about IS teenager? Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil In an interview with the Times, Ms Begum, who married an IS fighter, showed little remorse for her involvement with the terror group and saidshe was not fazed by seeing ""beheaded heads""in bins. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,"" she said. ""I don't regret coming here."" However, she said that after the ""shock"" of losing two children to illness while living in Syria, she was scared her unborn baby would also die if she stayed in the refugee camp to which she fled last month. She said: ""I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Ms Begum said life in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her expectations: ""The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" But she said she felt the IS ""caliphate"" was at an end. ""I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. ""And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory."" This video can not be played Anthony Loyd, of the Times, describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp Ms Begum's family have appealed for the teenager to be shown mercy. Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rahman, 36, told the Times: ""She was so young - I don't think she had the life experience to make those decisions."" ""I think the hope would be that she would be allowed to return home, as long as the government is satisfied she has turned her back on their ideology,"" he said. Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, who left the UK for Syria in February 2015. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a camp in northern Syria. Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was kidnapped and beheaded by IS seven years ago - said that the group's supporters did not ""necessarily"" have to be treated as criminals and deserved a trial. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she felt ""very strongly that Isis continues to be a threat"", adding: ""It's very difficult to discern how much of a threat they continue to be when they want to return home. ""We have to be very careful and very vigilant with any of these folks who have been involved in so many human rights atrocities."" IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

"Theresa May is sticking to her Brexit strategy, despite her party rowing in the wake of her latest Commons defeat. MPs rejected a motion endorsing her approach by 303 to 258, with 66 Tory MPs abstaining, leading one minister to accuse Brexiteer rebels of ""treachery"". Steve Baker, of the backbench European Research Group which led the rebellion, called it a ""storm in a teacup"". The PM will return to Brussels ""within days"", after her Brexit secretary met EU ambassadors in London on Friday. Steve Barclay will also travel for further talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, with Parliament yet to back a deal ahead of the UK's withdrawal from the bloc on 29 March. 'Tory truce' breaks down over Brexit vote Why has Theresa May lost again on Brexit? Brexit motion: How  did my MP vote? Mrs May is trying to renegotiate the Irish ""backstop"" after MPs voted to replace it with ""alternative arrangements"" earlier this month. Some MPs fear the backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border - will see the UK tied to EU customs rules in the long-term. Thursday's government motion called for MPs to back its renegotiating strategy, but ERG members believed it also meant endorsing calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit. They say the option of leaving the EU without a formal deal offers essential ""negotiating leverage"" in Brussels. But a majority of MPs believe it would cause chaos at ports and massive disruption to business. The EU has consistently ruled out changes to the backstop. The latest government defeat has no legal force and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told BBC political correspondent Iain Watson the PM would return to Brussels for talks in the coming days. Ms Leadsom also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the loss represented ""more of a hiccup than the disaster that is being reported"". ""[Mrs May] will continue to seek those legally binding changes to the backstop that will enable Parliament to support our deal,"" she added. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Theresa May had a choice. Abandoned by the ERG, she could have tried to build cross-party consensus by pivoting towards a customs union. This option is favoured by Labour's frontbench and quite a few Conservatives, and Brussels feels it has potential to deliver a stable parliamentary majority. But many in her grassroots would have pointed out a broken manifesto promise, and even re-badging it as a ""common customs territory"" might have caused a split. So, the PM returns to Brussels to eke out changes to the backstop, and hopes to detach enough Labour MPs to help get a deal over the line by promising new employment laws. If there is no revised deal before March, however, some ministers might abandon ship and urge her to delay Brexit. But doing just that might convince some in the ERG to return to the fold, persuaded to back what they see as a bad deal over a delayed, maybe even endangered, Brexit. Mrs Leadsom blamed Labour for ""playing politics"" to defeat the government. But the chair of the Exiting the EU committee, Labour's Hilary Benn, said Mrs May had rejected party leader Jeremy Corbyn's proposed alternatives and instead sought approval from Tory Brexiteers. ""As long as the prime minister continues to try and keep the ERG on-side... we are not going to make any progress,"" he told Today. ""We have to compromise."" Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told BBC Newsnight the ERG was a ""party within a party... flexing its muscle"" to take advantage of Mrs May's lack of a Commons majority. He called the group's actions ""irritating, provocative and... unnecessary"". Business Minister Richard Harringtontold The House magazine,externalERG members should defect to Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party - a move the former UKIP leader called ""a jolly good idea"". But Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC: ""That's not a sensible approach. The Conservative Party is a team - there's far more that unites us than divides us."" Former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan called for the Conservatives to take a ""collective deep breath"" and resolve matters to avoid a no-deal scenario. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Baker, the ERG's deputy chairman, told Today he was ""standing up for what the majority of the people voted for"", while still ""making enormous compromises"". But he added: ""[The EU] should also understand that there are those of us unwilling to vote to take a no-deal off the table."" Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve accused the Conservative Eurosceptics of being ""completely cavalier about the risks"" of leaving the EU without a formal withdrawal agreement. And he suggested a dozen or more ministers - including six in the cabinet - might resign if Mrs May refused to extend Brexit talks beyond 29 March. Asked whether she would resign if there was not a deal before the end of the month, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she planned to work with all colleagues to help the PM get her withdrawal agreement through Parliament. As to whether the ERG were ""traitors"", she responded: ""No, certainly not."" Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Meanwhile, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney suggested the UK could expect a ""generous response"" to any request to extend the withdrawal process beyond 29 March. Speaking at a Brexit event in Dublin, he said: ""With the practicalities around European elections, the establishment of a new European Commission... there is a natural extension date until the end of June perhaps."" However, Irish PM Leo Varadkar said anyone expecting the EU's solidarity over the Irish border issue to crumble at the final hour was in for a ""nasty surprise"". By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler EU leaders still believe this is not the time to budge. They see the UK arguing, debating and negotiating with itself again - as it has done so often during the Brexit process - rather than engaging with Brussels. As a result of all this, the new round of EU-UK negotiations are going nowhere fast. ""Window-dressing"" is how one senior EU figure described the talks to me, with each side simply repeating their red lines to the other. So, the current favourite prediction in Brussels is that things will only be resolved in March.

"Ariana Grande's latest album Thank U, Next has broken a UK chart record after debuting at number one. It had the most streams of an album by a female artist in a week - breaking a record she set herself with 2018's Sweetener. Ariana is also occupying both the top and second spots on the official singles chart. She's the first female artist in UK singles chart history to replace herself at number one. Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored is the new number one, with 7 Rings dropping to two after holding the top spot for the last three weeks. Ariana also becomes only the second female artist to fill the top two spots at the same time. The last was Madonna, who was at number one and two simultaneously in August 1985 with Into The Groove and Holiday. Thank U, Next's pole position is no surprise. According tothe Official Charts Company,external, it had been outselling the rest of the top five albums combined. Yet the success of Ariana's latest is particularly remarkable given how short the gap has been between her previous album and this one. Her last record, Sweetener, was released just six months ago, in August 2018. The intervening months have been turbulent for the 25-year-old. Her ex-boyfriend Mac Millerdied after an accidental overdose. Shortly after, she and her former fiance Pete Davidson broke off their engagement. Ariana took some time out, stopped doing promo for the album and asked her team for a break. ""I said, 'I'm not going anywhere, I'm not doing anything. Please give me some time,""she recalled last week in an interview,externalwith Zach Sang, ""and they were so respectful of that and wonderfully supportive"". But she was back in the studio soon enough, and in November released the hugely popular Thank U, Next - a song which referenced not just her split from Davidson, but several of her exes, who she sang she was ""so thankful"" for. However, considering she was only three months into the Sweetener album campaign with several songs already on the radio, throwing a brand new one into the mix was highly unusual. Another new song, Imagine, followed a month later, before the monster hit that was 7 Rings was unleashed in January. These weren't necessarily intended to form a whole new record, but, Ariana explained: ""I was just like, wow, I love all of these so much, this is like an album."" The creative team who had worked on Sweetener were accordingly called back to work on the new project. ""I called the same people back, a month-and-a-half later [after completing Sweetener], and they were like, 'why are we here?',"" Ariana explained to Sang. ""And I was like, 'I wanna play you an album'."" The rest of Thank U, Next was recorded in just two weeks. ""The first week we already had nine songs or so,"" songwriter Victoria MonÃ©ttold Rolling Stone,external. Mac Miller and Pete Davidson are both referenced in the lyrics of Thank U, Next ""Then we spent the next week cleaning them up, adding more things, doing production, cutting a few more songs."" The album was released last Friday, not long after it was completed, and went straight to the top of the download and streaming charts around the world. All the conventional rules were being broken - her team were nonchalant about crowding the market with two album releases in quick succession, and Ariana didn't do a single press or broadcast interview to promote the new record aside from her YouTube chat with Sang. And yet, by the end of its first sales week, Billboard reported Thank U, Next wasprojected to sell,external330,000 in the US, having been revised up from its original estimates. This is a full 100,000 more than Sweetener managed in its first week. Rather than becoming a victim of audience fatigue or radio burnout, something which often plagues over-exposed pop stars, Ariana seemed to have actively becomemorepopular in the short time that passed between albums. The last singer of equivalent profile to churn out albums at this rate was Rihanna. She released one album a year for four years while she was enjoying her most popular era between 2009 and 2012. Ariana recorded a BBC One special with Davina McCall last year in one of her few UK interviews Some have argued the increased success of Thank U, Next in comparison with Sweetener is down to a subtle change in direction from Ariana, who has a songwriting credit on every song on the new album. While there's no drastic adjustment to the music itself, as the catchy R&B-tinged pop hooks have broadly remained the same, there appears to be a difference in the lyrics. Many have noticed that the lyrics are far more specific and personal to Ariana than any she has previously performed. ""It's the most Taylor Swift album she's ever released,""suggested Perez Hilton,external. He continued: ""She has done for the first time what Taylor Swift has always done, which is turn her life into really personal songs which chronicle certain periods of their lives."" Thank U, Nextis the most obvious example of this personal touch - literally name checking all of her famous exes one by one. Ghostindeals with crying over a previous relationship in front of a new boyfriend. ""I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again over him,"" Ariana sings, inwhat is likely a reference,externalto her relationships with Miller and Davidson. She continues: ""I'm putting you through more than one ever should."" OnFake Smile, she sings: ""I read the things they write about me, hear what they're saying on the TV, it's crazy. I know it's the life that I chose... If I'm hard, I ain't gon' lie about it."" Rather than the slightly more vague or generic lyrics of her previous hits (no shade), these were lines nobody else could sing. ""The singles leading up to her new album aggressively fed the gossip machine,"" wrote Jon Caramanica inThe New York Times,external. ""[They] ensured that just as Ariana's music was reaching its peak popularity, she was also the subject of continuous meta-musical conversation."" Some have likened Ariana's more personal recent lyrics to those of Taylor Swift Some of her fans are so keen on the newly-released songs, they've started a campaign to boycott 7 Rings -which Ariana herself has acknowledged.,external But it's not because they don't like the song or have turned against her - but because fans are mobilising behind Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored, hoping its chart success could match itshuge popularity on YouTube,external. Break Up With Your Girlfriend is the only one of the new songs that came with its own music video, effectively making it the follow-up single to 7 Rings - not that declaring something an official single matters much any more in the age of streaming. Even a public spat with the Grammy Awards on the weekend of the album's release hasn't dented her popularity. Ariana had been due to perform at the biggest night in the music calendar last Sunday, but she and organisers reportedly fell out over which songs she would sing. Then, once an agreement had almost been reached, executive producer Ken Ehrlich claimed she had struggled to get a performance together in time for the ceremony. Ariana refuted that, writing on Twitter: ""I can pull together a performance overnight and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity and self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend."" Many felt it was the ceremony's loss. ""The Grammys need Ariana Grande more than she needs them,""pointed out Courtney E Smith in Refinery 29,external. And it didn't stop Ariana from taking home (or rather, getting delivered) her first ever Grammy - best pop vocal album for Sweetener. It was a nice, er, sweetener, for the album to receive before the singer embarks on a world tour in support of it later this year. Considering she now has two albums' worth of new material, she's probably struggling with the set list.

"The number of migrants detained in May was the highest since 2006 Congress approved a humanitarian aid plan for migrants at the US-Mexico border, but the political crisis over how to deal with migrants attempting to reach the US continues. Migrants continue to die en route to the border, including a Salvadorean father and daughter whose bodies were photographed lying face down in a river near the border.The photo has led to condemnation. President Donald Trump has repeatedly used the term ""invasion"" to describe the situation on the US southern border. In February he declared a ""national emergency"" in order to force through funding for his planned border wall. However his opponents say his government has created a ""manufactured crisis"". Trump wall - all you need to know about US border in seven charts So what's really happening? The number of border apprehensions dropped by 28% in June, according to US authorities. The decline follows a record number of apprehensions between ports of entry in May - the highest in over a decade. Drops in migrations are typical during the summer months, where temperatures can soar above 32C, but this June saw a sharper decline than previous years. Trump administration officials have attributed the decrease to new policies with Mexico to curb migration. It's impossible to say for certain, but US Border Patrol says it has made 688,375 southwest border apprehensions since October 2018. The previous US fiscal year there were 303,916, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number fell dramatically in President Trump's first year but rose again last year. The number of migrants apprehended at the border surged in May to the highest level since 2006, with 132,887 detained - including 11,507 unaccompanied children. It was the first time that detentions had exceeded 100,000 since April 2007. The UN Missing Migrants project reports that 170 migrants have died or are missing on the US-Mexico border so far in 2019 - including 13 children. Border Patrol figures show that 283 died last year, but human rights activists say the number is likely to be higher. Looking at the wider picture, until numbers rose this spring, there has been a sharp fall in the number of people arrested in the last 18 years. But even before the 2019 spike, when migration numbers were in fact at historic lows, Mr Trump described the situation on the border as a national security crisis. This year's surge in migration is significant, if not the highest ever. And changing migrant demographics have undoubtedly overwhelmed US agencies - but the situation along the border is a different kind of crisis than what the president described for years. Apprehension numbers released by the CBP include asylum seekers (a person who applies for refugee status at a US port of entry or from within the country). In fiscal year 2018, 92,959 people were deemed to have made claims of credible fear"" and asked for asylum at the border. That's a pretty big jump from fiscal year 2017, when 55,584 claims were made. This video can not be played Justice department says toothbrush and soap 'not required' for migrants Kate Jastram, senior staff attorney for the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, says that families fleeing violence in Central America began to make up a much larger part of border crossings beginning in 2014. She says that has more to do with conditions in those countries than any immigration policy implemented by the Trump administration. ""Single men from Mexico were by and large not seeking asylum, they were looking for work,"" says Jastram. ""[Now] we have families and children specifically seeking protection."" In November 2018,a caravan of 7,000 migrants arrived at the US-Mexico border, many claiming to be fleeing violence in countries like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Mr Trump labelled the caravan an ""invasion"". Overall, the rate of asylum denials is on the rise in the US and has been forthe past six years,external. President Trump and his administration have tried a variety of deterrent measures affecting both illegal entrants and asylum seekers in recent years. They are: asylum seekers caught crossing illegally must wait across the border in Mexico for adjudication border officials have decreased the number of asylum cases they process each day, a strategy called ""metering"" last June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that claims of domestic and gang violence would no longer qualify as grounds for asylum in the US - this was defeated in court most controversially, in spring, thousands of migrant children were separated from their parents at the border as a part of a ""zero tolerance policy"" that prosecuted anyone found crossing illegally ""This situation is child abuse,"" Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the government's policy. ""It is an atrocity that violates every value we have, not only as Americans, but as moral beings.""

Who decided to take away children at the US border? Illegal border crossings are not limited to the southern border - in 2017, for example, there were also 3,027 illegal apprehensions along the Canadian border and 3,588 from the coastal border. While cross-border migrants often make headlines, the largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire. This has been the case since 2007, official statistics say. This video can not be played What happens if Mexico doesn't stem the migrant flow? In 2016, there were a total of 739,478 overstays, compared to 563,204 illegal border crossings. It's also important to note that, according to the Pew Research Center, overallthe number of immigrants living in the US illegally has actually declined since 2007,external, in large part due to a dip in the number of people coming from Mexico. Apprehensions at the south-western border peaked at 1.64 million in 2000. Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US What's the state of illegal immigration in US? In total, Pew estimates that in 2017 there were 10.5 million unauthorised immigrants living in the US. A White House briefing report on immigration says3,755 known or suspected terrorists were prevented from entering the US,externalin the fiscal year 2017.

"After his failure to win support from Congress for his demand to fund the building of his border wall, Donald Trump was left with a series of unpalatable choices. Admit total failure on your key campaign pledge. Or go nuclear. He's gone nuclear. By declaring a state of emergency he will be able to raid other departmental budgets to cobble together $8bn for construction on the southern border. He will show his base that he is true to his word. He will argue he is fighting their fight, to staunch the flow of illegal immigrants and dangerous drugs into the country. And it is undoubtedly true that a lot of people from Central America are trying to enter the US illegally - even though less than in previous years. And a lot of drugs, too, are flooding into the US, courtesy of the Mexican drug lords. There is a separate debate about how effective the blunt instrument of a wall would be. Some argue that more effective would be the use of technology and reinforcing the numbers of border patrol officers. But as I say, let's leave that to one side. The trouble with going nuclear, is there is fall-out. This has been presented as a predictably partisan issue. On one side of the wall, Republicans; on the other side, Democrats. But by going nuclear the president has made it more complicated than that. There are a lot of Republicans - in the Senate and in the House - deeply uneasy about what Mr Trump is doing. Why? Because the constitutional arrangement of the US is that Congress controls the purse strings and allocates funds. Not the president. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? This is a major land grab by the president. It undermines the powers of Congress and sets a very dangerous precedent. Let's spin forward a few years, and it is a Democrat who is in the White House. There is a mass shooting somewhere. The president can't force through much tighter gun control measures through Congress, but will now have the Trump card to play. I see your objections, and raise you a national emergency. Bang (wrong word). Tighter gun control measures are introduced. All you need to know about the US border in seven charts Reaction to Trump's decision to declare national emergency On healthcare, ditto. And what about climate control? Yep that too. Lawmakers could be totally by-passed. The emergency powers were designed for a genuine national emergency. If the situation on the border is a genuine national emergency, why has it taken the president over two years to make this move? You can be sure that the Democrats will be considering a legal challenge that will wind its way up to the Supreme Court. And that will delay any building work. It is likely that over the coming months, the lawyers in Washington will be far busier than the bricklayers in Arizona and Texas and California. And the legal challenge will contain one central question - is this a  national emergency, or a political emergency?

"Anthony Payne, 80, was described as a ""decent, ordinary bloke"" by his friend A friend of one of three men in their 80s found dead in Exeter has described how he found his body - and an antique pistol next to him. Keith Baker, 68, who found Anthony Payne dead at the 80-year-old's Bonhay Road home on Monday, said he found the gun on the bed nearby. Twins Dick and Roger Carter, 84, were found dead in Cowick Lane the next day. Police previously said a gun was not used. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion on murder. Detectives have until 22:00 GMT to question him. A forensic tent remains outside the property where Anthony Payne was found dead on Monday Mr Baker said Anthony Payne, known as Tony, had been living with him since September and they had known each other for years. He said he had not seen his friend since Saturday, and went to the house in Bonhay Road, where Mr Payne had lived previously, to see if he was there feeding his cats. Mr Baker told the BBC he found Mr Payne on his bedroom floor between his bed and the wall. ""I tried to feel a pulse but I couldn't get anywhere near his neck, that's how bad he was jammed in there,"" he said. Mr Baker said there was an antique pistol on the bed but he thought it was too old to have been fired. ""I could see there was something seriously wrong so I called an ambulance,"" he added. Mr Payne had worked on a farm after leaving school, before doing National Service in the Army, and later did building work, according to Mr Baker. Outside of work Mr Payne was a big Exeter City fan who enjoyed maintaining his allotment and looking after his cats, particularly one called Boxer, who was the ""apple of his eye"", Mr Baker said. He added: ""He was a decent, ordinary 80-year-old bloke and I say it with affection but he was a bit of a curmudgeon."" Keith Baker said he had known Anthony Payne for years A friend of one of the twin brothers who were murdered said he ""wouldn't have done anything to harm anybody"". Martyn Liddon, who runs Exeter-based charity Men in Sheds, said he became friends with Dick Carter when talking to him on the bus. He said the brothers were both recluses and he could not understand what had happened. ""When I heard about it I had tears in my eyes,"" he added. ""I was totally gutted because they wouldn't have done anything to harm anybody."" The crime scenes are being guarded by police as tributes are left outside Police were first called to Bonhay Road at 15:00 on Monday where Mr Payne's body was found. Officers then found the Carter brothers dead about 1.5 miles (2.4km) away at 13:00 on Tuesday. The levels of violence involved in the deaths led detectives to link the deaths. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall Murdered men in 80s had 'head injuries' Twins among three men in 80s found dead On Wednesday, Det Ch Insp Roy Linden said ""significant police resources"" had been committed to the investigation and officers were managing more than 155 ""priority lines of inquiry"" and had seized nearly 300 exhibits.

"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A British woman who fled to Syria as a schoolgirl to join the Islamic State group could be prevented from returning to the UK, the home secretary has said. ""My message is clear,"" Sajid Javidtold the Times,external: ""If you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return."" He added that if Shamima Begum, 19, did come home she could be prosecuted. Ms Begum, who is pregnant, told the paper she had no regrets but wanted to have her baby in the UK. ""We must remember that those who left Britain to join Daesh were full of hate for our country,"" Mr Javid said. ""If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted."" Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Mr Javid added that there were a range of measures available to ""stop people who pose a serious threat from returning to the UK, including depriving them of their British citizenship or excluding them from the country"". Security chiefs in London could also control Ms Begum's possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. The controversial legal tool bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. However Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Analysis: What can the UK do about IS teenager? Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil In an interview with the Times, Ms Begum, who married an IS fighter, showed little remorse for her involvement with the terror group and saidshe was not fazed by seeing ""beheaded heads""in bins. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,"" she said. ""I don't regret coming here."" However, she said that after the ""shock"" of losing two children to illness while living in Syria, she was scared her unborn baby would also die if she stayed in the refugee camp to which she fled last month. She said: ""I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Ms Begum said life in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her expectations: ""The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" But she said she felt the IS ""caliphate"" was at an end. ""I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. ""And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory."" This video can not be played Anthony Loyd, of the Times, describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp Ms Begum's family have appealed for the teenager to be shown mercy. Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rahman, 36, told the Times: ""She was so young - I don't think she had the life experience to make those decisions."" ""I think the hope would be that she would be allowed to return home, as long as the government is satisfied she has turned her back on their ideology,"" he said. Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, who left the UK for Syria in February 2015. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a camp in northern Syria. Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was kidnapped and beheaded by IS seven years ago - said that the group's supporters did not ""necessarily"" have to be treated as criminals and deserved a trial. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she felt ""very strongly that Isis continues to be a threat"", adding: ""It's very difficult to discern how much of a threat they continue to be when they want to return home. ""We have to be very careful and very vigilant with any of these folks who have been involved in so many human rights atrocities."" IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

"This video can not be played A harpoon was fired to catch some debris successfully The British-led mission to test techniques to clear up space junk has demonstrated a harpoon in orbit. The RemoveDebris satellite,externalfired the projectile into a target board held at a distance on the end of a boom. Video of the event shows the miniature spear fly straight and true, and with such force that it actually breaks the target structure. But, importantly, the harpoon's barbs deploy and hold on to the board, preventing it from floating away. Prof Guglielmo Aglietti, from the University of Surrey in Guildford, is the principal investigator on the mission. He declared the experiment a total success. ""You see the harpoon hit the target in the centre, as expected, and get embedded. The target comes off the boom, but that's not a problem because the harpoon is tethered; it's attached to a wire. So all elements worked,"" he told BBC News. The Â£13m RemoveDebris project was launched last year to showcase ways of tackling the growing litter problem in orbit. UK satellite nets 'junk in space' UK satellite tracks 'space junk' The target breaks off the boom when the harpoon hits home More than 60 years of space activity have left something like 8,000 tonnes of material wandering aimlessly around the planet. From old rocket parts to broken fragments of spacecraft - this waste now poses a serious collision hazard to operational satellites that deliver important services, such as telecommunications and weather observations. RemoveDebris is a 100kg satellite that carries a number of demonstration technologies that could be used in the future to snare this sky-high rubbish. It has already shown how a net could be used to capture a piece of junk. It has also run the rule over a novel tracking system. This vision-based navigation (VBN) technology essentially tells a hunter spacecraft how its prey is behaving - how it's moving and even tumbling. Scale: The target (left) is about 10cm along the edge This was the third demo of the mission. To give a sense of scale - the extended boom is about 1.5m in length, and the target board is roughly 10cm along the edge. The target was made from standard satellite panelling - an aluminium honeycomb structure. The experiment was actually done ""in the blind"", in a part of the demo satellite's flight-path that was out of contact with controllers on the ground at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, also in Guildford. This meant all commands had to be pre-loaded. There was also the added complication that the act of firing the projectile would destabilise the spacecraft; it would immediately start to rotate. ""We knew that would happen,"" said SSTL operator Katie Bashford. ""The spacecraft went into its expected 'safe mode' and the team on the ground was then able to successfully stop the spinning and get RemoveDebris back into the normal orientation."" Harpoons are just one possible solution to the junk issue In the next few weeks, the satellite will undertake its final test - the deployment of a big membrane to accelerate its fall to Earth. This end-of-mission ""drag sail"" will catch the residual air molecules at the satellite's altitude of 400km and pull it down more quickly than would normally be the case. ""It's now really up to our partners in industry as to where they take these technologies,"" said Prof Aglietti. ""As a university, we've given a proof of concept for the basic ideas; we've shown the technology-readiness has reached a certain level. It's now for industry to turn these concepts into a commercial product or business."" It is widely accepted that a range of technologies will be needed to tackle the junk problem. This video can not be played Simon Fellowes: ""To know how something will work in space we need to be in space"" Other concepts are being developed that involve robotic arms reaching out and grabbing debris. But these systems would work best only on cooperative targets. If the junk was tumbling at speed, a net or a harpoon may be the better option. ""The space debris problem is a real problem and needs dealing with. But now that we've taken the first step in showing people that there is a viable way of handling objects, we hope that people will take that onboard and run with it,"" said Simon Fellowes, from the Surrey Space Centre, and who manages the consortium behind RemoveDebris. That consortium comprises 10 partners from across Europe and South Africa. They put in half the mission cost with the other half coming from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 science budget. Already, there are a number of commercial operations in development that would see satellites go up to latch on to ageing spacecraft to extend their lives by providing extra fuel or taking over flight control. It would not be a major step on from this to also bring those ageing spacecraft out of orbit as a final solution.

"This video can not be played Climate march schoolchildren: 'We need change and we need it now' Pupils from around the UK went ""on strike"" on Friday as part of a global campaign for action on climate change. Students around the country walked out of schools to call on the government to declare a climate emergency and take active steps to tackle the problem. Organisers Youth Strike 4 Climate said protests took place in more than 60 towns and cities, with an estimated 15,000 taking part. They carried placards, some reading: ""There is no planet B."" 'Why we skipped school' Children's climate rallies gain momentum Belgian children step up climate protest Climate strikes: Will they have an impact? The action was part of a much wider global movement, known as Schools 4 Climate Action. Itbegan with 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunbergskipping class to sit outside government buildings in September, accusing her country of not following the Paris Climate Agreement. Pupils across the UK took the day off school Since then, tens of thousands of children across Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia have been inspired to hold their own demonstrations. The biggest protests were held in London, Brighton, Oxford and Exeter, the UK Student Climate Network said. The group, which helped coordinate the protests, hasfour key demands,external: The government should declare a ""climate emergency"" It should also inform the public about the seriousness of the situation The national curriculum should be reformed to include ""the ecological crisis"" The age of voting should be lowered to 16 so younger people can be involved in decision-making around environmental issues. Greta tweeted about the UK protests, writing: ""British PM says that the children on school strike are 'wasting lesson time'. That may well be the case. ""But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. And that is slightly worse."" Scottish children strike 'to save planet' Hundreds protest in Cardiff Belfast rally calls for action They used home-made placards to get their message across A Downing Street spokeswoman said that, while it was important for young people to engage with issues like climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils. The National Association of Head Teachers,externalsaid it did not condone children missing school to take part in the action and that ""nothing is more important than a child's education"". It said ""individual school leaders can decide how best to respond"" to any protests involving its students. However, energy minister Claire Perry said she was ""incredibly proud"" of young people's passion and concern. She told the BBC: ""I suspect if this was happening 40 years ago, I would be out there too."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said schoolchildren were ""right to feel let down by the generation before them"", while Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it was the ""most hopeful thing that's happened in years"".

Placards contained messages about global warming and fossil fuels Christina (right) - whose surname the BBC has chosen not to use, in common with the other young protesters - says she's worried for her future In London, 15-year-old Christina said the issue was too big to ignore. ""A lot of us are very good, obedient students but when it comes to climate change, it's really important,"" she said. ""The youth of our time tend to get pushed to one side. We often stay quiet but when it comes to climate change we are going to have to pay for the older generation's mistakes."" Scarlet, one of the organisers, says they will keep making noise until they are heard Scarlet, 15, from Suffolk, is part of the UK Student Climate Network. She said: ""We want the UK government to declare a climate emergency and make moves to achieve climate justice, prioritising this above all else. ""We're demanding the government listen to us and we will continue to make a noise until they do so. ""It can't be about behaviour change any more; it has to be about system change."" Eleven-year-old Hannah Jane's mum wrote a letter to the head teacher asking for her permission to give her daughter the day off Banners filled London's Parliament Square By BBC education reporter Judith Burns Some of those involved staged a sit-down protest Teenagers brandishing brightly-coloured posters packed Parliament Square chanting ""save our planet"". Many were keen to point out it is their generation who will be left to pick up the pieces of our civilisation's waste and pollution. They don't feel the government is listening to scientists' warnings on climate change. Without a vote, protests like this one are their only option, they say. Some climbed onto statues but were quickly ordered down by police. The organisers had planned a revision session to show the protestors take their education seriously but instead, shortly after noon, some of the teenagers, sat down on a crossing, blocking traffic. Again they moved on quickly, but took an unplanned walk up Whitehall. Most of the protesters left the square and marched to Downing Street. The protest is good-humoured, but the organisers' plans have been abandoned. By about 13:30 only a noisy hardcore of a few hundred demonstrators remained, determined to cause maximum disruption to traffic outside the Palace of Westminster. Small groups staged sit-down protests across junctions, surrounding buses, shouting ""engines off"" at drivers and climbing traffic lights. As police dispersed one group another would form. I saw one young man arrested for obstruction - but he said he was not a school student. Some stopped traffic passing in Parliament Square Hundreds of young protesters chanted for climate justice in Cambridge. One of them was 10-year-old Zachary, who attended with his mother. He said: ""People just have to change their ways as we don't want the world as it is right now. ""We just want to make people aware of it. We were talking about it in our class, so we just came along."" Students in Cambridge gathered outside the Cambridgeshire County Council's offices Students marched down the streets of Brighton Ivy, 9, is home-schooled; she received permission from her mother to join the protest in Sheffield A protest was held in Belfast, where students walked out of schools to attend a demonstration at the City Hall. In Wales, hundreds of primary and secondary school pupilsdescended on the Welsh Assemblyin Cardiff Bay. Meanwhile in the Scottish Highlands,pupils staged hour-long walkoutsoutside their school gates. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed youngsters taking part, saying it was a ""cause for optimism in an often dark world"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Theresa May is sticking to her Brexit strategy, despite her party rowing in the wake of her latest Commons defeat. MPs rejected a motion endorsing her approach by 303 to 258, with 66 Tory MPs abstaining, leading one minister to accuse Brexiteer rebels of ""treachery"". Steve Baker, of the backbench European Research Group which led the rebellion, called it a ""storm in a teacup"". The PM will return to Brussels ""within days"", after her Brexit secretary met EU ambassadors in London on Friday. Steve Barclay will also travel for further talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, with Parliament yet to back a deal ahead of the UK's withdrawal from the bloc on 29 March. 'Tory truce' breaks down over Brexit vote Why has Theresa May lost again on Brexit? Brexit motion: How  did my MP vote? Mrs May is trying to renegotiate the Irish ""backstop"" after MPs voted to replace it with ""alternative arrangements"" earlier this month. Some MPs fear the backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border - will see the UK tied to EU customs rules in the long-term. Thursday's government motion called for MPs to back its renegotiating strategy, but ERG members believed it also meant endorsing calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit. They say the option of leaving the EU without a formal deal offers essential ""negotiating leverage"" in Brussels. But a majority of MPs believe it would cause chaos at ports and massive disruption to business. The EU has consistently ruled out changes to the backstop. The latest government defeat has no legal force and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told BBC political correspondent Iain Watson the PM would return to Brussels for talks in the coming days. Ms Leadsom also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the loss represented ""more of a hiccup than the disaster that is being reported"". ""[Mrs May] will continue to seek those legally binding changes to the backstop that will enable Parliament to support our deal,"" she added. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Theresa May had a choice. Abandoned by the ERG, she could have tried to build cross-party consensus by pivoting towards a customs union. This option is favoured by Labour's frontbench and quite a few Conservatives, and Brussels feels it has potential to deliver a stable parliamentary majority. But many in her grassroots would have pointed out a broken manifesto promise, and even re-badging it as a ""common customs territory"" might have caused a split. So, the PM returns to Brussels to eke out changes to the backstop, and hopes to detach enough Labour MPs to help get a deal over the line by promising new employment laws. If there is no revised deal before March, however, some ministers might abandon ship and urge her to delay Brexit. But doing just that might convince some in the ERG to return to the fold, persuaded to back what they see as a bad deal over a delayed, maybe even endangered, Brexit. Mrs Leadsom blamed Labour for ""playing politics"" to defeat the government. But the chair of the Exiting the EU committee, Labour's Hilary Benn, said Mrs May had rejected party leader Jeremy Corbyn's proposed alternatives and instead sought approval from Tory Brexiteers. ""As long as the prime minister continues to try and keep the ERG on-side... we are not going to make any progress,"" he told Today. ""We have to compromise."" Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told BBC Newsnight the ERG was a ""party within a party... flexing its muscle"" to take advantage of Mrs May's lack of a Commons majority. He called the group's actions ""irritating, provocative and... unnecessary"". Business Minister Richard Harringtontold The House magazine,externalERG members should defect to Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party - a move the former UKIP leader called ""a jolly good idea"". But Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC: ""That's not a sensible approach. The Conservative Party is a team - there's far more that unites us than divides us."" Former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan called for the Conservatives to take a ""collective deep breath"" and resolve matters to avoid a no-deal scenario. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Baker, the ERG's deputy chairman, told Today he was ""standing up for what the majority of the people voted for"", while still ""making enormous compromises"". But he added: ""[The EU] should also understand that there are those of us unwilling to vote to take a no-deal off the table."" Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve accused the Conservative Eurosceptics of being ""completely cavalier about the risks"" of leaving the EU without a formal withdrawal agreement. And he suggested a dozen or more ministers - including six in the cabinet - might resign if Mrs May refused to extend Brexit talks beyond 29 March. Asked whether she would resign if there was not a deal before the end of the month, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she planned to work with all colleagues to help the PM get her withdrawal agreement through Parliament. As to whether the ERG were ""traitors"", she responded: ""No, certainly not."" Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Meanwhile, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney suggested the UK could expect a ""generous response"" to any request to extend the withdrawal process beyond 29 March. Speaking at a Brexit event in Dublin, he said: ""With the practicalities around European elections, the establishment of a new European Commission... there is a natural extension date until the end of June perhaps."" However, Irish PM Leo Varadkar said anyone expecting the EU's solidarity over the Irish border issue to crumble at the final hour was in for a ""nasty surprise"". By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler EU leaders still believe this is not the time to budge. They see the UK arguing, debating and negotiating with itself again - as it has done so often during the Brexit process - rather than engaging with Brussels. As a result of all this, the new round of EU-UK negotiations are going nowhere fast. ""Window-dressing"" is how one senior EU figure described the talks to me, with each side simply repeating their red lines to the other. So, the current favourite prediction in Brussels is that things will only be resolved in March.

"This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall US President Donald Trump plans to make use of emergency powers to secure funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. Invoking a national emergency could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access military funds and resources. But what are these emergency powers, and is using them that simple? A state of emergency is usually declared in times of national crisis. In this case, Mr Trump has claimed there is a migration crisis on the US-Mexico border. Declaring a national emergency gives the president ""access to special powers that are contained in more than 100 other laws"", said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. Those powers effectively allow the president to bypass the usual political process. ""Obviously, the intent is to provide for badly needed flexibility when there are urgent crises which Congress does not have time to address,"" Ms Goitein said. Isthere really a border emergency? More than 2,000 people were turned away or arrested at the border each day during November 2018. Supporters of Mr Trump's plans for a wall have said the numbers constitute an emergency. Others argue the migration across the southern border is far lower than a decade ago, and many of the thousands of people who travelled north from countries like Honduras are presenting themselves as asylum seekers, looking to enter the country legally. 6 things that could topple Donald Trump's border wall How much of Trump's wall has been built? Ms Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, said she did not believe the situation constituted a national emergency. ""It needs to be something fast-moving, totally unforeseen, it is meant to be a stopgap measure,"" she said. ""This is not such a thing and it would be a tremendous abuse of power to invoke just to short-circuit the political process."" Ms Goitein pointed to two sections of the law which Mr Trump could take advantage of. One would allow the redirection of funds for military projects already approved by Congress, the other would require the administration to prove the wall amounts to a military construction. Neither are a ""slam dunk"" for the president, who must cite one of the laws as the legal basis for his declaration, Ms Goitein said. The National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status - provided both houses agree and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency. The dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential candidate and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, the Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski, who said the move was ""of dubious constitutionality"". The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. Harry Truman, pictured in 1953, tried - unsuccessfully - to use the powers There is another option of blocking the move through the courts - which is what happened when President Harry Truman tried to nationalise the steel industry during the Korean War, setting a legal precedent. ""If Harry Truman couldn't nationalise the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,"" Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, told CNN. How frequently do presidents usetheemergencyact? Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, used it 13 times, while his predecessor George W Bush used it 12 times. If Mr Trump goes ahead with declaring a national emergency, it would be the fourth of his administration. But emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. ""It's extremely rare for a president to declare a national emergency in a bid to fund domestic construction projects, particularly one that Congress has explicitly refused to fund,"" Andrew Boyle, an attorney in the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told the Associated Press news agency. ""The ones that former presidents declared are of a different sort."" Mr Trump's decision to apply the powers to overcome a partisan impasse over border security has struck politicians on both sides of the aisle as a deviation from the intended use of the act. ""It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past,"" said the Republican senator Ron Johnson. Some previous uses were for issues like the H1N1 influenza epidemic and have since ended. Others are more general and continue to this day, like blocking the property of people ""engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities"". Perhaps the most well-known occasion a president used his powers was in the case of Franklin D Roosevelt, who used them to order the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans in the months after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour. George W Bush used emergency powers in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Centre attack to sign off wiretapping and interrogation methods later decried as torture.

"The number of migrants detained in May was the highest since 2006 Congress approved a humanitarian aid plan for migrants at the US-Mexico border, but the political crisis over how to deal with migrants attempting to reach the US continues. Migrants continue to die en route to the border, including a Salvadorean father and daughter whose bodies were photographed lying face down in a river near the border.The photo has led to condemnation. President Donald Trump has repeatedly used the term ""invasion"" to describe the situation on the US southern border. In February he declared a ""national emergency"" in order to force through funding for his planned border wall. However his opponents say his government has created a ""manufactured crisis"". Trump wall - all you need to know about US border in seven charts So what's really happening? The number of border apprehensions dropped by 28% in June, according to US authorities. The decline follows a record number of apprehensions between ports of entry in May - the highest in over a decade. Drops in migrations are typical during the summer months, where temperatures can soar above 32C, but this June saw a sharper decline than previous years. Trump administration officials have attributed the decrease to new policies with Mexico to curb migration. It's impossible to say for certain, but US Border Patrol says it has made 688,375 southwest border apprehensions since October 2018. The previous US fiscal year there were 303,916, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number fell dramatically in President Trump's first year but rose again last year. The number of migrants apprehended at the border surged in May to the highest level since 2006, with 132,887 detained - including 11,507 unaccompanied children. It was the first time that detentions had exceeded 100,000 since April 2007. The UN Missing Migrants project reports that 170 migrants have died or are missing on the US-Mexico border so far in 2019 - including 13 children. Border Patrol figures show that 283 died last year, but human rights activists say the number is likely to be higher. Looking at the wider picture, until numbers rose this spring, there has been a sharp fall in the number of people arrested in the last 18 years. But even before the 2019 spike, when migration numbers were in fact at historic lows, Mr Trump described the situation on the border as a national security crisis. This year's surge in migration is significant, if not the highest ever. And changing migrant demographics have undoubtedly overwhelmed US agencies - but the situation along the border is a different kind of crisis than what the president described for years. Apprehension numbers released by the CBP include asylum seekers (a person who applies for refugee status at a US port of entry or from within the country). In fiscal year 2018, 92,959 people were deemed to have made claims of credible fear"" and asked for asylum at the border. That's a pretty big jump from fiscal year 2017, when 55,584 claims were made. This video can not be played Justice department says toothbrush and soap 'not required' for migrants Kate Jastram, senior staff attorney for the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, says that families fleeing violence in Central America began to make up a much larger part of border crossings beginning in 2014. She says that has more to do with conditions in those countries than any immigration policy implemented by the Trump administration. ""Single men from Mexico were by and large not seeking asylum, they were looking for work,"" says Jastram. ""[Now] we have families and children specifically seeking protection."" In November 2018,a caravan of 7,000 migrants arrived at the US-Mexico border, many claiming to be fleeing violence in countries like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Mr Trump labelled the caravan an ""invasion"". Overall, the rate of asylum denials is on the rise in the US and has been forthe past six years,external. President Trump and his administration have tried a variety of deterrent measures affecting both illegal entrants and asylum seekers in recent years. They are: asylum seekers caught crossing illegally must wait across the border in Mexico for adjudication border officials have decreased the number of asylum cases they process each day, a strategy called ""metering"" last June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that claims of domestic and gang violence would no longer qualify as grounds for asylum in the US - this was defeated in court most controversially, in spring, thousands of migrant children were separated from their parents at the border as a part of a ""zero tolerance policy"" that prosecuted anyone found crossing illegally ""This situation is child abuse,"" Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the government's policy. ""It is an atrocity that violates every value we have, not only as Americans, but as moral beings.""

Who decided to take away children at the US border? Illegal border crossings are not limited to the southern border - in 2017, for example, there were also 3,027 illegal apprehensions along the Canadian border and 3,588 from the coastal border. While cross-border migrants often make headlines, the largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire. This has been the case since 2007, official statistics say. This video can not be played What happens if Mexico doesn't stem the migrant flow? In 2016, there were a total of 739,478 overstays, compared to 563,204 illegal border crossings. It's also important to note that, according to the Pew Research Center, overallthe number of immigrants living in the US illegally has actually declined since 2007,external, in large part due to a dip in the number of people coming from Mexico. Apprehensions at the south-western border peaked at 1.64 million in 2000. Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US What's the state of illegal immigration in US? In total, Pew estimates that in 2017 there were 10.5 million unauthorised immigrants living in the US. A White House briefing report on immigration says3,755 known or suspected terrorists were prevented from entering the US,externalin the fiscal year 2017. But that includes terror suspects who have been stopped at any US border, and the vast majority are stopped at airports.

"This video can not be played Indian Interior Minister Rajnath Singh meets injured troops India has said it will ensure the ""complete isolation"" of Pakistan after a suicide bomber killed 46 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir. It claims to have ""incontrovertible evidence"" of its neighbour's involvement but has not provided it. Pakistan denies any role in the attack by militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, which is based on its soil. Thursday's bombing of the convoy was the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region for decades. Federal Minister Arun Jaitley said India would take ""all possible diplomatic steps"" to cut Pakistan off from the international community. But a Pakistani minister has asked India to reveal their evidence, and offered to help them investigate the attack. In pictures: India mourns attack victims There has been an insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir since the late 1980s but violence has risen in recent years. Protests were held in Jammu after Thursday's attack In the wake of the attack, authorities have imposed a curfew in parts of Hindu-majority Jammu city after an angry mob vandalised cars in a largely Muslim neighbourhood. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but only control parts of it. India says that Pakistan has long given safe haven to Jaish-e-Mohammad militants and accused it of having a ""direct hand"" in Thursday's attack. It has called for global sanctions against the group and for its leader, Masood Azhar, to be listed as a terrorist by the UN security council. India has tried to do this several times in the past but was repeatedly blocked by China, an ally of Pakistan. Mr Jaitley set out India's determination to hold Pakistan to account when speaking to reporters after attending a security meeting early on Friday. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Viewpoint: How far might India go? What is Jaish-e-Mohammad? He also confirmed that India would revoke Most Favoured Nation status from Pakistan, a special trading privilege granted in 1996. Pakistan said it was gravely concerned by the bombing but firmly rejected allegations that it was responsible. The country's Information Minister, Fawad Chaudry, asked India to show its evidence, and offered to help the investigation into the attack. ""This needs evidence,"" he told broadcaster CNN-News18. ""This needs an investigation."" India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a speech that those behind the attack would pay a ""heavy price"", leading many analysts to expect further action from Delhi. But they say that the government's military options appear limited due to heavy snow across the region. After a 2016 attack on an Indian army base that killed 19 soldiers, Delhi said it carried out a campaign of ""surgical strikes"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, across the de facto border. But aBBC investigation found little evidence militants had been hit. The bomber used a vehicle packed with explosives to ram a convoy of 78 buses carrying Indian security forces on the heavily guarded Srinagar-Jammu highway about 20km (12 miles) from the capital, Srinagar. The bomber is reported to be Adil Dar, a high school dropout who left home in March 2018. He is believed to be between the ages of 19 and 21. This video can not be played The blast took place on a heavily guarded highway Soon after the attack, Jaish-e-Mohammad released a video in which a young man identified as Dar spoke about what he described as atrocities against Kashmiri Muslims. He said he had joined the group in 2018 and was eventually ""assigned"" the task of carrying out the attack in Pulwama. Injured baby refuels India pellet gun row Is India losing Kashmir? He also said that by the time the video was releasedÂ he would be in jannat (heaven). Dar is one of many young Kashmiri men who have been radicalised in recent years. On Thursday, main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that the number of Kashmiri men joining militancy had risen from 88 in 2016 to 191 in 2018. India has been accused of using brutal tactics to put down protests in Kashmir - with thousands of people sustaining eye injuries from pellet guns used by security forces. by Arvind Chhabra, BBC News Punjabi Kulwinder Singh was killed in the attack on Thursday ""I'm proud of my son. He has sacrificed himself for his family,"" says Darshan Singh, whose son, Kulwinder, died in the suicide attack in Kashmir. Mr Singh, who lives in Rauli village in Punjab, last saw Kulwinder on 10 February, before he returned to Kashmir at the end of his vacation. His son was 26 and planned to marry in November: ""We talked of only his wedding. We had finalised the caterers and the venue."" ""It feels like my son is always with me,"" Mr Singh says, pointing to the jacket he is wearing. It belonged to Kulwinder and has his name embroidered on it. Darshan Singh says his son was like a friend to him and he had been waiting to see him come home with his bride.  ""I didn't know we would instead be waiting for his body."" There have been at least 10 suicide attacks since 1989 but this is only the second to use a vehicle. Prior to Thursday's bombing, the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir this century came in 2002, when militants killed at least 31 people at an army base in Kaluchak, near Jammu, most of them civilians and relatives of soldiers.

"Andrea Levy's The Long Song featured Sir Lenny Henry in the BBC One adaptation British author Andrea Levy, whose award-winning novels captured the black British experience in the years after Windrush, has died at the age of 62. A statement released on behalf of her family said she died of cancer. Levy was born in 1956 to Jamaican parents who had travelled to England on the Empire Windrush in 1948. Sir Lenny Henry, who played a slave in the BBC adaptation of her novel The Long Song, said he had ""loved hanging out with this pugnacious woman"". Levy was best known for Small Island, about two Jamaicans who came to England after World War Two, and The Long Song, her last novel. The 2010 novel was nominated for the Booker Prize and was adapted by BBC One last year. Obituary: Andrea Levy Unlike her other four novels, The Long Song was not set in post-war Britain but reached back to early 19th Century Jamaica during the last years of slavery. Sir Lennywrote in a tribute,external: ""She was funny, had attitude and was immensely smart."" Her publisher Headline said it was ""hugely saddened"" by her death on 14 February, adding that she ""had been ill for some time"". The poet Benjamin Zephaniah said of Levy: ""In the future if anybody wants to have a look at how the Windrush generation arrived here and how we the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation survived and are surviving, they have to refer to Andrea's work ."" Actress and director Kathy Burke said Levy was ""such a great writer,external"" and that The Long Song had been ""the best thing on telly last Christmas"". The Long Song examined the years before and after the end of slavery Levy did not start writing until she was in her mid-30s, after enrolling in a creative writing class at an adult education college in London. In 1994 she published her first novel, Every Light in the House Burninâ², a semi-autobiographical look at a young woman growing up in north London in the 1960s. Before that, little had been written about the lives of Jamaican immigrants and their families. It was not until the release of Small Island in 2004 that her writing really took off, with her fourth novel earning her the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The novel was praised for its compelling, intertwined tales of Jamaicans who moved from their own small island to Britain, and the Britons in whose home they lodged. Writing on Twitter,external, playwright and commentator Bonnie Greer recalled being sent a copy of Small Island to review and recognising it as ""a masterpiece"". Small Island was adapted for a 2009 BBC TV series starring Naomie Harris and Ruth Wilson. A stage version opens at the National Theatre in April.

"Police issued a new photo of Abdulah Husseini (left) A ""doppelganger"" of Friends actor David Schwimmer has denied a string of fraud and theft offences. Abdulah Husseini, 36, of Spencer Road, Slough, west London, appeared at Preston Crown Court via video link on Friday. He giggled and put his hand over his mouth when Judge Beverley Lunt asked: ""Is this the Ross from Friends case?"" Joe Allman, prosecuting, replied: ""It is the one with the doppelganger, your honour."" Mr Husseini, from Tehran, pleaded not guilty to the theft of a wallet in Blackpool on 20 September last year. He also denied five fraud offences by allegedly using or attempting to use a stolen Halifax bank card on 17 occasions in shops between 20 September and 5 November last year. An appeal by Lancashire Police went viral, fuelled by David Schwimmer's own take (shown on the left) Social media users first pointed out the likeness of the defendant to Schwimmer's character Ross Geller in the popular US sitcom when police in Blackpool posted an image of a man leaving a restaurant and carrying what appeared to be a carton of beer cans. Schwimmer later responded and posted a video on his Twitter account that showed him scurrying through a convenience store carrying a carton of beer before looking up furtively at a CCTV camera. A trial date for the Blackpool theft and fraud offences was set for 4 July.

"This video can not be played Ross McEwan, boss of RBS Royal Bank of Scotland has reported profits of Â£1.62bn for 2018, more than double the Â£752m it made a year earlier. RBS chief Ross McEwan called the results ""a good performance in the face of economic and political uncertainty"". Mr McEwan said the UK economy faced ""a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations"". He told the BBC that Brexit could have a bigger impact on theeconomy than the Bank of England has suggested,external. Mr McEwan said: ""Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals. ""If this goes on for a long period of time we're going to see the economy slowing down more than the Bank of England suggested. ""We have a very small period of time left until the end of March and it's time that our politicians got to the conclusion so that we can get some certainty going forward."" He said that 2018 saw benign economic conditions continue, with low defaults by customers on their loans. But the bank's statement,externalnoted the potential impact of ""ongoing political uncertainties and geopolitical tensions"" which could affect its customers, and, as a result, defaults were expected to increase this year. Asked how the bank is preparing for a no deal Brexit, Mr McEwan told the BBC: ""For those businesses that are a bit concerned they may have to pre-buy a number of raw materials for their production, we've put aside Â£3bn for what we call a Growth Fund"". RBS said NatWest had lent or approved Â£1.9bn to UK businesses to deal with Brexit (out of a possible Â£3bn). This could be to stockpile, find new suppliers or to secure trade financing. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of Â£45bn and it still owns 62% of the company. In October,RBS paid its first dividend to shareholders since its bailout. In its latest results, the bank announced a final dividend of 3.5p per share, and also a 7.5p special dividend, which means the Treasury is set to receive Â£977m. While the government is still RBS's main shareholder, it also has about 190,000 private investors. The government has been selling off blocks of shares it owns in the bank, and aims to have sold all of its stake by 2024. But it realises a loss every time it does this as it paid 502p a share and they have not yet returned to that level. RBS shares are currently trading at about 240p. Analysis: Rob Young, BBC business correspondent After RBS's near-death experience a decade ago, this looks like a very different bank. It's a lot smaller, having sold off large chunks. It also seems to have largely dealt with the financial consequences of its past bad behaviour. RBS hasn't had to set aside more cash to pay for PPI compensation this year. The boss of RBS, Ross McEwan, says the bank is pretty much fixed. That doesn't mean taxpayers are about to get all of their Â£45bn bailout cheque paid back. Despite the bank's rising profits, we'll probably still own part of it for a few more years yet. And even when we no longer have a stake in RBS, few expect the Treasury to break even. There's also the chance that political events could knock plans to sell off the public stake. The bank is warning of the economic consequences of a no deal Brexit. Mr McEwan says a deal needs to be done by the end of March. If not, he says the economy would take a hit. That could mean a rise in bad loans for the bank. That wouldn't be good for RBS's recovery. RBS has continued with its plan to shrink itself. Its assets, which in banking largely means its outstanding loans, shrank from Â£738.1bn to Â£694.2bn. Before the financial crisis, it was briefly the largest bank in the world by assets. The bank said the switch from physical to digital services was continuing to grow rapidly with 6.4 million customers now regularly using its mobile app, a 16% rise from 2017. But it gave a severe assessment of the risks presented by cyberattacks. It said such attacks were increasing in frequency, sophistication, impact and severity. Competition in the mortgage market meant profit margins remained thin, it said. Its net interest margin - the difference between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans, and a key measure of a bank's ability to make money - shrank to 1.98% from 2.13%. Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Profits may have doubled, but there is little to cheer for RBS in the latest official customer satisfaction rankings. The Royal Bank of Scotland brand was the bottom of 16 banks for overall service quality for personal customers in Britain, and 13th out of 14 for satisfaction among small business account holders. Stablemate NatWest, also part of the RBS group, was in the bottom half of both league tables. The rankings are drawn from the views of 16,000 people (1,000 from each bank) and nearly 20,000 small businesses asked how likely they would be to recommend their personal current account provider to friends and family. Fewer than half (47%) of Royal Bank of Scotland personal current account customers said they would recommend the bank. The results are revealed by the Competition and Markets Authority every six months, with the latest published on Friday. The aim is to encourage competition between banks on customer service. Metro Bank topped the league for personal customers and Handelsbanken was ranked the best by small businesses. Which banks do customers love or hate? 'RBS is ready for Brexit' says boss Ross McEwan.

"The teenager accused of murdering six-year-old Alesha MacPhail once told a friend he ""might kill 1 day for the lifetime experience"". A 16-year-old girl said he made the comment in a Facebook Messenger chat after she started a conversation about a crime documentary. The witness told police about the post, from 2017, after the 16-year-old boy was arrested. The boy denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha on 2 July last year. He cannot be named because he is under the age of 18. It is alleged that Alesha was taken from the home her grandparents shared with her father on the Isle of Bute. Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman A post-mortem examination revealed that the child suffered 117 injuries - although the court previously heard some could have been caused by vegetation in the area where she was found. She died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. Another 16-year-old girl told the High Court in Glasgow, the accused sent a selfie-style video to a Snapchat group with the message: ""Found the guy who has done it."" The girl said that post was sent hours after Alesha's body was discovered in a wooded area on the island. The witness said it was posted to about 25 young people who were part of the Snapchat group. The jury heard the silent footage was shot in a bathroom and featured the top half of the accused's body but not his face. The second young witness, who messaged the accused about the crime documentary, also said he privately contacted her just three hours after Alesha was found dead. She said: ""During the conversation he started to get anxious and he said the police were going to blame it on him."" Under cross examination by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, said she accepted the conversation about killing someone was ""fantasy"". The trial went on to hear from another friend, who said the accused was ""feeling suicidal"" hours before Alesha's body was found. He said the accused hosted a party at the home he shared with his parents on 1 July last year which was attended by about 15 people. The 16-year-old witness said the party broke up after midnight but he went back to the accused's house to get his bag. He told prosecutor Iain McSporran QC his friend was lying in his bed and was not in good state of mind. He told the witness he was concerned about his mother's drinking. The teenager added: ""He was telling me he was depressed and he was thinking about harming himself. I felt quite worried for him."" The witness asked the accused if he wanted him to stay the night or if he wanted to stay at his house, which was nearby, but he declined. He said the boy seemed to be better by the time they parted company. The witness, who got home at about 01:30, added: ""He told me he was going to get stoned and go to his bed."" The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared The teenager also told the court the accused was wearing grey jogging trousers and a black Nike zip-up hoodie. The boy was also a member of the Snapchat group that received a video from the accused, hours after Alesha's body was found. His recollection is that the footage featured the accused's voice, as opposed to a text caption. The jury were told the boy was heard saying: ""I have found where the murderer was hiding."" He then pointed to himself in the bathroom mirror. Under cross examination, the boy was questioned further by Mr McConnachie about the accused's demeanour when he returned to the house after leaving the party. The witness said: ""He said he was feeling suicidal."" The teenager and another young witness told the court the accused was physically strong and lifted weights at home and in the gym. The jury also heard evidence that the boy had a ""dark sense of humour"". Two of three men contacted by the accused in a bid to source cannabis gave evidence and confirmed they received messages from him the early hours of 2 July. But, like Alesha's father Robert MacPhail, they confirmed they did not meet the accused in the early hours of that morning to supply him with the drug. The court previously heard that a boy's hooded top was discarded in a skip despite being recovered on a shoreline days after Alesha's body was found. The trial heard that dog walker Zareya MacGillivray contacted police on 6 July last year after spotting the black Nike youth XL garment on the Isle of Bute. It was recovered by Sgt Anthony Hannah, using gloves and an evidence bag. But the jury heard the officer later put it in a skip behind Rothesay Police Station after consulting with a colleague. Sgt Hannah said the discovery came after the arrest of the 16-year-old suspect. He added: ""At that time we had no information that there was anything outstanding from the inquiry."" Alesha had been staying with her father and grandparents on the Isle of Bute Under cross examination by Brian McConnachie QC, for the accused, he denied his actions had been ""reckless"". Sgt Hannah told the court the top was found about half a mile outside the designated parameters set by search advisers for the investigation. It was removed from the skip when the inquiry team was made aware of it. The court also heard about a knife that was found on the shore opposite Alesha's grandparents' house. Coastguard volunteer Peter Morrison, 39, from Rothesay, told the court he was called out to carry out a shoreline search at 06:55. He said that opposite the house where Alesha had been staying, he found ""what looked like a kitchen knife"". Mr Morrison said he did not touch the knife - which he believed had been in the sea and left onshore by the receding tide - but noted its location before continuing to search for Alesha. He later told police who cordoned off the area. The accused teenager has also been charged with attempting to hide evidence. He has claimed it was Toni McLachlan, the partner of Alesha's father, who killed the child. During her evidence to the court on Wednesday, Ms McLachlan insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death, telling jurors: ""I loved her to pieces."" Before the case adjourned for the day, Mr McSporran told the court he expected to conclude the prosecution case by Tuesday. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"Why are black pupils disproportionately identified as having a particular range special needs? Many black pupils in England are having their education dumbed down after being wrongly identified as having one of a range special needs, a study says. The study found black Caribbean pupils were twice as likely to be identified as having social, emotional and mental health needs as white British pupils. The Oxford University team could not explain the ""substantial over-representation"" of this group. It urged schools to check if discipline policies caused a systematic bias. Previous research has looked towards cultural differences, teacher racism and ineffective classroom management as part of the answer. Prof Steve Strandanalysed data,externalon six million children in England's schools between 2005 and 2016. Social, emotional and mental health needs (SEMH) are a type of special educational needs that covers support with mental health problems and challenging behaviour. Challenging behaviour is a big factor in pupil exclusions and shifts to alternative provision. Prof Strand said: ""Black Caribbean children may be suffering an inappropriate and narrowed curriculum, from unwarranted over-identification, particularly [in] secondary schools. ""This might mean they get less academically challenging, more vocationally orientated work perhaps,"" he said, ""like being shifted from maths to motor maintenance, or experience a lowered expectation of what they can do. ""From the factors that we have measured - socio-economic background, poverty and neighbourhood deprivation, and children's development on entry to school - we can't explain why, in particular, black Caribbean children and mixed-black-Caribbean-and-white children are more likely to be diagnosed with SEMH."" There was a strong correlation between SEMH and social-economic background, Prof Strand said, but this could explain only half of the increased likelihood of a black Caribbean child being identified as having SEMH. Some schools banned African-Caribbean hair styles such as cornrows He said it was clear some children had been ""misidentified"" by schools, although it was difficult to know how many. The study did find higher SEMH rates among black Caribbean pupils and mixed-white-and-black-Caribbean pupils in secondary schools serving high deprivation communities, where there were large proportions of them. But what caused this association was unknown, the study said. However, Prof Strand suggested factors such as high levels of crime, violence and gang culture and the negative impact of other disaffected pupils may have an influence. But he also suggested disciplinary policies could be having an unintentional impact on some children. He asked: ""Is it that these young people from this ethnic groups are more confrontational with their teachers because of gang culture or is it a perception of their behaviour? ""It's important for schools to look at their policies and see that there isn't anything that would cause a systematic bias in the way special needs and SEMH is identified.""

"Retail sales bounced back sharply in January, rising by 1% on the previous month, official figures showed. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the amount of goods sold rose by 1%,external, after falling by 0.7% in December, with discounts in clothing helping to boost sales. Compared with a year ago, retail sales were 4.2% higher in January. That was the biggest annual rise since December 2016. The figures beat most economists' expectations. ""Clothing stores saw strong sales, luring consumers with price reductions, with food sales also growing after a slight dip after Christmas,"" said ONS statistician Rhian Murphy. The ONS said clothing prices fell by the most since August 2016. The figures suggest that consumer spending may have picked up again after a lull following the summer's World Cup. Inflation falls to two-year low in January Economic growth slowest since 2012 The findings also echo those from the British Retail Consortium, which indicated that shops saw their fastest sales growth for seven months in January. Other recent data has shown wages picking up after years of stagnation and rising faster than inflation. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""January's jump in retail sales shows that most households have maintained a happy-go-lucky mentality, despite the fraught political situation. While consumers' confidence is down, this reflects rather fuzzy expectations that Brexit might be costly eventually."" But he added that although low confidence would prompt consumers to hold back from buying cars, booking holidays and moving home, he thought the High Street would be protected.

"This Week - hosted by former Sunday Times editor and broadcaster Andrew Neil - began in 2003 The BBC's late-night political show This Week is to end, after presenter Andrew Neil decided to step down. This Week- which airs on BBC One on Thursdays - will not be recommissioned after its current run finishes in July. The programme began in 2003 and has been mostly hosted by Mr Neil. Regular panellists have included Labour's Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo. ""We couldn't imagine This Week without the inimitable Andrew Neil,"" said the BBC's Director of News Fran Unsworth. She called Mr Neil ""one of Britain's best political interviewers"" and said he was ""bowing out of late-night presenting on the show, at the top of his game"". Ms Unsworth added: ""We want to keep Andrew at the heart of the BBC's political coverage. ""He continues to present Politics Live on Thursdays and we look forward to developing future projects with him."" The programme's format sees the panel welcome political and celebrity guests to discuss the biggest news stories of the week. Former Conservative MP and defence secretary Mr Portillo is a regular panellist on the show and appeared alongside Labour's shadow home secretary, Ms Abbott, until 2010. The pair were known for getting on well on-screen and were described as a ""perfect combination"" by Mr Neil. This video can not be played Mr and Mrs quiz with Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo The light-hearted show also welcomes guests from outside the Westminster bubble - with past guests including the Cheeky Girls andNile Rodgers- as well as occasional appearances from Mr Neil's dog, Molly. After it was announced that This Week would be ending, fans of the programme criticised the decision. Journalist and columnist for the Telegraph, Liam Halligan, called it a ""blindingly obvious mistake"", while Sky's political correspondent Kate McCann said it was a ""real shame"". ""BBC This Week is a brilliant show and somehow manages to get people with opposing views to talk normally to each other and tease issues out,""she tweeted.,external""Plus it was such good fun to be on as a guest and has one of the loveliest teams behind the scenes!"" The BBC has not yet announced what will fill the late-night slot, but said it will be announced in due course.

"Police issued a new photo of Abdulah Husseini (left) A ""doppelganger"" of Friends actor David Schwimmer has denied a string of fraud and theft offences. Abdulah Husseini, 36, of Spencer Road, Slough, west London, appeared at Preston Crown Court via video link on Friday. He giggled and put his hand over his mouth when Judge Beverley Lunt asked: ""Is this the Ross from Friends case?"" Joe Allman, prosecuting, replied: ""It is the one with the doppelganger, your honour."" Mr Husseini, from Tehran, pleaded not guilty to the theft of a wallet in Blackpool on 20 September last year. He also denied five fraud offences by allegedly using or attempting to use a stolen Halifax bank card on 17 occasions in shops between 20 September and 5 November last year. An appeal by Lancashire Police went viral, fuelled by David Schwimmer's own take (shown on the left) Social media users first pointed out the likeness of the defendant to Schwimmer's character Ross Geller in the popular US sitcom when police in Blackpool posted an image of a man leaving a restaurant and carrying what appeared to be a carton of beer cans. Schwimmer later responded and posted a video on his Twitter account that showed him scurrying through a convenience store carrying a carton of beer before looking up furtively at a CCTV camera. A trial date for the Blackpool theft and fraud offences was set for 4 July.

"This video can not be played Ross McEwan, boss of RBS Royal Bank of Scotland has reported profits of Â£1.62bn for 2018, more than double the Â£752m it made a year earlier. RBS chief Ross McEwan called the results ""a good performance in the face of economic and political uncertainty"". Mr McEwan said the UK economy faced ""a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations"". He told the BBC that Brexit could have a bigger impact on theeconomy than the Bank of England has suggested,external. Mr McEwan said: ""Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals. ""If this goes on for a long period of time we're going to see the economy slowing down more than the Bank of England suggested. ""We have a very small period of time left until the end of March and it's time that our politicians got to the conclusion so that we can get some certainty going forward."" He said that 2018 saw benign economic conditions continue, with low defaults by customers on their loans. But the bank's statement,externalnoted the potential impact of ""ongoing political uncertainties and geopolitical tensions"" which could affect its customers, and, as a result, defaults were expected to increase this year. Asked how the bank is preparing for a no deal Brexit, Mr McEwan told the BBC: ""For those businesses that are a bit concerned they may have to pre-buy a number of raw materials for their production, we've put aside Â£3bn for what we call a Growth Fund"". RBS said NatWest had lent or approved Â£1.9bn to UK businesses to deal with Brexit (out of a possible Â£3bn). This could be to stockpile, find new suppliers or to secure trade financing. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of Â£45bn and it still owns 62% of the company. In October,RBS paid its first dividend to shareholders since its bailout. In its latest results, the bank announced a final dividend of 3.5p per share, and also a 7.5p special dividend, which means the Treasury is set to receive Â£977m. While the government is still RBS's main shareholder, it also has about 190,000 private investors. The government has been selling off blocks of shares it owns in the bank, and aims to have sold all of its stake by 2024. But it realises a loss every time it does this as it paid 502p a share and they have not yet returned to that level. RBS shares are currently trading at about 240p. Analysis: Rob Young, BBC business correspondent After RBS's near-death experience a decade ago, this looks like a very different bank. It's a lot smaller, having sold off large chunks. It also seems to have largely dealt with the financial consequences of its past bad behaviour. RBS hasn't had to set aside more cash to pay for PPI compensation this year. The boss of RBS, Ross McEwan, says the bank is pretty much fixed. That doesn't mean taxpayers are about to get all of their Â£45bn bailout cheque paid back. Despite the bank's rising profits, we'll probably still own part of it for a few more years yet. And even when we no longer have a stake in RBS, few expect the Treasury to break even. There's also the chance that political events could knock plans to sell off the public stake. The bank is warning of the economic consequences of a no deal Brexit. Mr McEwan says a deal needs to be done by the end of March. If not, he says the economy would take a hit. That could mean a rise in bad loans for the bank. That wouldn't be good for RBS's recovery. RBS has continued with its plan to shrink itself. Its assets, which in banking largely means its outstanding loans, shrank from Â£738.1bn to Â£694.2bn. Before the financial crisis, it was briefly the largest bank in the world by assets. The bank said the switch from physical to digital services was continuing to grow rapidly with 6.4 million customers now regularly using its mobile app, a 16% rise from 2017. But it gave a severe assessment of the risks presented by cyberattacks. It said such attacks were increasing in frequency, sophistication, impact and severity. Competition in the mortgage market meant profit margins remained thin, it said. Its net interest margin - the difference between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans, and a key measure of a bank's ability to make money - shrank to 1.98% from 2.13%. Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Profits may have doubled, but there is little to cheer for RBS in the latest official customer satisfaction rankings. The Royal Bank of Scotland brand was the bottom of 16 banks for overall service quality for personal customers in Britain, and 13th out of 14 for satisfaction among small business account holders. Stablemate NatWest, also part of the RBS group, was in the bottom half of both league tables. The rankings are drawn from the views of 16,000 people (1,000 from each bank) and nearly 20,000 small businesses asked how likely they would be to recommend their personal current account provider to friends and family. Fewer than half (47%) of Royal Bank of Scotland personal current account customers said they would recommend the bank. The results are revealed by the Competition and Markets Authority every six months, with the latest published on Friday. The aim is to encourage competition between banks on customer service. Metro Bank topped the league for personal customers and Handelsbanken was ranked the best by small businesses. Which banks do customers love or hate? 'RBS is ready for Brexit' says boss Ross McEwan.

"Are the UK's school strikes for climate change the moment that British youth finally wakes up to the ""climate emergency""? It may not represent a paradigm shift just yet, but the speed and scale of this young person's movement does make it feel more than a momentary splutter of impotent anger. Ever since the then 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg decided to stop going to school on Fridays last year and instead protest outside the Swedish parliament, there has been a rapid expansion in similar activities in many parts of the world, especially in Europe. UK carbon capture project begins World headed for warmest period on record Blue planet to get even bluer Tens of thousands of schoolchildren in Belgium,Germany and other locations have cut classes and taken to the streets to call on governments to take urgent action on climate change. Now young people in the UK are due to join them, determined to affect change on the issue that they feel is most germane to their future - the impacts of rapidly rising temperatures on an ever more crowded planet. Greta's memorable phrase that we ""cannot solve the crisis without treating it as a crisis"", reflects the thinking of many, frustrated with the slow pace of progress. That sense of crisis has been affected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the impacts of global temperature reaching 1.5C, released last October. This video can not be played 'I'm standing up for our planet' ""We are doing this because we feel that climate action really needs to happen after the IPCC report,"" said Lottie, 17, who says she will join a school protest in London. Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""We've been told we have to take serious action and have just 12 years to cut our carbon emissions in half. As the young people who are going to be most affected by the fact that no-one is taking any action on climate change - this is our entire future. ""We can't vote yet and this is one of the most effective ways of making our voices heard."" Last year also brought a wide range of impacts including heatwaves and forest fires thatscientists say were made worseby climate change. All the while, theemissions that are driving up temperaturescontinue to go up, not down. In the face of this continuing catalogue, the actions taken by governments seem rather limited, much to the frustration of scientists and campaigners. Students contrast the slow pace of tackling climate change with the fact they have managed to get a movement going to organise a UK-wide strike in only four weeks. According to the UK Student Climate Network,there are four key demands.,external They want the government ""to declare a climate emergency"", and inform the public about the seriousness of the situation. Protests in Belgium have made climate change a key issue for all political parties They also want the national curriculum reformed to include ""the ecological crisis as an educational priority"". To fully include young people in decision-making, especially about issues related to climate change, they are calling on the government to lower the age of voting to 16. These goals are being supported by a group of around 200 UK academics, who have written to a national newspaper to say they stand in solidarity with the strikers. ""With the dilution of citizenship education in recent years, this is an important opportunity for schools, colleges and universities to support active citizenship and political engagement,"" said Molly Scott Cato, the Green Party MEP who signed the letter, who is also a professor of green economics, at the University of Roehampton. ""Far from being disengaged, these strikes demonstrate that many young people do care passionately about our planet and the welfare of our neighbours across the world. Our politicians should pay attention and deliver policies that will safeguard future generations."" Young people were far, far more visible at last December's key UN climate meeting in Katowice, Poland. Their energy and demands for speedy action marked a significant change from previous events. Similarly in the US, we are seeing demands from young people for political action on climate change, forcefully represented by Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She is the driving force behind the Green New Deal,a radical climate planthat would see the US decarbonise in only 10 years. Greta Thunberg has taken her climate strike to Davos In Europe the school strikers are also making a powerful impression. ""They have put the climate issue on the public agenda,"" said Conner Rousseau, a spokesperson for the Flemish Socialist party in Belgium. ""They've forced all of the Belgian political parties to take a stand on the climate issue. We have elections in May, it will be one of the main themes."" Observers believe the same thing can happen in the UK. ""If the government is serious about winning over the next generation of voters, then they need to heed their most pressing concerns,"" said Richard Baker, from Christian Aid. ""But more importantly they are sparking a national debate, they are forcing teachers, parents and politicians to re-evaluate the issue of climate breakdown and, what is most important, while lifting our gaze beyond just immediate short-term national concerns.""

"Eight out of 10 knee replacements and six out of 10 hip replacements last as long as 25 years, says a large study from the University of Bristol. This is much longer than believed, the researchers said, and the findings will help patients and surgeons decide when to carry out surgery. To date, there has been little data on the success of new hips and knees. But this Lancet research looked at 25 years' worth of operations,,externalinvolving more than 500,000 people. Hip and knee replacements are two of the most common forms of surgery in the NHS, but doctors often struggle to answer questions from patients on how long the implants will last. Nearly 200,000 of the operations were performed in 2017 in England and Wales, with most carried out on people between 60 and 80 years old. Dr Jonathan Evans, orthopaedic registrar, lead study author and research fellow at Bristol Medical School, said: ""At best, the NHS has only been able to say how long replacements are designed to last, rather than referring to actual evidence from multiple patients' experiences of joint replacement surgery. ""Given the improvement in technology and techniques in the last 25 years, we expect that hip or knee replacements put in today may last even longer."" As the ageing population grows, and life expectancy rises, this becomes even more important, Dr Evans added. Hospitals failed to check on hip patients Patients lose hip replacement court case Wendy had a hip replacement 17 years ago Wendy Fryer, 80, had a hip replacement 17 years ago and it has completely changed her life. ""I was in agony beforehand, It was horrendous,"" she said. ""I used to cycle to work but had to stop. But the very next day after the operation, it was like magic, the pain had gone."" She still plays table tennis and badminton regularly, and also enjoys cycling and walking. ""The worst thing you can do is become a couch potato,"" Wendy says. Hip replacements:89% lasted 15 years, 70% lasted 20 years, 58% lasted 25 years Total knee replacements:93% lasted 15 years, 90% lasted 20 years, 82% lasted 25 years Partial knee replacements:77% lasted 15 years, 72% lasted 20 years, 70% lasted 25 years The researchers, writing in the Lancet, looked at reports from joint replacement registries in six countries which held at least 15 years of data - Australia, Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. They did not look at data from the UK, because its record of patients does not go back far enough, but the research team said their findings mirrored results from smaller studies of UK patients. According to the study, when hip and knee replacements do fail it tends to be because of infection, wear and tear and, more rarely, because they have broken. This means patients require revision surgery which is more likely to fail. John Skinner, from the British Orthopaedic Association and a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, said using more implants with better survival rates would mean fewer repeat surgeries in the future. ""This is great news. Orthopaedic surgeons are working to provide hip replacements that will last, as our population ages and lives longer."" He said it was known that 95% of hip replacements lasted at least 10 years. NHS advice says they last at least 15 years. ""Initially patients had joint replacements at the very end of their arthritic journey, just before they lost the ability to walk and became wheelchair dependent. ""We are now so confident in hip replacement surgery that we can offer it to younger, more active patients, to relieve their pain and keep them active,"" Mr Skinner said.

"The ""Spice-like substance"" was found on samples from the book A Harry Potter book sprayed with drugs was smuggled into one of the UK's most ""challenging"" prisons, where inmates are suspected to have smoked the pages. A copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire found in an HMP Nottingham cell tested positive for a psychoactive substance similar to Spice. The jail is one of 10 on which the Prisons Minister has staked his career. Rory Stewart vowed to resign if improvements failed, but he admitted Nottingham was ""causing concern"". He pledged in August to step down if the number of assaults at the 10 prisons did not come down by this summer. Mr Stewart said ""early indications"" from talking to staff were that violence was coming down with ""real progress"" in six or seven jails and he was now ""pretty confident"" he would keep his job. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands However, the minister admitted ""two or three"" of the 10 jails were proving difficult, with Nottingham and Wormwood Scrubs in west London the ones he was ""most worried about"". Nottingham's governor said conditions were improving but the jail remained ""fundamentally unsafe"",the term used in last year's inspection report. Nottingham Prison is just north of the city centre and holds about 1,060 inmates The ""Spice-like substance"" found on samples from the book was detected by a new drug-testing machine, installed as part of a Â£1.4m investment to refurbish HMP Nottingham and bolster security. It is thought the drugs had been sprayed on to the paper before it entered the prison. Four hundred pages were missing, which staff suspected had been torn into strips and smoked. Prison officer Adam Donegani said each strip was worth about Â£50. ""The prices are inflated within the prison service (compared with) street value, so that can be whatever they want to charge for it,"" he said. Rory Stewart said he would quit as prisons minister if assaults at problem jails did not decrease In January 2018, Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, triggered the ""urgent notification"" procedure at Nottingham after concluding it was ""dangerous, disrespectful and drug-ridden"". ""This prison will not become fit for purpose until it is made safe,"" he wrote. The procedure compelled the Justice Secretary to draw up an action plan to bring about improvements, including reducing the population by 200 to 780. In last year's inspection report, Mr Clarke said HMP Nottingham needed to do ""much more"" to tackle the problem of drugs which was ""inextricably linked to violence"". Prison whistleblower loses employment tribunal Death of inmate at 'dangerous' jail confirmed Prison worker passed drugs to inmates Phil Novis, who took over as governor in July, acknowledged it was taking longer than he would have liked. In his first week a prisoner died, allegedly murdered by another inmate, and since then there have been three self-inflicted deaths. ""The prison is fundamentally still unsafe and that remains a challenge for us,"" Mr Novis said. ""Every day there's an assault on my colleagues and on other prisoners, that's regretful."" He added: ""It is getting safer, but it's coming from such a low threshold that it's going to take time to get to a place where I and everybody can feel safe wherever we go."" A group of experienced prison staff have been brought in to coach and advise officers at Nottingham, where 59% of the workforce have less than two years' service. Prison officer Grace Hanselman, who used to work in a call centre, said the mentoring scheme had given her more confidence to deal with prisoners harming themselves. ""When you come into contact with somebody that is threatening to take their own life or attempting to take their own life that's probably the scariest, most daunting situation I've found myself in,"" she said. ""To have that experience there, to reassure me and the prisoner that we can help... was really beneficial."" The Â£10m scheme announced by Mr Stewart last year to improve security and conditions in jails is likely to be extended to other failing prisons, he has announced. Mr Stewart said: ""There is still much to do, and I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge, but the first six months have given us a solid platform from which we can set a more positive direction for all our prisons.""

"Cheryl disappeared shortly after her family migrated to Australia Australian prosecutors have dropped their case against a man who had been accused of murdering a UK-born toddler almost 50 years ago. The disappearance of three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer from a New South Wales beach in 1970 is one of Australia's longest-running mysteries. A man was arrested in 2017, and he later pleaded not guilty to murder. On Friday, a judge ruled that a key part of the prosecution case could not be used as evidence in a trial. It concerned statements made by the man during a police interview in 1971, when he was aged 17. The Supreme Court of New South Wales found that the evidence could not be heard because the teenager had not had an adult representative present during the interview. Justice Robert Allan Hulme said: ""The Crown accepts that its case cannot succeed without it."" Cheryl went missing from a shower block on 12 January, 1970, in Wollongong, a city 70km (44 miles) south of Sydney, shortly after her family moved to Australia from Bristol. It sparked a massive search at the time, but no trace of the girl was ever found. Police conduct a search days after Cheryl's disappearance On Friday Cheryl's brother, Ricki Nash, said the family was devastated by the latest development and felt let down by police. ""We're just a bit numb, a bit shockedâ¦ no words can describe how I feel at the moment,"" he said outside the court. Over the years, the family had expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the case. Another of her brothers, Stephen Grimmer, said in 2016: ""My mum and dad have passed on now not knowing, and we want to know too before we pass on."" In explaining his decision, Justice Hulme acknowledged that the man had made a written statement and engaged in a ""walk-through style interview"" with police in 1971. Unlike now, minors were not legally required to be accompanied by an adult when giving such statements. Cheryl with her late father, Vince Grimmer However, Justice Hulme ruled that the man's police interview ""should be excluded on the basis of unfairness"". He also noted testimony from psychologists who had reviewed the case for the trial. They found that the man had ""low intellect"" and would have been ""more vulnerable to influence"" at the time, the judge said. The man's trial had been due to begin in May.

"The LIGO Louisiana lab that detected gravitational waves is in line for an upgrade The UK and US governments will spend Â£25m upgrading the machines that made the historic first detection of gravitational waves in 2015. The improved instruments will be able to sense collisions of black holes nearly twice as far away. By 2024, they should be able to observe in unprecedented detail more than three such cataclysmic events every day. Details were announced at theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science meeting,externalin Washington DC. Prof Sheila Rowan, of Glasgow University, who will be among those leading the project, said the upgrade would help us understand more about gravity, black holes and neutron stars. ""We have already learned so much fromthe 10 black-hole and one neutron-star collisions we have already observed,"" she told BBC News. ""We are still at the very start of what [the instrument] can deliver for us across a number of areas of science."" Europe selects grand gravity mission Gravitational waves pioneer dies Italy to hunt for Einstein's waves LIGO's triumph for big science LIGO labs fire lasers through long tunnels, trying to sense ripples in the fabric of space-time Gravitational waves are ripples that are sent across the Universe when the gravity in a certain point in space suddenly changes, caused by the collision of two black holes, for example. The process is similar to the ripples caused by a pebble thrown into a pond, but in the case of gravitational waves, space and everything in it is the pond. Like those water ripples, everything in the path of the waves - the stars, planets, houses, even people - get fractionally taller and slimmer and then shorter and fatter, as the disturbance passes by. But the distortions are tiny - much less than the width of an atom. Einstein predicted the existence of such waves in 1916, but is reported to have said that they were too small to ever be detected. But he was proved both right and wrong 100 years later, when an international team detected them for the first time using a pair of 4km-long L-shaped machines called Advanced LIGO. This video can not be played Pallab Ghosh explains the sound of the gravitational wave and a computer visualisation Extremely well, say the researchers involved. In fact, the machines detected gravitational waves soon after they were turned on. The LIGO team went on to detect nine more black hole collisions and one collision of two dead stars, called neutron stars, in the two years following the initial discovery. This suggested that we live in a violent Universe, where such cataclysmic events are the norm. The L-shaped instruments are essentially made up of two highly accurate rulers at 90 degrees to each other. Each arm has a laser beam that bounces off a mirror at the other end. The time it takes to return is a measure of the length of each arm. When gravitational waves arrive from space, the L-shape is first stretched and then squashed by a tiny amount for a fraction of a second, but it's enough of a change to be detected. Unimaginatively, it will be called Advanced Ligo Plus, but that does mean it can be abbreviated to A+, which the marketing people are sure to like. Much of the ""plussing"" will be carried out by a UK team led by researchers at the Institute for Gravitational Research at Glasgow University, which has the expertise to build the high-precision instruments needed to measure the minuscule distortions gravitational waves create. Researchers there will be increasing the sensitivity in four ways. First, they will have better, shinier mirrors; second, the mirrors will have an improved coating, which reduces the wobbling of molecules on the surface; third, the suspension system on which the mirrors are hung will be made even more stable, and, lastly, light is known to be fuzzy at the quantum level. With the help of a team in Australia, researchers are sharpening the light by squeezing the fuzziness. By being able to detect more black hole collisions, researchers will be able to learn more about them, especially at their edges, where the known laws of physics start to break down. Researchers at Glasgow University are developing special coatings to improve the focus of the mirrors As well as an increase in quantity, scientists will be able to observe collisions in much greater resolution - in ultra-high definition compared with what they can currently detect.  Harder to detect are the collisions of dead stars, called neutron stars. These are fascinating because all the burning gas has collapsed into itself to form a super-dense material. One teaspoon of the material weighs 10 million tonnes. Physicists want to know what this material is like. And it's thought that neutron stars produce gold and platinum and other heavy metals when they collide. So far, the current instruments have detected just one. A+ should be able to detect 13 each month. This video can not be played Five reasons why gravitational waves matter And, perhaps most intriguingly, A+ might be able to resolvea mystery about the speed at which the Universe is expanding. Ground-based telescopes looking at far away supernovas come up with a different answer to the Planck space telescope, which examined the cosmic radiation left over from the Big Bang. A+ will measure the expansionby looking at the behaviour of gravitational waves. It will either find that measurements from the ground telescopes or Planck are flawed in some way, or, hopefully, that something really weird is going on that opens the door to new physics.

"Andrea Levy's The Long Song featured Sir Lenny Henry in the BBC One adaptation British author Andrea Levy, whose award-winning novels captured the black British experience in the years after Windrush, has died at the age of 62. A statement released on behalf of her family said she died of cancer. Levy was born in 1956 to Jamaican parents who had travelled to England on the Empire Windrush in 1948. Sir Lenny Henry, who played a slave in the BBC adaptation of her novel The Long Song, said he had ""loved hanging out with this pugnacious woman"". Levy was best known for Small Island, about two Jamaicans who came to England after World War Two, and The Long Song, her last novel. The 2010 novel was nominated for the Booker Prize and was adapted by BBC One last year. Obituary: Andrea Levy Unlike her other four novels, The Long Song was not set in post-war Britain but reached back to early 19th Century Jamaica during the last years of slavery. Sir Lennywrote in a tribute,external: ""She was funny, had attitude and was immensely smart."" Her publisher Headline said it was ""hugely saddened"" by her death on 14 February, adding that she ""had been ill for some time"". The poet Benjamin Zephaniah said of Levy: ""In the future if anybody wants to have a look at how the Windrush generation arrived here and how we the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation survived and are surviving, they have to refer to Andrea's work ."" Actress and director Kathy Burke said Levy was ""such a great writer,external"" and that The Long Song had been ""the best thing on telly last Christmas"". The Long Song examined the years before and after the end of slavery Levy did not start writing until she was in her mid-30s, after enrolling in a creative writing class at an adult education college in London. In 1994 she published her first novel, Every Light in the House Burninâ², a semi-autobiographical look at a young woman growing up in north London in the 1960s. Before that, little had been written about the lives of Jamaican immigrants and their families. It was not until the release of Small Island in 2004 that her writing really took off, with her fourth novel earning her the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The novel was praised for its compelling, intertwined tales of Jamaicans who moved from their own small island to Britain, and the Britons in whose home they lodged. Writing on Twitter,external, playwright and commentator Bonnie Greer recalled being sent a copy of Small Island to review and recognising it as ""a masterpiece"". Small Island was adapted for a 2009 BBC TV series starring Naomie Harris and Ruth Wilson. A stage version opens at the National Theatre in April. Rufus Norris, the theatre's director, said ""her humour, craft, rigour, openness and clarity of thought"" had been ""a pleasure and a privilege to witness."" Allow Twitter content?

"The floodwaters have spread more than 60km (37 miles) offshore Dirty water from a flood crisis in northern Australia has spread to parts of the Great Barrier Reef, placing it under stress, scientists say. The floods are the result of weeks of devastating rain in Queensland. Aerial pictures show that run-off from one river has blanketed some reef areas more than 60km (37 miles) from shore. Scientists fear the sediment-laden waters may be blocking out light and effectively ""smothering"" coral. Tests are yet to be undertaken. Queensland flood crisis: Two found dead Crocodiles spotted in flooded streets The Great Barrier Reef, located in the Coral Sea off the coast of Queensland, is a diverse World Heritage site that spans an area of 344,400 sq km (133,000 sq mi). In recent weeks, run-off from several rivers has coalesced to affect an approximately 600km stretch of the reef's outer edges, scientists say. The water has not dispersed due to its size and a recent lack of wind. The run-off can contain pesticides which disrupt the balance of the coral reef ecosystem ""Generally a bit of wind and wave action can break the plumes up quite quickly, but we have literally had no wind so they're just sitting there hanging,"" said Dr Frederieke Kroon from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. She told the BBC that the nutrient-rich water had also sparked algae growth in some areas, turning waters ""a thick blanket of green"". Australia unveils reef protection plan ""The biggest concern at the moment is this reduced light - if it persists for much longer, in some cases we can actually see a smothering of the system,"" said Jane Waterhouse, a scientist from James Cook University's TropWATER research unit. However, she said strong winds - if they come - could mitigate the impact. The reef is already facing threats to its survival such as coral bleaching caused by warmer sea temperatures.Mass bleaching events occurred in 2016 and 2017. This video can not be played Warmer water has led to mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef It has also been damaged by cyclones and crown-of thorns starfish.

"This video can not be played Why did May lose another Brexit vote? Prime Minister Theresa May has suffered another Commons defeat after MPs voted down her approach to Brexit talks. MPs voted by 303 to 258 - a majority of 45 - against a motion endorsing the government's negotiating strategy. The defeat has no legal force and Downing Street said it would not change the PM's approach to talks with the EU. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged Mrs May to ""admit her Brexit strategy has failed"" and to come forward with a plan Parliament would support. The defeat came after the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative MPs announced it had taken a ""collective decision"" to abstain, because backing the motion would have amounted to an endorsement of efforts to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Labour unity call amid split rumours Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May has consistently rejected calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but Tory Brexiteer rebels believed the wording of what was meant to be a neutral government motion opened the door to that. The motion reiterated support for the approach to Brexit backed by MPs in votes last month, one of which ruled out a no-deal Brexit. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The voting figures showed it was not just hardline Brexiteers that failed to support the government - a number of Tory Remainers also declined to vote, as more than a fifth of the party in the Commons failed to back the government. Five Conservative MPs - Brexiteers Peter Bone, Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Hollobone, and Anne Marie Morris, and the pro-Remain Sarah Wollaston - even voted with Labour against the motion. Downing Street blamed Mr Corbyn for the defeat, saying he had ""yet again put partisan considerations ahead of the national interest"" by voting against the government's motion. A No 10 spokesman said the PM would continue to seek legally-binding changes to the controversial Irish backstop, as MPs had instructed her to do in a Commons vote on 29 January. ""While we didn't secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage,"" he added. Plasters lose their stick, revealing the hurt underneath. And the fragile patch that was covering the Tory truce has been well and truly torn. Just when Theresa May wanted to show the European Union that she could hold her party together to win, she lost. And at home the prime minister has been shown in no uncertain terms that she simply can't count on the factions in her party to come through for her. Read More Downing Street had earlier warned that defeat could damage the prime minister's negotiating position, as she seeks to make changes to the controversial backstop ""insurance policy"" in her deal to avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker told BBC News the group still supported efforts to get ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the controversial Irish backstop plan, describing Mrs May's defeat as a ""storm in a teacup"". Jeremy Corbyn: 'This can't go on' But business minister Richard Harrington said ERG members should join former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's new Brexit party, telling them: ""In my view you're not Conservatives."" In an interview with The House magazine,external, he urged ministers opposed to a hard Brexit not to ""give in"" to the ERG by resigning. He also said he was ""disappointed"" that Mrs May had not made a statement to the Commons today, and given MPs an outline of a revised deal to vote on. ""We're now told it will be in another two weeks' time so, being very conscious of the damage that not ruling out a hard Brexit is having on business and industry, I'm concerned that it's going to drag on. ""What concerns me most is there is now talk that there won't be a final decision until the next EU Council on 21 March which, as far as business is concerned, is completely unacceptable."" By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler EU leaders still believe this is not the time to budge. They see the UK arguing, debating and negotiating with itself again - as it has done so often during the Brexit process - rather than engaging with Brussels. As a result of all this, the new round of EU-UK negotiations are going nowhere fast. ""Window-dressing"" is how one senior EU figure described the talks to me - with each side simply repeating their red lines to the other. So, the current favourite prediction in Brussels is that things will only be resolved in March. Read Katya's blog Commenting on Mrs May's latest defeat, Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Two weeks ago, the prime minister told Parliament that her new approach could 'secure a substantial and sustainable majority' in Parliament. ""However, tonight's vote has proved that there is no majority for the prime minister's course of action. ""This can't go on. The government can't keep ignoring Parliament or ploughing on towards 29 March without a coherent plan."" He added that the PM needed to admit her strategy had failed ""and come back with a proposal that can truly command majority support in Parliament"". Allow Twitter content?

Pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry said: ""The prime minister has been dealt yet another body blow. This is really serious stuff. ""What is happening is a profound lack of leadership from the very top of government."" She said it was ""chilling"" that ministers were still keeping no-deal on the table when they had seen economic analysis showing that it would be ""absolutely disastrous"" for the country. ""What an absolute fiasco this is,"" she added, blaming a ""lack of leadership in both of our broken parties"". Mrs May has promised MPs a final, decisive vote on her Brexit deal with the EU when she has secured the changes to it that she believes MPs want to see. She believes she can secure a Commons majority for the deal if she can get legally binding changes to the backstop clause - something the EU has consistently ruled out. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A Labour amendment calling for the final, meaningful vote to be held before 27 February was earlier defeated by 16 votes. An SNP amendment, backed by the Liberal Democrats and calling for Britain's departure from the EU on 29 March to be delayed by three months, was defeated by 93 votes to 315 after most Labour MPs abstained. Anna Soubry withdrew an amendment calling on the government to publish the latest cabinet briefing on the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit after ministers agreed to meet her and publish relevant documents. Ms Soubry said she would table it again on 27 February if ministers did not keep to their promise. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay had pledged to call the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier after the vote to discuss the result. The two men are set to resume talks in Brussels early next week.

"This video can not be played Ross McEwan, boss of RBS Royal Bank of Scotland has reported profits of Â£1.62bn for 2018, more than double the Â£752m it made a year earlier. RBS chief Ross McEwan called the results ""a good performance in the face of economic and political uncertainty"". Mr McEwan said the UK economy faced ""a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations"". He told the BBC that Brexit could have a bigger impact on theeconomy than the Bank of England has suggested,external. Mr McEwan said: ""Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals. ""If this goes on for a long period of time we're going to see the economy slowing down more than the Bank of England suggested. ""We have a very small period of time left until the end of March and it's time that our politicians got to the conclusion so that we can get some certainty going forward."" He said that 2018 saw benign economic conditions continue, with low defaults by customers on their loans. But the bank's statement,externalnoted the potential impact of ""ongoing political uncertainties and geopolitical tensions"" which could affect its customers, and, as a result, defaults were expected to increase this year. Asked how the bank is preparing for a no deal Brexit, Mr McEwan told the BBC: ""For those businesses that are a bit concerned they may have to pre-buy a number of raw materials for their production, we've put aside Â£3bn for what we call a Growth Fund"". RBS said NatWest had lent or approved Â£1.9bn to UK businesses to deal with Brexit (out of a possible Â£3bn). This could be to stockpile, find new suppliers or to secure trade financing. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of Â£45bn and it still owns 62% of the company. In October,RBS paid its first dividend to shareholders since its bailout. In its latest results, the bank announced a final dividend of 3.5p per share, and also a 7.5p special dividend, which means the Treasury is set to receive Â£977m. While the government is still RBS's main shareholder, it also has about 190,000 private investors. The government has been selling off blocks of shares it owns in the bank, and aims to have sold all of its stake by 2024. But it realises a loss every time it does this as it paid 502p a share and they have not yet returned to that level. RBS shares are currently trading at about 240p. Analysis: Rob Young, BBC business correspondent After RBS's near-death experience a decade ago, this looks like a very different bank. It's a lot smaller, having sold off large chunks. It also seems to have largely dealt with the financial consequences of its past bad behaviour. RBS hasn't had to set aside more cash to pay for PPI compensation this year. The boss of RBS, Ross McEwan, says the bank is pretty much fixed. That doesn't mean taxpayers are about to get all of their Â£45bn bailout cheque paid back. Despite the bank's rising profits, we'll probably still own part of it for a few more years yet. And even when we no longer have a stake in RBS, few expect the Treasury to break even. There's also the chance that political events could knock plans to sell off the public stake. The bank is warning of the economic consequences of a no deal Brexit. Mr McEwan says a deal needs to be done by the end of March. If not, he says the economy would take a hit. That could mean a rise in bad loans for the bank. That wouldn't be good for RBS's recovery. RBS has continued with its plan to shrink itself. Its assets, which in banking largely means its outstanding loans, shrank from Â£738.1bn to Â£694.2bn. Before the financial crisis, it was briefly the largest bank in the world by assets. The bank said the switch from physical to digital services was continuing to grow rapidly with 6.4 million customers now regularly using its mobile app, a 16% rise from 2017. But it gave a severe assessment of the risks presented by cyberattacks. It said such attacks were increasing in frequency, sophistication, impact and severity. Competition in the mortgage market meant profit margins remained thin, it said. Its net interest margin - the difference between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans, and a key measure of a bank's ability to make money - shrank to 1.98% from 2.13%. Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Profits may have doubled, but there is little to cheer for RBS in the latest official customer satisfaction rankings. The Royal Bank of Scotland brand was the bottom of 16 banks for overall service quality for personal customers in Britain, and 13th out of 14 for satisfaction among small business account holders. Stablemate NatWest, also part of the RBS group, was in the bottom half of both league tables. The rankings are drawn from the views of 16,000 people (1,000 from each bank) and nearly 20,000 small businesses asked how likely they would be to recommend their personal current account provider to friends and family. Fewer than half (47%) of Royal Bank of Scotland personal current account customers said they would recommend the bank. The results are revealed by the Competition and Markets Authority every six months, with the latest published on Friday. The aim is to encourage competition between banks on customer service. Metro Bank topped the league for personal customers and Handelsbanken was ranked the best by small businesses. Which banks do customers love or hate? 'RBS is ready for Brexit' says boss Ross McEwan.

The time it takes to return is a measure of the length of each arm. When gravitational waves arrive from space, the L-shape is first stretched and then squashed by a tiny amount for a fraction of a second, but it's enough of a change to be detected. Unimaginatively, it will be called Advanced Ligo Plus, but that does mean it can be abbreviated to A+, which the marketing people are sure to like. Much of the ""plussing"" will be carried out by a UK team led by researchers at the Institute for Gravitational Research at Glasgow University, which has the expertise to build the high-precision instruments needed to measure the minuscule distortions gravitational waves create. Researchers there will be increasing the sensitivity in four ways. First, they will have better, shinier mirrors; second, the mirrors will have an improved coating, which reduces the wobbling of molecules on the surface; third, the suspension system on which the mirrors are hung will be made even more stable, and, lastly, light is known to be fuzzy at the quantum level. With the help of a team in Australia, researchers are sharpening the light by squeezing the fuzziness. By being able to detect more black hole collisions, researchers will be able to learn more about them, especially at their edges, where the known laws of physics start to break down. Researchers at Glasgow University are developing special coatings to improve the focus of the mirrors As well as an increase in quantity, scientists will be able to observe collisions in much greater resolution - in ultra-high definition compared with what they can currently detect.  Harder to detect are the collisions of dead stars, called neutron stars. These are fascinating because all the burning gas has collapsed into itself to form a super-dense material. One teaspoon of the material weighs 10 million tonnes. Physicists want to know what this material is like.

"A team of researchers who have built an artificially-intelligent writer say they are withholding the technology as it might be used for ""malicious"" purposes. OpenAI, based in San Francisco, is a research institute backed by Silicon Valley luminaries including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. It shared some new research on using machine learning to create a system capable of producing natural language,external, but in doing so the team expressed concern the tool could be used to mass-produce convincing fake news. Which, to put it another way, is of course also an admission that what its system puts out there is unreliable, made-up rubbish. Still, when it works well, the results are impressively realistic in tone - which is why I've shared a sample of it below. OpenAI said its system was able to produce coherent articles, on any subject, requiring only a brief prompt. The AI is ""unsupervised"", meaning it does not have to be retrained to talk about a different topic. It generates text using data scraped from approximately 8m webpages. To ""feed"" the system, the team created a new, automated method of finding ""quality"" content on the internet. Rather than scrape data from the web indiscriminately, which would have provided a lot of messy information, the system only looked at pages posted to link-sharing site Reddit. Their data only included links that had attracted a ""karma"" score of 3 or above, meaning at least three humans had deemed the content valuable, for whatever reason. ""This can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for whether other users found the link interesting, educational or just funny,"" the research paper said. The AI generates the story word-by-word. The resulting text is often coherent, but rarely truthful - all quotes and attributions are fabricated. The sentences are based on information already published online, but the composition of that information is intended to be unique. Sometimes the system spits out passages of text that do not make a lot of sense structurally, or contain laughable inaccuracies. In one demo given to the BBC, the AI wrote that a protest march was organised by a man named ""Paddy Power"" - recognisable to many in the UK as being a chain of betting shops. ""We have observed various failure modes,"" the team observed. ""Such as repetitive text, world modelling failures (eg the model sometimes writes about fires happening under water), and unnatural topic switching."" In calling around for an independent view on OpenAI's work, it became clear that the institute is not altogether popular among many in this field. ""Hyperbolic,"" was how one independent expert described the announcement (and much of the work OpenAI does). ""They have a lot of money, and they produce a lot of parlour tricks,"" said Benjamin Recht, associate professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. Another told me she felt OpenAI's publicity efforts had ""negative implications for academics"", and pointed out that the research paper published alongside OpenAI's announcement had not been peer-reviewed. But Prof Recht did add: ""The idea that AI researchers should think about the consequences of what they are producing is incredibly important."" OpenAI said it wanted its technology to prompt a debate about how such AI should be used and controlled. ""[We] think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems."" Brandie Nonnecke, director of Berkeley's CITRIS Policy Lab, an institution that studies societal impacts of technology, said such misinformation was inevitable. She felt debate should focus more keenly on the platforms - such as Facebook - upon which it might be disseminated. ""It's not a matter of whether nefarious actors will utilise AI to create convincing fake news articles and deepfakes, they will,"" she told the BBC. ""Platforms must recognise their role in mitigating its reach and impact. The era of platforms claiming immunity from liability over the distribution of content is over. Platforms must engage in evaluations of how their systems will be manipulated and build in transparent and accountable mechanisms for identifying and mitigating the spread of maliciously fake content."" Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump directed his federal agencies to develop a strategy to advance artificial intelligence. He is set to sign an executive order to launch the initiative on Monday. The move came amid fears in the US that it is being outpaced by China and other countries when it comes to the technology. So, how good is it? Here's a sample, provided by OpenAI, based on a prompt written by the BBC. The first paragraph, in bold, is the text written by a human.

"The LIGO Louisiana lab that detected gravitational waves is in line for an upgrade The UK and US governments will spend Â£25m upgrading the machines that made the historic first detection of gravitational waves in 2015. The improved instruments will be able to sense collisions of black holes nearly twice as far away. By 2024, they should be able to observe in unprecedented detail more than three such cataclysmic events every day. Details were announced at theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science meeting,externalin Washington DC. Prof Sheila Rowan, of Glasgow University, who will be among those leading the project, said the upgrade would help us understand more about gravity, black holes and neutron stars. ""We have already learned so much fromthe 10 black-hole and one neutron-star collisions we have already observed,"" she told BBC News. ""We are still at the very start of what [the instrument] can deliver for us across a number of areas of science."" Europe selects grand gravity mission Gravitational waves pioneer dies Italy to hunt for Einstein's waves LIGO's triumph for big science LIGO labs fire lasers through long tunnels, trying to sense ripples in the fabric of space-time Gravitational waves are ripples that are sent across the Universe when the gravity in a certain point in space suddenly changes, caused by the collision of two black holes, for example. The process is similar to the ripples caused by a pebble thrown into a pond, but in the case of gravitational waves, space and everything in it is the pond. Like those water ripples, everything in the path of the waves - the stars, planets, houses, even people - get fractionally taller and slimmer and then shorter and fatter, as the disturbance passes by. But the distortions are tiny - much less than the width of an atom. Einstein predicted the existence of such waves in 1916, but is reported to have said that they were too small to ever be detected. But he was proved both right and wrong 100 years later, when an international team detected them for the first time using a pair of 4km-long L-shaped machines called Advanced LIGO. This video can not be played Pallab Ghosh explains the sound of the gravitational wave and a computer visualisation Extremely well, say the researchers involved. In fact, the machines detected gravitational waves soon after they were turned on. The LIGO team went on to detect nine more black hole collisions and one collision of two dead stars, called neutron stars, in the two years following the initial discovery. This suggested that we live in a violent Universe, where such cataclysmic events are the norm. The L-shaped instruments are essentially made up of two highly accurate rulers at 90 degrees to each other. Each arm has a laser beam that bounces off a mirror at the other end.

"Lord Nazir Ahmed denies all the allegations against him A member of the House of Lords has been accused of exploiting his position to pursue sex with vulnerable women who asked him for help, Newsnight reveals. One woman said Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham ""took advantage"" and began a sexual relationship with her after she approached him for assistance. Her case has raised questions about the adequacy of the House of Lords Code of Conduct. Lord Ahmed, 61, denies acting inappropriately. Tahira Zaman, 43, approached Lord Ahmed in February 2017 through a mutual friend, hoping he would help get the police to investigate a Muslim faith healer who she felt was a danger to women. Ms Zaman told BBC Newsnight that Lord Ahmed said he wrote a letter to the Metropolitan Police Commander Cressida Dick about her concerns. She then alleges that he repeatedly asked her for dinner. She says she finally agreed and weeks after the dinner, she contacted him about her case and he invited her to his east London home. ""He was saying I'm beautiful,"" she told Newsnight. The pair went on to have sex on numerous occasions. Tahira Zaman complained about Lord Ahmed's behaviour to the Lords' Commissioner for Standards She accepts the relationship was consensual but said: ""I was looking for help and he took advantage of me. He abused his power."" The relationship ended after two months when Lord Ahmed told her he would not leave his wife, she said. ""I genuinely did believe that he had feelings for me, I'm just so stupidâ¦ and I believed that he was going to help me,"" she said. In her interview with Newsnight, Ms Zaman said she feels exploited by Lord Ahmed because she was suffering from anxiety and depression. In a second case, a woman who wishes to remain anonymous told Newsnight she had also asked Lord Ahmed for help and claims he suggested she should spend the night at his London home. She interpreted this as a proposition for sex, which she refused. Lord Ahmed denies any wrongdoing. In January of last year, Ms Zaman complained about Lord Ahmed's behaviour to the Lords' Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff. ""Lord Ahmed used my trust to repeatedly have intercourse with me,"" she told the commissioner. ""I feel I have been preyed upon due to my vulnerability and used by Lord Ahmed."" But after reviewing her complaint twice, the commissioner said she was unable to investigate. Ms Scott-Moncrieff concluded the code could not have been broken because when Lord Ahmed offered to help her and write to the police, it was not part of his parliamentary work. She wrote to Ms Zaman: ""The behaviour you describe in your email could amount to a breach of personal honour. However, the code only applies in relation to a peer's parliamentary work, and, from your email, it looks as if your initial contact with him was not to do with his parliamentary work."" Newsnight showed the full correspondence between Ms Zaman and the Lords' Commissioner for Standards to Lord Carlile - a barrister and former deputy high court judge. He said the rules should be clarified. ""If someone comes to you for help, particularly if they're vulnerableâ¦and you form a sexual relationship, actually that's disgraceful,"" he said. He added: ""If it is not clear to the commissioner, who is a very experienced lawyer, then I think the rules need to be clarified and in particular the guide to the code of conduct needs to be clarified."" ""She went to Lord Ahmed because she believed he was in a position to do something influential for her"", he added. ""So it's absolutely clear to me that what he was doing was in his role as a member of the House of Lords."" Lord Carlile said a sexual relationship between Lord Ahmed and Ms Zaman could breach two clauses in the code of conduct: one covering conflicts of interest and another which stipulates that Lords must behave on ""their personal honour"". But in a statement to Newsnight, Ms Scott-Moncrieff, said: ""Though credible and substantial, the complaint provided insufficient evidence that contact with the member was in relation to his parliamentary duties... To conclude otherwise, as Lord Carlile has done, is to misunderstand the code."" In a statement, Lord Ahmed told Newsnight: ""I completely deny the allegation that I have exploited my position to pursue an inappropriate relationship with any member of the public (vulnerable or otherwise) or that I have acted inappropriately in the presence of women either in my personal or professional capacity. ""The House of Lords' Commissioner for Standards, Ms Lucy Scott-Moncrieff CBE, assessed the complaint and decided that it did not engage parliamentary inappropriate behaviour about me. She decided to take no further action."" He added: ""I take my duties as a Parliamentarian extremely seriously and would not act so as to undermine my personal or professional reputation.""

"The ""Spice-like substance"" was found on samples from the book A Harry Potter book sprayed with drugs was smuggled into one of the UK's most ""challenging"" prisons, where inmates are suspected to have smoked the pages. A copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire found in an HMP Nottingham cell tested positive for a psychoactive substance similar to Spice. The jail is one of 10 on which the Prisons Minister has staked his career. Rory Stewart vowed to resign if improvements failed, but he admitted Nottingham was ""causing concern"". He pledged in August to step down if the number of assaults at the 10 prisons did not come down by this summer. Mr Stewart said ""early indications"" from talking to staff were that violence was coming down with ""real progress"" in six or seven jails and he was now ""pretty confident"" he would keep his job. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands However, the minister admitted ""two or three"" of the 10 jails were proving difficult, with Nottingham and Wormwood Scrubs in west London the ones he was ""most worried about"". Nottingham's governor said conditions were improving but the jail remained ""fundamentally unsafe"",the term used in last year's inspection report. Nottingham Prison is just north of the city centre and holds about 1,060 inmates The ""Spice-like substance"" found on samples from the book was detected by a new drug-testing machine, installed as part of a Â£1.4m investment to refurbish HMP Nottingham and bolster security. It is thought the drugs had been sprayed on to the paper before it entered the prison. Four hundred pages were missing, which staff suspected had been torn into strips and smoked. Prison officer Adam Donegani said each strip was worth about Â£50. ""The prices are inflated within the prison service (compared with) street value, so that can be whatever they want to charge for it,"" he said. Rory Stewart said he would quit as prisons minister if assaults at problem jails did not decrease In January 2018, Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, triggered the ""urgent notification"" procedure at Nottingham after concluding it was ""dangerous, disrespectful and drug-ridden"". ""This prison will not become fit for purpose until it is made safe,"" he wrote. The procedure compelled the Justice Secretary to draw up an action plan to bring about improvements, including reducing the population by 200 to 780. In last year's inspection report, Mr Clarke said HMP Nottingham needed to do ""much more"" to tackle the problem of drugs which was ""inextricably linked to violence"". Prison whistleblower loses employment tribunal Death of inmate at 'dangerous' jail confirmed Prison worker passed drugs to inmates Phil Novis, who took over as governor in July, acknowledged it was taking longer than he would have liked. In his first week a prisoner died, allegedly murdered by another inmate, and since then there have been three self-inflicted deaths. ""The prison is fundamentally still unsafe and that remains a challenge for us,"" Mr Novis said. ""Every day there's an assault on my colleagues and on other prisoners, that's regretful."" He added: ""It is getting safer, but it's coming from such a low threshold that it's going to take time to get to a place where I and everybody can feel safe wherever we go."" A group of experienced prison staff have been brought in to coach and advise officers at Nottingham, where 59% of the workforce have less than two years' service. Prison officer Grace Hanselman, who used to work in a call centre, said the mentoring scheme had given her more confidence to deal with prisoners harming themselves. ""When you come into contact with somebody that is threatening to take their own life or attempting to take their own life that's probably the scariest, most daunting situation I've found myself in,"" she said. ""To have that experience there, to reassure me and the prisoner that we can help... was really beneficial."" The Â£10m scheme announced by Mr Stewart last year to improve security and conditions in jails is likely to be extended to other failing prisons, he has announced. Mr Stewart said: ""There is still much to do, and I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge, but the first six months have given us a solid platform from which we can set a more positive direction for all our prisons.""

"Cheryl disappeared shortly after her family migrated to Australia Australian prosecutors have dropped their case against a man who had been accused of murdering a UK-born toddler almost 50 years ago. The disappearance of three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer from a New South Wales beach in 1970 is one of Australia's longest-running mysteries. A man was arrested in 2017, and he later pleaded not guilty to murder. On Friday, a judge ruled that a key part of the prosecution case could not be used as evidence in a trial. It concerned statements made by the man during a police interview in 1971, when he was aged 17. The Supreme Court of New South Wales found that the evidence could not be heard because the teenager had not had an adult representative present during the interview. Justice Robert Allan Hulme said: ""The Crown accepts that its case cannot succeed without it."" Cheryl went missing from a shower block on 12 January, 1970, in Wollongong, a city 70km (44 miles) south of Sydney, shortly after her family moved to Australia from Bristol. It sparked a massive search at the time, but no trace of the girl was ever found. Police conduct a search days after Cheryl's disappearance On Friday Cheryl's brother, Ricki Nash, said the family was devastated by the latest development and felt let down by police. ""We're just a bit numb, a bit shockedâ¦ no words can describe how I feel at the moment,"" he said outside the court. Over the years, the family had expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the case. Another of her brothers, Stephen Grimmer, said in 2016: ""My mum and dad have passed on now not knowing, and we want to know too before we pass on."" In explaining his decision, Justice Hulme acknowledged that the man had made a written statement and engaged in a ""walk-through style interview"" with police in 1971. Unlike now, minors were not legally required to be accompanied by an adult when giving such statements. Cheryl with her late father, Vince Grimmer However, Justice Hulme ruled that the man's police interview ""should be excluded on the basis of unfairness"". He also noted testimony from psychologists who had reviewed the case for the trial. They found that the man had ""low intellect"" and would have been ""more vulnerable to influence"" at the time, the judge said. The man's trial had been due to begin in May.

"The floodwaters have spread more than 60km (37 miles) offshore Dirty water from a flood crisis in northern Australia has spread to parts of the Great Barrier Reef, placing it under stress, scientists say. The floods are the result of weeks of devastating rain in Queensland. Aerial pictures show that run-off from one river has blanketed some reef areas more than 60km (37 miles) from shore. Scientists fear the sediment-laden waters may be blocking out light and effectively ""smothering"" coral. Tests are yet to be undertaken. Queensland flood crisis: Two found dead Crocodiles spotted in flooded streets The Great Barrier Reef, located in the Coral Sea off the coast of Queensland, is a diverse World Heritage site that spans an area of 344,400 sq km (133,000 sq mi). In recent weeks, run-off from several rivers has coalesced to affect an approximately 600km stretch of the reef's outer edges, scientists say. The water has not dispersed due to its size and a recent lack of wind. The run-off can contain pesticides which disrupt the balance of the coral reef ecosystem ""Generally a bit of wind and wave action can break the plumes up quite quickly, but we have literally had no wind so they're just sitting there hanging,"" said Dr Frederieke Kroon from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. She told the BBC that the nutrient-rich water had also sparked algae growth in some areas, turning waters ""a thick blanket of green"". Australia unveils reef protection plan ""The biggest concern at the moment is this reduced light - if it persists for much longer, in some cases we can actually see a smothering of the system,"" said Jane Waterhouse, a scientist from James Cook University's TropWATER research unit. However, she said strong winds - if they come - could mitigate the impact. The reef is already facing threats to its survival such as coral bleaching caused by warmer sea temperatures.Mass bleaching events occurred in 2016 and 2017.

"The brain function of very late risers and ""morning larks"" during the hours of the working day is different, according to a study. Researchers scanned the brains of night owls with a bedtime of 02:30 and a wake time of 10:15, along with early risers. The tests - performed between 08:00 and 20:00 - found night owls had less connectivity in brain regions linked to maintaining consciousness. They also had poorer attention, slower reactions and increased sleepiness. Researchers said it suggested that night owls were disadvantaged by the ""constraints"" of the typical working day. They called for more research to understand the health implications of night owls performing on a work or school schedule to which they are not naturally suited. Should we all become early risers? Late risers 'likelier to have early death' The benefits of being a night owl Scientists took 38 people who were either night owls or morning larks (people who went to bed just before 23:00 and woke at 06:30) and investigated their brain function at rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The volunteers then carried out a series of tasks at various times, from 08:00 to 20:00, and were asked to report on their levels of sleepiness. Morning larks were least sleepy and had their fastest reaction time in the early morning tests. They were also found to perform significantly better at this time than night owls. In contrast, night owls were least sleepy and had their fastest reaction time at 20:00, although they did not do significantly better than the larks at this time. The brain connectivity in the regions that predicted better performance and lower sleepiness was significantly higher in larks at all time points, suggesting connectivity in late risers is impaired throughout the whole working day, researchers said. The lead researcher, Dr Elise Facer-Childs, of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Human Brain Health, said the findings ""could be partly driven by the fact that night owls tend to be compromised throughout their lives"". Dr Facer-Childs said: ""Night owls during school have to get up earlier, then they go into work and they have to get up earlier, so they're constantly having to fight against their preferences and their innate rhythms."" For a night owl the typical 9-5 day might diminish productivity, researchers say She said there was a ""critical need"" to better understand how adapting to school and work times to which people are not suited, may be affecting health and productivity. About 40-50% of the population identify as having a preference for later bedtimes and for getting up after 08:20, researchers said. Dr Facer-Childs added: ""A typical day might last from 09:00 to 17:00, but for a night owl this could result in diminished performance during the morning, lower brain connectivity in regions linked to consciousness, and increased daytime sleepiness. ""If, as a society, we could be more flexible about how we manage time, we could go a long way towards maximising productivity and minimising health risks."" Dr Facer-Childs stressed that the differences in brain connectivity are not a type of damage and are probably reversible. There are also some limitations to the study. The tests did not look at brain function later in the day, and it is possible that other factors not picked up on in the study, like lifestyle choices, may have affected the results. Dr Alex Nesbitt, consultant neurologist at King's College London, who was not involved in the research, said the study added to evidence that a person's brain performance is influenced not only by the time of the day but also their body clock. ""It is becoming increasingly clear that these factors are important when 9-to-5 routines are widely imposed on people,"" he added. The authors of the study called for more research to look at whether other brain regions might be affected by being a night owl or morning lark. The research, which also involved the University of Surrey, ispublished in the journal Sleep.,external Should we all become early risers?

"This video can not be played Senator McConnell supports the president; Speaker Pelosi warns it sets a dangerous precedent Democratic and Republican politicians have sharply criticised President Trump's plan to use emergency powers to pay for a border wall with Mexico. Mr Trump is due to declare the emergency shortly in an attempt to bypass Congress, which has refused to approve $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for the wall. Senior Democrats accused the president of a ""gross abuse of power"". Several Republicans also voiced concern. Building a border wall was a key pledge in Mr Trump's election campaign. Declaring a national emergency would give Mr Trump access to billions of dollars for his project. All you need to know about the US border in seven charts Reaction to Trump's decision to declare national emergency Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? The president agreed on Thursday to sign a spending bill that does not include finance for the wall. Disagreement over the issue led to a 35-day government shutdown early this year - the longest in US history. The spending bill is due to be signed shortly to avert another shutdown. Citing unnamed White House officials, US media outlets reported that the president would sign the emergencies act at the same time. The National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it - and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency. The dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential contender and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Maine Susan Collins, who said the move was of ""dubious constitutionality"". The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. ""The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. She said Mr Trump would ""take other executive action - including a national emergency - to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border"". The compromise legislation was approved in an 83-16 vote in the Senate on Thursday. The House of Representatives later also backed the measure, by 300 to 128. The package includes $1.3bn in funding for border security, including physical barriers, but it does not allot money towards Mr Trump's wall. Trump's border wall in seven charts How much of the wall is built already? Speaking on the Senate floor on Thursday, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated his support for the president's national emergency move, saying the president was taking action with ""whatever tools he can legally use to enhance his efforts to secure the border"".Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Allow Twitter content?

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer issued a strongly worded joint statement condemning the move. ""Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall,"" read the statement. ""He couldn't convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he's trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it."" Ms Pelosi had already suggested that Democrats would mount a legal challenge. A month ago, in the midst of the federal government shutdown crisis, a consensus had emerged that the easiest way out for the president was to back down from his demands for congressional border wall appropriations while declaring a ""national emergency"" to commandeer funds from other sources. It took a while, but the path of least resistance is the one Donald Trump is following. He has extricated himself from a predicament of his own making, while taking action that he can cite to supporters as evidence that he's fulfilling his ""build the wall"" campaign promise. Of course, the drawbacks to this course that were apparent in January are still there. Republicans fear this will set a precedent for presidential power that Democrats can someday use to circumvent the will of Congress. The emergency declaration is sure to get bogged down in court challenges, which means it may not have much tangible benefit anytime soon. And, as much as the president may like to spin this as a victory by other means, he still backed down in the face of Democratic resistance in Congress. The shutdown fight was always about more than just the wall - it was a battle over who would set the political agenda for the next two years of the Trump presidency. And if this resolution is any indication, if the president wants to get his way he's largely going to have to find ways around Congress, not through it. The National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis. Mr Trump has claimed that there is a migration crisis at the nation's southern border - a claim strongly refuted by migration experts. The largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire. Declaring a national emergency would give the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process, and he would be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall. Emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. ""It's extremely rare for a president to declare a national emergency in a bid to fund domestic construction projects, particularly one that Congress has explicitly refused to fund,"" Andrew Boyle, an attorney in the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told the Associated Press news agency. The National Emergencies Act explained Mr Trump's decision to apply the powers to overcome a partisan impasse over border security has struck politicians on both sides of the aisle as a deviation from the intended use of the act. ""It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past,"" said the Republican senator Ron Johnson.
