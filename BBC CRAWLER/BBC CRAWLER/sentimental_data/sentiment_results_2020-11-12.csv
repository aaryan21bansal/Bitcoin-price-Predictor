"Boris Johnson's director of communications - and longest serving aide - Lee Cain (right) has resigned following a power struggle in Downing Street After the hurricane of the last 24 hours, what's left behind the storm? Let's face it, there are plenty of people in the Tory Party who have been deeply unhappy about the government's performance in the last few months and who hope, if perhaps don't quite believe, that the shenanigans in Downing Street could be the beginning of a new, calm, world order. And the departure of Lee Cain may even hasten the exit of the prime minister's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. It's been clear for a while in SW1 that he wanted to do less of the day-to-day political fire fighting, trying to focus more on particular projects. But given his closeness to the departing Lee Cain, and it is understood, frustration with what has been going on, it is not impossible that he might end up leaving Boris Johnson's side sooner rather than later. It was suggested to me tonight that he was always due to go in the New Year. No 10 exit much more than a random resignation Top Johnson aide quits amid infighting at No 10 Tensions at No 10 play out over top role One insider said he had let it be known fairly widely that he was interested in stepping back in the next few months. He did not, however, it's understood, threaten to quit last night. There is no official confirmation of that from any of the factions involved in the No 10 implosion. But from the outside it seems, with the UK about to leave the departure lounge of the EU in a matter of weeks, that the group that drove through Brexit, and drove the prime minister's victory is losing its muscle. Mr Cummings' departure would be a huge change to the dynamics in Downing Street, if it happens. He has had unparalleled power, aside from the prime minister. He's provoked rage, but inspired loyalty too, and he broke the cardinal rule of any government adviser by becoming the story so dramatically in May. But while many MPs and ministers would cheer that, hoping for a shift to a more conventional Downing Street, it is far from certain that Mr Johnson would prosper as an individual politician if he lost two of his closest aides in quick succession. The prime minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings was instrumental in the successful pro-Brexit campaign And as ever, the picture is more complicated than it might appear. The divides inside government are simply not as straightforward as Vote Leavers on one side, everyone else on the other. Mr Johnson has been prime minister for well over a year, it's nearly 12 months since the election victory, and the referendum was more than four years ago. Certainly the operation in there sought publicly to emphasise the divide and there has been a natural division between Leavers and Remainers, but in terms of the individuals and personalities working together behind closed doors, the world is less binary than the political universe that Boris Johnson was part of creating. And now, while the Vote Leave tribe made plenty of enemies, and often seemed to enjoy doing so, even deliberately, the prime minister cannot be sure that a new operation will bring him more political success or stability. He is still the same person, the same leader, with the same flaws and and the same strengths. A rejigged team may, or may not make life easier for him. Just as the talks over a trade deal after Brexit grind towards a finale, the dominance of Vote Leave is coming to a close too. But just as the negotiations haven't finished, the final act of the Brexit project is yet to end.

"Soldiers have helped with a city-wide trial in Liverpool, as one of several ways the government has ramped up coronavirus testing A record 33,470 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK government's latest daily figure. It is the highest daily number reported in the UK, although testing capacity has increased greatly since the first wave of the epidemic. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to more than 1.29 million. Government minister Alok Sharma said rising case numbers were ""a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus"". On Wednesday the UK became the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 Covid deaths, based on government figures. On Thursday, a further 563 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, down from Wednesday's figure of 595. Other ways to measure deaths, such as the number of people whose death certificates mention Covid-19, have put the overall toll at more than 60,000. UK coronavirus death toll passes 50,000 Mainland Greece back on UK's quarantine list Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? Thursday'sdaily number of cases,externalshowed a 45.8% increase on Wednesday's figure of 22,950. BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher said the spike in cases could have been driven by changes in people's behaviour in the run-up to England's four-week national lockdown, which began on 5 November but was announced on 31 October. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""The majority of cases reported today were from tests carried out on 9 and 10 November, which includes infections acquired in the days leading up to new measures on 5 November. ""Limiting contact with others will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love,"" she said. Dr Doyle added that the highest rate of infections continues to be seen in the younger generations, but is ""worryingly"" rising quickly in those aged over 80, who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill. In parts of England in the lower tiers of Covid restrictions, pubs remained open until the national lockdown began on 5 November NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis played down the jump in cases, telling a Downing Street press conference it was important to ""not just take one day in isolation"". But he added: ""It is clear that infection rates have been going up. What is really important is to get those infection rates down."" The Department of Health and Social Care said ""daily fluctuations"" can happen in the daily figures ""so it is important to avoid drawing conclusions from one day's figures"". ""We must instead focus on the wider trend which is increasing, particularly in those at highest risk of disease,"" it said, adding it was ""vital"" the public continued to follow the guidance to stop the spread of the virus. Experts have previously warned against describing the daily figure as a record because there was no widespread testing programme during the first wave of the epidemic. Reading too much into one day's data is dangerous. But there is no getting away from the fact the jump in positive cases is worrying. We've not seen this kind of jump before - it is both 10,000 above Wednesday's figure and the current rolling average. It's unclear why this is. The government says there was no backlog of tests that were processed, which could have explained it. The mass testing in Liverpool is not thought to be feeding into the figure yet. The number of tests processed has gone up, but that has happened previously without returning such a high number of positive cases. An increase in socialising last week ahead of lockdown could be a factor. Whatever the cause, the hope is it's a one-off blip. Cases had been pretty stable for a fortnight before this. And there was growing hope next week would see figures falling as the impact of lockdown takes effect. The next few days will be crucial. Despite the UK-wide rise in cases, the average number of new cases every day is no longer rising in Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said recent measures, including the introduction of a new five-tier system of rules for different areas,have slowed the spread of the virus ""very significantly"". However, latest figures showthere are more patients in hospitals in Wales with Covid-19than at any other time - including during the peak of the first wave of the epidemic earlier this year. Meanwhile, tighter Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland - which have been in place since 16 October - will be extended for one more week,the executive has agreed. Mass testing - where a huge proportion of the population is tested for Covid, whether or not people have symptoms - has been touted as a way to allow people to live a more normal life, and even to help avoid future lockdowns. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised a ""massive expansion"" in such testing in the UK. Liverpool has been the first city to trial this, with all residents and workers in the city being offered a test. Mr Johnson has urged all of the city's 500,000 residents to take part, in an attempt to drive the spread of the disease down. Earlier this week some 23,000 people had been tested as part of the trial -which saw Anfield football stadium become one of 18 test centres- with 154 people testing positive.

LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? As the number of daily cases jumped on Thursday, Prof Powis also warned of an increasing number of people needing hospital treatment for Covid-19. He told the Downing Street briefing there were now more than 12,700 people in hospital with coronavirus in England - up from 3,827 a month ago.

"Dominic Cummings arriving at Downing Street on Friday Boris Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings is expected to leave his position by the end of the year. Mr Cummings told the BBC ""rumours of me threatening to resign are invented"", after speculation this week. But he added that his ""position hasn't changed since my January blog"" when he said thathe wanted to make himself ""largely redundant"" by the end of 2020. And a senior Downing Street source said that Mr Cummings would be ""out of government"" by Christmas. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was no question the announcement of his departure was ""accelerated by turmoil in No 10 in recent days"". It comes afterLee Cain - the director of communications and an ally of Mr Cummings - stood downamid reports of internal tensions at Downing Street. The pair are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum - and Mr Cain's departure prompted rumours that his ally would also step down. Meanwhile, former Treasury adviser Sonia Khan, sacked after Mr Cummings accused her of leaking from inside Downing Street, hassettled her unfair dismissal claim with the government. Kuenssberg: Is Cummings' departure a blessing or an error? Is Vote Leave losing its muscle in Downing Street? Speaking to the BBC's political editor, Mr Cummings denied that he had threatened to resign after Mr Cain's departure - and instead pointed out that he had indicated his own plans nearly a year ago. While it's tempting to see this is as a dramatic and sudden eruption, it has been a longer-term burn. The prime minister's chief adviser stepped back somewhat from some of the brutal day-to-day politics he had helped create after the election. He had been spending more time focusing on trying to rewire Whitehall - trying to increase the importance of science and data in government - hoping to be less involved in the moment-by-moment political rush. But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Read more from Laura After Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, he hired Mr Cummings to be his senior adviser, and six months later the pair's strategy of stressing ""Get Brexit Done"" as the main campaign message helped the party win a large majority in the general election. Mr Cummings has become more of a public figure in the past year and was forced into holding his own news conference at Downing Street in the summer, followingcontroversy over him making a trip to the north of Englandwhen non-essential travel was banned at the height of the coronavirus lockdown. Dominic Cummings, 48, ran the pro-Brexit Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum and was behind the group's ""take back control"" slogan Prior to the referendum he worked for Iain Duncan Smith when he was Conservative Party leader and Michael Gove at the Department for Education Born in Durham, Mr Cummings went to a state primary school before being privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history A longstanding Eurosceptic, he cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group and once ran a successful campaign to oppose a regionally elected assembly in north-east England He was portrayed by actor Benedict Cumberbatch in the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War Profile: Dominic Cummings Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he was ""not particularly surprised"" by the announcement, adding that ""advisers come and go over a period of time"". Asked if his departure of Mr Cummings and Mr Cain suggested the prime minister was intending to follow a very different path, Mr Shapps said Mr Johnson had ""always taken advice from a very wide range of people and doesn't always side with the same people at the end of that decision-making process"". Tory MP Theresa Villiers - who was in cabinet until February - said the chief adviser's exit offered ""an opportunity for a fresh start"" and a ""more collegiate"" approach from No 10. She told BBC News: ""There is no doubt that both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers, and on some occasion ministers and secretaries of states as well, and I don't think that was helpful. ""I do think it is important whoever takes over from these two has a different approach."" Writing in his blog in January 2020,externalto encourage ""weirdos"" to work in No 10, Mr Cummings said he wanted to ""improve performance"" in government  in order to ""make me less important - and within a year largely redundant"". Since taking his job at Number 10, he has not been a popular figure with everyone within the governing party, and was known for making disparaging comments about some of Mr Johnson's own MPs, including labelling Brexiteer MPs ""useful idiots"". This video can not be played How powerful is Dominic Cummings? It was widely suggested that former Conservative leader Sir John Major was talking about Mr Cummings when he warned Mr Johnson in a speech in September 2019 not to rely on ""overmighty advisers"". Sir John, who led the country from 1990 to 1997, added: ""I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly.""

"Staff have been trained to analyse Covid tests in care homes as part of a trial Rapid Covid tests in care homes could be a game-changer for vulnerable people and their families, say researchers. Access to fast tests will make it easier for relatives to visit care home residents isolated by the pandemic. A trial suggests tests by staff are as accurate as those done in hospitals, says lead researcher Prof Adam Gordon of Nottingham University. In time, tests could be offered not just to residents and staff but also to relatives and friends, he says. Staff at four care homes in England have been trained to carry out and analyse the tests as part of a trial. Many care homes first shut their doors to visitors eight months ago to try to protect residents from the spread of coronavirus. But with visits still very limited, families argue the restrictions are causing huge distress and confusion, particularly for residents with dementia. Are care homes ready for the second wave? Locked down and lonely: 'Why doesn't anyone want us?' Coronavirus: Care home resident shares feelings of isolation and worry Coronavirus: Care home moves had 'tragic consequences' For care home residents like 96-year-old Janet Dunham, rapid testing for relatives would mean she could see more of her family. She found the weeks when all visiting was stopped very difficult. ""It felt as if you had done something wrong and you'd got to be kept in prison and you knew you hadn't. Not to be able to see your family is dreadful really,"" she says. She lives in Landersmeads care home on the outskirts of Nottingham, which is taking part in the trial. Janet Dunham, 96, teaches her great granddaughter the violin through a screen At the moment, only staff and residents are being tested, but it is hoped that eventually, relatives could be checked before visits. In one of its outbuildings, the home has set up what amounts to a small Covid-19 testing centre and staff have had special training. They take throat and nasal swabs, place them in a solution and then put the sample in a machine that runs the test. It can do eight tests at once and takes 85 minutes to provide results. Next, they will trial a machine that takes just 15 minutes to run a single test. Prof Adam Gordon, who is president-elect of the British Geriatric Society, says care home staff have found the technology relatively easy to use, with a very low error rate. He says the system ""gets it right in 99 cases out of every 100 tests that are done - that's about as good as a diagnostic test could be. And it means that care home staff are delivering this test with the same level of specificity that we see when it's used in hospitals."" They still have to finalise results, but expect to send a report to the government within weeks. Prof Gordon believes rapid testing will make a real difference. ""This test works at least as well in care homes as it does in other settings. And it could be a game-changer for the vulnerable people who live here."" Until then the home has built pods so relatives can visit safely. It means Janet Dunham can once again teach her great granddaughter the violin, but there is still a screen between them and they cannot touch or hug. So far, in England and Wales, nearly 17,000 care home residents have died in the pandemic, the majority during the first wave. At Landersmeads they lost six residents to the virus. Ros Heath runs the home, which is one of relatively few in the country rated outstanding. She says their priority has to be protecting people from Covid, but she also believes it is vital for residents to see the people they love. ""If we could have testing [for relatives] where someone can actually come in and be with somebody, obviously taking necessary precautions, I think it would be a massive step forward,"" she says. ""We support a lot of people with dementia,"" says Ros. ""They can't rationalise why their relatives aren't hereâ¦ So when it became a long-term thing - and we are now into the eighth month of not having open visiting - it had a devastating effect on people's health."" At the moment, all care staff in England have access to weekly testing and residents are tested monthly, but it can take several days for the laboratory results to come back. Rapid tests run by individual homes should make it easier to check people on the day they want to visit, but it is not clear how that would work in practice. Helen Brown's daughter says her mother deteriorated during the lockdown The government says a pilot scheme to test the safety and practicalities of testing visitors will begin on 16 November, involving 30 homes, across four local authority areas where there is a low prevalence of Covid-19. For Clare Brown, whose mother Helen lives in Landersmeads, this needs to happen quickly. Her mother has dementia and Clare believes her ability to understand what is going on deteriorated significantly in the weeks when her family couldn't visit. ""For the people who have been desperate for it for months and months and months, it can't happen quickly enough now. And for my mum, in particular, and people like her, to have access to people who know her and love her best is such an important part of her care. It can't be ignored."" The research is part of the Covid-19 National Diagnostic Research and evaluation programme, or Condor, to look into the use of new technologies in the fight against coronavirus. It is funded by the National Institute for Health Research and backed by the government. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Supporters of both candidates are still out on the streets 10 days after the election US election officials have said the 2020 White House vote was the ""most secure in American history"", rejecting President Donald Trump's fraud claims. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" a committee announced. They spoke out after Mr Trump claimed without proof that 2.7 million votes for him had been ""deleted"". He has yet to concede to the president-elect, Democrat Joe Biden. The result of the 3 November election was projected by all the major US TV networks last weekend. On Friday, the BBC projected Mr Biden to have won Georgia and Mr Trump to have won North Carolina. Mr Biden was earlier projected to have won Arizona. His total is now306 electoral college votes, with Mr Trump at 232. It is the first time Arizona and Georgia have voted Democrat since 1996 and 1992 respectively. After long silence, China congratulates Biden Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? Mr Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. In another development, a group of more than 150 former national security officials has warned that delaying the transition posed ""a serious risk to national security"". In a letter,external, they urged the General Services Administration - the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process - to officially recognise Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris so that they could access ""pressing national security issues"". Meanwhile, China has finally extended its congratulations to Mr Biden and Ms Harris after days of silence. ""We respect the choice of the American people,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said. Russia has said it wants to wait for an ""official result"". The announcement from US election officials marks the most direct rebuttal from federal and state officials of President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Thursday's joint statement was released by the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council,external- which is made up of senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the US Election Assistance Commission as well as state-level officials who oversee elections and representatives of the voting machine industry. ""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result,"" the group said. ""While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,"" it added, without naming Mr Trump directly. ""When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections."" This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy The statement was posted to the website of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The head of Cisa, Christopher Krebs, has reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunks election misinformation. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Election results state by state On Thursday, Mr Krebs shared a post by an election law expert that said: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Cisa assistant director Bryan Ware stepped down on Thursday. The White House had asked for his resignation earlier this week, Reuters reports. Mr Krebs expects to be fired, the news agency adds. Hours before the statement was released, Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence for the stunning claim, which appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News and was flagged by Twitter. The claim was linked to the miscounting of votes in one Republican-leaning Michigan county. Unofficial results initially favoured Mr Biden but were later corrected in President Trump's favour. State election officials acknowledged what had happened, saying human error was to blame, rather than a software malfunction. At the White House, President Trump's advisers discuss his trade policies and act as if he will remain their boss for the next several years and they will still have jobs on the premises. One of the president's economic advisers, Peter Navarro, said on Fox Business this morning that they are operating under the assumption that ""there will be a second Trump term"". When I saw Navarro recently in front of the West Wing, he seemed equally confident about his future in the building. He refused to answer questions, and he insulted journalists, just as he had always done. Then he waved vigorously at me as he slipped into the West Wing, a place where he was among friends. People outside of the White House and in other parts of town say their time is almost over. But for those who are inside the West Wing, it's business as usual. A small but growing number of Republicans are backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, was among those saying Mr Biden should start receiving the secret presidential memo, as is usual with incoming presidents. Lindsey Graham is among those backing giving Joe Biden briefings, but remains a Trump ally Republican Senators Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn and John Thune agreed, although House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Mr Biden was ""not president right now"" and should wait. Between 10 and 20 Republicans in Congress have now either congratulated Mr Biden or accepted there must be moves towards a transition. But most have yet to acknowledge the president-elect's win. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" A chorus of senior Democrats have condemned this: Former President Barack Obama said senior Republicans were undermining democracyby going along with President Trump's claims of fraud House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meanwhile said the ""absurd circus"" meant the coronavirus pandemic was being neglected. Senator Chris Coons told CNN some Republicans had been asking him to congratulate Mr Biden on their behalf because they did not feel able to do so publicly. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Republican politicians were ""deliberately casting doubt on our elections for no other reason but fear of Donald Trump"". Capitol Hill reporters say Republican lawmakers are anxious not to alienate the Trump base, given that the president just won more votes than any incumbent ever, even though he is projected to lose. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Do these Republican voters accept election result? What Trump could do after leaving the White House Party bigwigs are also said to be hoping that Mr Trump will help campaign for two Senate run-off elections in January in Georgia that will decide whether Republicans retain control of the upper chamber. Mr Biden is 5.3 million votes ahead of Mr Trump - about 3.4%, and is well beyond the hurdle of 270 electoral college votes required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Tony Blair: 'US democratic system is resilient' President Trump has kept a low key public profile since the election. Reports suggest he has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to take on the conservative network Fox News, whose full support he now feels to be lacking. According to CBS News,Mr Trump is also openly discussing a possible 2024 campaign,externalto retake the presidency. On Thursday he spoke with Pope Francis, who offered his ""blessings and congratulations"". Mr Biden will be only the second Roman Catholic president of the US. He also spoke with congressional Democratic leadership about the need for a coronavirus stimulus package as the daily US caseload from the disease soared to a new record of more than 150,000.

"Troops loyal to the government ride in trucks to face Tigray People's Liberation Front forces ""Scores and probably hundreds"" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says. Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved. Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week. Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict. There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces. As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. In a statement it said it could confirm that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November"". It had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a ""horrific tragedy"" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access. Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. The UN has said thatvital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopiaare at risk because of the conflict there. In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control. He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of ""cruelty"", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they ""found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied"". The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked. There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains. The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party. Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption. Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run.

"The isolation suits supplied by PestFix were similar to those pictured here Britain's safety watchdog felt leaned on by the government to make factually incorrect statements about PPE suits bought for NHS staff earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, the BBC has found. Emails reveal how the Health and Safety Executive said protective suits, bought by the government in April, had not been tested to the correct standard. But the emails describe ""political"" pressure to approve them for use. The government said all PPE is ""quality assured"" and only sent out if safe. Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks Has the NHS got enough PPE? Early on in the pandemic, the NHS experienced severe shortages of personal protective equipment, known as PPE. As the country woke up to the lethal threat of Covid-19, there was a scramble to secure gloves, overalls and masks for NHS staff. The shortage was so drastic that some hospital staff were even pictured at the time wearing bin bags. Medics at a hospital in the Midlands don bin bags in place of PPE, in April 2020 The government had to find new suppliers quickly to meet demand and to compete with rising global competition. But that rush has prompted questions about its choice of provider. One of those providers was small pest control firm Crisp Websites Ltd, trading as PestFix, whichsecured a contract in April,externalwith the Department of Health and Social Care for a Â£32m batch of isolation suits. Three months after it was signed, the suits from PestFix had still not been released for use in the NHS, despite the rush to get PPE into hospitals. Instead, they were being stored at an NHS supply chain warehouse, in Daventry, waiting for safety assessments. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had concluded they had not been specified to the correct standard for use in hospitals when they were bought. Separately, the contract was being challenged in the courts by campaign group the Good Law Project. It asked why DHSC had agreed to pay 75% upfront when the provider, it claimed, was ""wholly unsuited"" to deliver such a large and important order. The contract had been awarded without being opened to competition because of the urgency of the crisis. Now, emails from the HSE - given to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) - reveal how its officials came under pressure from government over the summer to release the suits to the NHS. In June, one email from a firm working alongside the HSE describes ""political pressure"" being applied to get the suits through the quality assurance process. By September, the legal wrangling was still going on, the emails show, even though the suits had, by then, been released to the NHS. ""We are being drawn into the legalities"", one official wrote, saying they'd been asked to provide a statement that PestFix's products had had the right safety documents. ""I have been contacted by [name redacted] today requesting a statement to the effect that HSE were provided with the required documentation by Pestfixâ¦ This is not factually correct,"" the safety regulator wrote. The following day, another email reveals: ""â¦various colleagues in DHSC are contacting those involved in the assessment of the Pestfix products requesting statements to the effect that HSE assessed the products and they were compliant - not factually correct"". An email, dated 25 June, said Pestfix was worried news its equipment had not completed necessary testing might leak to the public. ""We are very concerned about whom we speak to with regard to getting these suits tested as we do not want it to be made public knowledge that PPE from Pestfix has not passed HSE inspection,"" it read. The firm added that, with the legal challenge looming, it hoped that new tests could be done quickly. This was so that ""we and the DHSC can confirm that the productâ¦ has been certified and accepted"". The isolation suits were ultimately tested to the required standard, and on 6 August the regulator allowed them to be used for staff treating Covid-19 in hospitals. But it insisted the products were relabelled because the description was incorrect. The decision says: ""The product refers to itself as an isolation gown, but it is clearly a disposable coverall"". Last month, the government published five more contracts it had signed with PestFix for gowns, gloves, masks and aprons totalling more than Â£300m. A government spokesperson said: ""We have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect our health and social care staff throughout the pandemic, with more than 4.7 billion items delivered so far and 32 billion items ordered to provide a continuous supply to the frontline over the coming months. ""All PPE products are quality assured and only distributed if they are safe to use."" In a statement, PestFix said it had ""delivered these products to DHSC on time and in compliance with the DHSC's specification and applicable regulations. ""After delivery, there was some delay while the product was re-categorised as a PPE product and further testing was carried out to confirm that the product was PPE compliant.""

"HN-329 his boss, Conrad Dixon, and another officer A former undercover police officer has admitted for the first time that the Metropolitan Police set out half a century ago to infiltrate left-wing political groups, even if they posed no threat to the public. The officer - the first to give evidence at a mammoth public inquiry - said his task had been to gather intelligence on anti-establishment campaign groups threatening the political status quo in the late 1960s. The officer's evidence is the first insider testimony to be put before the Undercover Policing Inquiry that shows that Scotland Yard's Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) targeted groups merely because of their aims, rather than because they threatened violence. During this first day of evidence from a former police officer, Sir John Mitting, the inquiry chairman, threatened to silence a barrister acting for some of those who say they were unjustly spied on. Codenamed HN329, the elderly retired officer was a founding member of the SDS that's accused of serial abuses over decades, including miscarriages of justice, unjustified political operations and tricking women into sexual relationships. The SDS was disbanded in 2008. Six years ago Theresa May, when she was home secretary, ordered an inquiry into its activities. What is the Undercover Policing Inquiry? Undercover Policing Inquiry: We want answers HN329 told the inquiry he joined the SDS in August 1968. It had been set up following an anti-Vietnam War protest in March that year that led to disorder in London. The officer invented a cover name, ""John Graham"", and grew a beard and his hair long. Donning  a jacket with a leopard skin lining and a pair of Hush Puppy shoes, he set out to blend into the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (VSC), a left-wing alliance planning an October protest in London. Police infiltrated left-wing groups during protests Operating under the command of Chief Inspector Conrad Dixon, HN329 said his job had been to gather intelligence on people trying to undermine the status quo and the political establishment. ""Ultimately, any group that came to notice as a result of causing trouble, for example throwing bricks through shop windows and actions of that sort, would have been reported on if they were anti-establishment in a political sense,"" said the officer inhis opening statement,external. He then added: ""It may well be that a particular group is completely harmless but we would be asked to find out what their objectives were. A file would then be opened."" David Barr QC, the barrister leading questioning for the inquiry, asked what the officer meant by ""anti-establishment"". ""Well, it was people who were opposed to the current political situation, or the current government,"" he replied. One crucial meeting of the VSC was infiltrated by a total of nine officers including HN-329 - but the officer said that during all his time with the SDS he uncovered no crimes and saw no violence. Founding officers - 1968 photograph of the Special Demonstration Squad Recollecting his career with the squad, HN329 said: ""The original group, from Conrad Dixon down, were the finest representatives of Special Branch. They were excellent officers who did exactly the proper job."" Rajiv Menon QC, representing some of the victims of alleged undercover abuses, asked to put further matters to the officer, saying the inquiry needed to hear more specific information about his activities and the directions he had been given by superiors. Under the inquiry's rules, lawyers for the participants are required to send suggested topics for questions to the lead barrister, so that he can then examine a witness on behalf of all. Sir John Mitting, the chairman, ruled out all the additional topics proposed by Mr Menon, other than one specific set of questions. When the senior barrister sought to further explain his position, the chairman cut across him and said: ""No, you may not. I'm sorry. ""You may ask  your questions, or you will be silenced.""

"Helga Wauters said she would ""regret this death [her] entire life"" A Belgian anaesthetist has been jailed for three years after a British woman died following a botched emergency Caesarean. Helga Wauters, 51, was also banned from practising following a court hearing in France on Thursday. She was found guilty of manslaughter over the death of 28-year-old Xynthia Hawke in 2014. Wauters pushed a breathing tube into Ms Hawke's oesophagus instead of her windpipe, investigators said. She was under the influence of alcohol during the procedure. Wauters did not appear in court on Thursday. Ms Hawke's partner, meanwhile, travelled to attend the proceedings in the French city of Pau. Ms Hawke was admitted to Orthez hospital near Pau in September 2014. She was given an epidural by Wauters, but problems occurred during the birth which meant an emergency Caesarean was needed. Wauters, a chronic alcoholic, admitted being an alcoholic who started ""every day"" drinking vodka and water. She also said she had a glass of wine before she was called back to the hospital for the Caesarean. Witnesses reported smelling alcohol on her when she returned. When she was taken into custody, the alcohol content in her blood was 2.38 grams per litre, or the equivalent of around 10 glasses of wine. Xynthia Hawke's family attended a court hearing last month The 51-year-old was less than two weeks into the job when she inserted the breathing tube incorrectly. She also allegedly used an oxygen mask instead of a ventilator. Ms Hawke, who is from Somerset in the UK, woke up during the operation and began vomiting and shouting ""it hurts"", witnesses said. One nurse told the court the scene was like a war zone. She suffered a cardiac arrest and died four days after the procedure, but her baby boy survived. But Wauters denied being solely responsible for the death and insisted other staff were to blame. She claimed the ventilator was not working at the time - but investigators found this to be untrue. On Thursday, the court ordered her to pay almost 1.4 million euros (Â£1.25m; $1.65m) in damages to Ms Hawke's family. ""Justice has set an example for this type of doctor who, in my eyes, is not a doctor,"" her partner Yannick Balthazar said. Wauters moved to France after she was fired from her job at a Belgian hospital for being under the influence of alcohol. The recruitment company that hired her did not check her credentials or disciplinary record, investigators said. ""I recognise now that my addiction was incompatible with my job,"" Ms Wauters said during an earlier hearing, according to the AFP news agency. ""I will regret this death my entire life.""

Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said.

Read our full story here Joe Biden has been projected to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to beat Donald Trump in the race to the White House. What happens now? The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern. Read more here With just two weeks until Thanksgiving, the mayor of Chicago has issued a month-long advisory for residents to stay at home, warning that 1,000 more people could die in the city by the end of the year if no action is taken to stop the spread of coronavirus. Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

It added the islands of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos had not seen as significant a growth in cases over recent weeks as the rest of Greece and therefore quarantining was not required. The UAE, Qatar, Turks & Caicos islands, Laos, Iceland, Cambodia, Chile and Bahrain were also seen as ""posing a lower infection risk"", a statement said. Denmark wascut from the UK's safe list last weekafter a mutated strain of Covid-19 was found to have spread to humans from mink.

"Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday, in a compromise reached by the executive. A proposal from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds was supported by the Ulster Unionists and Alliance. Sinn FÃ©in voted against the move and the SDLP abstained. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Hair and beauty salons and driving instructors will reopen, by appointment, next Friday. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on 20 November, but with a closing time of 20:00 GMT. Alcohol cannot be purchased or consumed on such premises. Pubs and bars will be permitted to sell sealed off sales on 20 November. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November, as the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced on 16 October will expire at midnight on 26 November. The currentrestrictions came into effect on 16 Octoberand were due to expire at midnight on Friday, with ministers under pressure to make a decision. The latest paper, brought by the DUP after several days of disagreement, was signed off late on Thursday afternoon. Close contact services including hair salons will reopen, by appointment, on 20 November The document agreed also says that support will be provided for mitigations to reduce risk within the hospitality sector, including improved ventilation and requirements for the recording of customer information for contact tracing purposes. The executive said a vaccination programme will be rolled out from as early as possible in December in line with England, initially targeting priority groups such as health care staff, care homes and those with underlying vulnerabilities. Justice Minister Naomi Long said she wasreconsidering her position in the Northern Ireland Executive over its handling of the Covid restrictions. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance initially supported a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to extend all Covid-19 restrictions for another two weeks, butit was blocked by the DUP,who put it to a cross-community vote. It is a mechanism that can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis, effectively giving parties with enough ministers a veto. The NI Executive is made up of five parties that operate in a mandatory coalition, sharing power between unionist and nationalist parties, and the cross-community Alliance Party - tensions had been flaring between ministers throughout the four days of meetings. A separate proposal put forward by Mr Swann, suggesting a one-week extension, was also blocked on Wednesday. The DUP had been calling for firm dates to be announced for other sectors to reopen, but other parties argued providing concrete dates to businesses during an unpredictable pandemic would be ""unfair"". Talks continued between the parties on Thursday over a hybrid proposal merging the one-week extension with a partial reopening of sectors the DUP had been calling for. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan. She told BBC Newsline that only imposing one more week of restrictions ""potentially means we're coming back to this situation before Christmas"". Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan ""We had strong advice from the chief medical officer and that should have been adhered to."" Economy Minister Diane Dodds said what the DUP had tried to do in their proposal ""is to bring certainty to people in their lives in the run-up to Christmas"". ""We have tried to bring forward a proposal that is balanced, that is proportionate and which the health minister supported, because that is the only way forward for an executive of five parties,"" she said. Mrs Dodds added: ""We cannot have a situation where we simply just open up business, close down business, open up business and we keep that in a perpetual cycle."" She later told BBC One's The View programme that she did not believe the executive had ""covered itself in glory"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds the DUP has tried to 'bring certainty to people' In a tweet, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said a ""fair and balanced agreement"" had been reached with the support of the health minister.

SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon abstained on the vote as she said she feared it could lead to more restrictions just before Christmas. ""People were crying out for a decision,"" she said. ""And I'm being honest, I could support the extension for the one week, I could support additional finances going to businesses, but I couldn't support the partial reopening in the second week, and the best way and most honest way for me to reflect that was by abstaining on the vote."" Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: ""That an agreement that could have been reached over a week ago has finally been achieved this evening is hardly a startling example of good and effective government."" He added: ""The lack of leadership from the Executive Office, the leaking and the briefing, as well as the use of cross-community voting within the Executive on matters that are anything but, further reinforces our belief that the system of government here needs urgent reform."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said it had been ""an embarrassing week of misgovernment"". Chief Executive of Belfast Chamber, Simon Hamilton, described the wrangling at Stormont as an ""embarrassing mess"". Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation told BBC One's The View programme that 35% of hotel rooms in Northern Ireland had been booked this weekend. She said 3,000 phone calls had to be made on Thursday after the Executive made a decision to keep hotels closed for two more weeks. She added: ""What many people forget is we had brides who are getting married this Saturday on the phone this afternoon asking could they get married."" Allow Twitter content?

Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said he hoped the announcement would ""result in thousands of jobs and businesses being saved"".

What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the package of restrictions was ""far from perfect"" - but welcomed that a decision had been taken. ""This decision provides a roadmap for the reopening of our high streets for the Christmas period and increased footfall for local retailers,"" he said. However, Bill Wolsey, who owns the Beannchor Group, said the decision came ""late in they day"" and was ""hugely disappointing"". He said the hospitality industry is now ""in a dire position"", and it was costing his company Â£30,000 a week in wages to stay closed. He said being open at Christmas is ""hugely important"". ""That's not only for my company, but for the whole of our industry - we use that money we make in December to sustain us through January and February, which are very quiet months. That's why we're so concerned about on what basis we'll be allowed to open."" Claire Blackadder, a hairdresser from Newry, told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra the announcement her business could reopen next Friday was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""At least now the ball is rolling in that regard, we just need finance now and we are good to go,"" she added. This week was a hard lesson in how not to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. What we have seen is a slow moving, five-party government trying to deal with a fast-moving situation, and it was quite clear this week that they failed on all fronts, given the level of frustration among the public. Despite the fact that there is now an agreement in place, few people are pleased with what is on the table. The big loser in all of this is the public messaging - while our politicians spent a lot of time and energy trying to convince each other about what was the right thing to do, they lost valuable time trying to convince the public that they need to comply with regulations. Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear that if he feels there needs to be a review in the next fortnight, he will be prepared to bring a recommendation for further restrictions to the executive table, so pubs and restaurants may not be out of the woods just yet. While pubs and restaurants might be circling 27 November on their calendar, they also know that there is a possibility they may not get to that point without further intervention.

""And I'm being honest, I could support the extension for the one week, I could support additional finances going to businesses, but I couldn't support the partial reopening in the second week, and the best way and most honest way for me to reflect that was by abstaining on the vote."" Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: ""That an agreement that could have been reached over a week ago has finally been achieved this evening is hardly a startling example of good and effective government."" He added: ""The lack of leadership from the Executive Office, the leaking and the briefing, as well as the use of cross-community voting within the Executive on matters that are anything but, further reinforces our belief that the system of government here needs urgent reform."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said it had been ""an embarrassing week of misgovernment"". Chief Executive of Belfast Chamber, Simon Hamilton, described the wrangling at Stormont as an ""embarrassing mess"". Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation told BBC One's The View programme that 35% of hotel rooms in Northern Ireland had been booked this weekend. She said 3,000 phone calls had to be made on Thursday after the Executive made a decision to keep hotels closed for two more weeks. She added: ""What many people forget is we had brides who are getting married this Saturday on the phone this afternoon asking could they get married."" Allow Twitter content?

Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said he hoped the announcement would ""result in thousands of jobs and businesses being saved"". ""While pubs and restaurants may be closed, the bills continue to mount on a daily basis therefore extra financial support is needed now to protect businesses and jobs and we hope that the NI Executive will be swift in getting this money into bank accounts."" What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the package of restrictions was ""far from perfect"" - but welcomed that a decision had been taken. ""This decision provides a roadmap for the reopening of our high streets for the Christmas period and increased footfall for local retailers,"" he said. However, Bill Wolsey, who owns the Beannchor Group, said the decision came ""late in they day"" and was ""hugely disappointing"". He said the hospitality industry is now ""in a dire position"", and it was costing his company Â£30,000 a week in wages to stay closed. He said being open at Christmas is ""hugely important"". ""That's not only for my company, but for the whole of our industry - we use that money we make in December to sustain us through January and February, which are very quiet months. That's why we're so concerned about on what basis we'll be allowed to open."" Claire Blackadder, a hairdresser from Newry, told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra the announcement her business could reopen next Friday was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""At least now the ball is rolling in that regard, we just need finance now and we are good to go,"" she added. This week was a hard lesson in how not to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. What we have seen is a slow moving, five-party government trying to deal with a fast-moving situation, and it was quite clear this week that they failed on all fronts, given the level of frustration among the public. Despite the fact that there is now an agreement in place, few people are pleased with what is on the table. The big loser in all of this is the public messaging - while our politicians spent a lot of time and energy trying to convince each other about what was the right thing to do, they lost valuable time trying to convince the public that they need to comply with regulations. Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear that if he feels there needs to be a review in the next fortnight, he will be prepared to bring a recommendation for further restrictions to the executive table, so pubs and restaurants may not be out of the woods just yet. While pubs and restaurants might be circling 27 November on their calendar, they also know that there is a possibility they may not get to that point without further intervention.

"Hospital admissions have stayed fairly steady over the last week although they are generally rising There are more patients in hospitals in Wales with Covid-19 than at any time - including the peak of the pandemic. Latest figures show 1,529 beds are occupied - 20% of all patients in hospital. They include 983 beds occupied with confirmed Covid-19 patients. However, the number of patients in critical care or on ventilators with coronavirus has only reached 40% of the levels at the height of the first wave. About a third of all Covid patients are in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area, wheremore than 530 cases were reported linked to infection outbreaks inside five hospitals. But although lower numbers, the increase in patients is most marked in Betsi Cadwaladr (up 48%), Swansea Bay (up 23%) and Hywel Dda (up by a third) in the last week. The number of Covid patients in hospital (on 10 November) was 1,529 across Wales. This is 14% up overall on the week before There were still more than 6,200 patients in hospital with other conditions - which is three times as many as when surgery and treatments were cancelled during the peak of the first wave Of those - 983 were confirmed Covid-19 patients and there were 251 patients with suspected Covid and 295 who were recovering from the virus An updated status report on Thursday stated there were 1,054 confirmed patients in hospitals. 68 people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus, on 10 November - the highest number since mid-May. Doctors are known to be trying to treat more seriously ill patients without putting them on ventilation. NHS Wales estimated about 12% of admissions were now needing critical care, compared with 30% during the first wave Of these, 19 were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, 15 in Swansea Bay, 12 in Aneurin Bevan, 11 in Cardiff and Vale, nine in Betsi Cadwaladr and two in Hywel Dda Latest figures from NHS Wales Informatics show there were 114 patients in critical care with other conditions, and now occupancy - 182 patients - is beyond the usual capacity for critical care Concerns over patient safety if hospital opens Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Black people 'twice as likely to catch Covid' Covid hotspot ICU staff 'broken' by deaths The seven-day average in total daily admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases stood at 91 a day on 11 November, fewer than the same day a week before although there were 112 admissions on Saturday. NHS Wales said average admissions had ""generally increased"". Meanwhile, separate Public Health Wales figures reported fewer Covid-19 infections linked to outbreaks in hospitals in Wales in the latest week. There was however a rise in infections in Betsi Cadwaladr, Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health boards. These figures show clearly the impact the second wave is having on the NHS and its staff. In terms of sheer numbers of Covid patients, the pressure is right up there with what they were dealing with in the spring. But the difference then was that the NHS had already postponed pretty much all other non-urgent treatment, so that resources could be targeted at Covid care. But the strain is arguably worse this time as it tries to continue to deliver other services in so far as possible. Front-line staff I've talked to at some of the hardest-hit hospitals so far talk of Covid patients in intensive care being ""sicker"" than they were before. They talk of A&E departments struggling not just with Covid, but also with the usual winter pressures that are growing. And they talk of nurses once again having to do ""brutal shifts"" in full PPE. All of this when much of the workforce is still exhausted. The good news is that the number of Covid patients in intensive care is lower than it was at the height of the first wave. This suggests the NHS is having some success in preventing patients from deteriorating to a point where they need to be put on ventilators. But that's not to say intensive care is not under a lot of pressure. Units are already full way beyond what their capacity would be in normal times - dealing also with large numbers of patients seriously ill with other conditions.

Dr Chris Stockport, from Betsi Cadwaladr health board, told a meeting that plans to conduct mass vaccinations were ""well advanced"". Dr Stockport said work had been going on for months to organise how vaccines would be distributed in the UK.

AnÂ Oxford University/AstraZeneca trial of a different vaccine is also said to be close to producing preliminary results. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? According tothe Local Democracy Reporting Service, Dr Stockport said: ""We are formalisingÂ those plans now that a date is starting to become a little clearer and a little closer. ""We will be in a position in north Wales to do whatÂ we need to do in delivering that vaccination when it becomes available.""

"Pubs and other businesses affected by the current restrictions are unsure if they can reopen this weekend The Stormont Executive's deadlock over whether to extend Covid-19 restrictions was described as ""our politics at its worst again"" by a business group. Ministers have now agreed to extend restrictions for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday. A proposal from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds was supported by a majority of parties. Sinn FÃ©in voted against the move and the SDLP abstained. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen next Friday. The hospitality sector and hair and beauty salons have been closed since 16 October after tight restrictions were imposed. Ministers were in heated discussions for days before reaching agreement, with the parties at odds over what to do when the current laws run out at midnight on Friday. The delayed decision drew criticism from business groups. Tina McKenzie, the Northern Ireland chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the ""lack of communication"" from the executive had led to confusion among businesses. ""They are at sea, with some saying they will not be able to open, even if they get the go-ahead,"" she said. ""Very few of them have got any money since four weeks ago - they have been angry and now they are in despair. ""I don't agree that it's one party or a green-and-orange issue - this is our politics at its worst again."" Some businesses had saidthey planned to reopen on Fridayif no agreement was reached at Stormont. Two proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann to extend all of the restrictions for one week, or two weeks,were blocked by the DUPin a cross-community vote on Wednesday. A separate DUP proposal advocating a partial reopening of some sectors from Friday was also voted down by the executive. Another 15 coronavirus-related deaths were reported by Stormont's Department of Health on Thursday, taking its overall death toll to 825. Of the 15 deaths, 11 happened between 10:00 GMT on Wednesday and 10:00 on Thursday. The other deaths happened within the previous three weeks and have now been added to the overall total. Another 548 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive for the virus in the past day. Earlier on Thursday, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party would ""look very carefully"" at any new proposals. ""We recognise time is of the essence here - we do want to get a decision made,"" he said. ""We will do everything we can do get that arrangement. ""I'm not going to accept there will be a negative outcome - when the will is there, there is a way."" Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate Wait for clarity as Stormont tempers flare Hospitality return is 'act of vandalism', says doctor Speaking to RTÃ, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ""anything other than that is going against the public health advice"". ""The executive needs to make a decision today and that decision needs to be communicated to the public today,"" added the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president. ""It needs to be for two weeks - that's the clear, straightforward advice from the health team and that is where my support will lie."" On Sunday, Ms O'Neill had suggesteda partial and graduated reopening of some sectors was being considered by ministers. Two days later, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party supported Mr Swann's proposal of a two-week extension of all restrictions, which was blocked by the DUP. Mr Swann had warned his ministerial colleagues that doing nothing ""needs to be avoided"" at all costs and that some mitigations to curb the spread of coronavirus must be retained. A former DUP politician also criticised the executive, describing the delayed decision as ""shameful"". Jimmy Spratt, who has been receiving treatment for cancer, accused politicians of ""dithering"" on Thursday afternoon. ""If anyone is trying to run the clock down to midnight, the public will judge everyone in the executive at the next election,"" he told Talkback. He said ministers should remember Wednesday's news of three members of one family whodied within two weeks of each other with Covid-19. ""They should go to that family and ask them how they feel,"" he said. NI Covid restrictions extended for one more week Q&A: How does the Executive work? Can NI 'learn to live' with Covid-19?

"This video can not be played MP Tracey Crouch says she is âdisappointingly unable to participateâ in a Commons debate on breast cancer. MPs have called for wider virtual participation to be allowed in Parliament, arguing that those with cancer were ""excluded"" from taking part in a debate on the illness. Ex-minister Tracey Crouch, who has cancer, expressed disappointment she could not speak in the debate. Labour's Chris Bryant said this was due to Jacob Rees-Mogg's reluctance to allow greater use of video links. But the Commons leader said it was down to a lack of broadcasting equipment. Mr Rees-Mogg has previously argued that virtual working was not an effective way to hold the government to account and was no substitute for the ""cut and thrust"" of live debate. Currently, MPs who cannot be in Westminster due to coronavirus are only able to take part in some events. They can put questions to ministers by video link, but are not able to contribute to general debates on legislation or events in Westminster Hall - a separate chamber from the House of Commons. Westminster Hall debates were suspended from 20 March during the first wave of coronavirus. They only resumedfrom 5 October,external, around a month after business returned in the main chamber following the summer recess. Those trying to avoid travel during the pandemic are also able to register for proxy votes. On Thursday, a debate on breast cancer services took place in Westminster Hall, and Conservative MP Ms Crouch said because of Mr Rees-Mogg's ruling, those ""with real and current life experience of the disease are disappointingly unable to participate"". MP 'overwhelmed' by cancer message reaction Labour and unions urge return to hybrid Parliament She added: ""While I respect his commitment to traditional parliamentary procedures, I'm sure if he was on the backbenches and not the fine specimen of health and fitness he clearly is, he would be arguing forcefully for members to be able to contribute more often in proceedings by modern technology."" The MP asked him to ""please stop thinking those of us at home are shirking our duties"" and urged him to allow virtual participation in Westminster Hall. Leader of the House Mr Rees-Mogg said when events in Westminster Hall restarted, ""the broadcasting facilities were already being fully utilised"". ""So it wasn't an issue then of whether we wanted to do it or not, it simply wasn't an option,"" he said. However, he also added there needed to be a balance between the needs of MPs with the needs of the House of Commons ""to proceed with its business"". Mr Bryant said it was ""appalling that Tracey Crouch is excluded from a debate on breast cancer because she's recuperating from cancer by Jacob Rees-Mogg rules"". His party colleague Barbara Keeley agreed and said she was also ""excluded"" having just been through breast cancer treatment. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour - recorded before Thursday's debate - Ms Crouch said she would not have been able to participate in debates at all before the pandemic as the video technology was not set up. ""So actually, in a way, and I don't mean this to sound insensitive, this is a good time to have gone through this,"" she added. However, she told the programme that wider use of video technology, beyond the debates where it is currently used, would make for a ""better"" system and called for MPs to be allowed to carry on contributing virtually ""while coronavirus exists"". Ms Crouch added that she would also like to see the proxy voting scheme extended to cover MPs suffering from other health conditions or on bereavement leave.

"The Planning Inspectorate said the decision was made following ""careful consideration"" A plan to dig a Â£1.7bn road tunnel near Stonehenge has been approved by the Transport Secretary. The A303, a popular route for motorists travelling to and from the south west, runs within a few hundred metres of the world heritage site. The decision to build a two-mile (3.2km) tunnel out of sight of the monument goes against the recommendations of planning officials. Campaigners said it was a ""complete violation"" and ""international scandal"". The Planning Inspectorate had recommended Transport Secretary Grant Shapps withhold consent, warning it would cause ""permanent, irreversible harm"" to the World Heritage site. But the Department for Transport wrote to Highways England stating: ""The Secretary of State is satisfied that, on balance, the need case for the development together with the other benefits identified outweigh any harm."" Sarah Richards, the Planning Inspectorate's chief executive, said there had been a ""great deal of public interest in this project"". She said: ""A major priority for us over the course of the examination was to ensure that communities who might be affected by this proposal had the opportunity to put forward their views. ""As always, the examining authority gave careful consideration to these before reaching its conclusion."" Some environmentalists and archaeologists have voiced their opposition to the plan due to its potential impact on the area Some environmentalists and archaeologists had voiced their opposition to the plan due to its potential impact on the area. Tom Holland, from the Stonehenge Alliance, said the scheme was ""a Â£2 billion white elephant"" and called the decision ""shocking and shameful"". ""The decision to inject a great gash of tarmac and concrete into Britain's most precious prehistoric landscape is one that ranks simultaneously as spendthrift and sacrilegious,"" he said. ""This has huge implications not just for Britain, but for the entire world. What's to stop people at Giza (site of the pyramids), or in Rwanda getting rid of gorillas because they're in the way of mining developments?."" Cas Smith, a druid and anti-tunnel campaigner, said it was a ""complete violation"". ""You wouldn't dream of pushing a bore tunnel next door to Salisbury Cathedral, so why Stonehenge,"" she said. Prof David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, described the news as ""gut-wrenching"". ""The tunnel is going to clearly compromise the archaeology,"" he said. ""Stonehenge is precious for the whole of humanity, for our understanding of how we have adapted and evolved as a species since the Ice Age. ""It's an international scandal."" Highways England said the cost range for the whole scheme is between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.4bn but it is ""currently working to Â£1.7bn"" In June, it emerged that a team ofarchaeologists had discovered a ring of at least 20 large shaftswithin the ancient religious monument, a short distance from the stones. But Highways England said the finds were ""well outside the scheme boundary"" and no closer than 500 metres from the planned road upgrade. Chief executive Jim O'Sullivan welcomed the decision and said: ""The A303 Stonehenge tunnel project is part of the biggest investment in our road network for a generation. ""This transformational scheme will return the Stonehenge landscape towards its original setting and will improve journey times for everyone who travels to and from the South West."" Anna Eavis, from English Heritage which looks after Stonehenge, said the scheme would ""restore the ancient landscape"" around the monument. ""At the moment the A303 is a great blight which cuts through the world heritage site,"" she said. ""The project will transform this great blight so people will be able to walk freely and experience those monuments without the assault on the senses."" There is now a six-week period in which the decision can be challenged in the High Court. Preparatory work is due to begin in spring next year, with the five-year construction phase expected to start by 2023. Highways England said the cost range for the whole scheme was between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.4bn but it was ""currently working to Â£1.7bn"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in March that funding was in place for the project. Public-private funding was due to be used to finance the work, but in October 2018 then-Chancellor Philip Hammond cancelled future deals using that model.

However, he also added there needed to be a balance between the needs of MPs with the needs of the House of Commons ""to proceed with its business"". Mr Bryant said it was ""appalling that Tracey Crouch is excluded from a debate on breast cancer because she's recuperating from cancer by Jacob Rees-Mogg rules"". His party colleague Barbara Keeley agreed and said she was also ""excluded"" having just been through breast cancer treatment. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour - recorded before Thursday's debate - Ms Crouch said she would not have been able to participate in debates at all before the pandemic as the video technology was not set up. ""So actually, in a way, and I don't mean this to sound insensitive, this is a good time to have gone through this,"" she added. However, she told the programme that wider use of video technology, beyond the debates where it is currently used, would make for a ""better"" system and called for MPs to be allowed to carry on contributing virtually ""while coronavirus exists"". Ms Crouch added that she would also like to see the proxy voting scheme extended to cover MPs suffering from other health conditions or on bereavement leave.

"The isolation suits supplied by PestFix were similar to those pictured here Britain's safety watchdog felt leaned on by the government to make factually incorrect statements about PPE suits bought for NHS staff earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, the BBC has found. Emails reveal how the Health and Safety Executive said protective suits, bought by the government in April, had not been tested to the correct standard. But the emails describe ""political"" pressure to approve them for use. The government said all PPE is ""quality assured"" and only sent out if safe. Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks Has the NHS got enough PPE? Early on in the pandemic, the NHS experienced severe shortages of personal protective equipment, known as PPE. As the country woke up to the lethal threat of Covid-19, there was a scramble to secure gloves, overalls and masks for NHS staff. The shortage was so drastic that some hospital staff were even pictured at the time wearing bin bags. Medics at a hospital in the Midlands don bin bags in place of PPE, in April 2020 The government had to find new suppliers quickly to meet demand and to compete with rising global competition. But that rush has prompted questions about its choice of provider. One of those providers was small pest control firm Crisp Websites Ltd, trading as PestFix, whichsecured a contract in April,externalwith the Department of Health and Social Care for a Â£32m batch of isolation suits. Three months after it was signed, the suits from PestFix had still not been released for use in the NHS, despite the rush to get PPE into hospitals. Instead, they were being stored at an NHS supply chain warehouse, in Daventry, waiting for safety assessments. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had concluded they had not been specified to the correct standard for use in hospitals when they were bought. Separately, the contract was being challenged in the courts by campaign group the Good Law Project. It asked why DHSC had agreed to pay 75% upfront when the provider, it claimed, was ""wholly unsuited"" to deliver such a large and important order. The contract had been awarded without being opened to competition because of the urgency of the crisis. Now, emails from the HSE - given to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) - reveal how its officials came under pressure from government over the summer to release the suits to the NHS. In June, one email from a firm working alongside the HSE describes ""political pressure"" being applied to get the suits through the quality assurance process. By September, the legal wrangling was still going on, the emails show, even though the suits had, by then, been released to the NHS. ""We are being drawn into the legalities"", one official wrote, saying they'd been asked to provide a statement that PestFix's products had had the right safety documents. ""I have been contacted by [name redacted] today requesting a statement to the effect that HSE were provided with the required documentation by Pestfixâ¦ This is not factually correct,"" the safety regulator wrote. The following day, another email reveals: ""â¦various colleagues in DHSC are contacting those involved in the assessment of the Pestfix products requesting statements to the effect that HSE assessed the products and they were compliant - not factually correct"". An email, dated 25 June, said Pestfix was worried news its equipment had not completed necessary testing might leak to the public. ""We are very concerned about whom we speak to with regard to getting these suits tested as we do not want it to be made public knowledge that PPE from Pestfix has not passed HSE inspection,"" it read. The firm added that, with the legal challenge looming, it hoped that new tests could be done quickly. This was so that ""we and the DHSC can confirm that the productâ¦ has been certified and accepted"". The isolation suits were ultimately tested to the required standard, and on 6 August the regulator allowed them to be used for staff treating Covid-19 in hospitals. But it insisted the products were relabelled because the description was incorrect. The decision says: ""The product refers to itself as an isolation gown, but it is clearly a disposable coverall"". Last month, the government published five more contracts it had signed with PestFix for gowns, gloves, masks and aprons totalling more than Â£300m. A government spokesperson said: ""We have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect our health and social care staff throughout the pandemic, with more than 4.7 billion items delivered so far and 32 billion items ordered to provide a continuous supply to the frontline over the coming months. ""All PPE products are quality assured and only distributed if they are safe to use."" In a statement, PestFix said it had ""delivered these products to DHSC on time and in compliance with the DHSC's specification and applicable regulations. ""After delivery, there was some delay while the product was re-categorised as a PPE product and further testing was carried out to confirm that the product was PPE compliant.""

"Helga Wauters said she would ""regret this death [her] entire life"" A Belgian anaesthetist has been jailed for three years after a British woman died following a botched emergency Caesarean. Helga Wauters, 51, was also banned from practising following a court hearing in France on Thursday. She was found guilty of manslaughter over the death of 28-year-old Xynthia Hawke in 2014. Wauters pushed a breathing tube into Ms Hawke's oesophagus instead of her windpipe, investigators said. She was under the influence of alcohol during the procedure. Wauters did not appear in court on Thursday. Ms Hawke's partner, meanwhile, travelled to attend the proceedings in the French city of Pau. Ms Hawke was admitted to Orthez hospital near Pau in September 2014. She was given an epidural by Wauters, but problems occurred during the birth which meant an emergency Caesarean was needed. Wauters, a chronic alcoholic, admitted being an alcoholic who started ""every day"" drinking vodka and water. She also said she had a glass of wine before she was called back to the hospital for the Caesarean. Witnesses reported smelling alcohol on her when she returned. When she was taken into custody, the alcohol content in her blood was 2.38 grams per litre, or the equivalent of around 10 glasses of wine. Xynthia Hawke's family attended a court hearing last month The 51-year-old was less than two weeks into the job when she inserted the breathing tube incorrectly. She also allegedly used an oxygen mask instead of a ventilator. Ms Hawke, who is from Somerset in the UK, woke up during the operation and began vomiting and shouting ""it hurts"", witnesses said. One nurse told the court the scene was like a war zone. She suffered a cardiac arrest and died four days after the procedure, but her baby boy survived. But Wauters denied being solely responsible for the death and insisted other staff were to blame. She claimed the ventilator was not working at the time - but investigators found this to be untrue. On Thursday, the court ordered her to pay almost 1.4 million euros (Â£1.25m; $1.65m) in damages to Ms Hawke's family. ""Justice has set an example for this type of doctor who, in my eyes, is not a doctor,"" her partner Yannick Balthazar said. Wauters moved to France after she was fired from her job at a Belgian hospital for being under the influence of alcohol. The recruitment company that hired her did not check her credentials or disciplinary record, investigators said. ""I recognise now that my addiction was incompatible with my job,"" Ms Wauters said during an earlier hearing, according to the AFP news agency. ""I will regret this death my entire life.""

"The Planning Inspectorate said the decision was made following ""careful consideration"" A plan to dig a Â£1.7bn road tunnel near Stonehenge has been approved by the Transport Secretary. The A303, a popular route for motorists travelling to and from the south west, runs within a few hundred metres of the world heritage site. The decision to build a two-mile (3.2km) tunnel out of sight of the monument goes against the recommendations of planning officials. Campaigners said it was a ""complete violation"" and ""international scandal"". The Planning Inspectorate had recommended Transport Secretary Grant Shapps withhold consent, warning it would cause ""permanent, irreversible harm"" to the World Heritage site. But the Department for Transport wrote to Highways England stating: ""The Secretary of State is satisfied that, on balance, the need case for the development together with the other benefits identified outweigh any harm."" Sarah Richards, the Planning Inspectorate's chief executive, said there had been a ""great deal of public interest in this project"". She said: ""A major priority for us over the course of the examination was to ensure that communities who might be affected by this proposal had the opportunity to put forward their views. ""As always, the examining authority gave careful consideration to these before reaching its conclusion."" Some environmentalists and archaeologists have voiced their opposition to the plan due to its potential impact on the area Some environmentalists and archaeologists had voiced their opposition to the plan due to its potential impact on the area. Tom Holland, from the Stonehenge Alliance, said the scheme was ""a Â£2 billion white elephant"" and called the decision ""shocking and shameful"". ""The decision to inject a great gash of tarmac and concrete into Britain's most precious prehistoric landscape is one that ranks simultaneously as spendthrift and sacrilegious,"" he said. ""This has huge implications not just for Britain, but for the entire world. What's to stop people at Giza (site of the pyramids), or in Rwanda getting rid of gorillas because they're in the way of mining developments?."" Cas Smith, a druid and anti-tunnel campaigner, said it was a ""complete violation"". ""You wouldn't dream of pushing a bore tunnel next door to Salisbury Cathedral, so why Stonehenge,"" she said. Prof David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, described the news as ""gut-wrenching"". ""The tunnel is going to clearly compromise the archaeology,"" he said. ""Stonehenge is precious for the whole of humanity, for our understanding of how we have adapted and evolved as a species since the Ice Age. ""It's an international scandal."" Highways England said the cost range for the whole scheme is between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.4bn but it is ""currently working to Â£1.7bn"" In June, it emerged that a team ofarchaeologists had discovered a ring of at least 20 large shaftswithin the ancient religious monument, a short distance from the stones. But Highways England said the finds were ""well outside the scheme boundary"" and no closer than 500 metres from the planned road upgrade. Chief executive Jim O'Sullivan welcomed the decision and said: ""The A303 Stonehenge tunnel project is part of the biggest investment in our road network for a generation. ""This transformational scheme will return the Stonehenge landscape towards its original setting and will improve journey times for everyone who travels to and from the South West."" Anna Eavis, from English Heritage which looks after Stonehenge, said the scheme would ""restore the ancient landscape"" around the monument. ""At the moment the A303 is a great blight which cuts through the world heritage site,"" she said. ""The project will transform this great blight so people will be able to walk freely and experience those monuments without the assault on the senses."" There is now a six-week period in which the decision can be challenged in the High Court. Preparatory work is due to begin in spring next year, with the five-year construction phase expected to start by 2023. Highways England said the cost range for the whole scheme was between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.4bn but it was ""currently working to Â£1.7bn"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in March that funding was in place for the project. Public-private funding was due to be used to finance the work, but in October 2018 then-Chancellor Philip Hammond cancelled future deals using that model.

"The factory in Urumqi produces about 20,000 cars a year, a fraction of that from other VW plants in China Volkswagen has defended its decision to continue operating a car plant in Xinjiang, a Chinese region mired in allegations of large-scale human rights abuses by the state. Evidence that hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities are being detained in camps, or used as forced labour in factories,has led some multinational companies to cut ties,externalwith the region, despite China's insistence that the claims are untrue. Volkswagen's critics argue that it has a particular moral obligation,externalnot to be involved in such practices because of its history. The company wasfounded by the ruling German Nazi Party in 1937 and used forced labour,external- including concentration camp prisoners - in its factories during WWII. Adolf Hitler inspects a VW model car when the Nazis ruled Germany But in an interview with the BBC in Beijing, the company's CEO in China, Stephan Wollenstein, defended Volkswagen's presence in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, where it runs a factory with 600 workers, producing up to 20,000 vehicles a year. ""What happened in the Nazi times was something that happened in our factories where we had forced labour, people producing Volkswagen cars,"" he said. This video can not be played VW boss Stephan Wollenstein: ""We have no forced labour"" ""This certainly is an unacceptable situation. Therefore, we are making sure that none of our production sites have forced labour, and this is something that we specifically checked in Urumqi and I can assure you, we do not have forced labour."" But when asked whether he could be absolutely certain of that claim and give an assurance that none of the Urumqi workforce - of which around 25% is made up of Uighurs and other minorities - had been in a camp, Dr Wollenstein said he couldn't. ""We try to control our company-related processes, including the HR process, which, for instance, means the hiring of people in the best possible manner,"" he said. ""And this reduces for us the risk that something happens which we do not like and which is not complying to our standards. But I guess we could never reach 100% certainty."" Up to a million Muslims are thought to have been detained in prison camps across Xinjiang For critics, that defence falls short. Viola von Cramon-Taubadel is a Green Party member of the European Parliament and formerly a member of the German Federal Parliament from Lower Saxony - the state where Volkswagen's headquarters is based. ""Why can't they be certain? They should make sure that there is no linkage between any labour camp and that company,"" she told the BBC. Even if VW could prove categorically that their own supply chain was clean, the criticism goes far deeper. Because opening a car plant in Xinjiang requires the partnership and approval of the Chinese authorities, the concern is that it risks lending tacit support to the policies of mass incarceration and ethnic repression, for which there is now compelling evidence. China's hidden camps: The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang Xinjiang schools separate children from families Satellite data, the testimony of witnesses andChina's own government records,externalmake clearthe scale of the camp building,externaland thecoercion behind the factory labour,external. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" WhileChina insists it has been providing de-extremification trainingfor Xinjiang's traditionally Muslim minorities, and running large-scale job creation schemes, the real aim appears to be the forced assimilation of identities and cultures now viewed by the state as inherently disloyal. Withinternational governments and rights-groups raising their voices,externalin condemnation, andsome major brands distancing themselves,external, Volkswagen finds itself out of step on Xinjiang. ""Even the placing of a factory there gives, of course, the Communist Party a higher legitimacy,"" Ms von Cramon-Taubadel said. ""Volkswagen knows this - they have done it exactly for this, to get a comparative advantage. It was a political issue from the very beginning - economically it is useless, it doesn't make sense at all."" Volkswagen denies that its decision to open its Xinjiang plant in 2013 was for political rather than economic reasons, insisting that the company saw good, long-term opportunities for market growth in China's far-west. With the number of cars being produced currently less than 10% of capacity of some of the company's 32 other plants in China, Dr Wollenstein said they would ""love to do more."" ""But the market is still not as big as it could be with regard to our product offerings."" There are other things that appear to distinguish VW's Xinjiang operation from its factories elsewhere in China. Shortly after production began,a Chinese report suggested that the plant had an agreement with a neighbouring unit of a paramilitary police unit,external. Data leak reveals how China 'brainwashes' Uighurs in prison camps 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps The company would donate vehicles and in exchange, the People's Armed Police - an organisation with a frontline role in Xinjiang's heavy securitisation - would provide VW employees with both ""military training"" and ""patriotic education"", phrases often associated with the wider camp programme. Dr Wollenstein told the BBC that only two cars were provided to the unit - on behalf of Volkswagen's Chinese partner in the Xinjiang plant, Saic Motor Corporation Ltd - and he was not aware of any such training taking place at the factory. VW makes 20% of all new cars in China - a vital market for the company But when pressed as to whether it could have taken place off-site, he admitted, ""we probably would not know"". ""I would say everything that is happening outside the fences of all of our production sites all over China and what is happening in the spare time of our employees is out of our control."" For Volkswagen's critics, its real problem may be one of too much success. Its dominance ofthe China market, where it sells one-fifth of all new cars,external, risks making it a hostage to it. There have been demonstrations around the world against China's actions in Xinjiang Ms von Cramon-Taubadel says that in recent meetings she's held with senior company executives, they've admitted as much. ""They told me that the condition for any expansion of the company within China is that at least one of the factories should be based in the west,"" she said. ""And they tried to convince me that if VW decides unilaterally to close [its Xinjiang plant] they could not produce a single car in China any more."" In public, at least, Volkswagen insists its dominance of the Chinese market puts it in a position of strength. ""We've been engaged in this country for 37 years,"" Dr Wollenstein said. ""And as much as we are to a certain extent dependent on China, probably China is also dependent on us. ""We firmly believe in a global perspective and that free trade and doing business according to our ethical standards is helping every country where we're engaged.""

"The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths, according to the latest government figures. A total of 50,365 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 595 in the past 24 hours. The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures showed, despite hopes for a vaccine, ""we are not out of the woods"". He said: ""Every death is a tragedy,"" but added: ""I do think we have got now to a different phase in the way that we treat it."" How the UK reached 50,000 virus deaths How many cases are there in your area? How does the UK compare to the rest of the world? A further 22,950 cases of coronavirus were recorded on Wednesday,government figures show,external. There have been some 1.2 million confirmed cases in the UK since the epidemic began, and more than 185,000 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus. The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over 65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more from Nick here. The government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus -  but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 60,000 deaths by 23 October, by this measure. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest death figures were a ""grim milestone"" and criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the pandemic during the first wave. He said the government owed it to the families of those who have lost their lives to the virus ""to get on top"" of its response to the second wave. The British Medical Association (BMA) said lessons had to be learned. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: ""This is a point that should never have been reached."" He added: ""Today's figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public."" The government had to ""ensure that nothing on this scale ever happens again"", he added, with a public inquiry to ""go over every step with a fine-tooth comb"". It comes as officials said no decision has yet been made onhow people under the age of 50 should be offered a Covid vaccine. The current priority list of people who would get a vaccine in ""phase one"" starts with those living and working in care homes, then - in stages - everyone over 60 years old. But the list is subject to change, with close attention being paid to how the vaccines work in older age groups, who often have a weak response to immunisation. Attention has turned to how a vaccine will be rolled out after Pfizer and BioNTech revealedtheir vaccine protects more than 90% of peoplefrom developing Covid symptoms. The prime minister urged everybody to get a coronavirus vaccine once one becomes available, adding that the arguments of anti-vaccination activists were ""total nonsense"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Mr Johnson would be happy to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Number 10 has said. On a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in south-east London on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the prospect of a vaccine and the ramping up of testing were ""two big boxing gloves"" to ""pummel"" the virus with, but said: ""Neither of them is capable of delivering a knock-out blow on its own. ""That's why this country needs to continue to work hard to keep discipline and to observe the measures we've put in."" Please enable JavaScript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive   Here are only some of those who have died. To see all of them would take more than {{x}} hours. Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in recent weeks. In England,a new four-week lockdown started last Thursday- replacing the three-tier system until 2 December. Mr Johnson said England must ""get through this current period of tough autumn measures"" to ""hopefully"" curb the spread of the virus enough to allow Christmas to be ""as normal as possible for as many people as possible"". Meanwhile, pubs reopened and travel restrictions were lifted in Wales on Monday,as it ended a two-week ""firebreak"" lockdown. Additional restrictions in Northern Ireland are due to end on Friday aftera proposal from the Northern Ireland Assembly's health minister to extend restrictions was blocked. In Scotland,there is now a five-tier system of virus alert levelswith different measures in place in different parts of the country. The tiers are numbered from zero to four, with level four requiring the introduction of lockdown restrictions for that area. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

"The factory in Urumqi produces about 20,000 cars a year, a fraction of that from other VW plants in China Volkswagen has defended its decision to continue operating a car plant in Xinjiang, a Chinese region mired in allegations of large-scale human rights abuses by the state. Evidence that hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities are being detained in camps, or used as forced labour in factories,has led some multinational companies to cut ties,externalwith the region, despite China's insistence that the claims are untrue. Volkswagen's critics argue that it has a particular moral obligation,externalnot to be involved in such practices because of its history. The company wasfounded by the ruling German Nazi Party in 1937 and used forced labour,external- including concentration camp prisoners - in its factories during WWII. Adolf Hitler inspects a VW model car when the Nazis ruled Germany But in an interview with the BBC in Beijing, the company's CEO in China, Stephan Wollenstein, defended Volkswagen's presence in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, where it runs a factory with 600 workers, producing up to 20,000 vehicles a year. ""What happened in the Nazi times was something that happened in our factories where we had forced labour, people producing Volkswagen cars,"" he said. This video can not be played VW boss Stephan Wollenstein: ""We have no forced labour"" ""This certainly is an unacceptable situation. Therefore, we are making sure that none of our production sites have forced labour, and this is something that we specifically checked in Urumqi and I can assure you, we do not have forced labour."" But when asked whether he could be absolutely certain of that claim and give an assurance that none of the Urumqi workforce - of which around 25% is made up of Uighurs and other minorities - had been in a camp, Dr Wollenstein said he couldn't. ""We try to control our company-related processes, including the HR process, which, for instance, means the hiring of people in the best possible manner,"" he said. ""And this reduces for us the risk that something happens which we do not like and which is not complying to our standards. But I guess we could never reach 100% certainty."" Up to a million Muslims are thought to have been detained in prison camps across Xinjiang For critics, that defence falls short. Viola von Cramon-Taubadel is a Green Party member of the European Parliament and formerly a member of the German Federal Parliament from Lower Saxony - the state where Volkswagen's headquarters is based. ""Why can't they be certain? They should make sure that there is no linkage between any labour camp and that company,"" she told the BBC. Even if VW could prove categorically that their own supply chain was clean, the criticism goes far deeper. Because opening a car plant in Xinjiang requires the partnership and approval of the Chinese authorities, the concern is that it risks lending tacit support to the policies of mass incarceration and ethnic repression, for which there is now compelling evidence. China's hidden camps: The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang Xinjiang schools separate children from families Satellite data, the testimony of witnesses andChina's own government records,externalmake clearthe scale of the camp building,externaland thecoercion behind the factory labour,external. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" WhileChina insists it has been providing de-extremification trainingfor Xinjiang's traditionally Muslim minorities, and running large-scale job creation schemes, the real aim appears to be the forced assimilation of identities and cultures now viewed by the state as inherently disloyal. Withinternational governments and rights-groups raising their voices,externalin condemnation, andsome major brands distancing themselves,external, Volkswagen finds itself out of step on Xinjiang. ""Even the placing of a factory there gives, of course, the Communist Party a higher legitimacy,"" Ms von Cramon-Taubadel said. ""Volkswagen knows this - they have done it exactly for this, to get a comparative advantage. It was a political issue from the very beginning - economically it is useless, it doesn't make sense at all."" Volkswagen denies that its decision to open its Xinjiang plant in 2013 was for political rather than economic reasons, insisting that the company saw good, long-term opportunities for market growth in China's far-west. With the number of cars being produced currently less than 10% of capacity of some of the company's 32 other plants in China, Dr Wollenstein said they would ""love to do more."" ""But the market is still not as big as it could be with regard to our product offerings."" There are other things that appear to distinguish VW's Xinjiang operation from its factories elsewhere in China. Shortly after production began,a Chinese report suggested that the plant had an agreement with a neighbouring unit of a paramilitary police unit,external. Data leak reveals how China 'brainwashes' Uighurs in prison camps 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps The company would donate vehicles and in exchange, the People's Armed Police - an organisation with a frontline role in Xinjiang's heavy securitisation - would provide VW employees with both ""military training"" and ""patriotic education"", phrases often associated with the wider camp programme. Dr Wollenstein told the BBC that only two cars were provided to the unit - on behalf of Volkswagen's Chinese partner in the Xinjiang plant, Saic Motor Corporation Ltd - and he was not aware of any such training taking place at the factory. VW makes 20% of all new cars in China - a vital market for the company But when pressed as to whether it could have taken place off-site, he admitted, ""we probably would not know"". ""I would say everything that is happening outside the fences of all of our production sites all over China and what is happening in the spare time of our employees is out of our control."" For Volkswagen's critics, its real problem may be one of too much success. Its dominance ofthe China market, where it sells one-fifth of all new cars,external, risks making it a hostage to it. There have been demonstrations around the world against China's actions in Xinjiang Ms von Cramon-Taubadel says that in recent meetings she's held with senior company executives, they've admitted as much. ""They told me that the condition for any expansion of the company within China is that at least one of the factories should be based in the west,"" she said. ""And they tried to convince me that if VW decides unilaterally to close [its Xinjiang plant] they could not produce a single car in China any more."" In public, at least, Volkswagen insists its dominance of the Chinese market puts it in a position of strength. ""We've been engaged in this country for 37 years,"" Dr Wollenstein said. ""And as much as we are to a certain extent dependent on China, probably China is also dependent on us. ""We firmly believe in a global perspective and that free trade and doing business according to our ethical standards is helping every country where we're engaged.""

"The students hung up a banner reading: ""Put students and staff before profits."" Students are ""occupying"" a University of Manchester building in a protest against ""extremely high"" rents and a claimed lack of support during the coronavirus pandemic. They accuse the university of ""putting profits before students"" and have asked for rents to be reduced by 40%. Izzy Smitheman, 18, said they had enough food to stay there for a week but could get more. The university said it was ""already engaging"" with student unions. Ms Smitheman, who is studying English Literature and French, said she was protesting at the Owens Park Tower in Fallowfield because the university had ""put us on unsafe campuses, paying extremely high rent"" and she felt there had been a lack of support. ""They brought us here for profit rather than our safety,"" she said, adding: ""We've tried protesting and withholding our rent but the university won't respond to our demands with support."" The students say they are following social distancing guidelines Last week, students living at the University of Manchester's Fallowfield halls of residencetore down ""prison-like"" fencing erected around their campuson day one of England's national lockdown. Ms Smitheman said the university had tried ""fearmongering and threatening"" students who have not paid their rent as part of theUoM Rent Strike,externalaction group. ""This is the same university that fenced us in and told us when we were isolating to put on a mask and get to the shops,"" she said. The 18-year-old added: ""I thought the university would be on our side and try help us but it feels like it is us against them. They're here to take our money and that's all they care about."" ""This is a fight now."" Another protester Ben McGowan said: ""There have been so many mistakes made by the university. ""The state of the accommodation has been ridiculous with regular flooding in the rooms."" He said he wanted a refund on rent paid for December asnew government guidelinesmeant he had to leave the accommodation, but the university had ""refused to engage"" and he had been ""threatened with fines"". Barnaby Peter, a first year student who is also a rent striker, said he had been told his contract would be terminated if he continued to withhold rent. ""We are being charged for things like use of common room facilities which are actually shut, among other things. ""We are also not being provided adequate mental health support."" Security has already removed the protesters' banner A University of Manchester spokesperson said a ""handful of students"" were protesting in an empty residential building and they had been told ""they shouldn't be there"" and they could be breaking Covid-19 public health regulations. The university statement added: ""We are already engaging with elected Students' Union representatives about many of the issues being highlighted by the protestors."" Ms Smitheman said: ""We are forming a household. We are aware of Covid and are wearing masks and socially distancing. ""We're not doing it for ourselves but for every other student on campus."" Greater Manchester Police said officers would support the university ""wherever necessary"" to deal with those involved. ""We condemn any breaches of Covid legislation and the risk it poses to those present, the emergency services and the wider public,"" a spokesperson said.

An investigation is now under way into what caused the crash. Read our full story here Twitter says that approximately 300,000 ""disputed and potentially misleading"" tweets had additional context added to them in the two-week period around the election, according to a report it released today. That represents some 0.2% of all election-related tweets sent during their study. Around 450 tweets were subjected to further censoring, with warning labels applied and restrictions about how they could be shared. The report,externalfocused on tweets sent from 27 October to 11 November. As you're probably aware, dozens of Trump tweets (including those claiming he had won re-election) were flagged under the Twitter rules that were temporarily put in place for the election. Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said. The analysis comes as Twitter begins to roll back some of their election-time restrictions. Donald Trump has issued an order banning American investments in Chinese firms the government determines have ties to the Chinese military. Inthe order,,externalTrump accused China of ""increasingly exploiting"" US investors ""to finance the development and modernisation of its military"". The ban is to go into effect in January. It could affect some of China's biggest publicly-listed firms, including China Telecom and tech firm Hikvision. Throughout his administration, Trump has made efforts to disentangle the US from its close economic ties with China.

The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern. Read more here With just two weeks until Thanksgiving, the mayor of Chicago has issued a month-long advisory for residents to stay at home, warning that 1,000 more people could die in the city by the end of the year if no action is taken to stop the spread of coronavirus. Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

"The number of people waiting over a year for hospital treatment in England has hit its highest levels since 2008. Patients are meant to be seen within 18 weeks - but nearly 140,000 of the 4.35 million on the waiting list at the end of September had waited over a year. The number waiting 12 months or more has increased sharply this year - the figure in February was just 1,600. Surgeons said it was ""tragic"" patients were being left in pain while they waited for treatment. And others warned the situation could become even worse during winter with the NHS seeing rising numbers of Covid patients. In recent weeks, major hospitals in Bradford, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Liverpool, which have seen high rates of infection, have announced the mass cancellation of non-urgent work. Donna Doyle, 52, was referred for surgery at the end of 2019. She has rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and needed reconstructive surgery on the front half of her right foot. But her pre-op appointment was cancelled in the spring because of pandemic. And now she has been told she will have to wait until February at the earliest. ""The pain isn't something that affects me every now and then, it's a problem every single day,"" she says. ""Imagine two pebbles grinding against the bone in your feet. It's constant. ""It causes a lot of problems in my life, physically and mentally. I psyched myself up for having the surgery, so the day I was told nothing would be happening, I was so upset. ""I work from home at moment. And some days, my husband comes home and I'm crying, feeling really down. ""I'm fed up with seeing Matt Hancock say ""the NHS is open for business"" because it's not true. I'm being overlooked."" Prof John Appleby, director of research at health think tank the Nuffield Trust, said the situation was a ""real concern"". Hospitals were facing a real battle to keep non-Covid services going, he said, pointing out the number of Covid patients in hospital had risen from just over 2,000 to more than 10,000 since the end of September. ""It is clear that over the summer months, NHS staff have put in tremendous amounts of work to boost activity across the board,"" he said. ""However, the service has fallen short of the tall order of recovering all non-Covid activity between the two waves of this pandemic."" Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen said these patients had paid a ""heavy price"". ""It is tragic to see so many lives put on hold,2 he said. ""Each statistic represents someone waiting patiently, potentially in pain, for the treatment they need to get on with living an independent life. ""Older people and poorer people are particularly hard hit by these delays."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis, said the situation was ""appalling"". ""We're currently seeing some hospitals entirely pausing elective surgery because of the pressures of the second phase of the pandemic,"" she said. ""The consequences of these further delays will reverberate for years to come."" Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the NHS was doing its best but was facing a really challenging winter. ""We are keenly aware of the inconvenience, anxiety and distress for patients caused by any delays for diagnostic tests, treatment or consultations,"" he added. Alongside routine care, significant numbers have missed out on treatment for cancer. The numbers receiving urgent check-ups have dropped by a quarter during the pandemic, with 300,000 fewer people seeing a cancer specialist from April to September than during the same period last year. The numbers starting cancer treatment are also down by a fifth. Anoushka Kurkjian Mother-of-three Anoushka Kurkjian, 41, found a cyst on her breast in June. She sought medical advice and was told it was benign but remained concerned because she was in pain. As a last resort - three months later - she went to her local accident-and-emergency unit and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had been afraid to go because of worries over catching the coronavirus. The cancer has now spread to her lymph nodes. ""If it had been a year ago, I would have gone in earlier,"" Anoushka says. ""I am now undergoing chemotherapy and have lost my hair. ""I feel very angry that I was not diagnosed earlier. ""I wish I could say to women, 'Seek treatment. ""'Don't be deterred.' ""Yes, Covid is a factor. ""But there's a lot more going on out there."" But NHS bosses said cancer services had returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity by the end of September. An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""The NHS message to the public has always been clear - do not delay, help us to help you by coming forward for care.""

"Carrie Gracie (centre), pictured in 2018, received back pay and an apology from the broadcaster that year Former BBC journalist Carrie Gracie has said a report that found no unlawful pay discrimination against women at the BBC ""feels like a whitewash"". The Equalities and Human Rights Commission's investigation came after presenters like Gracie and Samira Ahmed were revealed to have been underpaid. The watchdog said the BBC didn't break the law but must ""increase transparency and rebuild trust"" with women. The BBC Women group said,externalit was ""deeply disappointed by the findings"". The commission defended its ""robust investigations"", but a statement from BBC Women, which represents female employees, said the findings ""do not reflect our experiences"". The report ""does not address the systemic issue of unequal pay suggested by the hundreds of pay increases and settlements the BBC has made to women"", the group added. Graciewon back pay and an apology in 2018after resigning as BBC China editor following the discovery that she was paid less than male colleagues. Allow Twitter content?

She took issue with the way the commission started by looking at 1,000 complaints from female BBC employees, whittled them down to 40, before focusing on 10. ""Seriously?"" She wrote on Twitter. ""FOLLOW THE Â£Â£ INSTEAD: #BBC forced to pay out to 100s of #bbcwomen. Moral of story: don't rely on regulator but stay strong, calm, united + JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL."" More than 500 women have been awarded rises since 2017 after making pay complaints. Gracie left the BBC in August after 33 years at the corporation. Meanwhile, earlier this yearan employment tribunal foundthat Newswatch presenter Ahmed had been paid one sixth of the amount Jeremy Vine received for doing similar work on Points of View. AndSarah Montague received a Â£400,000 settlementafter being paid less than former Radio 4 co-presenters like John Humphrys and Nick Robinson. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which launched its investigation in March 2019, said the BBC accepted that ""its historical practices were not fit for purpose and has made significant changes since 2015"". BBC director general Tim Davie pledged to implement the report's recommendations, saying: ""We have to work even harder to be best in class."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed (right) won an equal pay case against the BBC in January EHRC interim chair Caroline Waters said it was ""easy to see why trust between some women at the BBC and the organisation has broken down"". She said: ""Many women felt their voices were not being heard and have been left feeling confused as to how decisions about their pay have been made. ""This took a heavy emotional toll on those involved in the process and the strength of feeling of women at the BBC should not be understated. ""While we have not found any unlawful acts in our investigation, repairing the damage caused by these issues requires continued leadership and we hope the BBC board takes forward our recommendations."" How to know if you're getting equal pay Asked why the EHRC found no unlawful pay discrimination despite the high-profile cases, Suzanne Baxter, who led the investigation, explained: ""Our work here has been carried out under the equality act, and has a different remit to an employment tribunal. ""I do understand why there might be some surprise. Our investigation is broader, we're gathering every piece of evidence we can, which isn't always available to a tribunal. ""We think we've done robust investigations. The important thing here is the recommendations we make."" EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath added that ""we're looking at overarching systems, whereas employment tribunals look at a specific case"". She said they did find ""real concerns about the overall processes which led to concerns about trust and transparency"", and acknowledged that ""this is about real lives [of the women] at the centre of this investigation"". She added: ""We talked to them, they had gone though humiliation, anxiety, insomnia, were signed off work. One woman waited 370 days, another woman was passed between eight people in 10 months. These are real people having a terrible time."" Ms Baxter said she was ""very confident our recommendations will make a difference to women going forward"". The recommendations include better record keeping and a more transparent grievance process that it is done within a ""reasonable time limit"". The BBC has also been told to continue improving training and guidance for BBC staff making decisions about pay, and reviewing pay frameworks regularly. Tim Davie replaced Tony Hall as director general of the BBC in September Welcoming the report, Mr Davie said: ""Trust is vitally important and as an organisation that serves the public, the BBC must continue to lead the way on pay transparency and fairness. We are committed to building a truly inclusive culture. ""We agree with the Commission that we should continue to deliver on our reform programme which began in 2015. We accept every one of their recommendations and will implement them."" But the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said the report was not based on ""robust research"" because the ""strongest cases"" of pay discrimination were not properly examined. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said many members would feel the report ""doesn't address their lived experiences"" and there were ""still vital changes that need to take place"". Broadcasting union Bectu said the report ""highlights the importance of transparency in pay and terms and conditions"" and there are ""still improvements to be made, particularly in relation to pay progression"". Differences between men and women were exposed whenthe corporation published its first star salaries listin 2017. Only two of the top 14 earners were women, and men made up about two-thirds of the overall list. The corporation said most of the 500 salary increases rises awarded to women since 2017 related to the issue of fair pay rather than equal pay, and that 99% of pay queries had now been resolved. Four equal pay cases are still going through the tribunal process, with three more being dealt with by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). A further seven fair or equal pay complaints are going through the BBC's own internal procedure. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The fire caused an estimated Â£47,500-worth of damage to the hospital ward A man has been jailed for five years after admitting causing a fire at a hospital by lighting a cigarette. Lee Williams, of Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, was wearing an oxygen mask when he lit the cigarette on a ward at University Hospital of Wales. The fire caused almost Â£50,000-worth of damage, a court heard. He pleaded guilty to assaulting an emergency worker and arson with intent to endanger life at a hearing at Cardiff Crown Court. Nurses had to evacuate 38 patients after the fire took hold on the ward, which was subsequently closed for two weeks in May 2019. Lee Williams had been treated with oxygen and a nebuliser prior to the blaze Williams, 44, had been receiving treatment for two weeks on the C5 ward at the hospital when the fire happened. The court heard Williams had been told on three previous occasions he was not allowed to smoke on the ward, but Williams told them he would smoke if he wanted to. He had been found in his bed with a lit cigarette the day before the blaze, but appeared to be sleeping. A nurse took away the lit cigarette and he was again warned against smoking in the hospital. Prosecutor Andrew Kendall told the court: ""The ward was forced to close for two weeks and medical staff had treatment for smoke inhalation."" Medical staff needed treatment for smoke inhalation in the aftermath of the blaze He added an investigation found that ""smoking while using an oxygen mask"" was the ""probable cause"" of the fire. The fire caused Â£47,500 worth of damage and the closure ""added pressure to the rest of the hospital"". Williams suffered a blackened nose and injuries to his mouth after the fire. Laurence Jones, defending, said Williams ""may have been in a state of confusion through self-medication"". Judge David Wynn Morgan said: ""You were told in the clearest terms you could not smoke in the hospital. ""The dangers of fire were made clear to you. Your response was: 'I don't care, it is my decision to have a cigarette'. ""You put at risk the life of the doctor who rushed to treat you, the two nurses who helped, the security staff who put out the fire, and the 38 patients who had to be evacuated in the thick smoke.""

"Lee Cain arrived for work on Thursday, having already handed in his notice to No 10 One of Boris Johnson's closest aides, director of communications Lee Cain, has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street. He will leave next month, despite being offered a promotion to chief of staff. His departure prompted speculation about the future of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, but the BBC was told he would stay for now. No 10 denied Mr Johnson had been distracted by the saga, saying he was ""fully focussed"" on tackling Covid. Mr Cain has been at the PM's side since he was a press officer for the Vote Leave campaign under Mr Cummings. Many will not have heard of him before the story broke, but his resignation comes at a time when the government is facing big decisions over its coronavirus strategy and the future of post-Brexit trade with the EU. After a number of rows and U-turns within government in recent months, No 10 will see communications as key in connecting with the country and trying to gain support for its decisions. No 10 exit much more than a random resignation Newscast: Cain quits No 10 The news that Mr Cain - who worked with Mr Cummings and the PM in the Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU - could become Mr Johnson's chief of staff had led to consternation among some MPs and ministers, said BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. One Tory source even suggested that Mr Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds - a former head of communications for the Conservatives - had misgivings about that plan. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio: ""This is pathetic. I think millions of people will be waking up this morning, scratching their heads, saying what on earth is going on? ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we're all worried about our health and our families, we're all worried about our jobs, and this lot are squabbling behind the door of No 10. Pull yourselves together, focus on the job in hand."" But the PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson was concentrating on fighting coronavirus, adding: ""You can see the progress we are making, in terms of rolling out mass testing, in securing vaccines and also in terms of making improvements to test and trace."" Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said there was also a ""complete focus in government on making sure we can work with business and work with citizens in order to deliver on the promise of Brexit"". This is much more than a random resignation. Lee Cain was Boris Johnson's longest serving aide in No 10 and very close to his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. Arguments and rivalry in any Downing Street operation are not unusual. This feels different though, perhaps the final act of Vote Leave is playing out after months of building tensions. One insider - who until now has kept their counsel - spoke out in frustration last night, saying: ""I just can't describe to you how much of a mess it is."" This is about who is running the country and the prime minister's ability to manage his own operation. The question now is whether the chaos that has spilled into public spirals into something more serious, or whether it is the chance for a reset the prime minister requires. Allies of Mr Cain were unhappy about how he had been treated, which prompted initial speculation about Mr Cummings's own future. Mr Cummings and Mr Cain are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum. Mr Cain, who is set to step down next month, will be replaced as the director of communications by James Slack - a former journalist and one of the PM's spokesmen. Mr Johnson is thought to be looking to fill the post of chief of staff as part of a wider reorganisation, which will also see ex-BBC journalist Allegra Stratton take on a role fronting new daily televised press briefings. Lee Cain spent time as a journalist before entering No 10 - including a stint following David Cameron around dressed as a chicken Lee Cain, 39, went to Ormskirk Grammar School in Lancashire and Staffordshire University, before starting a career in journalism in 2006 as the Abbeymead and Abbeydale patch reporter for the Gloucester Citizen He worked briefly at the Sun and the Mail on Sunday and then joined the Daily Mirror - where he spent time during the 2010 election campaignfollowing Conservative leader David Cameron dressed as a chicken Later, he became a member of the communications team for the Vote Leave campaign, and worked as a special adviser for Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office He also worked for Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs In his resignation statement, Mr Cain said it had been a privilege to work for Mr Johnson, but he added: ""After careful consideration I have this evening resigned as No 10 director of communications and will leave the post at the end of the year. In response, Mr Johnson thanked Mr Cain for his ""extraordinary service"" to him, calling him a ""true ally and friend"". But several Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the wrangling in Downing Street, which comes at a time of growing unease on the government's own benches over its handling of the pandemic - especially the use of lockdown measures. This video can not be played Gove: Government focused on delivering for British people Charles Walker, the vice chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there has been ""unhappiness about the No 10 operation for some time"". He added: ""Members of Parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that's no secret. ""The real opportunity here is for the chief of staff position to be filled by someone who has good links with the Conservative Party and its representation in the House of Commons."" Fellow Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale said it was ""very worrying indeed"" that No 10 ""consider it proper to devote this amount of energy to internal squabbles"" in the midst of a pandemic and Brexit trade negotiations. He told BBC News: ""We really do need people there with their minds on the job. It really is time that Downing Street got in place, what I think is now in common parlance is known as somebody with big boy pants on.

"The number of people waiting over a year for hospital treatment in England has hit its highest levels since 2008. Patients are meant to be seen within 18 weeks - but nearly 140,000 of the 4.35 million on the waiting list at the end of September had waited over a year. The number waiting 12 months or more has increased sharply this year - the figure in February was just 1,600. Surgeons said it was ""tragic"" patients were being left in pain while they waited for treatment. And others warned the situation could become even worse during winter with the NHS seeing rising numbers of Covid patients. In recent weeks, major hospitals in Bradford, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Liverpool, which have seen high rates of infection, have announced the mass cancellation of non-urgent work. Donna Doyle, 52, was referred for surgery at the end of 2019. She has rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and needed reconstructive surgery on the front half of her right foot. But her pre-op appointment was cancelled in the spring because of pandemic. And now she has been told she will have to wait until February at the earliest. ""The pain isn't something that affects me every now and then, it's a problem every single day,"" she says. ""Imagine two pebbles grinding against the bone in your feet. It's constant. ""It causes a lot of problems in my life, physically and mentally. I psyched myself up for having the surgery, so the day I was told nothing would be happening, I was so upset. ""I work from home at moment. And some days, my husband comes home and I'm crying, feeling really down. ""I'm fed up with seeing Matt Hancock say ""the NHS is open for business"" because it's not true. I'm being overlooked."" Prof John Appleby, director of research at health think tank the Nuffield Trust, said the situation was a ""real concern"". Hospitals were facing a real battle to keep non-Covid services going, he said, pointing out the number of Covid patients in hospital had risen from just over 2,000 to more than 10,000 since the end of September. ""It is clear that over the summer months, NHS staff have put in tremendous amounts of work to boost activity across the board,"" he said. ""However, the service has fallen short of the tall order of recovering all non-Covid activity between the two waves of this pandemic."" Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen said these patients had paid a ""heavy price"". ""It is tragic to see so many lives put on hold,2 he said. ""Each statistic represents someone waiting patiently, potentially in pain, for the treatment they need to get on with living an independent life. ""Older people and poorer people are particularly hard hit by these delays."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis, said the situation was ""appalling"". ""We're currently seeing some hospitals entirely pausing elective surgery because of the pressures of the second phase of the pandemic,"" she said. ""The consequences of these further delays will reverberate for years to come."" Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the NHS was doing its best but was facing a really challenging winter. ""We are keenly aware of the inconvenience, anxiety and distress for patients caused by any delays for diagnostic tests, treatment or consultations,"" he added. Alongside routine care, significant numbers have missed out on treatment for cancer. The numbers receiving urgent check-ups have dropped by a quarter during the pandemic, with 300,000 fewer people seeing a cancer specialist from April to September than during the same period last year. The numbers starting cancer treatment are also down by a fifth. Anoushka Kurkjian Mother-of-three Anoushka Kurkjian, 41, found a cyst on her breast in June. She sought medical advice and was told it was benign but remained concerned because she was in pain. As a last resort - three months later - she went to her local accident-and-emergency unit and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had been afraid to go because of worries over catching the coronavirus. The cancer has now spread to her lymph nodes. ""If it had been a year ago, I would have gone in earlier,"" Anoushka says. ""I am now undergoing chemotherapy and have lost my hair. ""I feel very angry that I was not diagnosed earlier. ""I wish I could say to women, 'Seek treatment. ""'Don't be deterred.' ""Yes, Covid is a factor. ""But there's a lot more going on out there."" But NHS bosses said cancer services had returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity by the end of September. An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""The NHS message to the public has always been clear - do not delay, help us to help you by coming forward for care.""

"The Planning Inspectorate said the decision was made following ""careful consideration"" A plan to dig a Â£1.7bn road tunnel near Stonehenge has been approved by the Transport Secretary. The A303, a popular route for motorists travelling to and from the south west, runs within a few hundred metres of the world heritage site. The decision to build a two-mile (3.2km) tunnel out of sight of the monument goes against the recommendations of planning officials. Campaigners said it was a ""complete violation"" and ""international scandal"". The Planning Inspectorate had recommended Transport Secretary Grant Shapps withhold consent, warning it would cause ""permanent, irreversible harm"" to the World Heritage site. But the Department for Transport wrote to Highways England stating: ""The Secretary of State is satisfied that, on balance, the need case for the development together with the other benefits identified outweigh any harm."" Sarah Richards, the Planning Inspectorate's chief executive, said there had been a ""great deal of public interest in this project"". She said: ""A major priority for us over the course of the examination was to ensure that communities who might be affected by this proposal had the opportunity to put forward their views. ""As always, the examining authority gave careful consideration to these before reaching its conclusion."" Some environmentalists and archaeologists have voiced their opposition to the plan due to its potential impact on the area Some environmentalists and archaeologists had voiced their opposition to the plan due to its potential impact on the area. Tom Holland, from the Stonehenge Alliance, said the scheme was ""a Â£2 billion white elephant"" and called the decision ""shocking and shameful"". ""The decision to inject a great gash of tarmac and concrete into Britain's most precious prehistoric landscape is one that ranks simultaneously as spendthrift and sacrilegious,"" he said. ""This has huge implications not just for Britain, but for the entire world. What's to stop people at Giza (site of the pyramids), or in Rwanda getting rid of gorillas because they're in the way of mining developments?."" Cas Smith, a druid and anti-tunnel campaigner, said it was a ""complete violation"". ""You wouldn't dream of pushing a bore tunnel next door to Salisbury Cathedral, so why Stonehenge,"" she said. Prof David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, described the news as ""gut-wrenching"". ""The tunnel is going to clearly compromise the archaeology,"" he said. ""Stonehenge is precious for the whole of humanity, for our understanding of how we have adapted and evolved as a species since the Ice Age. ""It's an international scandal."" Highways England said the cost range for the whole scheme is between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.4bn but it is ""currently working to Â£1.7bn"" In June, it emerged that a team ofarchaeologists had discovered a ring of at least 20 large shaftswithin the ancient religious monument, a short distance from the stones. But Highways England said the finds were ""well outside the scheme boundary"" and no closer than 500 metres from the planned road upgrade. Chief executive Jim O'Sullivan welcomed the decision and said: ""The A303 Stonehenge tunnel project is part of the biggest investment in our road network for a generation. ""This transformational scheme will return the Stonehenge landscape towards its original setting and will improve journey times for everyone who travels to and from the South West."" Anna Eavis, from English Heritage which looks after Stonehenge, said the scheme would ""restore the ancient landscape"" around the monument. ""At the moment the A303 is a great blight which cuts through the world heritage site,"" she said. ""The project will transform this great blight so people will be able to walk freely and experience those monuments without the assault on the senses."" There is now a six-week period in which the decision can be challenged in the High Court. Preparatory work is due to begin in spring next year, with the five-year construction phase expected to start by 2023. Highways England said the cost range for the whole scheme was between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.4bn but it was ""currently working to Â£1.7bn"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in March that funding was in place for the project. Public-private funding was due to be used to finance the work, but in October 2018 then-Chancellor Philip Hammond cancelled future deals using that model.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: 'There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic' The UK's economy rebounded from recession in July to September, but growth showed signs of slowing down at the end of the three months. Growth of 15.5% in July to September was the biggest on record,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. It came after a six-month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, while the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the virus struck. The economy had shrunk in the first three months of the year and then contracted by a record 19.8% in the April-to-June period. Two consecutive three-month periods of contraction are generally defined as a recession. What is a recession? UK unemployment rate continues to surge Despite the rebound in July to September, analysts warned that the economy was likely to shrink again in the final three months of the year because of the impact of renewed lockdowns in different parts of the country. A second lockdown began in England on 5 November and is due to finish on 2 December. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that in view of what had happened since, the figures felt ""not just like old news, but like ancient news"". ""We already know that GDP will struggle to rise in October as tighter restrictions were imposed and that it will take a hammering in November as the effects of the second Covid-19 lockdown are felt."" In September, growth was 1.1%, marking the fifth consecutive month of expansion. However, that was weaker than the levels seen in previous months. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said all sectors of the economy continued to recover, albeit more slowly. ""The return of children to school boosted activity in the education sector. Housebuilding also continued to recover, while business strengthened for lawyers and accountants after a poor August. ""However, pubs and restaurants saw less business after the Eat Out to Help Out scheme ended and accommodation saw less business after a successful summer."" In another sign of the impact of the pandemic on the economy, figures released on Tuesday showedthe unemployment rate rose to 4.8%in the three months to September, up from 4.5%. The number of people out of work rose by 243,000 in the three-month period, the largest increase since May 2009. Welsh food packaging firm Transcend Packaging saw its sales collapse by half during the depths of the first lockdown. But boss Lorenzo Angelucci says they have are now higher than they were at the start of the year - partly because the firm has started making personal protective equipment which kept sales buoyant. ""Obviously the beginning of the pandemic was pretty tough,"" he told the BBC. ""It forced us to be creative and come up with other types of products."" The firm, which supplies clients such as McDonald's, expects to benefit in coming months as takeaway services remain open. ""Food packaging is by default safer in this situation, because people still need to eat,"" he said. ""But the economy itself, I don't think will be in a very nice position for a long time."" Record growth for the UK economy in July to September is a welcome partial reverse from the record fall seen in the spring. It means that lights are going back on in the economy that were switched off in the first lockdown. It is, though, catch-up not recovery. It is rebound more than it is established bounce-back. The economy is still nearly a tenth smaller than it was before the pandemic struck. More than that, the data is a rear-view mirror on the economy. It reflects a period of falling infections, the boost to growth and to footfall from the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out scheme. It shows the rate of this rebound slowing in September, even as there was a boost from the return of school pupils. Since then, there has obviously been a further, though less extensive shutdown, but both the Bank of England and the Treasury have boosted the economy. The great bit of sunlight on the horizon, however, is the vaccine. That will be the biggest economic stimulus imaginable. In a BBC interview, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was going to be ""a difficult winter"", but there were ""reasons for cautious optimism"". ""Our priority remains to protect as many jobs as possible,"" he said, adding that the extension of the furlough scheme and the creation of the Kickstart job scheme for young people would help to do this. He maintained that England would be able to exit its second lockdown as planned on 2 December. ""I am very confident that the measures we have put in place will do the job that we need them to do,"" he said. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy was likely to shrink by about 0.5% in the final three months of the year. ""On a monthly basis, it probably won't recover to September's level until the spring, when it should be possible for Covid-19 restrictions to be sustainably relaxed,"" he added. Looking further ahead, Sarah Hewin, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC there was ""uncertainty"" about the first three months of 2021, ""particularly if we have trade disruptions related to Brexit as the transition period comes to an end at the end of the year"". Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said news of a potential vaccine ""reduced uncertainty"" for business Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey welcomed news thata possible Covid-19 vaccine had performed well in clinical trials: ""It's encouraging for individuals, it's encouraging for businesses, and it's encouraging for the economy."" ""The sooner that way out of Covid comes into effect, the more businesses are likely to survive in financial terms,"" he told the Financial Times in a video interview. Mr Bailey said the news was ""broadly consistent"" with the Bank's latest set of economic forecasts, which assumed that the pandemic would start to recede after the winter as better treatments arrived. But the news ""reduces the huge level of uncertainty that we have in the forecasts"", he added. How fast is the UK's economy growing? What is a recession?

"The students hung up a banner reading: ""Put students and staff before profits."" Students are ""occupying"" a University of Manchester building in a protest against ""extremely high"" rents and a claimed lack of support during the coronavirus pandemic. They accuse the university of ""putting profits before students"" and have asked for rents to be reduced by 40%. Izzy Smitheman, 18, said they had enough food to stay there for a week but could get more. The university said it was ""already engaging"" with student unions. Ms Smitheman, who is studying English Literature and French, said she was protesting at the Owens Park Tower in Fallowfield because the university had ""put us on unsafe campuses, paying extremely high rent"" and she felt there had been a lack of support. ""They brought us here for profit rather than our safety,"" she said, adding: ""We've tried protesting and withholding our rent but the university won't respond to our demands with support."" The students say they are following social distancing guidelines Last week, students living at the University of Manchester's Fallowfield halls of residencetore down ""prison-like"" fencing erected around their campuson day one of England's national lockdown. Ms Smitheman said the university had tried ""fearmongering and threatening"" students who have not paid their rent as part of theUoM Rent Strike,externalaction group. ""This is the same university that fenced us in and told us when we were isolating to put on a mask and get to the shops,"" she said. The 18-year-old added: ""I thought the university would be on our side and try help us but it feels like it is us against them. They're here to take our money and that's all they care about."" ""This is a fight now."" Another protester Ben McGowan said: ""There have been so many mistakes made by the university. ""The state of the accommodation has been ridiculous with regular flooding in the rooms."" He said he wanted a refund on rent paid for December asnew government guidelinesmeant he had to leave the accommodation, but the university had ""refused to engage"" and he had been ""threatened with fines"". Barnaby Peter, a first year student who is also a rent striker, said he had been told his contract would be terminated if he continued to withhold rent. ""We are being charged for things like use of common room facilities which are actually shut, among other things. ""We are also not being provided adequate mental health support."" Security has already removed the protesters' banner A University of Manchester spokesperson said a ""handful of students"" were protesting in an empty residential building and they had been told ""they shouldn't be there"" and they could be breaking Covid-19 public health regulations. The university statement added: ""We are already engaging with elected Students' Union representatives about many of the issues being highlighted by the protestors."" Ms Smitheman said: ""We are forming a household. We are aware of Covid and are wearing masks and socially distancing. ""We're not doing it for ourselves but for every other student on campus."" Greater Manchester Police said officers would support the university ""wherever necessary"" to deal with those involved.

"The UK has recorded a record 33,470 cases in the past day - a jump of 10,520 compared with yesterday's total The government is to give councils Â£2.2bn for business grants tomorrow, Sharma says The UK's economy bounced back from recession with record growth of 15.5% in July to September - but is still 8.2% smaller than before Covid Chancellor Rishi Sunak says there are grounds for ""cautious optimism"" but a ""difficult winter"" still lies ahead Figures reveal huge growth in NHS waiting lists since Covid struck - with nearly 140,000 waiting over a year for routine procedures WHO chief warns world not to get complacent about Covid-19 as it's not yet proven how effective vaccines will be Wales has 983 Covid patients in hospitals - more than at any time including during the first wave Scotland temporarily bans alcohol from trains and stations to help social distancing - as nation's R number drops to one Northern Ireland's circuit-break lockdown will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday Spain's coronavirus death toll has surged to more than 40,000, with infections passing 1.4m Germany's health minister says he expects coronavirus restrictions there to continue through the winter The US has confirmed its highest 24-hour infection total to date â a world record of more than 144,000 cases Edited by Emma Owen We're wrapping up our live-page coverage of the pandemic for the day. Thanks for joining us, we hope to see you again on Friday. Today's contributors were Mal Siret, Joshua Nevett, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley. If you're just catching up, here's an overview of today's headlines from the UK and around the world. In the UK:  Elsewhere around the world:    We've just got some more information on the extension of restrictions in Northern Ireland. Close contact services including hair and beauty salons and driving lessons will reopen for appointments only on Friday, 20 November. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on that date. Northern Ireland's executive has said this will not include the purchase or consumption of alcohol on such premises. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November. Our story here will continue to be updated. Emily Ashton, from Bloomberg, asks the final set of questions. She first asks Powis: Lockdown
will end 2 December, is that the right thing to do given the rise in cases? She also asks Sharma: Can you categorically say that the
supply of the vaccine wonât be affected by Brexit disruption? Powis replies that that is ""a matter for our elected representatives"" but âwe will not be going back completely to normalâ after lockdown. âExactly what those measures are [after lockdown] itâs too early to say yet,â
he says. âWe need to see what transpires over the next few weeks.â Sharma says the government has been preparing for Brexit, including investing hundreds of
millions of pounds in border infrastructure. He says the key message is that businesses ""do need to be prepared"", adding that information for them is
available on the .gov website. All bars and restaurants in England have had to close for four weeks Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday,the executive has agreed. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if the government is considering compulsory vaccination. He also wants to know if there will be a certification system so people can prove they have had the vaccine. Alok Sharma begins his reply by emphasizing that the vaccines will only be rolled out if they are safe and effective. ""Then of course we will follow the advice we get from the scientists and experts,"" he adds. ""We are good at vaccinations in this country,"" says Stephen Powis. He says he believes the public has confidence in the vaccine programme and will come forward to get it. Jane Merrick from the i raises public concern about the deployment of a vaccine and has another question about the prevalence of the virus in the north west: was the tiered system enough to have an impact there? Sharma says a plan for deployment of a vaccine will be set out and that the government will continue to communicate with people on the issue. Powis says he is âconfidentâ that the tiered
system has had an effect on the transmission of the virus and the number of
infections. In Liverpool âwe are beginning to see some of the effects of
tier three,â he says. But we will not see the benefits of national restrictions
until next week, he adds. Sam Coates from Sky asks if failure to strike a trade deal with the EU would make any difference to the sourcing of vaccines. Stephen Powis says the NHS has been preparing for the UK's exit from the EU ""for some time"". He adds that the focus is on getting the vaccines to those who need it. Alok Sharma praises the work of the vaccine taskforce, noting that it has secured 350 million vaccines ""across six of the most promising vaccine candidates"". Dan Hewitt from ITV asks about the resignation of Boris Johnson's top aideamid news of infighting in No 10during a pandemic. He directs a second question to Prof Powis, asking whether he regrets stopping routine surgery in the
first wave Sharma says: âAll of us in government are focused on one thing, which is protecting lives and livelihoods.â He goes on to say they have protected ""millions of jobs"" through schemes such as furlough. Prof Powis says at the start of the pandemic in March infection
rates and hospitalisations were ""rising incredibly rapidly"" and testing was more limited. It was ""absolutely critical we had to create capacity in the NHS
not knowing how large it would be and not knowing how the public would respond
to measures"", he says. It ""was right we ensured the NHS was ready for that"". He adds: ""Of course we donât want to step down elective surgery... That is why in the second wave this autumn we havenât done
that."" Lee Cain has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks if there is concern about today's dramatic jump in infections. Stephen Powis says it is important to look at a range of data not just the numbers for a single day. However, he adds that it is clear that infections are rising - and emphasises the importance of complying with restrictions. Sophie also asks if Brexit will affect the supply chain for the vaccine. Alok Sharma says the government has been working with businesses to make sure they are prepared for 31 December, when the UK leaves the Brexit transition period. The second question is from Laura from Sheffield, who asks that if the national lockdown restrictions end on 2 December, do we go
back to the tier our area was in? Sharma says the government has ""made it clear"" that the national
restrictions ""will come to an end"" on 2 December and England ""will move back to tiered
system"". He says it's important to continue to follow the rules to stop the spread of the virus. ""As we get to 2 December the prime minister will set out more details,"" he
says. We now turn to questions, and Chris asks how the vaccine will be rolled out. Alok Sharma says people will understand that the government wants to make sure that those most at risk get the vaccine first. Stephen Powis says GPs and pharmacies are well prepared and adds that they are also looking at vaccination centres. He says he will say more in the coming weeks once we know more about the vaccine. He adds that he is ""confident the NHS will be up to this huge logistical challenge"". Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for England, says the number of patients in hospital with coronavirus ""is
still rising"". ""As we know, that number will unfortunately continue to rise if
the infection rates continue to increase in communities,"" he says. He says the news this week about a potential vaccine is ""extremely
encouraging"" and is ""welcome news"". ""But the vaccine is not here yet,"" he warns. ""That is why it is vital we continue to follow all the guidelines."" Alok Sharma welcomes this week's positive progress on the Pfizer vaccine, but warns ""we still have a lot of hurdles to come"". He urges the public to continue following the guidance. ""The virus is still there, it is still a danger,"" he says. Turning to the economic situation, Sharma says the government will be ""distributing Â£2.2bn to local authorities tomorrow to allow them to make vital grant payments to businesses affected"". ""These measures are designed to help business stay afloat,"" he says. He adds that the government's Kickstart scheme has created 19,000 jobs. It is ""a ray of hope for young people"" he says. Travellers from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar and the Turks and Caicos islands will no longer have to self-isolate when they arrive to the UK after 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Current coronavirus restrictions mean that only people with valid reasons are supposed to travel abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Greece will be removed from the travel corridor list, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos. From 04:00 on Saturday travellers to the UK from this destination will need to self-isolate. He added that the travel ban on Denmark will be extended for a further 14 days. Alok Sharma begins by going through the coronavirus figures. He says the average number of positive Covid tests is 22,524 compared to 22,398 a week ago. He also says the average number of Covid patients in hospital is 14,196 across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago. ""This is a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus,"" he says. Business Secretary Alok Sharma and the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, have arrived for today's press conference. We'll bring you all the news as it comes. We are expecting a government press conference to start shortly, and could hear questions on both the state of the NHS and the economy. Todayfigures revealed that NHS waiting lists have grownsince Covid struck, with nearly 140,000 people waiting over a year for routine procedures. We've also learnt thatthe UK's economy has rebounded from recessionfollowing a six month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, and the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the pandemic. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has accused President Donald Trump of ""refusing to accept reality"" in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi told a news conference that the president and Republicans had ""ignored by delay, distortion, denial"" the impact of the health and economic crisis, which she called a ""red alert"". She said the ""devastating milestone"" of 10 million Americans infected with coronavirus had been passed, listing the dire economic consequences of that. ""And what are they doing now?,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Trump administration. ""Continuing to ignore in spite of these numbers that should be so compelling. ""Every kind of avoidance of taking responsibility has been witnessed. They're engaged in an absurd circus right now, refusing to accept reality."" Trump maintains that he has handled the pandemic well, arguing that his administration has provided ample medical equipment and accelerated the development of treatments. Allow Twitter content?

"The factory in Urumqi produces about 20,000 cars a year, a fraction of that from other VW plants in China Volkswagen has defended its decision to continue operating a car plant in Xinjiang, a Chinese region mired in allegations of large-scale human rights abuses by the state. Evidence that hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities are being detained in camps, or used as forced labour in factories,has led some multinational companies to cut ties,externalwith the region, despite China's insistence that the claims are untrue. Volkswagen's critics argue that it has a particular moral obligation,externalnot to be involved in such practices because of its history. The company wasfounded by the ruling German Nazi Party in 1937 and used forced labour,external- including concentration camp prisoners - in its factories during WWII. Adolf Hitler inspects a VW model car when the Nazis ruled Germany But in an interview with the BBC in Beijing, the company's CEO in China, Stephan Wollenstein, defended Volkswagen's presence in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, where it runs a factory with 600 workers, producing up to 20,000 vehicles a year. ""What happened in the Nazi times was something that happened in our factories where we had forced labour, people producing Volkswagen cars,"" he said. This video can not be played VW boss Stephan Wollenstein: ""We have no forced labour"" ""This certainly is an unacceptable situation. Therefore, we are making sure that none of our production sites have forced labour, and this is something that we specifically checked in Urumqi and I can assure you, we do not have forced labour."" But when asked whether he could be absolutely certain of that claim and give an assurance that none of the Urumqi workforce - of which around 25% is made up of Uighurs and other minorities - had been in a camp, Dr Wollenstein said he couldn't. ""We try to control our company-related processes, including the HR process, which, for instance, means the hiring of people in the best possible manner,"" he said. ""And this reduces for us the risk that something happens which we do not like and which is not complying to our standards. But I guess we could never reach 100% certainty."" Up to a million Muslims are thought to have been detained in prison camps across Xinjiang For critics, that defence falls short. Viola von Cramon-Taubadel is a Green Party member of the European Parliament and formerly a member of the German Federal Parliament from Lower Saxony - the state where Volkswagen's headquarters is based. ""Why can't they be certain? They should make sure that there is no linkage between any labour camp and that company,"" she told the BBC. Even if VW could prove categorically that their own supply chain was clean, the criticism goes far deeper. Because opening a car plant in Xinjiang requires the partnership and approval of the Chinese authorities, the concern is that it risks lending tacit support to the policies of mass incarceration and ethnic repression, for which there is now compelling evidence. China's hidden camps: The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang Xinjiang schools separate children from families Satellite data, the testimony of witnesses andChina's own government records,externalmake clearthe scale of the camp building,externaland thecoercion behind the factory labour,external. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" WhileChina insists it has been providing de-extremification trainingfor Xinjiang's traditionally Muslim minorities, and running large-scale job creation schemes, the real aim appears to be the forced assimilation of identities and cultures now viewed by the state as inherently disloyal. Withinternational governments and rights-groups raising their voices,externalin condemnation, andsome major brands distancing themselves,external, Volkswagen finds itself out of step on Xinjiang. ""Even the placing of a factory there gives, of course, the Communist Party a higher legitimacy,"" Ms von Cramon-Taubadel said. ""Volkswagen knows this - they have done it exactly for this, to get a comparative advantage. It was a political issue from the very beginning - economically it is useless, it doesn't make sense at all."" Volkswagen denies that its decision to open its Xinjiang plant in 2013 was for political rather than economic reasons, insisting that the company saw good, long-term opportunities for market growth in China's far-west. With the number of cars being produced currently less than 10% of capacity of some of the company's 32 other plants in China, Dr Wollenstein said they would ""love to do more."" ""But the market is still not as big as it could be with regard to our product offerings."" There are other things that appear to distinguish VW's Xinjiang operation from its factories elsewhere in China. Shortly after production began,a Chinese report suggested that the plant had an agreement with a neighbouring unit of a paramilitary police unit,external. Data leak reveals how China 'brainwashes' Uighurs in prison camps 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps The company would donate vehicles and in exchange, the People's Armed Police - an organisation with a frontline role in Xinjiang's heavy securitisation - would provide VW employees with both ""military training"" and ""patriotic education"", phrases often associated with the wider camp programme. Dr Wollenstein told the BBC that only two cars were provided to the unit - on behalf of Volkswagen's Chinese partner in the Xinjiang plant, Saic Motor Corporation Ltd - and he was not aware of any such training taking place at the factory. VW makes 20% of all new cars in China - a vital market for the company But when pressed as to whether it could have taken place off-site, he admitted, ""we probably would not know"". ""I would say everything that is happening outside the fences of all of our production sites all over China and what is happening in the spare time of our employees is out of our control."" For Volkswagen's critics, its real problem may be one of too much success. Its dominance ofthe China market, where it sells one-fifth of all new cars,external, risks making it a hostage to it. There have been demonstrations around the world against China's actions in Xinjiang Ms von Cramon-Taubadel says that in recent meetings she's held with senior company executives, they've admitted as much. ""They told me that the condition for any expansion of the company within China is that at least one of the factories should be based in the west,"" she said. ""And they tried to convince me that if VW decides unilaterally to close [its Xinjiang plant] they could not produce a single car in China any more."" In public, at least, Volkswagen insists its dominance of the Chinese market puts it in a position of strength. ""We've been engaged in this country for 37 years,"" Dr Wollenstein said. ""And as much as we are to a certain extent dependent on China, probably China is also dependent on us. ""We firmly believe in a global perspective and that free trade and doing business according to our ethical standards is helping every country where we're engaged.""

"The Xbox Series X and Series S consoles were released to the public on Tuesday The UK's leading internet providers have experienced record broadband use as a result of new Xbox consoles and fresh releases to the Call of Duty games franchise. BT, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, Vodafone, City Fibre and Zen Internet said they had all coped with the spike in demand on Tuesday. Much of the activity was generated by video gamers downloading large files. Some people will have experienced slower speeds as a consequence. The internet service providers will be tested again on 19 November when the PlayStation 5 comes to the UK. Factors that may have fed in to Tuesday's figures include: Activision releasing updates to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone that ranged up to 65 gigabytes in size pre-loads of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War of up to 130GB, which launches on Friday an update to Bungie's video game Destiny 2 that was about 65GB, as well as a live event inside the title the release of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which was 60GB. Even if users bought the game in disc form, they still faced downloading an 8GB ""day one update"" various security updates and bug fixes from Microsoft, as part of it regular monthly ""patch Tuesday"" release Call of Duty downloads have been linked to previous record days for the UK's internet providers BT said broadband traffic peaked at 18 terabits per second (Tbps) - equivalent to delivering about 1,510 hours of high-definition video every second. That compared with the previous record of 17.5Tbps it reported on an evening when it had experienced high demand for both streaming football and video games. ""This is comfortably within the network's capacity,"" said a spokeswoman. Virgin Media said 108 petabytes of data were consumed via its network - 1PB is equivalent to one billion megabytes (MB) or one million gigabytes (GB). It said this was 30% higher than its average figure last month. Its previous busiest day was in June, when Call of Duty: Warzone's Season 4 launched. ""Keeping the country connected throughout the Covid-19 pandemic remains a top priority, and we anticipate another busy weekend with the streaming of the Autumn Nations Cup,"" said Jeanie York the firm's chief technology and information officer. TalkTalk said its network traffic spiked at 6.8Tbps. ""It appears that our appetite for data is showing no signs of slowing down during this second lockdown,"" commented Gary Steen, managing director of technology at the firm. Assassin's Creed Valhalla - like many other games - comes with a day one patch to allow developers to provide additional fixes to the version burned to disc Zen Internet said its equivalent figure was 11.6% higher than its previous peak, which occurred in October. ""We're looking forward to the PlayStation launch next week - although we cannot accurately predict it, we anticipate the traffic on our network to be higher again,"" said chief executive Paul Stobart. City Fibre said Tuesday had been a record day for it too, but added that Wednesday had been even busier as gamers and others continued their downloads. ""We are now having almost daily reminders about the nation's increased reliance on connectivity,"" said a spokesman. ""Whether that's people playing online with next generation consoles, streaming content, or working from home, demand for capacity is sky-rocketing."" Vodafone said Tuesday's peak had been 8% higher than its previous record, which was the Champions League final on 23 August. The PlayStation 5 has already launched in some parts of the world, but does not come to the UK until next week Sky said it observed a traffic surge of 16.6Tbps at its highest peak, setting a new record for its network. Its usual usage peak for a Tuesday is about 14Tbps. The BBC also asked KCom and the Post Office to share their figures. Openreach - which provides the network infrastructure to many of the UK's internet service providers - said its traffic had been high but not quite record-breaking. It told the BBC that 174PB of data was consumed on Tuesday versus a figure of 193PB on 5 August, which was when season five of Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare went live. ""This far exceeds what we'd consider a normal Tuesday,"" added Colin Lees, chief technology innovation officer at Openreach. ""We're also expecting to see another jump in traffic with the upcoming release of the PS5.""

"Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday, in a compromise reached by the executive. A proposal from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds was supported by the Ulster Unionists and Alliance. Sinn FÃ©in voted against the move and the SDLP abstained. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Hair and beauty salons and driving instructors will reopen, by appointment, next Friday. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on 20 November, but with a closing time of 20:00 GMT. Alcohol cannot be purchased or consumed on such premises. Pubs and bars will be permitted to sell sealed off sales on 20 November. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November, as the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced on 16 October will expire at midnight on 26 November. The currentrestrictions came into effect on 16 Octoberand were due to expire at midnight on Friday, with ministers under pressure to make a decision. The latest paper, brought by the DUP after several days of disagreement, was signed off late on Thursday afternoon. Close contact services including hair salons will reopen, by appointment, on 20 November The document agreed also says that support will be provided for mitigations to reduce risk within the hospitality sector, including improved ventilation and requirements for the recording of customer information for contact tracing purposes. The executive said a vaccination programme will be rolled out from as early as possible in December in line with England, initially targeting priority groups such as health care staff, care homes and those with underlying vulnerabilities. Justice Minister Naomi Long said she wasreconsidering her position in the Northern Ireland Executive over its handling of the Covid restrictions. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance initially supported a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to extend all Covid-19 restrictions for another two weeks, butit was blocked by the DUP,who put it to a cross-community vote. It is a mechanism that can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis, effectively giving parties with enough ministers a veto. The NI Executive is made up of five parties that operate in a mandatory coalition, sharing power between unionist and nationalist parties, and the cross-community Alliance Party - tensions had been flaring between ministers throughout the four days of meetings. A separate proposal put forward by Mr Swann, suggesting a one-week extension, was also blocked on Wednesday. The DUP had been calling for firm dates to be announced for other sectors to reopen, but other parties argued providing concrete dates to businesses during an unpredictable pandemic would be ""unfair"". Talks continued between the parties on Thursday over a hybrid proposal merging the one-week extension with a partial reopening of sectors the DUP had been calling for. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan. She told BBC Newsline that only imposing one more week of restrictions ""potentially means we're coming back to this situation before Christmas"". Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan ""We had strong advice from the chief medical officer and that should have been adhered to."" Economy Minister Diane Dodds said what the DUP had tried to do in their proposal ""is to bring certainty to people in their lives in the run-up to Christmas"". ""We have tried to bring forward a proposal that is balanced, that is proportionate and which the health minister supported, because that is the only way forward for an executive of five parties,"" she said. Mrs Dodds added: ""We cannot have a situation where we simply just open up business, close down business, open up business and we keep that in a perpetual cycle."" She later told BBC One's The View programme that she did not believe the executive had ""covered itself in glory"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds the DUP has tried to 'bring certainty to people' In a tweet, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said a ""fair and balanced agreement"" had been reached with the support of the health minister.

SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon abstained on the vote as she said she feared it could lead to more restrictions just before Christmas. ""People were crying out for a decision,"" she said. ""And I'm being honest, I could support the extension for the one week, I could support additional finances going to businesses, but I couldn't support the partial reopening in the second week, and the best way and most honest way for me to reflect that was by abstaining on the vote."" Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: ""That an agreement that could have been reached over a week ago has finally been achieved this evening is hardly a startling example of good and effective government."" He added: ""The lack of leadership from the Executive Office, the leaking and the briefing, as well as the use of cross-community voting within the Executive on matters that are anything but, further reinforces our belief that the system of government here needs urgent reform."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said it had been ""an embarrassing week of misgovernment"". Chief Executive of Belfast Chamber, Simon Hamilton, described the wrangling at Stormont as an ""embarrassing mess"". Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation told BBC One's The View programme that 35% of hotel rooms in Northern Ireland had been booked this weekend. She said 3,000 phone calls had to be made on Thursday after the Executive made a decision to keep hotels closed for two more weeks.

Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said he hoped the announcement would ""result in thousands of jobs and businesses being saved"". ""While pubs and restaurants may be closed, the bills continue to mount on a daily basis therefore extra financial support is needed now to protect businesses and jobs and we hope that the NI Executive will be swift in getting this money into bank accounts."" What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the package of restrictions was ""far from perfect"" - but welcomed that a decision had been taken. ""This decision provides a roadmap for the reopening of our high streets for the Christmas period and increased footfall for local retailers,"" he said. However, Bill Wolsey, who owns the Beannchor Group, said the decision came ""late in they day"" and was ""hugely disappointing"". He said the hospitality industry is now ""in a dire position"", and it was costing his company Â£30,000 a week in wages to stay closed. He said being open at Christmas is ""hugely important"". ""That's not only for my company, but for the whole of our industry - we use that money we make in December to sustain us through January and February, which are very quiet months. That's why we're so concerned about on what basis we'll be allowed to open."" Claire Blackadder, a hairdresser from Newry, told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra the announcement her business could reopen next Friday was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""At least now the ball is rolling in that regard, we just need finance now and we are good to go,"" she added. This week was a hard lesson in how not to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. What we have seen is a slow moving, five-party government trying to deal with a fast-moving situation, and it was quite clear this week that they failed on all fronts, given the level of frustration among the public. Despite the fact that there is now an agreement in place, few people are pleased with what is on the table. The big loser in all of this is the public messaging - while our politicians spent a lot of time and energy trying to convince each other about what was the right thing to do, they lost valuable time trying to convince the public that they need to comply with regulations. Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear that if he feels there needs to be a review in the next fortnight, he will be prepared to bring a recommendation for further restrictions to the executive table, so pubs and restaurants may not be out of the woods just yet. While pubs and restaurants might be circling 27 November on their calendar, they also know that there is a possibility they may not get to that point without further intervention.

"The Xbox Series X and Series S consoles were released to the public on Tuesday The UK's leading internet providers have experienced record broadband use as a result of new Xbox consoles and fresh releases to the Call of Duty games franchise. BT, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, Vodafone, City Fibre and Zen Internet said they had all coped with the spike in demand on Tuesday. Much of the activity was generated by video gamers downloading large files. Some people will have experienced slower speeds as a consequence. The internet service providers will be tested again on 19 November when the PlayStation 5 comes to the UK. Factors that may have fed in to Tuesday's figures include: Activision releasing updates to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone that ranged up to 65 gigabytes in size pre-loads of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War of up to 130GB, which launches on Friday an update to Bungie's video game Destiny 2 that was about 65GB, as well as a live event inside the title the release of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which was 60GB. Even if users bought the game in disc form, they still faced downloading an 8GB ""day one update"" various security updates and bug fixes from Microsoft, as part of it regular monthly ""patch Tuesday"" release Call of Duty downloads have been linked to previous record days for the UK's internet providers BT said broadband traffic peaked at 18 terabits per second (Tbps) - equivalent to delivering about 1,510 hours of high-definition video every second. That compared with the previous record of 17.5Tbps it reported on an evening when it had experienced high demand for both streaming football and video games. ""This is comfortably within the network's capacity,"" said a spokeswoman. Virgin Media said 108 petabytes of data were consumed via its network - 1PB is equivalent to one billion megabytes (MB) or one million gigabytes (GB). It said this was 30% higher than its average figure last month. Its previous busiest day was in June, when Call of Duty: Warzone's Season 4 launched. ""Keeping the country connected throughout the Covid-19 pandemic remains a top priority, and we anticipate another busy weekend with the streaming of the Autumn Nations Cup,"" said Jeanie York the firm's chief technology and information officer. TalkTalk said its network traffic spiked at 6.8Tbps. ""It appears that our appetite for data is showing no signs of slowing down during this second lockdown,"" commented Gary Steen, managing director of technology at the firm. Assassin's Creed Valhalla - like many other games - comes with a day one patch to allow developers to provide additional fixes to the version burned to disc Zen Internet said its equivalent figure was 11.6% higher than its previous peak, which occurred in October. ""We're looking forward to the PlayStation launch next week - although we cannot accurately predict it, we anticipate the traffic on our network to be higher again,"" said chief executive Paul Stobart. City Fibre said Tuesday had been a record day for it too, but added that Wednesday had been even busier as gamers and others continued their downloads. ""We are now having almost daily reminders about the nation's increased reliance on connectivity,"" said a spokesman. ""Whether that's people playing online with next generation consoles, streaming content, or working from home, demand for capacity is sky-rocketing."" Vodafone said Tuesday's peak had been 8% higher than its previous record, which was the Champions League final on 23 August. The PlayStation 5 has already launched in some parts of the world, but does not come to the UK until next week Sky said it observed a traffic surge of 16.6Tbps at its highest peak, setting a new record for its network. Its usual usage peak for a Tuesday is about 14Tbps. The BBC also asked KCom and the Post Office to share their figures. Openreach - which provides the network infrastructure to many of the UK's internet service providers - said its traffic had been high but not quite record-breaking. It told the BBC that 174PB of data was consumed on Tuesday versus a figure of 193PB on 5 August, which was when season five of Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare went live. ""This far exceeds what we'd consider a normal Tuesday,"" added Colin Lees, chief technology innovation officer at Openreach. ""We're also expecting to see another jump in traffic with the upcoming release of the PS5.""

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: 'There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic' The UK's economy rebounded from recession in July to September, but growth showed signs of slowing down at the end of the three months. Growth of 15.5% in July to September was the biggest on record,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. It came after a six-month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, while the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the virus struck. The economy had shrunk in the first three months of the year and then contracted by a record 19.8% in the April-to-June period. Two consecutive three-month periods of contraction are generally defined as a recession. What is a recession? UK unemployment rate continues to surge Despite the rebound in July to September, analysts warned that the economy was likely to shrink again in the final three months of the year because of the impact of renewed lockdowns in different parts of the country. A second lockdown began in England on 5 November and is due to finish on 2 December. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that in view of what had happened since, the figures felt ""not just like old news, but like ancient news"". ""We already know that GDP will struggle to rise in October as tighter restrictions were imposed and that it will take a hammering in November as the effects of the second Covid-19 lockdown are felt."" In September, growth was 1.1%, marking the fifth consecutive month of expansion. However, that was weaker than the levels seen in previous months. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said all sectors of the economy continued to recover, albeit more slowly. ""The return of children to school boosted activity in the education sector. Housebuilding also continued to recover, while business strengthened for lawyers and accountants after a poor August. ""However, pubs and restaurants saw less business after the Eat Out to Help Out scheme ended and accommodation saw less business after a successful summer."" In another sign of the impact of the pandemic on the economy, figures released on Tuesday showedthe unemployment rate rose to 4.8%in the three months to September, up from 4.5%. The number of people out of work rose by 243,000 in the three-month period, the largest increase since May 2009. Welsh food packaging firm Transcend Packaging saw its sales collapse by half during the depths of the first lockdown. But boss Lorenzo Angelucci says they have are now higher than they were at the start of the year - partly because the firm has started making personal protective equipment which kept sales buoyant. ""Obviously the beginning of the pandemic was pretty tough,"" he told the BBC. ""It forced us to be creative and come up with other types of products."" The firm, which supplies clients such as McDonald's, expects to benefit in coming months as takeaway services remain open. ""Food packaging is by default safer in this situation, because people still need to eat,"" he said. ""But the economy itself, I don't think will be in a very nice position for a long time."" Record growth for the UK economy in July to September is a welcome partial reverse from the record fall seen in the spring. It means that lights are going back on in the economy that were switched off in the first lockdown. It is, though, catch-up not recovery. It is rebound more than it is established bounce-back. The economy is still nearly a tenth smaller than it was before the pandemic struck. More than that, the data is a rear-view mirror on the economy. It reflects a period of falling infections, the boost to growth and to footfall from the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out scheme. It shows the rate of this rebound slowing in September, even as there was a boost from the return of school pupils. Since then, there has obviously been a further, though less extensive shutdown, but both the Bank of England and the Treasury have boosted the economy. The great bit of sunlight on the horizon, however, is the vaccine. That will be the biggest economic stimulus imaginable. In a BBC interview, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was going to be ""a difficult winter"", but there were ""reasons for cautious optimism"". ""Our priority remains to protect as many jobs as possible,"" he said, adding that the extension of the furlough scheme and the creation of the Kickstart job scheme for young people would help to do this. He maintained that England would be able to exit its second lockdown as planned on 2 December. ""I am very confident that the measures we have put in place will do the job that we need them to do,"" he said. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy was likely to shrink by about 0.5% in the final three months of the year. ""On a monthly basis, it probably won't recover to September's level until the spring, when it should be possible for Covid-19 restrictions to be sustainably relaxed,"" he added. Looking further ahead, Sarah Hewin, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC there was ""uncertainty"" about the first three months of 2021, ""particularly if we have trade disruptions related to Brexit as the transition period comes to an end at the end of the year"". Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said news of a potential vaccine ""reduced uncertainty"" for business Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey welcomed news thata possible Covid-19 vaccine had performed well in clinical trials: ""It's encouraging for individuals, it's encouraging for businesses, and it's encouraging for the economy."" ""The sooner that way out of Covid comes into effect, the more businesses are likely to survive in financial terms,"" he told the Financial Times in a video interview. Mr Bailey said the news was ""broadly consistent"" with the Bank's latest set of economic forecasts, which assumed that the pandemic would start to recede after the winter as better treatments arrived. But the news ""reduces the huge level of uncertainty that we have in the forecasts"", he added. How fast is the UK's economy growing? What is a recession?

"The Queen is Britain's longest reigning monarch and the longest reigning living monarch in the world A ""once-in-a-generation show"" over a four-day bank holiday weekend will mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in 2022. The Queen, 94, hopes as many people as possible across the UK will have the opportunity to join the celebrations, Buckingham Palace said. She will have reigned for 70 years on 6 February 2022 but plans are in place to stage a series of events from 2-5 June. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be a ""truly historic moment"" and deserved a ""celebration to remember"". He added it would ""bring the entire nation and the Commonwealth together."" The events will reflect the Queen's reign, the longest of any British sovereign, and her impact on the UK and the world since her accession to the throne in 1952. MPs and peers search for gift fit for the Queen To create the four-day weekend in June 2022, the late May Spring Bank Holiday that year will be moved to Thursday 2 June and an additional Bank Holiday on Friday 3 June will be created. Mr Dowden told MPs that ministers were working with the Royal Household, the devolved administrations and ""leading creative minds"" to make this a ""jubilee weekend to remember - one that mixes the best of British ceremonial splendour and pageantry with cutting edge artistic and technological display"". He added there were also plans to plant trees across the UK to commemorate the occasion. 2 June 1953- The Queen's coronation 14 November 1973- The wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips 7 June 1977Â - The Queen's Silver Jubilee 29 July 1981- The wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer 3 June 2002- The Queen's Golden Jubilee 29 April 2011- The wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton 5 June 2012- The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Members of the Royal Family are expected to take part in the celebrations over the extended weekend and in the run-up to it. In keeping with tradition established with previous royal milestones, a Platinum Jubilee medal will be awarded to people who work in public service, including representatives of the Armed Forces, the emergency services and the prison services. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle announcedplans to commemorate the anniversary in Parliament. A stained-glass window was placed in the Palace of Westminster as a gift to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, and a sundial was built in parliamentary grounds for the Golden Jubilee. MPs and peers will be invited to fund the gift at their own discretion, Sir Lindsay said. The Queen toured the country for her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""The Platinum Jubilee offers an opportunity for the Queen to express her thanks for the support and loyalty Her Majesty has received throughout her reign. ""The Queen hopes that as many people as possible will have the opportunity to join the celebrations."" Like for the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February. The Queen also became monarch on the day of the death of her father King George VI and and is known not to want to celebrate on the specific day of his anniversary. The Queen marked her Golden Jubilee in 2002 The Royal Household and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) are organising the commemorations.

"John Charles' sign-off sparked a demand for merchandise Fashion giant Hugo Boss has dropped its legal fight with an artist over his use of the word ""boss"" in a clothing range. John Charles, from Huyton, Merseyside, planned to launch the merchandise as a spin-off from online art lessons he started during the first lockdown. Mr Charles, who ends lessons by saying ""Be boss, be kind"", said an agreement had been reached over the slogan. Hugo Boss confirmed it had ""reached anÂ amicable solution with Mr Charles that does justice to both sides"". The artist's sign-off was so popular it led to a demand for merchandise with the motto, which caught the attention of the German fashion brand. The word ""boss"" is Liverpool slang for great. Mr Charles said: ""I'm buzzing - it is just boss. The key thing is that we're able to continue our free online art classes and release our merchandise."" The artist says he has no desire to rival the global brand Mr Charles conducted his first meeting alongside his wife Jen with Hugo Boss officials over Skype, before a company offering pro bono legal advice took over the negotiations. He said he wanted to say a ""massive thank you"" to people who had given him ""overwhelming"" public support. ""Hugo Boss were really sound. Very friendly,"" he said. He added: ""By the end of the call we had them all laughing and one of their reps said she will get her kid to join in on one of our live online art classes."" More than 27,000 people logged into Mr Charles' free online classes which he devised with the help of his 10-year-old daughter. ""We always wanted to finish positively which is why we said 'Be boss, be kind',"" he said. John Charles and his wife spoke to the company over Skype People from Australia, Italy and Mexico were among those who took part. The artist began marketing the slogan after people started asking for baseball caps, T-shirts and hoodies. Money from the merchandise is being put into a trust fund for his daughter. He received a letter from lawyers acting on behalf of Hugo Boss after he applied to trademark ""Be Boss, Be Kind"" in July.

"Lee Cain arrived for work on Thursday, having already handed in his notice to No 10 One of Boris Johnson's closest aides, director of communications Lee Cain, has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street. He will leave next month, despite being offered a promotion to chief of staff. His departure prompted speculation about the future of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, but the BBC was told he would stay for now. No 10 denied Mr Johnson had been distracted by the saga, saying he was ""fully focussed"" on tackling Covid. Mr Cain has been at the PM's side since he was a press officer for the Vote Leave campaign under Mr Cummings. Many will not have heard of him before the story broke, but his resignation comes at a time when the government is facing big decisions over its coronavirus strategy and the future of post-Brexit trade with the EU. After a number of rows and U-turns within government in recent months, No 10 will see communications as key in connecting with the country and trying to gain support for its decisions. No 10 exit much more than a random resignation Newscast: Cain quits No 10 The news that Mr Cain - who worked with Mr Cummings and the PM in the Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU - could become Mr Johnson's chief of staff had led to consternation among some MPs and ministers, said BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. One Tory source even suggested that Mr Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds - a former head of communications for the Conservatives - had misgivings about that plan. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio: ""This is pathetic. I think millions of people will be waking up this morning, scratching their heads, saying what on earth is going on? ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we're all worried about our health and our families, we're all worried about our jobs, and this lot are squabbling behind the door of No 10. Pull yourselves together, focus on the job in hand."" But the PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson was concentrating on fighting coronavirus, adding: ""You can see the progress we are making, in terms of rolling out mass testing, in securing vaccines and also in terms of making improvements to test and trace."" Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said there was also a ""complete focus in government on making sure we can work with business and work with citizens in order to deliver on the promise of Brexit"". This is much more than a random resignation. Lee Cain was Boris Johnson's longest serving aide in No 10 and very close to his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. Arguments and rivalry in any Downing Street operation are not unusual. This feels different though, perhaps the final act of Vote Leave is playing out after months of building tensions. One insider - who until now has kept their counsel - spoke out in frustration last night, saying: ""I just can't describe to you how much of a mess it is."" This is about who is running the country and the prime minister's ability to manage his own operation. The question now is whether the chaos that has spilled into public spirals into something more serious, or whether it is the chance for a reset the prime minister requires. Allies of Mr Cain were unhappy about how he had been treated, which prompted initial speculation about Mr Cummings's own future. Mr Cummings and Mr Cain are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum. Mr Cain, who is set to step down next month, will be replaced as the director of communications by James Slack - a former journalist and one of the PM's spokesmen. Mr Johnson is thought to be looking to fill the post of chief of staff as part of a wider reorganisation, which will also see ex-BBC journalist Allegra Stratton take on a role fronting new daily televised press briefings. Lee Cain spent time as a journalist before entering No 10 - including a stint following David Cameron around dressed as a chicken Lee Cain, 39, went to Ormskirk Grammar School in Lancashire and Staffordshire University, before starting a career in journalism in 2006 as the Abbeymead and Abbeydale patch reporter for the Gloucester Citizen He worked briefly at the Sun and the Mail on Sunday and then joined the Daily Mirror - where he spent time during the 2010 election campaignfollowing Conservative leader David Cameron dressed as a chicken Later, he became a member of the communications team for the Vote Leave campaign, and worked as a special adviser for Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office He also worked for Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs In his resignation statement, Mr Cain said it had been a privilege to work for Mr Johnson, but he added: ""After careful consideration I have this evening resigned as No 10 director of communications and will leave the post at the end of the year. In response, Mr Johnson thanked Mr Cain for his ""extraordinary service"" to him, calling him a ""true ally and friend"". But several Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the wrangling in Downing Street, which comes at a time of growing unease on the government's own benches over its handling of the pandemic - especially the use of lockdown measures. This video can not be played Gove: Government focused on delivering for British people Charles Walker, the vice chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there has been ""unhappiness about the No 10 operation for some time"". He added: ""Members of Parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that's no secret. ""The real opportunity here is for the chief of staff position to be filled by someone who has good links with the Conservative Party and its representation in the House of Commons."" Fellow Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale said it was ""very worrying indeed"" that No 10 ""consider it proper to devote this amount of energy to internal squabbles"" in the midst of a pandemic and Brexit trade negotiations. He told BBC News: ""We really do need people there with their minds on the job. It really is time that Downing Street got in place, what I think is now in common parlance is known as somebody with big boy pants on. ""A prime minister, particularly one facing the difficulties that Mr Johnson is facing, needs heavyweight help.""

"Hospitals in England have seen thenumber of new admissions jump by a quarter in just one day. During the spring, the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed was one of the prime reasons the UK went into lockdown. So how well-prepared is the health service for the second wave? The rise in infections in the community is now clearly translating into new cases being admitted to hospital. But we are still a long way from the peak. The increase in admissions means there are now nearly 3,000 patients in hospital with Covid. That represents about 3% of hospital beds. But given the reduced amount of activity - latest figures suggest only about half the number of routine operations are being done than was the case before the pandemic - there is still plenty of available space. The latest occupancy figures suggest there were around 30,000 beds unoccupied across the UK in the summer - three times as many as was normally the case before the pandemic hit. As with cases, the highest rates of admission are in the north of England. A look at the most recent data for hospital admissions shows two-thirds of the new cases admitted in England have been in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber. Hospitals in these areas have started standing up more of their ""Covid wards"" - where patients are isolated so they do not come into contact with patients coming in for other reasons, from cancer care to routine operations. But there have already been cases of hospitals reporting a build-up of extreme pressures. In recent weeks, hospitals in Bolton, Blackburn and Wakefield have issued alerts and tweets urging patients not to come to hospital unless absolutely necessary. But none of this is exceptional at this time of year - especially the closer we get to winter. Admissions for respiratory illnesses can double from late summer to the peak in December and January. What is not clear from the figures published by the government and NHS on Covid is what impact is being felt on other respiratory illnesses, such as flu. Prof Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford University, said this ""context"" is going to be crucial if decision-makers and the public are not to jump to ""inappropriate conclusions"" from rising Covid admissions. At the height of winter, hospitals would expect to see around 1,000 emergency admissions a day for respiratory illnesses. However, what may be more of a problem this year compared with previous winters is the state of the workforce. Both NHS managers and unions have warned that staff are on their knees after six months of fighting the pandemic following one of the most difficult winters in a generation. This week NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned that staff were ""exhausted"" and ""traumatised"" by what had happened this year. During the peak, staff found themselves being redeployed to unfamiliar environments as the NHS pulled out all the stops to ensure the service was not overwhelmed. This time it will be different. Hospitals are planning to keep other services running on a much greater scale than they did in the spring when routine treatments were cancelled en masse. London-based intensive care consultant Rupert Pearse said hospitals were working on the basis that hospital cases would peak at about two-thirds of the level they did in the spring. He believes that will allow just enough room to ""keep many services going"". Much though will depend on what happens next. On the current trajectory, hospital admissions are doubling every week to two weeks - the rate of increase is even steeper in the hotspot areas. If that continues, the NHS will fairly quickly reach and exceed the peak seen in the spring. That would then require the network of Nightingale field hospitals to start taking on patients, stretching resources even further. But the NHS is still a long way from that position. And the experience of other nations offers some hope that the situation may not be repeated. Spain and France, which started experiencing a rise in cases before the UK, have seen rises in hospital cases slow in recent weeks. Although some would point out that that required extra restrictions to be brought in to be achieved. There is also some evidence from the southern hemisphere - from countries such as Chile, Argentina and Australia - that suggests other respiratory viruses may be pushed out. In particular, they have reported very little flu - something which experts have put down to the social distancing and good hand hygiene that have become routine. It has left the NHS planning for the worst, but hoping for the best.

"A&E visits in England have halved since the coronavirus outbreak started, dropping to their lowest level since records began. Before the pandemic, about two million patients a month were visiting A&E but in April that dropped to 916,581. NHS bosses are concerned seriously ill patients are being put off seeking treatment. Drops in cancer referrals and routine operations were also seen as services were scaled back and staff redeployed. Health experts said it could take months to get the NHS back to normal and tackle the backlog. The drop in A&E visits - to just above 900,000 in April - was the lowest since records began in 2010. Before the coronavirus outbreak, more than 2.1 million patients a month were visiting A&E. In March that dropped to 1.53 million. There is particular concern that patients who have suffered strokes and heart problems have stayed away because of fears over coronavirus. NHS England clinical director for stroke Dr Deb Lowe said she and her fellow doctors were ""really worried"" that the numbers seeking help for stroke care had gone down. Breast screening is just one of many ways of detecting cancer Data for other areas lags a month behind - so for routine treatments and cancer care NHS England has only been able to publish the data for March. Lockdown was announced in late March. GPs made 181,873 urgent cancer referrals during March - down from 196,425 on the same month in 2019. The number of patients admitted for routine surgery and treatment, such as knee and hip operations, dropped by a third to 207,754, down from 305,356 in March 2019. Hospitals were told to start stopping routine care to free up beds for the coronavirus peak. At the end of last month Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged hospitals to re-start routine treatments - guidance has now been updated advising patients to isolate for two weeks before going in for surgery What protective gear do NHS staff need? Are these seven targets being hit? Who am I allowed to meet now? Where should people wear face coverings? Meanwhile, community services have had to be scaled back as staff have been redeployed and face-to-face contact has had to be restricted. Health visitors, for example, have been having to carry out most of their consultations with new mothers via phone or using video technology. Macmillan Cancer Support chief executive Lynda Thomas said despite urgent cancer care being prioritised during the lockdown, services were still affected, while she fears some patients were put off seeking help. ""Cancer must not become the forgotten 'C' in this pandemic."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Three leading think tanks - the Nuffield Trust, King's Fund and Health Foundation - said restoring services was going to take time. They warned staff were exhausted because they had been working flat out and needed time to recover. The availability of protective kit, such as aprons and goggles, would need to be improved and expanded, while changes would need to be made to allow for social distancing and extra cleaning. What is more, capacity would still need to be set aside for a second peak. HOSPITAL SPECIAL:The human stories behind the headlines JESSE LINGARD'S HOME WORKOUT:Can you keep up? The NHS is expected to use the space at the 10 field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - to provide some of this. Only two of them are currently being used. Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards said: ""With the virus still at large there is no easy route back to the way things were before.

"There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic Cancer care in England has faced major disruption during the pandemic with big drops in numbers being seen following urgent referrals by GPs, figures show. The number of people being assessed by a cancer doctor after referral fell to 79,500 in April - a drop of 60% compared to the same month last year. Meanwhile, patients starting treatment dropped to 10,800 - 20% below 2019. The NHS said it had tried to protect services - and some of the impact was due to people not seeking treatment. NHS England said a number of innovative approaches were being introduced to keep cancer care running. This has included delivering more chemotherapy in the community and people's homes as well as creating ""Covid-free"" wings in hospital to protect patients. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said staff had gone to ""great lengths"" to deliver care. And he urged people to come forward for treatment amid concerns fear of the virus is deterring people from seeking help. Figures for elsewhere in the UK have not been published yet. Cancer patients are missing out on appointments and treatments during the epidemic Charities warned the disruption to services would have a devastating effect. As well as the drop in referrals and treatment starting, Cancer Research UKestimates that there will be a backlog of more than two million people waiting for screening across the UK. Thousands of patients have also seen their on-going treatment stopped. Baroness Delyth Morgan, of Breast Cancer Now, said her charity has been deluged with calls from people worried about not getting treatment. ""It is extremely concerning,"" she said. Lynda Thomas, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the pandemic had ""wreaked havoc"" on services. ""Many people with cancer are being left to wait for next steps in fear, worrying about the long-term implications for their health, their families and their future."" Joanne Addis has seen her treatment for breast cancer stopped Joanne Addis, 54, from Stockport, was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in 2017 only weeks after having surgery for primary breast cancer. She has been given a drug called palbociclib ever since to slow down the cancer, but her treatment had to be stopped in April because it left her susceptible to coronavirus. ""I wasn't happy. It has kept my cancer stable for three years. I try not to think what will happen. ""There are a lot of people like me who've had to pause their cancer treatment and not all of us will have good results at the end of this. ""I'm just hoping that the risk of coronavirus drops low enough soon so I can restart my treatment."" In England - and elsewhere in the UK for that matter - NHS bosses have sought new ways to deliver cancer care. ""Covid-free"" wings have been set up in hospitals to allow cancer patients to be treated. These have been organised by 21 cancer hubs in England with lead cancer hospitals helping to coordinate care. For example, in London this has been done by the Royal Marsden, Guy's and St Thomas' and University College London Hospitals. There has also been a focus on delivering care in the community and people's homes - with ""chemo-buses"" used in some places to allow staff to tour neighbourhoods providing chemotherapy from the back of an adapted van. A targeted form of radiotherapy has also been rolled out, which requires fewer courses of treatment meaning patients do not have to visit hospital so often. The figures published also include data for A&E and routine operations. Routine operations were cancelled en-masse during April to help free up space for the expected surge of coronavirus patients. Just 41,000 underwent surgery - down from 280,000 in April 2019. Routine work is now in the process of being re-started, although NHS bosses have said thewaiting list could more than double in size by the start of next yearas hospitals are struggling to get back to full capacity because of the strain of dealing with the pandemic. The A&E data is more recent - it covers the month of May. It shows 1.26m people visit A&E - down from 2.17m in May 2020. But it the numbers did represent an increase from just over 900,000 in April. Doctors have urged patients needing urgent help to come to A&E.

Thanks for joining us, we hope to see you again on Friday. Today's contributors were Mal Siret, Joshua Nevett, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley. If you're just catching up, here's an overview of today's headlines from the UK and around the world. In the UK:  Elsewhere around the world:    We've just got some more information on the extension of restrictions in Northern Ireland. Close contact services including hair and beauty salons and driving lessons will reopen for appointments only on Friday, 20 November. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on that date. Northern Ireland's executive has said this will not include the purchase or consumption of alcohol on such premises. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November. Our story here will continue to be updated. Emily Ashton, from Bloomberg, asks the final set of questions. She first asks Powis: Lockdown
will end 2 December, is that the right thing to do given the rise in cases? She also asks Sharma: Can you categorically say that the
supply of the vaccine wonât be affected by Brexit disruption? Powis replies that that is ""a matter for our elected representatives"" but âwe will not be going back completely to normalâ after lockdown. âExactly what those measures are [after lockdown] itâs too early to say yet,â
he says. âWe need to see what transpires over the next few weeks.â Sharma says the government has been preparing for Brexit, including investing hundreds of
millions of pounds in border infrastructure. He says the key message is that businesses ""do need to be prepared"", adding that information for them is
available on the .gov website. All bars and restaurants in England have had to close for four weeks Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday,the executive has agreed. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if the government is considering compulsory vaccination. He also wants to know if there will be a certification system so people can prove they have had the vaccine. Alok Sharma begins his reply by emphasizing that the vaccines will only be rolled out if they are safe and effective. ""Then of course we will follow the advice we get from the scientists and experts,"" he adds. ""We are good at vaccinations in this country,"" says Stephen Powis. He says he believes the public has confidence in the vaccine programme and will come forward to get it. Jane Merrick from the i raises public concern about the deployment of a vaccine and has another question about the prevalence of the virus in the north west: was the tiered system enough to have an impact there? Sharma says a plan for deployment of a vaccine will be set out and that the government will continue to communicate with people on the issue. Powis says he is âconfidentâ that the tiered
system has had an effect on the transmission of the virus and the number of
infections. In Liverpool âwe are beginning to see some of the effects of
tier three,â he says. But we will not see the benefits of national restrictions
until next week, he adds. Sam Coates from Sky asks if failure to strike a trade deal with the EU would make any difference to the sourcing of vaccines. Stephen Powis says the NHS has been preparing for the UK's exit from the EU ""for some time"". He adds that the focus is on getting the vaccines to those who need it. Alok Sharma praises the work of the vaccine taskforce, noting that it has secured 350 million vaccines ""across six of the most promising vaccine candidates"". Dan Hewitt from ITV asks about the resignation of Boris Johnson's top aideamid news of infighting in No 10during a pandemic. He directs a second question to Prof Powis, asking whether he regrets stopping routine surgery in the
first wave Sharma says: âAll of us in government are focused on one thing, which is protecting lives and livelihoods.â He goes on to say they have protected ""millions of jobs"" through schemes such as furlough. Prof Powis says at the start of the pandemic in March infection
rates and hospitalisations were ""rising incredibly rapidly"" and testing was more limited. It was ""absolutely critical we had to create capacity in the NHS
not knowing how large it would be and not knowing how the public would respond
to measures"", he says. It ""was right we ensured the NHS was ready for that"". He adds: ""Of course we donât want to step down elective surgery... That is why in the second wave this autumn we havenât done
that."" Lee Cain has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks if there is concern about today's dramatic jump in infections. Stephen Powis says it is important to look at a range of data not just the numbers for a single day. However, he adds that it is clear that infections are rising - and emphasises the importance of complying with restrictions. Sophie also asks if Brexit will affect the supply chain for the vaccine. Alok Sharma says the government has been working with businesses to make sure they are prepared for 31 December, when the UK leaves the Brexit transition period. The second question is from Laura from Sheffield, who asks that if the national lockdown restrictions end on 2 December, do we go
back to the tier our area was in? Sharma says the government has ""made it clear"" that the national
restrictions ""will come to an end"" on 2 December and England ""will move back to tiered
system"". He says it's important to continue to follow the rules to stop the spread of the virus. ""As we get to 2 December the prime minister will set out more details,"" he
says. We now turn to questions, and Chris asks how the vaccine will be rolled out. Alok Sharma says people will understand that the government wants to make sure that those most at risk get the vaccine first. Stephen Powis says GPs and pharmacies are well prepared and adds that they are also looking at vaccination centres. He says he will say more in the coming weeks once we know more about the vaccine. He adds that he is ""confident the NHS will be up to this huge logistical challenge"". Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for England, says the number of patients in hospital with coronavirus ""is
still rising"". ""As we know, that number will unfortunately continue to rise if
the infection rates continue to increase in communities,"" he says. He says the news this week about a potential vaccine is ""extremely
encouraging"" and is ""welcome news"". ""But the vaccine is not here yet,"" he warns. ""That is why it is vital we continue to follow all the guidelines."" Alok Sharma welcomes this week's positive progress on the Pfizer vaccine, but warns ""we still have a lot of hurdles to come"". He urges the public to continue following the guidance. ""The virus is still there, it is still a danger,"" he says. Turning to the economic situation, Sharma says the government will be ""distributing Â£2.2bn to local authorities tomorrow to allow them to make vital grant payments to businesses affected"". ""These measures are designed to help business stay afloat,"" he says. He adds that the government's Kickstart scheme has created 19,000 jobs. It is ""a ray of hope for young people"" he says. Travellers from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar and the Turks and Caicos islands will no longer have to self-isolate when they arrive to the UK after 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Current coronavirus restrictions mean that only people with valid reasons are supposed to travel abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Greece will be removed from the travel corridor list, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos. From 04:00 on Saturday travellers to the UK from this destination will need to self-isolate. He added that the travel ban on Denmark will be extended for a further 14 days. Alok Sharma begins by going through the coronavirus figures. He says the average number of positive Covid tests is 22,524 compared to 22,398 a week ago. He also says the average number of Covid patients in hospital is 14,196 across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago. ""This is a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus,"" he says. Business Secretary Alok Sharma and the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, have arrived for today's press conference. We'll bring you all the news as it comes. We are expecting a government press conference to start shortly, and could hear questions on both the state of the NHS and the economy. Todayfigures revealed that NHS waiting lists have grownsince Covid struck, with nearly 140,000 people waiting over a year for routine procedures. We've also learnt thatthe UK's economy has rebounded from recessionfollowing a six month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, and the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the pandemic. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has accused President Donald Trump of ""refusing to accept reality"" in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi told a news conference that the president and Republicans had ""ignored by delay, distortion, denial"" the impact of the health and economic crisis, which she called a ""red alert"". She said the ""devastating milestone"" of 10 million Americans infected with coronavirus had been passed, listing the dire economic consequences of that. ""And what are they doing now?,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Trump administration. ""Continuing to ignore in spite of these numbers that should be so compelling. ""Every kind of avoidance of taking responsibility has been witnessed. They're engaged in an absurd circus right now, refusing to accept reality."" Trump maintains that he has handled the pandemic well, arguing that his administration has provided ample medical equipment and accelerated the development of treatments. Allow Twitter content?

"Lee Cain arrived for work on Thursday, having already handed in his notice to No 10 One of Boris Johnson's closest aides, director of communications Lee Cain, has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street. He will leave next month, despite being offered a promotion to chief of staff. His departure prompted speculation about the future of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, but the BBC was told he would stay for now. No 10 denied Mr Johnson had been distracted by the saga, saying he was ""fully focussed"" on tackling Covid. Mr Cain has been at the PM's side since he was a press officer for the Vote Leave campaign under Mr Cummings. Many will not have heard of him before the story broke, but his resignation comes at a time when the government is facing big decisions over its coronavirus strategy and the future of post-Brexit trade with the EU. After a number of rows and U-turns within government in recent months, No 10 will see communications as key in connecting with the country and trying to gain support for its decisions. No 10 exit much more than a random resignation Newscast: Cain quits No 10 The news that Mr Cain - who worked with Mr Cummings and the PM in the Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU - could become Mr Johnson's chief of staff had led to consternation among some MPs and ministers, said BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. One Tory source even suggested that Mr Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds - a former head of communications for the Conservatives - had misgivings about that plan. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio: ""This is pathetic. I think millions of people will be waking up this morning, scratching their heads, saying what on earth is going on? ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we're all worried about our health and our families, we're all worried about our jobs, and this lot are squabbling behind the door of No 10. Pull yourselves together, focus on the job in hand."" But the PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson was concentrating on fighting coronavirus, adding: ""You can see the progress we are making, in terms of rolling out mass testing, in securing vaccines and also in terms of making improvements to test and trace."" Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said there was also a ""complete focus in government on making sure we can work with business and work with citizens in order to deliver on the promise of Brexit"". This is much more than a random resignation. Lee Cain was Boris Johnson's longest serving aide in No 10 and very close to his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. Arguments and rivalry in any Downing Street operation are not unusual. This feels different though, perhaps the final act of Vote Leave is playing out after months of building tensions. One insider - who until now has kept their counsel - spoke out in frustration last night, saying: ""I just can't describe to you how much of a mess it is."" This is about who is running the country and the prime minister's ability to manage his own operation. The question now is whether the chaos that has spilled into public spirals into something more serious, or whether it is the chance for a reset the prime minister requires. Allies of Mr Cain were unhappy about how he had been treated, which prompted initial speculation about Mr Cummings's own future. Mr Cummings and Mr Cain are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum. Mr Cain, who is set to step down next month, will be replaced as the director of communications by James Slack - a former journalist and one of the PM's spokesmen. Mr Johnson is thought to be looking to fill the post of chief of staff as part of a wider reorganisation, which will also see ex-BBC journalist Allegra Stratton take on a role fronting new daily televised press briefings. Lee Cain spent time as a journalist before entering No 10 - including a stint following David Cameron around dressed as a chicken Lee Cain, 39, went to Ormskirk Grammar School in Lancashire and Staffordshire University, before starting a career in journalism in 2006 as the Abbeymead and Abbeydale patch reporter for the Gloucester Citizen He worked briefly at the Sun and the Mail on Sunday and then joined the Daily Mirror - where he spent time during the 2010 election campaignfollowing Conservative leader David Cameron dressed as a chicken Later, he became a member of the communications team for the Vote Leave campaign, and worked as a special adviser for Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office He also worked for Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs In his resignation statement, Mr Cain said it had been a privilege to work for Mr Johnson, but he added: ""After careful consideration I have this evening resigned as No 10 director of communications and will leave the post at the end of the year. In response, Mr Johnson thanked Mr Cain for his ""extraordinary service"" to him, calling him a ""true ally and friend"". But several Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the wrangling in Downing Street, which comes at a time of growing unease on the government's own benches over its handling of the pandemic - especially the use of lockdown measures. This video can not be played Gove: Government focused on delivering for British people Charles Walker, the vice chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there has been ""unhappiness about the No 10 operation for some time"". He added: ""Members of Parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that's no secret. ""The real opportunity here is for the chief of staff position to be filled by someone who has good links with the Conservative Party and its representation in the House of Commons."" Fellow Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale said it was ""very worrying indeed"" that No 10 ""consider it proper to devote this amount of energy to internal squabbles"" in the midst of a pandemic and Brexit trade negotiations. He told BBC News: ""We really do need people there with their minds on the job. It really is time that Downing Street got in place, what I think is now in common parlance is known as somebody with big boy pants on. ""A prime minister, particularly one facing the difficulties that Mr Johnson is facing, needs heavyweight help.""

"Soldiers have helped with a city-wide trial in Liverpool, as one of several ways the government has ramped up coronavirus testing A record 33,470 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK government's latest daily figure. It is the highest daily number reported in the UK, although testing capacity has increased greatly since the first wave of the epidemic. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to more than 1.29 million. Government minister Alok Sharma said rising case numbers were ""a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus"". On Wednesday the UK became the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 Covid deaths, based on government figures. On Thursday, a further 563 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, down from Wednesday's figure of 595. Other ways to measure deaths, such as the number of people whose death certificates mention Covid-19, have put the overall toll at more than 60,000. UK coronavirus death toll passes 50,000 Mainland Greece back on UK's quarantine list Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? Thursday'sdaily number of cases,externalshowed a 45.8% increase on Wednesday's figure of 22,950. BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher said the spike in cases could have been driven by changes in people's behaviour in the run-up to England's four-week national lockdown, which began on 5 November but was announced on 31 October. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""The majority of cases reported today were from tests carried out on 9 and 10 November, which includes infections acquired in the days leading up to new measures on 5 November. ""Limiting contact with others will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love,"" she said. Dr Doyle added that the highest rate of infections continues to be seen in the younger generations, but is ""worryingly"" rising quickly in those aged over 80, who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill. In parts of England in the lower tiers of Covid restrictions, pubs remained open until the national lockdown began on 5 November NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis played down the jump in cases, telling a Downing Street press conference it was important to ""not just take one day in isolation"". But he added: ""It is clear that infection rates have been going up. What is really important is to get those infection rates down."" The Department of Health and Social Care said ""daily fluctuations"" can happen in the daily figures ""so it is important to avoid drawing conclusions from one day's figures"". ""We must instead focus on the wider trend which is increasing, particularly in those at highest risk of disease,"" it said, adding it was ""vital"" the public continued to follow the guidance to stop the spread of the virus. Experts have previously warned against describing the daily figure as a record because there was no widespread testing programme during the first wave of the epidemic. Reading too much into one day's data is dangerous. But there is no getting away from the fact the jump in positive cases is worrying. We've not seen this kind of jump before - it is both 10,000 above Wednesday's figure and the current rolling average. It's unclear why this is. The government says there was no backlog of tests that were processed, which could have explained it. The mass testing in Liverpool is not thought to be feeding into the figure yet. The number of tests processed has gone up, but that has happened previously without returning such a high number of positive cases. An increase in socialising last week ahead of lockdown could be a factor. Whatever the cause, the hope is it's a one-off blip. Cases had been pretty stable for a fortnight before this. And there was growing hope next week would see figures falling as the impact of lockdown takes effect. The next few days will be crucial. Despite the UK-wide rise in cases, the average number of new cases every day is no longer rising in Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said recent measures, including the introduction of a new five-tier system of rules for different areas,have slowed the spread of the virus ""very significantly"". However, latest figures showthere are more patients in hospitals in Wales with Covid-19than at any other time - including during the peak of the first wave of the epidemic earlier this year. Meanwhile, tighter Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland - which have been in place since 16 October - will be extended for one more week,the executive has agreed. Mass testing - where a huge proportion of the population is tested for Covid, whether or not people have symptoms - has been touted as a way to allow people to live a more normal life, and even to help avoid future lockdowns. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised a ""massive expansion"" in such testing in the UK. Liverpool has been the first city to trial this, with all residents and workers in the city being offered a test. Mr Johnson has urged all of the city's 500,000 residents to take part, in an attempt to drive the spread of the disease down. Earlier this week some 23,000 people had been tested as part of the trial -which saw Anfield football stadium become one of 18 test centres- with 154 people testing positive.

LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? As the number of daily cases jumped on Thursday, Prof Powis also warned of an increasing number of people needing hospital treatment for Covid-19. He told the Downing Street briefing there were now more than 12,700 people in hospital with coronavirus in England - up from 3,827 a month ago.

Read our full story here Twitter says that approximately 300,000 ""disputed and potentially misleading"" tweets had additional context added to them in the two-week period around the election, according to a report it released today. That represents some 0.2% of all election-related tweets sent during their study. Around 450 tweets were subjected to further censoring, with warning labels applied and restrictions about how they could be shared. The report,externalfocused on tweets sent from 27 October to 11 November. As you're probably aware, dozens of Trump tweets (including those claiming he had won re-election) were flagged under the Twitter rules that were temporarily put in place for the election. Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said. The analysis comes as Twitter begins to roll back some of their election-time restrictions. Donald Trump has issued an order banning American investments in Chinese firms the government determines have ties to the Chinese military. Inthe order,,externalTrump accused China of ""increasingly exploiting"" US investors ""to finance the development and modernisation of its military"". The ban is to go into effect in January. It could affect some of China's biggest publicly-listed firms, including China Telecom and tech firm Hikvision. Throughout his administration, Trump has made efforts to disentangle the US from its close economic ties with China.

The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern. Read more here With just two weeks until Thanksgiving, the mayor of Chicago has issued a month-long advisory for residents to stay at home, warning that 1,000 more people could die in the city by the end of the year if no action is taken to stop the spread of coronavirus. Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

"Helga Wauters said she would ""regret this death [her] entire life"" A Belgian anaesthetist has been jailed for three years after a British woman died following a botched emergency Caesarean. Helga Wauters, 51, was also banned from practising following a court hearing in France on Thursday. She was found guilty of manslaughter over the death of 28-year-old Xynthia Hawke in 2014. Wauters pushed a breathing tube into Ms Hawke's oesophagus instead of her windpipe, investigators said. She was under the influence of alcohol during the procedure. Wauters did not appear in court on Thursday. Ms Hawke's partner, meanwhile, travelled to attend the proceedings in the French city of Pau. Ms Hawke was admitted to Orthez hospital near Pau in September 2014. She was given an epidural by Wauters, but problems occurred during the birth which meant an emergency Caesarean was needed. Wauters, a chronic alcoholic, admitted being an alcoholic who started ""every day"" drinking vodka and water. She also said she had a glass of wine before she was called back to the hospital for the Caesarean. Witnesses reported smelling alcohol on her when she returned. When she was taken into custody, the alcohol content in her blood was 2.38 grams per litre, or the equivalent of around 10 glasses of wine. Xynthia Hawke's family attended a court hearing last month The 51-year-old was less than two weeks into the job when she inserted the breathing tube incorrectly. She also allegedly used an oxygen mask instead of a ventilator. Ms Hawke, who is from Somerset in the UK, woke up during the operation and began vomiting and shouting ""it hurts"", witnesses said. One nurse told the court the scene was like a war zone. She suffered a cardiac arrest and died four days after the procedure, but her baby boy survived. But Wauters denied being solely responsible for the death and insisted other staff were to blame. She claimed the ventilator was not working at the time - but investigators found this to be untrue. On Thursday, the court ordered her to pay almost 1.4 million euros (Â£1.25m; $1.65m) in damages to Ms Hawke's family. ""Justice has set an example for this type of doctor who, in my eyes, is not a doctor,"" her partner Yannick Balthazar said. Wauters moved to France after she was fired from her job at a Belgian hospital for being under the influence of alcohol. The recruitment company that hired her did not check her credentials or disciplinary record, investigators said. ""I recognise now that my addiction was incompatible with my job,"" Ms Wauters said during an earlier hearing, according to the AFP news agency. ""I will regret this death my entire life.""

"Black people are twice as likely as white people to catch the coronavirus, a study of 18 million people suggests. The research also indicates Asian people are 1.5 times more likely than white people to be infected - and may be more likely to need intensive care. Researchers say their findings are of ""urgent public-health importance"" and raise questions about how vaccines will be prioritised within at-risk groups. The work, inEClinical Medicine,external, adds support to other studies' findings. There has beenmounting evidencepeople belonging to ethnic minorities are at greater risk from Covid-19. But whether the risks centre around a higher likelihood of catching the disease or of developing more severe illness from the virus is not fully understood. The researchers at the universities of Leicester and Nottingham looked at data from eight UK and 42 US studies. Some tentative evidence suggests Asian people may be at higher risk of death than other groups, they found. But lead researcher Dr Manish Pareek said there was little evidence the risks were driven by genetic factors. People belonging to ethnic minorities were more likely to work in front-line roles and live in large households with several generations, he added. This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? Fellow lead researcher Dr Shirley Sze said: ""The clear evidence of increased risk of infection among ethnic minority groups is of urgent public health importance. ""We must work to minimise exposure to the virus in these at-risk groups by facilitating their timely access to healthcare resources and target the social and structural disparities that contribute to health inequalities."" The researchers suggest ""racism and structural discrimination may also contribute to an increased risk of worse clinical outcomes within ethnic minority communities"". It comes after a scientific adviser to the governmentpreviously suggested racism did not explain the increased riskto people belonging to ethnic minorities. Dr Raghib Ali, speaking last month at a briefing on a government report about Covid disparities, said ethnicity should no longer be used to judge whether people were at greater risk from the virus.

Biden has expressed condolences to the families and friends of five American peacekeepers who died in a helicopter crash in Egypt's Sinai peninsula earlier on Thursday. In a tweet, the US president-elect also wished ""a speedy recovery"",externalto one US national who survived the crash.

An investigation is now under way into what caused the crash. Read our full story here Twitter says that approximately 300,000 ""disputed and potentially misleading"" tweets had additional context added to them in the two-week period around the election, according to a report it released today. That represents some 0.2% of all election-related tweets sent during their study. Around 450 tweets were subjected to further censoring, with warning labels applied and restrictions about how they could be shared. The report,externalfocused on tweets sent from 27 October to 11 November. As you're probably aware, dozens of Trump tweets (including those claiming he had won re-election) were flagged under the Twitter rules that were temporarily put in place for the election. Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said. The analysis comes as Twitter begins to roll back some of their election-time restrictions. Donald Trump has issued an order banning American investments in Chinese firms the government determines have ties to the Chinese military. Inthe order,,externalTrump accused China of ""increasingly exploiting"" US investors ""to finance the development and modernisation of its military"". The ban is to go into effect in January. It could affect some of China's biggest publicly-listed firms, including China Telecom and tech firm Hikvision.

The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern.

Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

"Carrie Gracie (centre), pictured in 2018, received back pay and an apology from the broadcaster that year Former BBC journalist Carrie Gracie has said a report that found no unlawful pay discrimination against women at the BBC ""feels like a whitewash"". The Equalities and Human Rights Commission's investigation came after presenters like Gracie and Samira Ahmed were revealed to have been underpaid. The watchdog said the BBC didn't break the law but must ""increase transparency and rebuild trust"" with women. The BBC Women group said,externalit was ""deeply disappointed by the findings"". The commission defended its ""robust investigations"", but a statement from BBC Women, which represents female employees, said the findings ""do not reflect our experiences"". The report ""does not address the systemic issue of unequal pay suggested by the hundreds of pay increases and settlements the BBC has made to women"", the group added.

She took issue with the way the commission started by looking at 1,000 complaints from female BBC employees, whittled them down to 40, before focusing on 10. ""Seriously?"" She wrote on Twitter. ""FOLLOW THE Â£Â£ INSTEAD: #BBC forced to pay out to 100s of #bbcwomen. Moral of story: don't rely on regulator but stay strong, calm, united + JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL."" More than 500 women have been awarded rises since 2017 after making pay complaints. Gracie left the BBC in August after 33 years at the corporation. Meanwhile, earlier this yearan employment tribunal foundthat Newswatch presenter Ahmed had been paid one sixth of the amount Jeremy Vine received for doing similar work on Points of View. AndSarah Montague received a Â£400,000 settlementafter being paid less than former Radio 4 co-presenters like John Humphrys and Nick Robinson. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which launched its investigation in March 2019, said the BBC accepted that ""its historical practices were not fit for purpose and has made significant changes since 2015"". BBC director general Tim Davie pledged to implement the report's recommendations, saying: ""We have to work even harder to be best in class."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed (right) won an equal pay case against the BBC in January EHRC interim chair Caroline Waters said it was ""easy to see why trust between some women at the BBC and the organisation has broken down"". She said: ""Many women felt their voices were not being heard and have been left feeling confused as to how decisions about their pay have been made. ""This took a heavy emotional toll on those involved in the process and the strength of feeling of women at the BBC should not be understated. ""While we have not found any unlawful acts in our investigation, repairing the damage caused by these issues requires continued leadership and we hope the BBC board takes forward our recommendations."" How to know if you're getting equal pay Asked why the EHRC found no unlawful pay discrimination despite the high-profile cases, Suzanne Baxter, who led the investigation, explained: ""Our work here has been carried out under the equality act, and has a different remit to an employment tribunal. ""I do understand why there might be some surprise. Our investigation is broader, we're gathering every piece of evidence we can, which isn't always available to a tribunal. ""We think we've done robust investigations. The important thing here is the recommendations we make."" EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath added that ""we're looking at overarching systems, whereas employment tribunals look at a specific case"". She said they did find ""real concerns about the overall processes which led to concerns about trust and transparency"", and acknowledged that ""this is about real lives [of the women] at the centre of this investigation"". She added: ""We talked to them, they had gone though humiliation, anxiety, insomnia, were signed off work. One woman waited 370 days, another woman was passed between eight people in 10 months. These are real people having a terrible time."" Ms Baxter said she was ""very confident our recommendations will make a difference to women going forward"". The recommendations include better record keeping and a more transparent grievance process that it is done within a ""reasonable time limit"". The BBC has also been told to continue improving training and guidance for BBC staff making decisions about pay, and reviewing pay frameworks regularly. Tim Davie replaced Tony Hall as director general of the BBC in September Welcoming the report, Mr Davie said: ""Trust is vitally important and as an organisation that serves the public, the BBC must continue to lead the way on pay transparency and fairness. We are committed to building a truly inclusive culture. ""We agree with the Commission that we should continue to deliver on our reform programme which began in 2015. We accept every one of their recommendations and will implement them."" But the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said the report was not based on ""robust research"" because the ""strongest cases"" of pay discrimination were not properly examined. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said many members would feel the report ""doesn't address their lived experiences"" and there were ""still vital changes that need to take place"". Broadcasting union Bectu said the report ""highlights the importance of transparency in pay and terms and conditions"" and there are ""still improvements to be made, particularly in relation to pay progression"". Differences between men and women were exposed whenthe corporation published its first star salaries listin 2017. Only two of the top 14 earners were women, and men made up about two-thirds of the overall list. The corporation said most of the 500 salary increases rises awarded to women since 2017 related to the issue of fair pay rather than equal pay, and that 99% of pay queries had now been resolved. Four equal pay cases are still going through the tribunal process, with three more being dealt with by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas).

"NÃ³ra Quoirin was reported missing a day after the family had arrived at the resort The feet of a British girl who was found dead in the Malaysian jungle were not in a state to suggest she had been on the move for days, an inquest heard. NÃ³ra Quoirin, from London, was discovered dead nine days after she was reported missing on 4 August 2019. Her father Sebastien told a court he noticed her feet were ""dirty"" but ""didn't seem to be particularly damaged"" when he identified her body. He said he also saw that some of the fences around the resort were broken. NÃ³ra's family, from Balham, were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur. The 15-year-old was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. She was reported missing the day after they arrived and was eventually found less than two miles from the holiday home. The 15-year-old was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development Speaking via video-link, Mr Quoirin said he had spotted her feet as he went to identify her body for the second time to authorise an autopsy. He told Seremban Coroner's Court they ""didn't seem to be particularly damaged, in fact they seemed just dirty"" and questioned how that could be possible since the police had suggested that she had been ""on the move for seven days"". ""How was that compatible with the state of Nora's feet?"" he said. The 48-year-old said the family had been ""super excited"" to be going on a ""big adventure"", although the trip was not a novelty for NÃ³ra as they had spent time in Singapore and Bali two years earlier. Mr Quoirin told the court he saw some of the perimeter fences of the resort were broken and had fallen to the ground as he went for a walk after they had arrived. The inquest heard that after the family had gone to bed that night, Mr Quoirin was woken by noises from a nearby chalet where they ""seemed to be having a party"". He said he later heard a ""muffled noise"" coming from the chalet but he had been ""half asleep"" and ""couldn't describe what exactly that noise was"". Mr Quoirin said he woke at 07:00 the next day and left the room at 08:00 to check on his daughter. He climbed up a staircase to the mezzanine level where NÃ³ra was sharing a bed with her sister Innes, but when he looked at the bed NÃ³ra's side was empty. Innes explained to her father she had noticed NÃ³ra was not in the bed earlier when she went downstairs to the toilet but she had assumed the 15-year-old was with her parents ""having a cuddle"", the court heard. Mr Quoirin said he ""very quickly... realised something very dramatic was in front of us"" and immediately began searching the area, including out of a back gate which he described as ""porous"" and something that ""anyone could walk through it"". Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra Mr Quoirin said he and his wife realised their daughter's shoes were still there so believed she must not have gone far due to the difficulty of the surrounding terrain. They also noticed the kitchen window was open, the inquest heard. He said the resort's owner went to the local police station to report that NÃ³ra was missing and he followed two hours later but when he arrived he found officers ""did not realise the seriousness of the problem"". He described how at about 15:00 a police officer with a dog came to the resort but ""the dog wasn't fit for purpose"" and ""after two minutes it was exhausted and couldn't do the job properly"". He added that he felt the police had not done enough to search for Nora during those ""precious hours"". Mr Quoirin told the court his daughter ""had no survival instinct"" and she would have been unable to cope with the ""dense and slippery"" terrain to get to the spot where she was eventually found. He also said it was ""impossible"" that she had opened or climbed out of the kitchen window, adding that it ""would be totally out of character for her to do that"". The inquest continues.

The 48-year-old said the family had been ""super excited"" to be going on a ""big adventure"", although the trip was not a novelty for NÃ³ra as they had spent time in Singapore and Bali two years earlier. Mr Quoirin told the court he saw some of the perimeter fences of the resort were broken and had fallen to the ground as he went for a walk after they had arrived. The inquest heard that after the family had gone to bed that night, Mr Quoirin was woken by noises from a nearby chalet where they ""seemed to be having a party"". He said he later heard a ""muffled noise"" coming from the chalet but he had been ""half asleep"" and ""couldn't describe what exactly that noise was"". Mr Quoirin said he woke at 07:00 the next day and left the room at 08:00 to check on his daughter. He climbed up a staircase to the mezzanine level where NÃ³ra was sharing a bed with her sister Innes, but when he looked at the bed NÃ³ra's side was empty. Innes explained to her father she had noticed NÃ³ra was not in the bed earlier when she went downstairs to the toilet but she had assumed the 15-year-old was with her parents ""having a cuddle"", the court heard. Mr Quoirin said he ""very quickly... realised something very dramatic was in front of us"" and immediately began searching the area, including out of a back gate which he described as ""porous"" and something that ""anyone could walk through it"". Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra Mr Quoirin said he and his wife realised their daughter's shoes were still there so believed she must not have gone far due to the difficulty of the surrounding terrain. They also noticed the kitchen window was open, the inquest heard. He said the resort's owner went to the local police station to report that NÃ³ra was missing and he followed two hours later but when he arrived he found officers ""did not realise the seriousness of the problem"". He described how at about 15:00 a police officer with a dog came to the resort but ""the dog wasn't fit for purpose"" and ""after two minutes it was exhausted and couldn't do the job properly"". He added that he felt the police had not done enough to search for Nora during those ""precious hours"". Mr Quoirin told the court his daughter ""had no survival instinct"" and she would have been unable to cope with the ""dense and slippery"" terrain to get to the spot where she was eventually found. He also said it was ""impossible"" that she had opened or climbed out of the kitchen window, adding that it ""would be totally out of character for her to do that"". The inquest continues.

"Black people are twice as likely as white people to catch the coronavirus, a study of 18 million people suggests. The research also indicates Asian people are 1.5 times more likely than white people to be infected - and may be more likely to need intensive care. Researchers say their findings are of ""urgent public-health importance"" and raise questions about how vaccines will be prioritised within at-risk groups. The work, inEClinical Medicine,external, adds support to other studies' findings. There has beenmounting evidencepeople belonging to ethnic minorities are at greater risk from Covid-19. But whether the risks centre around a higher likelihood of catching the disease or of developing more severe illness from the virus is not fully understood. The researchers at the universities of Leicester and Nottingham looked at data from eight UK and 42 US studies. Some tentative evidence suggests Asian people may be at higher risk of death than other groups, they found. But lead researcher Dr Manish Pareek said there was little evidence the risks were driven by genetic factors. People belonging to ethnic minorities were more likely to work in front-line roles and live in large households with several generations, he added. This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? Fellow lead researcher Dr Shirley Sze said: ""The clear evidence of increased risk of infection among ethnic minority groups is of urgent public health importance. ""We must work to minimise exposure to the virus in these at-risk groups by facilitating their timely access to healthcare resources and target the social and structural disparities that contribute to health inequalities."" The researchers suggest ""racism and structural discrimination may also contribute to an increased risk of worse clinical outcomes within ethnic minority communities"". It comes after a scientific adviser to the governmentpreviously suggested racism did not explain the increased riskto people belonging to ethnic minorities. Dr Raghib Ali, speaking last month at a briefing on a government report about Covid disparities, said ethnicity should no longer be used to judge whether people were at greater risk from the virus. He added focusing on all those at higher risk due to the underlying factors, such as jobs and housing, would help more people overall - from all ethnic groups. TESTING:What tests are available?

"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales in 2017-18 was the highest since records began. By 2019 youth violence was being called a ""national emergency"" with MPs calling on the government to ""get a grip"" on the crisis in the wake of a string of teenagers being killed. To find out more about what was going on behind the headlines the BBC started to track the killings across the UK in 2019, looking at the lives of the people affected. While the suggestion was that gang violence and cuts to police numbers was the problem, the BBC project highlighted a far more complicated picture. We reported on thefirst 100 victims of fatal stabbingsin 2019 which showed those killed were mostly young and male. But we also saw arise in ""invisible victims of knife crime""- those killed in incidents of domestic violence and highlighted how theexcessive use of drugs and alcoholwas a major factor in attacks across the UK. The project has now examined the first 100 killings. This includes fatal stabbings, as well as deaths caused by shooting, assault and smothering. We've identified 100 people held legally responsible for most of the deaths. In some cases, more than one killer was involved. The age range of killers is wide but more than a quarter were teenagers - 14 of them were children (under 18). Evidence in their trials revealed a pattern of abuse or neglect, mental health problems and limited educational attainment in the background of the young killers. The circumstances of each killing is varied but there are also some strikingly common themes. Many were influenced by drugs and alcohol and some impacted with serious mental health problems. But although such cases naturally grab the headlines, the violence generated by the market in illicit drugs doesn't tell the whole story. From the dozens of murder trials we followed across the country, the killings were actually more likely to be the result of rows settled under the influence of drink and drugs rather than turf wars. Most of the killers had been in trouble with the law before. Some were prolific offenders. Over a fifth of the killers had links to street gangs, illustrating why police and government prioritise tackling this to drive down serious violence. But domestic killings also feature prominently. Most of the 100 killings (66) led to criminal convictions, others went to inquests where a suspect had taken their own life after carrying out a homicide. Some trials are waiting to be heard, having been delayed by Covid-19. The 13 cases with no charges include those that went to inquests and seven which are currently unsolved. By January this year our research found thenumber of people killed across the UK actually fell in 2019for the first time in five years. It remains unclear what impact the pandemic will have on levels of violent crime in the UK but since lockdown restrictions began charities say there has beena rise in the number of people seeking help for domestic abuseand fears that higher rates of unemployment, homelessness and traumacould lead to an increase in violence, particularly among vulnerable young people.

NÃ³ra Quoirin, from London, was discovered dead nine days after she was reported missing on 4 August 2019. Her father Sebastien told a court he noticed her feet were ""dirty"" but ""didn't seem to be particularly damaged"" when he identified her body. He said he also saw that some of the fences around the resort were broken. NÃ³ra's family, from Balham, were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur. The 15-year-old was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. She was reported missing the day after they arrived and was eventually found less than two miles from the holiday home. The 15-year-old was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development Speaking via video-link, Mr Quoirin said he had spotted her feet as he went to identify her body for the second time to authorise an autopsy. He told Seremban Coroner's Court they ""didn't seem to be particularly damaged, in fact they seemed just dirty"" and questioned how that could be possible since the police had suggested that she had been ""on the move for seven days"". ""How was that compatible with the state of Nora's feet?"" he said. The 48-year-old said the family had been ""super excited"" to be going on a ""big adventure"", although the trip was not a novelty for NÃ³ra as they had spent time in Singapore and Bali two years earlier. Mr Quoirin told the court he saw some of the perimeter fences of the resort were broken and had fallen to the ground as he went for a walk after they had arrived. The inquest heard that after the family had gone to bed that night, Mr Quoirin was woken by noises from a nearby chalet where they ""seemed to be having a party"". He said he later heard a ""muffled noise"" coming from the chalet but he had been ""half asleep"" and ""couldn't describe what exactly that noise was"". Mr Quoirin said he woke at 07:00 the next day and left the room at 08:00 to check on his daughter. He climbed up a staircase to the mezzanine level where NÃ³ra was sharing a bed with her sister Innes, but when he looked at the bed NÃ³ra's side was empty. Innes explained to her father she had noticed NÃ³ra was not in the bed earlier when she went downstairs to the toilet but she had assumed the 15-year-old was with her parents ""having a cuddle"", the court heard. Mr Quoirin said he ""very quickly... realised something very dramatic was in front of us"" and immediately began searching the area, including out of a back gate which he described as ""porous"" and something that ""anyone could walk through it"". Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra Mr Quoirin said he and his wife realised their daughter's shoes were still there so believed she must not have gone far due to the difficulty of the surrounding terrain. They also noticed the kitchen window was open, the inquest heard. He said the resort's owner went to the local police station to report that NÃ³ra was missing and he followed two hours later but when he arrived he found officers ""did not realise the seriousness of the problem"". He described how at about 15:00 a police officer with a dog came to the resort but ""the dog wasn't fit for purpose"" and ""after two minutes it was exhausted and couldn't do the job properly"". He added that he felt the police had not done enough to search for Nora during those ""precious hours"". Mr Quoirin told the court his daughter ""had no survival instinct"" and she would have been unable to cope with the ""dense and slippery"" terrain to get to the spot where she was eventually found. He also said it was ""impossible"" that she had opened or climbed out of the kitchen window, adding that it ""would be totally out of character for her to do that"". The inquest continues.

"Goods for sale in The Range during lockdown Retailers and supermarkets have been accused of taking advantage of lockdown loopholes for Christmas trading while other stores remain closed. Homeware chain The Range has been encouraging consumers in England to ""Shop Christmas in-store and online"". The Plymouth-based firm - which sells groceries alongside soft furnishings and art supplies - says it's acting within the rules. But traders whose businesses are closed say some companies aren't playing fair. A competitor to The Range who didn't want to be named, told the BBC: ""It's the wild west out there. The legislation was rushed and now government has lost control, with some retailers taking liberties in a very unfair playing field."" But The Range said it was following government guidance. ""The Range is classed as an essential retailer and is complying with all aspects of government legislation and guidelines,"" a spokesman for the firm said. ""Our stores trade in a fully Covid-compliant manner, creating a safe environment for our customers and staff."" Which shops will still be open in lockdown? Advertising from The Range encourages consumers to 'shop Christmas' in-store and online Martin Coles-Evans runs a gifts and homeware store called Hargreaves & Sons in Buxton, Derbyshire. The business has been going for more than 150 years, but now he says times are ""tough"". ""Shops like ourselves, we're following the rules and we're making people stay safe so we're closed, and yet these bigger companies are trying on loopholes left, right and centre to stay open, when really they shouldn't be,"" he said. ""It does seem to be they're mopping up all the Christmas trade while we're just limping along, struggling trying to get by with some government support."" The gifts and homeware store owned by Martin Coles-Evans is closed during lockdown. The business owner says he visited a garden centre at the weekend that was also selling clothing, shoes, books, home dÃ©cor, candles and photo frames. He's written to his local MP to voice his concerns but so far he's heard nothing back. All non-essential retail stores - as well as hospitality and leisure venues - must remain closed in England from 5 November to 2 December. Toy store owner Hellen Stirling Baker was dismayed to find Lidl supermarket in Sheffield with shelves full of children's playthings, while her doors remain firmly closed. ""Lidl is stacked high with wooden toys and books. It feels like the big supermarkets are capitalising on the fact they are able to sell non-essential goods alongside their essentials, in the run up to Christmas,"" she said. Under government guidelines, Lidl is allowed to sell toys alongside essential items. Lidl says it is closely following government guidance, which states: ""A business selling a significant amount of essential retail may also continue to sell goods typically sold at non-essential retail. For example, a supermarket that sells food is not required to close off or cordon off aisles selling homeware."" ""Why is that allowed to happen?"" asks Ms Stirling Baker. ""It's definitely given the bigger supermarkets and retailers a massively unfair advantage."" Only stores that sell non-essential goods on another floor or in a different building are required to close those parts of their premises, according to the guidance. The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said the restrictions were necessary to slow the spread of coronavirus. ""These restrictions have been brought in because we have to limit social contact in order to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We recognise this continues to be a very difficult period for businesses, which is why we've confirmed that there will be a full package of financial support in place, with the furlough scheme extended and grants worth up to Â£3,000 per month for businesses legally required to close."" Toy store owner Hellen Stirling Baker says it seems 'incredibly unfair' that the supermarket chains can sell toys during lockdown But just six weeks out from Christmas, many store owners say that help doesn't go far enough to compensate business owners who've been forced to close. ""I don't think the government truly understand how retail works in the UK,"" says William Coe, who runs Coe's department store in Ipswich. ""They think if we pay their wages and give them a little towards overheads, they'll be alright. But these are key trading weeks that have massive implications for cash flow and stock and ongoing implications."" William Coe says government support doesn't go far enough for businesses closed at such a crucial time of year. Mr Coe says he understands the government is in a difficult position, ""but if you tell people they have to shut, you have to give them adequate support."" Other ""non-essential"" retailers includingbookstore owners and clothing firms have criticisedthe government's handling of the second coronavirus lockdown. James Daunt, the boss of Waterstones, told the BBC that ""arbitrary lines"" had been drawn, with smaller bookshops forced to shut, while large newsagents such as WHSmith, which sell books alongside other items, were able to stay open. But a spokesman for WHSmith said the chain isn't really benefitting from the rules, since lockdown means there are far fewer shoppers on High Streets anyway. He said the company is operating in line with government guidance, which allows newsagents and post offices to keep trading.

"The UK has recorded a record 33,470 cases in the past day - a jump of 10,520 compared with yesterday's total The government is to give councils Â£2.2bn for business grants tomorrow, Sharma says The UK's economy bounced back from recession with record growth of 15.5% in July to September - but is still 8.2% smaller than before Covid Chancellor Rishi Sunak says there are grounds for ""cautious optimism"" but a ""difficult winter"" still lies ahead Figures reveal huge growth in NHS waiting lists since Covid struck - with nearly 140,000 waiting over a year for routine procedures WHO chief warns world not to get complacent about Covid-19 as it's not yet proven how effective vaccines will be Wales has 983 Covid patients in hospitals - more than at any time including during the first wave Scotland temporarily bans alcohol from trains and stations to help social distancing - as nation's R number drops to one Northern Ireland's circuit-break lockdown will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday Spain's coronavirus death toll has surged to more than 40,000, with infections passing 1.4m Germany's health minister says he expects coronavirus restrictions there to continue through the winter The US has confirmed its highest 24-hour infection total to date â a world record of more than 144,000 cases Edited by Emma Owen We're wrapping up our live-page coverage of the pandemic for the day. Thanks for joining us, we hope to see you again on Friday. Today's contributors were Mal Siret, Joshua Nevett, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley. If you're just catching up, here's an overview of today's headlines from the UK and around the world. In the UK:  Elsewhere around the world:    We've just got some more information on the extension of restrictions in Northern Ireland. Close contact services including hair and beauty salons and driving lessons will reopen for appointments only on Friday, 20 November. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on that date. Northern Ireland's executive has said this will not include the purchase or consumption of alcohol on such premises. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November. Our story here will continue to be updated. Emily Ashton, from Bloomberg, asks the final set of questions. She first asks Powis: Lockdown
will end 2 December, is that the right thing to do given the rise in cases? She also asks Sharma: Can you categorically say that the
supply of the vaccine wonât be affected by Brexit disruption? Powis replies that that is ""a matter for our elected representatives"" but âwe will not be going back completely to normalâ after lockdown. âExactly what those measures are [after lockdown] itâs too early to say yet,â
he says. âWe need to see what transpires over the next few weeks.â Sharma says the government has been preparing for Brexit, including investing hundreds of
millions of pounds in border infrastructure. He says the key message is that businesses ""do need to be prepared"", adding that information for them is
available on the .gov website. All bars and restaurants in England have had to close for four weeks Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday,the executive has agreed. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if the government is considering compulsory vaccination. He also wants to know if there will be a certification system so people can prove they have had the vaccine. Alok Sharma begins his reply by emphasizing that the vaccines will only be rolled out if they are safe and effective. ""Then of course we will follow the advice we get from the scientists and experts,"" he adds. ""We are good at vaccinations in this country,"" says Stephen Powis. He says he believes the public has confidence in the vaccine programme and will come forward to get it. Jane Merrick from the i raises public concern about the deployment of a vaccine and has another question about the prevalence of the virus in the north west: was the tiered system enough to have an impact there? Sharma says a plan for deployment of a vaccine will be set out and that the government will continue to communicate with people on the issue. Powis says he is âconfidentâ that the tiered
system has had an effect on the transmission of the virus and the number of
infections. In Liverpool âwe are beginning to see some of the effects of
tier three,â he says. But we will not see the benefits of national restrictions
until next week, he adds. Sam Coates from Sky asks if failure to strike a trade deal with the EU would make any difference to the sourcing of vaccines. Stephen Powis says the NHS has been preparing for the UK's exit from the EU ""for some time"". He adds that the focus is on getting the vaccines to those who need it. Alok Sharma praises the work of the vaccine taskforce, noting that it has secured 350 million vaccines ""across six of the most promising vaccine candidates"". Dan Hewitt from ITV asks about the resignation of Boris Johnson's top aideamid news of infighting in No 10during a pandemic. He directs a second question to Prof Powis, asking whether he regrets stopping routine surgery in the
first wave Sharma says: âAll of us in government are focused on one thing, which is protecting lives and livelihoods.â He goes on to say they have protected ""millions of jobs"" through schemes such as furlough. Prof Powis says at the start of the pandemic in March infection
rates and hospitalisations were ""rising incredibly rapidly"" and testing was more limited. It was ""absolutely critical we had to create capacity in the NHS
not knowing how large it would be and not knowing how the public would respond
to measures"", he says. It ""was right we ensured the NHS was ready for that"". He adds: ""Of course we donât want to step down elective surgery... That is why in the second wave this autumn we havenât done
that."" Lee Cain has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks if there is concern about today's dramatic jump in infections. Stephen Powis says it is important to look at a range of data not just the numbers for a single day. However, he adds that it is clear that infections are rising - and emphasises the importance of complying with restrictions. Sophie also asks if Brexit will affect the supply chain for the vaccine. Alok Sharma says the government has been working with businesses to make sure they are prepared for 31 December, when the UK leaves the Brexit transition period. The second question is from Laura from Sheffield, who asks that if the national lockdown restrictions end on 2 December, do we go
back to the tier our area was in? Sharma says the government has ""made it clear"" that the national
restrictions ""will come to an end"" on 2 December and England ""will move back to tiered
system"". He says it's important to continue to follow the rules to stop the spread of the virus. ""As we get to 2 December the prime minister will set out more details,"" he
says. We now turn to questions, and Chris asks how the vaccine will be rolled out. Alok Sharma says people will understand that the government wants to make sure that those most at risk get the vaccine first. Stephen Powis says GPs and pharmacies are well prepared and adds that they are also looking at vaccination centres. He says he will say more in the coming weeks once we know more about the vaccine. He adds that he is ""confident the NHS will be up to this huge logistical challenge"". Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for England, says the number of patients in hospital with coronavirus ""is
still rising"". ""As we know, that number will unfortunately continue to rise if
the infection rates continue to increase in communities,"" he says. He says the news this week about a potential vaccine is ""extremely
encouraging"" and is ""welcome news"". ""But the vaccine is not here yet,"" he warns. ""That is why it is vital we continue to follow all the guidelines."" Alok Sharma welcomes this week's positive progress on the Pfizer vaccine, but warns ""we still have a lot of hurdles to come"". He urges the public to continue following the guidance. ""The virus is still there, it is still a danger,"" he says. Turning to the economic situation, Sharma says the government will be ""distributing Â£2.2bn to local authorities tomorrow to allow them to make vital grant payments to businesses affected"". ""These measures are designed to help business stay afloat,"" he says. He adds that the government's Kickstart scheme has created 19,000 jobs. It is ""a ray of hope for young people"" he says. Travellers from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar and the Turks and Caicos islands will no longer have to self-isolate when they arrive to the UK after 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Current coronavirus restrictions mean that only people with valid reasons are supposed to travel abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Greece will be removed from the travel corridor list, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos. From 04:00 on Saturday travellers to the UK from this destination will need to self-isolate. He added that the travel ban on Denmark will be extended for a further 14 days. Alok Sharma begins by going through the coronavirus figures. He says the average number of positive Covid tests is 22,524 compared to 22,398 a week ago. He also says the average number of Covid patients in hospital is 14,196 across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago. ""This is a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus,"" he says. Business Secretary Alok Sharma and the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, have arrived for today's press conference. We'll bring you all the news as it comes. We are expecting a government press conference to start shortly, and could hear questions on both the state of the NHS and the economy. Todayfigures revealed that NHS waiting lists have grownsince Covid struck, with nearly 140,000 people waiting over a year for routine procedures. We've also learnt thatthe UK's economy has rebounded from recessionfollowing a six month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, and the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the pandemic. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has accused President Donald Trump of ""refusing to accept reality"" in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi told a news conference that the president and Republicans had ""ignored by delay, distortion, denial"" the impact of the health and economic crisis, which she called a ""red alert"". She said the ""devastating milestone"" of 10 million Americans infected with coronavirus had been passed, listing the dire economic consequences of that. ""And what are they doing now?,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Trump administration. ""Continuing to ignore in spite of these numbers that should be so compelling. ""Every kind of avoidance of taking responsibility has been witnessed. They're engaged in an absurd circus right now, refusing to accept reality."" Trump maintains that he has handled the pandemic well, arguing that his administration has provided ample medical equipment and accelerated the development of treatments. Allow Twitter content?

"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales in 2017-18 was the highest since records began. By 2019 youth violence was being called a ""national emergency"" with MPs calling on the government to ""get a grip"" on the crisis in the wake of a string of teenagers being killed. To find out more about what was going on behind the headlines the BBC started to track the killings across the UK in 2019, looking at the lives of the people affected. While the suggestion was that gang violence and cuts to police numbers was the problem, the BBC project highlighted a far more complicated picture. We reported on thefirst 100 victims of fatal stabbingsin 2019 which showed those killed were mostly young and male. But we also saw arise in ""invisible victims of knife crime""- those killed in incidents of domestic violence and highlighted how theexcessive use of drugs and alcoholwas a major factor in attacks across the UK. The project has now examined the first 100 killings. This includes fatal stabbings, as well as deaths caused by shooting, assault and smothering. We've identified 100 people held legally responsible for most of the deaths. In some cases, more than one killer was involved. The age range of killers is wide but more than a quarter were teenagers - 14 of them were children (under 18). Evidence in their trials revealed a pattern of abuse or neglect, mental health problems and limited educational attainment in the background of the young killers. The circumstances of each killing is varied but there are also some strikingly common themes. Many were influenced by drugs and alcohol and some impacted with serious mental health problems. But although such cases naturally grab the headlines, the violence generated by the market in illicit drugs doesn't tell the whole story. From the dozens of murder trials we followed across the country, the killings were actually more likely to be the result of rows settled under the influence of drink and drugs rather than turf wars. Most of the killers had been in trouble with the law before. Some were prolific offenders. Over a fifth of the killers had links to street gangs, illustrating why police and government prioritise tackling this to drive down serious violence. But domestic killings also feature prominently. Most of the 100 killings (66) led to criminal convictions, others went to inquests where a suspect had taken their own life after carrying out a homicide. Some trials are waiting to be heard, having been delayed by Covid-19. The 13 cases with no charges include those that went to inquests and seven which are currently unsolved. By January this year our research found thenumber of people killed across the UK actually fell in 2019for the first time in five years. It remains unclear what impact the pandemic will have on levels of violent crime in the UK but since lockdown restrictions began charities say there has beena rise in the number of people seeking help for domestic abuseand fears that higher rates of unemployment, homelessness and traumacould lead to an increase in violence, particularly among vulnerable young people. Michael Rolle fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend Charlotte Huggins, 33, hours after she had celebrated the start of the new year. Judge Heather Norton jailed him for a minimum of 20 years and told him heâd acted in a â jealous rage no doubt fuelled by alcohol and drugs.â The Old Bailey heard that Rolle, 34, had previous convictions and cautions for violence and drugs. Ashey Martin started a house fire in which he and two others died. An inquest heard that had he survived, he would have been charged with the murders of Jay Edmunds and Billy Hicks.

Michael McConville, 38, was convicted of the murder of fellow Salvation Army hostel resident David Capseed, 57, in January 2019. Judge Andrew Menary QC said McConville had struggled with the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and was desperate for drugs. He killed Mr Capseed because he believed he had cheated him.

A jury at the Old Bailey heard how he hadnât dealt with the loss of his stillborn son Romeo in 2018. Pencille had a previous conviction for stabbing a flatmate in the neck over a disagreement about cigarette papers. Khalid Ashraf, 32, admitted choking his sister, Sarah Ashraf, 35,  to death because he said he had been told to by the devil and his Buddhist leader. The Old Bailey heard the former auditor became depressed when he learned he had HIV in 2011. He was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and detained under the Mental Health Act. He will only be released if he is deemed to be fit and no longer a risk to the public. Luc Barker was convicted of murdering his flatmate, Gavin Moon, following claims he and co-defendant Brian Goldsmith had stolen drugs belonging to the victim, who was a drug dealer. After stabbing Mr Moon with separate knives, the pair left him lying on the kitchen floor and emptied his pockets. Barker, 28, had suffered an earlier brain injury and had limited verbal comprehension, according to his lawyer. He was jailed for a minimum of 16 years. Brian Goldsmith was convicted of murdering Gavin Moon following claims that he and co-defendant Luc Barker had stolen drugs belonging to the victim, who was a drug dealer.

"The UK has recorded a record 33,470 cases in the past day - a jump of 10,520 compared with yesterday's total The government is to give councils Â£2.2bn for business grants tomorrow, Sharma says The UK's economy bounced back from recession with record growth of 15.5% in July to September - but is still 8.2% smaller than before Covid Chancellor Rishi Sunak says there are grounds for ""cautious optimism"" but a ""difficult winter"" still lies ahead Figures reveal huge growth in NHS waiting lists since Covid struck - with nearly 140,000 waiting over a year for routine procedures WHO chief warns world not to get complacent about Covid-19 as it's not yet proven how effective vaccines will be Wales has 983 Covid patients in hospitals - more than at any time including during the first wave Scotland temporarily bans alcohol from trains and stations to help social distancing - as nation's R number drops to one Northern Ireland's circuit-break lockdown will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday Spain's coronavirus death toll has surged to more than 40,000, with infections passing 1.4m Germany's health minister says he expects coronavirus restrictions there to continue through the winter The US has confirmed its highest 24-hour infection total to date â a world record of more than 144,000 cases Edited by Emma Owen We're wrapping up our live-page coverage of the pandemic for the day. Thanks for joining us, we hope to see you again on Friday. Today's contributors were Mal Siret, Joshua Nevett, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley. If you're just catching up, here's an overview of today's headlines from the UK and around the world. In the UK:  Elsewhere around the world:    We've just got some more information on the extension of restrictions in Northern Ireland. Close contact services including hair and beauty salons and driving lessons will reopen for appointments only on Friday, 20 November. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on that date. Northern Ireland's executive has said this will not include the purchase or consumption of alcohol on such premises. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November. Our story here will continue to be updated. Emily Ashton, from Bloomberg, asks the final set of questions. She first asks Powis: Lockdown
will end 2 December, is that the right thing to do given the rise in cases? She also asks Sharma: Can you categorically say that the
supply of the vaccine wonât be affected by Brexit disruption? Powis replies that that is ""a matter for our elected representatives"" but âwe will not be going back completely to normalâ after lockdown. âExactly what those measures are [after lockdown] itâs too early to say yet,â
he says. âWe need to see what transpires over the next few weeks.â Sharma says the government has been preparing for Brexit, including investing hundreds of
millions of pounds in border infrastructure. He says the key message is that businesses ""do need to be prepared"", adding that information for them is
available on the .gov website. All bars and restaurants in England have had to close for four weeks Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday,the executive has agreed. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if the government is considering compulsory vaccination. He also wants to know if there will be a certification system so people can prove they have had the vaccine. Alok Sharma begins his reply by emphasizing that the vaccines will only be rolled out if they are safe and effective. ""Then of course we will follow the advice we get from the scientists and experts,"" he adds. ""We are good at vaccinations in this country,"" says Stephen Powis. He says he believes the public has confidence in the vaccine programme and will come forward to get it. Jane Merrick from the i raises public concern about the deployment of a vaccine and has another question about the prevalence of the virus in the north west: was the tiered system enough to have an impact there? Sharma says a plan for deployment of a vaccine will be set out and that the government will continue to communicate with people on the issue. Powis says he is âconfidentâ that the tiered
system has had an effect on the transmission of the virus and the number of
infections. In Liverpool âwe are beginning to see some of the effects of
tier three,â he says. But we will not see the benefits of national restrictions
until next week, he adds. Sam Coates from Sky asks if failure to strike a trade deal with the EU would make any difference to the sourcing of vaccines. Stephen Powis says the NHS has been preparing for the UK's exit from the EU ""for some time"". He adds that the focus is on getting the vaccines to those who need it. Alok Sharma praises the work of the vaccine taskforce, noting that it has secured 350 million vaccines ""across six of the most promising vaccine candidates"". Dan Hewitt from ITV asks about the resignation of Boris Johnson's top aideamid news of infighting in No 10during a pandemic. He directs a second question to Prof Powis, asking whether he regrets stopping routine surgery in the
first wave Sharma says: âAll of us in government are focused on one thing, which is protecting lives and livelihoods.â He goes on to say they have protected ""millions of jobs"" through schemes such as furlough. Prof Powis says at the start of the pandemic in March infection
rates and hospitalisations were ""rising incredibly rapidly"" and testing was more limited. It was ""absolutely critical we had to create capacity in the NHS
not knowing how large it would be and not knowing how the public would respond
to measures"", he says. It ""was right we ensured the NHS was ready for that"". He adds: ""Of course we donât want to step down elective surgery... That is why in the second wave this autumn we havenât done
that."" Lee Cain has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks if there is concern about today's dramatic jump in infections. Stephen Powis says it is important to look at a range of data not just the numbers for a single day. However, he adds that it is clear that infections are rising - and emphasises the importance of complying with restrictions. Sophie also asks if Brexit will affect the supply chain for the vaccine. Alok Sharma says the government has been working with businesses to make sure they are prepared for 31 December, when the UK leaves the Brexit transition period. The second question is from Laura from Sheffield, who asks that if the national lockdown restrictions end on 2 December, do we go
back to the tier our area was in? Sharma says the government has ""made it clear"" that the national
restrictions ""will come to an end"" on 2 December and England ""will move back to tiered
system"". He says it's important to continue to follow the rules to stop the spread of the virus. ""As we get to 2 December the prime minister will set out more details,"" he
says. We now turn to questions, and Chris asks how the vaccine will be rolled out. Alok Sharma says people will understand that the government wants to make sure that those most at risk get the vaccine first. Stephen Powis says GPs and pharmacies are well prepared and adds that they are also looking at vaccination centres. He says he will say more in the coming weeks once we know more about the vaccine. He adds that he is ""confident the NHS will be up to this huge logistical challenge"". Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for England, says the number of patients in hospital with coronavirus ""is
still rising"". ""As we know, that number will unfortunately continue to rise if
the infection rates continue to increase in communities,"" he says. He says the news this week about a potential vaccine is ""extremely
encouraging"" and is ""welcome news"". ""But the vaccine is not here yet,"" he warns. ""That is why it is vital we continue to follow all the guidelines."" Alok Sharma welcomes this week's positive progress on the Pfizer vaccine, but warns ""we still have a lot of hurdles to come"". He urges the public to continue following the guidance. ""The virus is still there, it is still a danger,"" he says. Turning to the economic situation, Sharma says the government will be ""distributing Â£2.2bn to local authorities tomorrow to allow them to make vital grant payments to businesses affected"". ""These measures are designed to help business stay afloat,"" he says. He adds that the government's Kickstart scheme has created 19,000 jobs. It is ""a ray of hope for young people"" he says. Travellers from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar and the Turks and Caicos islands will no longer have to self-isolate when they arrive to the UK after 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Current coronavirus restrictions mean that only people with valid reasons are supposed to travel abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Greece will be removed from the travel corridor list, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos. From 04:00 on Saturday travellers to the UK from this destination will need to self-isolate. He added that the travel ban on Denmark will be extended for a further 14 days. Alok Sharma begins by going through the coronavirus figures. He says the average number of positive Covid tests is 22,524 compared to 22,398 a week ago. He also says the average number of Covid patients in hospital is 14,196 across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago. ""This is a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus,"" he says. Business Secretary Alok Sharma and the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, have arrived for today's press conference. We'll bring you all the news as it comes. We are expecting a government press conference to start shortly, and could hear questions on both the state of the NHS and the economy. Todayfigures revealed that NHS waiting lists have grownsince Covid struck, with nearly 140,000 people waiting over a year for routine procedures. We've also learnt thatthe UK's economy has rebounded from recessionfollowing a six month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, and the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the pandemic. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has accused President Donald Trump of ""refusing to accept reality"" in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi told a news conference that the president and Republicans had ""ignored by delay, distortion, denial"" the impact of the health and economic crisis, which she called a ""red alert"". She said the ""devastating milestone"" of 10 million Americans infected with coronavirus had been passed, listing the dire economic consequences of that. ""And what are they doing now?,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Trump administration. ""Continuing to ignore in spite of these numbers that should be so compelling. ""Every kind of avoidance of taking responsibility has been witnessed. They're engaged in an absurd circus right now, refusing to accept reality."" Trump maintains that he has handled the pandemic well, arguing that his administration has provided ample medical equipment and accelerated the development of treatments. Allow Twitter content?

"Senior Democrats urge Republicans to ""accept reality"" over the US presidential election President Trump is yet to concede and many other Republicans continue to back him Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the ""absurd circus"" meant the coronavirus pandemic was being neglected US President-elect Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, spoke with the Pope on Thursday Biden announces his chief of staff - his long-standing aide Ron Klain Reports suggest the Trump administration is withholding support from the incoming leader Three states have yet to be projected - Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina But Biden has an unassailable tally of 279 under the electoral college system, BBC projects Edited by Tom Spender We're pausing our live coverage of the US election aftermath - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap - here are the key developments in the past 24 hours:  Thursday's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington - Mal Siret, Ritu Prasad, Vicky Bisset, Yaroslav Lukov, Max Matza, Patrick Jackson and Thomas Spender. Biden has expressed condolences to the families and friends of five American peacekeepers who died in a helicopter crash in Egypt's Sinai peninsula earlier on Thursday. In a tweet, the US president-elect also wished ""a speedy recovery"",externalto one US national who survived the crash.

The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) said the helicopter came down during a routine mission near the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.,external A French citizen and a Czech citizen also died. An investigation is now under way into what caused the crash. Read our full story here Twitter says that approximately 300,000 ""disputed and potentially misleading"" tweets had additional context added to them in the two-week period around the election, according to a report it released today. That represents some 0.2% of all election-related tweets sent during their study. Around 450 tweets were subjected to further censoring, with warning labels applied and restrictions about how they could be shared. The report,externalfocused on tweets sent from 27 October to 11 November. As you're probably aware, dozens of Trump tweets (including those claiming he had won re-election) were flagged under the Twitter rules that were temporarily put in place for the election. Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said. The analysis comes as Twitter begins to roll back some of their election-time restrictions. Donald Trump has issued an order banning American investments in Chinese firms the government determines have ties to the Chinese military. Inthe order,,externalTrump accused China of ""increasingly exploiting"" US investors ""to finance the development and modernisation of its military"". The ban is to go into effect in January. It could affect some of China's biggest publicly-listed firms, including China Telecom and tech firm Hikvision. Throughout his administration, Trump has made efforts to disentangle the US from its close economic ties with China. Read our full story here Joe Biden has been projected to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to beat Donald Trump in the race to the White House. What happens now? The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern. Read more here With just two weeks until Thanksgiving, the mayor of Chicago has issued a month-long advisory for residents to stay at home, warning that 1,000 more people could die in the city by the end of the year if no action is taken to stop the spread of coronavirus. Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

"Lee Cain (right) with Dominic Cummings Uncertainty has reigned over exactly who is in charge in Downing Street. The director of communications, Lee Cain, is out. But it is much more than a random resignation. He was Boris Johnson's longest serving aide in No 10, and very close to his most senior adviser Dominic Cummings. Despite those longstanding relationships, the possibility that Mr Cain would be promoted to chief of staff met resistance from some MPs and ministers and he quit. His promotion was also being resisted, it's understood, by the prime minister's fiancee, Carrie Symonds and his incoming press spokesperson, Allegra Stratton. Senior Johnson adviser to leave Downing Street PM's new spin doctor was Daily Mirror chicken Arguments and rivalry in any Downing Street operation are not unusual. This feels different though, like a final act has started to play out after months of building tension. One insider, who until now has kept their counsel, spoke out in frustration saying: ""I just can't describe to you how much of a mess it is."" This is about who is running the country. It's not just about whether a man, who you probably haven't heard of, has fallen out with a politician. The wider issue now though is not just Mr Cain's departure. It is the unhappiness it leaves behind - anger about what has unfolded shared by other key advisers like the prime minister's most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, and the Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost. Neither is leaving their jobs - for now. But after months of strain, and fractures inside a government under pressure, tensions are spilling fully into the open. Rather than a government united in trying to confront a pandemic, a picture emerges instead of rival groups vying for influence over the prime minister himself.

"The UK's three biggest unions are changing leadership, while Labour's governing body has been holding elections. What does all this mean for Sir Keir Starmer? Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - the NEC - matters. It can help or hinder Sir Keir Starmer in his efforts to prove the party really is under new leadership. And his control over it is on a knife edge. The NEC brings together representatives from across the Labour movement - from the shadow cabinet,  the parliamentary party, councillors, the unions and the grassroots membership. Labour 'should apologise for Brexit policy' Labour aims to build trust with new slogan Get serious about winning, Starmer tells Labour Polling closes on Thursday for the election of nine grassroots members - along with the election of Wales, youth and disability representatives, and a party treasurer. A BAME representative was elected separately and the Scottish Labour leader also sits on the body. The election results - due out at 12:00 GMT on Friday - should be a clue to the party's future direction. When left candidates - including Momentum's founder, Jon Lansman -swept the board early in 2018in elections for the grassroots seats, it signalled that Jeremy Corbyn and his allies had finally gained control of the party machine. The NEC has a lot of contentious issues in its in-tray. It will draw up rule changes designed to implementrecommendationsof the Equality and Human Rights Commission in tackling anti-Semitism. It will also have to respond to a forthcoming report from the Forde Inquiry in to the party's internal culture. This was set up following the leak of a report whichclaimed that the previous leadership had been underminedby party officials and argued that factional interests had undermined the election campaign. And ultimately the NEC - or at least a panel drawn from its membership - could decide the political fate of Mr Corbyn,currently suspended from the partyfor suggested Labour's opponents had dramatically overstated the scale of anti-Semitism. While Sir Keir has not lost any major votes on the NEC since his election in April, his hold is tenuous. Two reps elected in the summer suggested a move away from Momentum - the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - was taking place at the grassroots. The successful candidates came from the Labour To Win ticket - representing the ""moderate"" groups Labour First and Progress. One of its declared aims is to ""work together to make Keir Starmer's leadership a success"". Allies of Sir Keir say only 18 of the current 37 members are solidly reliable. Some others - including the representatives of the GMB union - are usually helpful, but as one insider put it: ""They usually want something in return."" So Labour to Win is looking for reinforcements. But the method of electing representatives has changed from a first-past the-post system to a form of proportional representation, where candidates are ranked in order of preference. The effect of this will be to make any result less clear-cut. This change was backed by the party leadership. Jeremy Corbyn is currently suspended from the Labour Party One staunch Starmer supporter said it was about ""managing risk"". While the voting system would prevent Labour To Win from sweeping the board, it eliminated the risk of Momentum doing so too. In other words, if there is a backlash against decisions taken by the new leadership, any damage would be limited. So under the new voting system, we are likely to see Momentum's standard bearer and former MP Laura Pidcock elected, alongside the leading candidate from Labour To Win - Luke Akehurst. He runs the Labour First group to help rally and organise critics and opponents of the Corbyn leadership. One of its avowed aims is to ensure ""the party is kept safe from the organised hard left"". But it is less clear how well the rival camps will fare overall. Momentum candidates are bullish about their prospects and believe the message of stopping a rightward drift will play well with the activist electorate. Labour To Win does not lack confidence either. The membership has changed to an extent since the general election, as some Corbyn supporters have left the party while some of his opponents joined, or rejoined, to support Sir Keir's leadership campaign. But if there are no clear-cut winners in the grassroots seats, the role of the NEC members appointed by the affiliated unions becomes more crucial. Three big unions affiliated to the party - and which generously donate funds to Labour - will also see a change of leadership over the next year or so. Each has representatives on the NEC. There's an imminent contest in the public service union Unison. Outgoing Unison boss Dave Prentis has been a firm supporter of Sir Keir Its 1.3 million members have been sent ballot papers and the contest closes on 27 November, with the winning candidate taking over from veteran leader Dave Prentis in the New Year. Under his leadership, Unison nominated Sir Keir to become Labour leader, but it is by no means certain that another ally will replace Mr Prentis. His favoured replacement is Christina McAnea - an assistant general secretary who has said she supports Sir Keir's leadership. She has been nominated for the job (though not unanimously) by the union's executive committee and more than 200 local branches. Ms McAnea grew up on a Glasgow council estate and her campaign has focused on what she can do to improve working conditions. She is seen as a tough negotiator who has delivered for NHS staff. And although a long-standing (though not lifelong) Labour member, union insiders say she does not see things through the prism of internal party politics. But her elevation to the top job is not guaranteed. She faces tough competition from Roger Mackenzie - another assistant general secretary and Unison's first senior official from a BAME background. His candidacy has been endorsed by none other than Mr Corbyn - who said: ""Roger and I have stood together on picket lines, on demonstrations together, and he did a huge amount of work supporting my leadership campaigns."" In a twist in the contest, the campaign group Labour Against Anti-Semitism has made a complaint against Mr Mackenzie to Labour headquarters, based largely on his social media activity. He denies any anti-Semitic behaviour. The party is investigating. And this week, complaints have also been made to Unison which sources say are ""being looked into"". However, even were Mr Mackenzie to be suspended subject to investigation - and I'm told that's by no means certain - the union's rules would not stop him running for office. His opponents believe that his profile has been boosted by his support for a campaign to reinstate Mr Corbyn. If he too was suspended by either the party or the union, they fear that this may not derail his campaign. Indeed, in an election where turnout among the wider membership is expected to be low, but higher among left-wing activists, he may actually receive a boost. Another left-wing candidate is already suspended from the union, but is also taking part in the contest. Paul Holmes - who is employed by Kirklees Council, in West Yorkshire - came third in the 2010 contest and has vowed to take his current Â£32,000 salary if elected, and not the six-figure sum that comes with the job. He has campaigned to sell off the union's expensive London HQ. The fourth candidate is Hugo Pierre, who isn't a Labour member. He is backed by the Socialist Party, a successor organisation to the Trotskyite Militant Tendency, and is not expected to come close to winning. It's a first-past-the-post election so with the left-wing vote split three ways, Ms McAnea remains favourite. But if much of the activist vote were to coalesce behind Roger Mackenzie, things could all become politically more choppy for Sir Keir in the New Year. An imminent change of leadership was also expected at the GMB union - the UK's third largest - following the departure of the previous general secretary Tim Roache amid allegations of misconduct. He said was resigning on grounds of ill health. The timetable, though, has slipped following adevastating report by Karen Monaghan QCon the culture at the union. She found ""bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment"" were endemic. I am told that the union's ruling body has made dealing with this, and an internal probe in to the circumstances around the previous general secretary's departure, a priority - hence the delay. A contest in March next year has been mooted but not confirmed. GMS is the UK's third largest trade union Putting the union's own house in order is seen as more important than internal Labour politics. A GMB insider suggested that any likely candidate would have to be informally ""vetted"" to ensure they were not tainted by any criticism. However, the internal rumours are that the likely candidates will be the relatively youthful Scotland regional secretary Gary Smith, and union's public services lead Rehana Azam. Given the strength of the Monaghan report, and the previous lack of women in the most senior positions, Ms Azam would most clearly represent a break from the past. But neither candidate is thought to be problematic for Sir Keir, and newly installed interim general secretary Warren Kenny, son of the former GMB leader Sir Paul Kenny, is seen as convivial to the party leadership. Potentially the biggest problem for Sir Keir is if the leadership of the union most generous in its funding of Labour moves from being critical of him to downright hostile. Unite gave the party Â£3m in the run-up to the last election. Current general secretary and Corbyn ally Len McCluskey has said he will stand down in 2022, though some in the union still believe he may go a little sooner. In any case,the contest to replace him will begin next year. One candidate - Howard Beckett, who already represents the union on Labour's NEC - has been enraged by Mr Corbyn's suspension. He has said that ""an attack on Corbynism is an attack on all of us"". Len McCluskey has remained loyal to Jeremy Corbyn Mr Beckett has advocated reducing the union's contributions to Labour and devoting cash to setting up a broadcasting rival to the mainstream media. Unite already punches above its not inconsiderable weight on Labour's NEC and under his leadership he would, at the very least, also be throwing political punches at the current Labour leadership. A left-wing rival - and the candidate of the union's United Left faction, Steve Turner - is seen as more willing to do deals with Sir Keir than act as a rival power base. It is also likely that a member of the union's executive, Sharon Graham, also on the left, will campaign to become the first female general secretary, with a focus on improving her members' lot rather than seeking to get involved in internal Labour struggles. But considering another attempt at the top job is Gerard Coyne, whochallenged Mr McCluskey last time and lost narrowly. A split in the left vote in a first-past-the-post contest could help him. He was seen as close to Labour's former deputy leader Tom Watson after the latter's relations with Mr McCluskey soured. This contest is likely to be dramatic and bitter - the NEC elections certainly won't be the last word in internal party disputes. So if the NEC elections tilt Sir Keir's way and the contests in three biggest unions are ultimately won by candidates who are willing to be constructive, he could end up with an even more supportive party machine than his predecessor. But his critics haven't gone away. The contests could turn on very narrow margins and potentially make it more difficult for him to effect a change in his party's direction.

"Carrie Gracie (centre), pictured in 2018, received back pay and an apology from the broadcaster that year Former BBC journalist Carrie Gracie has said a report that found no unlawful pay discrimination against women at the BBC ""feels like a whitewash"".

The commission defended its ""robust investigations"", but a statement from BBC Women, which represents female employees, said the findings ""do not reflect our experiences"".

She took issue with the way the commission started by looking at 1,000 complaints from female BBC employees, whittled them down to 40, before focusing on 10. ""Seriously?"" She wrote on Twitter. ""FOLLOW THE Â£Â£ INSTEAD: #BBC forced to pay out to 100s of #bbcwomen. Moral of story: don't rely on regulator but stay strong, calm, united + JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL."" More than 500 women have been awarded rises since 2017 after making pay complaints. Gracie left the BBC in August after 33 years at the corporation. Meanwhile, earlier this yearan employment tribunal foundthat Newswatch presenter Ahmed had been paid one sixth of the amount Jeremy Vine received for doing similar work on Points of View. AndSarah Montague received a Â£400,000 settlementafter being paid less than former Radio 4 co-presenters like John Humphrys and Nick Robinson. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which launched its investigation in March 2019, said the BBC accepted that ""its historical practices were not fit for purpose and has made significant changes since 2015"". BBC director general Tim Davie pledged to implement the report's recommendations, saying: ""We have to work even harder to be best in class."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed (right) won an equal pay case against the BBC in January EHRC interim chair Caroline Waters said it was ""easy to see why trust between some women at the BBC and the organisation has broken down"". She said: ""Many women felt their voices were not being heard and have been left feeling confused as to how decisions about their pay have been made. ""This took a heavy emotional toll on those involved in the process and the strength of feeling of women at the BBC should not be understated. ""While we have not found any unlawful acts in our investigation, repairing the damage caused by these issues requires continued leadership and we hope the BBC board takes forward our recommendations."" How to know if you're getting equal pay Asked why the EHRC found no unlawful pay discrimination despite the high-profile cases, Suzanne Baxter, who led the investigation, explained: ""Our work here has been carried out under the equality act, and has a different remit to an employment tribunal. ""I do understand why there might be some surprise. Our investigation is broader, we're gathering every piece of evidence we can, which isn't always available to a tribunal. ""We think we've done robust investigations. The important thing here is the recommendations we make."" EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath added that ""we're looking at overarching systems, whereas employment tribunals look at a specific case"". She said they did find ""real concerns about the overall processes which led to concerns about trust and transparency"", and acknowledged that ""this is about real lives [of the women] at the centre of this investigation"". She added: ""We talked to them, they had gone though humiliation, anxiety, insomnia, were signed off work. One woman waited 370 days, another woman was passed between eight people in 10 months. These are real people having a terrible time."" Ms Baxter said she was ""very confident our recommendations will make a difference to women going forward"". The recommendations include better record keeping and a more transparent grievance process that it is done within a ""reasonable time limit"". The BBC has also been told to continue improving training and guidance for BBC staff making decisions about pay, and reviewing pay frameworks regularly. Tim Davie replaced Tony Hall as director general of the BBC in September Welcoming the report, Mr Davie said: ""Trust is vitally important and as an organisation that serves the public, the BBC must continue to lead the way on pay transparency and fairness. We are committed to building a truly inclusive culture. ""We agree with the Commission that we should continue to deliver on our reform programme which began in 2015. We accept every one of their recommendations and will implement them."" But the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said the report was not based on ""robust research"" because the ""strongest cases"" of pay discrimination were not properly examined. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said many members would feel the report ""doesn't address their lived experiences"" and there were ""still vital changes that need to take place"". Broadcasting union Bectu said the report ""highlights the importance of transparency in pay and terms and conditions"" and there are ""still improvements to be made, particularly in relation to pay progression"". Differences between men and women were exposed whenthe corporation published its first star salaries listin 2017. Only two of the top 14 earners were women, and men made up about two-thirds of the overall list. The corporation said most of the 500 salary increases rises awarded to women since 2017 related to the issue of fair pay rather than equal pay, and that 99% of pay queries had now been resolved. Four equal pay cases are still going through the tribunal process, with three more being dealt with by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas).

"Sir Keir Starmer at a 2019 People's Vote campaign rally Two key members of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet have called for the party to issue a '""full throated apology"" for its stance on Brexit. Ex-party chairman Ian Lavery and former elections chief Jon Trickett say backing a second referendum at last year's election destroyed trust. In a new report, the pair call for the current leadership to apologise to both Remain and Leave voters. Sir Keir Starmer was a leading advocate of another referendum. The party's then Brexit spokesman was elected to replace Mr Corbyn as leader in April. In their report, to be published later, Mr Lavery  and Mr Trickett - who were both fired from the front bench by Sir Keir - say Leave and Remain voters were equally let down by the party's Brexit policy at the 2019 election. Can Starmer keep hold of his party machine? New leader not enough for victory - Labour report Labour leadership takes blame over election result ""Leave voters were too often sneered at and Remain voters were led up the garden path with a position - of overturning the referendum result - that was never seriously achievable. ""To put this aside, Leavers and Remainers need an apology."" The pair's report, entitled No Holding Back, was co-written with former MP Laura Smith, who lost Crewe and Nantwich to the Conservatives at the 2019 election. It is result of zoom conversations with Labour activists, trade unionists, voters and former voters. And the report indeed does not hold back on what the authors think went wrong at the general election. Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett maintain they warned their shadow cabinet colleagues of the electoral consequences of backing a second referendum. They say: ""Our argument, back in the summer of 2019, that seeking to overturn the referendum would lead to electoral disaster in the North and the Midlands was drowned out by other elements in the top ranks of the Partyâ¦ we opposed the moves which were made to turn the party into a Remain-facing political unit."" But their criticisms go beyond Brexit. Ian Lavery on the campaign trail last year The party machine was in 2019 under the control of Jeremy Corbyn's allies  - and Ian Lavery in particular played a prominent role in touring seats Labour needed to win or couldn't afford to lose. But the report acknowledges serious mistakes. It argues that ""we did not develop a narrative that threaded our policies together and told a story about what Labour would do in power. ""â¦ the 2019 general election was a hard lesson in how not to do policy - it was confused, contradictory in some places and was not believable to most voters."" The report analyses why Labour has recovered in the polls since Sir Keir Starmer became leader, It suggests he is picking up more support amongst former Liberal Democrats and middle-class voters in the South. In Leave-voting areas, the report argues that there has been ""a glacial pace of change among voters who are still overwhelmingly in the Tory camp. At present Sir Keir Starmer's leadership is yet to cut through."" Jon Trickett was a key member of Mr Corbyn's team Supporters of the current Labour leader maintain that Jeremy Corbyn was mentioned on the doorsteps during last year's election as a reason for not voting Labour more often than Brexit. And Sir Keir Starmer's personal ratings have not only been much higher than his predecessor's but have also run ahead of the prime minister's in some polls. The report acknowledges that the Corbyn leadership and his perceived lack of patriotism was an issue at the last election. It says that it had been a failing of the then leadership not to ""re-interpret what patriotism really means in a progressive sense"". But it also claims that ""media smears"" meant that he was viewed less favourably by the public in 2019 than at the 2017 election. The report suggests Labour's problems go much deeper than the issues of Brexit and leadership - that for too long in predominantly working class areas, voters felt they were being taken for granted - and that Labour was seen as the establishment party. From conversations with activists and trade unionists, the report's authors say: ""People repeatedly claimed that Labour had become too southern and too middle class."" They have some recommendations, too - including, when candidates are selected, introducing quotas for those from working-class backgrounds. Close to general elections, supporters of the party leadership - under Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn - have been selected with little say from local members. ""The old days of parachuting political professionals into working-class communities that they have no connection to must now end in totality,"" says the report. And while Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett left the shadow cabinet at Sir Keir Starmer's request, they have what they call some ""comradely advice"" for him: ""be bold and transformational"". Criticism of the Starmer leadership had been fairly muted until the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn. But the report from Jon Trickett, Ian Lavery and Laura Smith could signal a renewed willingness to speak out. Closely-fought elections to Labour's  ruling national executive conclude on Thursday, and will determine whether the Left's influence will continue to wane, or whether grassroots members want to limit Sir Keir's growing control of the party machine.

"The number of people waiting over a year for hospital treatment in England has hit its highest levels since 2008. Patients are meant to be seen within 18 weeks - but nearly 140,000 of the 4.35 million on the waiting list at the end of September had waited over a year. The number waiting 12 months or more has increased sharply this year - the figure in February was just 1,600. Surgeons said it was ""tragic"" patients were being left in pain while they waited for treatment. And others warned the situation could become even worse during winter with the NHS seeing rising numbers of Covid patients. In recent weeks, major hospitals in Bradford, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Liverpool, which have seen high rates of infection, have announced the mass cancellation of non-urgent work. Donna Doyle, 52, was referred for surgery at the end of 2019. She has rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and needed reconstructive surgery on the front half of her right foot. But her pre-op appointment was cancelled in the spring because of pandemic. And now she has been told she will have to wait until February at the earliest. ""The pain isn't something that affects me every now and then, it's a problem every single day,"" she says. ""Imagine two pebbles grinding against the bone in your feet. It's constant. ""It causes a lot of problems in my life, physically and mentally. I psyched myself up for having the surgery, so the day I was told nothing would be happening, I was so upset. ""I work from home at moment. And some days, my husband comes home and I'm crying, feeling really down. ""I'm fed up with seeing Matt Hancock say ""the NHS is open for business"" because it's not true. I'm being overlooked."" Prof John Appleby, director of research at health think tank the Nuffield Trust, said the situation was a ""real concern"". Hospitals were facing a real battle to keep non-Covid services going, he said, pointing out the number of Covid patients in hospital had risen from just over 2,000 to more than 10,000 since the end of September. ""It is clear that over the summer months, NHS staff have put in tremendous amounts of work to boost activity across the board,"" he said. ""However, the service has fallen short of the tall order of recovering all non-Covid activity between the two waves of this pandemic."" Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen said these patients had paid a ""heavy price"". ""It is tragic to see so many lives put on hold,2 he said. ""Each statistic represents someone waiting patiently, potentially in pain, for the treatment they need to get on with living an independent life. ""Older people and poorer people are particularly hard hit by these delays."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis, said the situation was ""appalling"". ""We're currently seeing some hospitals entirely pausing elective surgery because of the pressures of the second phase of the pandemic,"" she said. ""The consequences of these further delays will reverberate for years to come."" Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the NHS was doing its best but was facing a really challenging winter. ""We are keenly aware of the inconvenience, anxiety and distress for patients caused by any delays for diagnostic tests, treatment or consultations,"" he added. Alongside routine care, significant numbers have missed out on treatment for cancer. The numbers receiving urgent check-ups have dropped by a quarter during the pandemic, with 300,000 fewer people seeing a cancer specialist from April to September than during the same period last year. The numbers starting cancer treatment are also down by a fifth. Anoushka Kurkjian Mother-of-three Anoushka Kurkjian, 41, found a cyst on her breast in June. She sought medical advice and was told it was benign but remained concerned because she was in pain. As a last resort - three months later - she went to her local accident-and-emergency unit and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had been afraid to go because of worries over catching the coronavirus. The cancer has now spread to her lymph nodes. ""If it had been a year ago, I would have gone in earlier,"" Anoushka says. ""I am now undergoing chemotherapy and have lost my hair. ""I feel very angry that I was not diagnosed earlier. ""I wish I could say to women, 'Seek treatment. ""'Don't be deterred.' ""Yes, Covid is a factor. ""But there's a lot more going on out there."" But NHS bosses said cancer services had returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity by the end of September. An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""The NHS message to the public has always been clear - do not delay, help us to help you by coming forward for care.""

"Pubs and other businesses affected by the current restrictions are unsure if they can reopen this weekend The Stormont Executive's deadlock over whether to extend Covid-19 restrictions was described as ""our politics at its worst again"" by a business group. Ministers have now agreed to extend restrictions for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday. A proposal from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds was supported by a majority of parties. Sinn FÃ©in voted against the move and the SDLP abstained. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen next Friday. The hospitality sector and hair and beauty salons have been closed since 16 October after tight restrictions were imposed. Ministers were in heated discussions for days before reaching agreement, with the parties at odds over what to do when the current laws run out at midnight on Friday. The delayed decision drew criticism from business groups. Tina McKenzie, the Northern Ireland chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the ""lack of communication"" from the executive had led to confusion among businesses. ""They are at sea, with some saying they will not be able to open, even if they get the go-ahead,"" she said. ""Very few of them have got any money since four weeks ago - they have been angry and now they are in despair. ""I don't agree that it's one party or a green-and-orange issue - this is our politics at its worst again."" Some businesses had saidthey planned to reopen on Fridayif no agreement was reached at Stormont. Two proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann to extend all of the restrictions for one week, or two weeks,were blocked by the DUPin a cross-community vote on Wednesday. A separate DUP proposal advocating a partial reopening of some sectors from Friday was also voted down by the executive. Another 15 coronavirus-related deaths were reported by Stormont's Department of Health on Thursday, taking its overall death toll to 825. Of the 15 deaths, 11 happened between 10:00 GMT on Wednesday and 10:00 on Thursday. The other deaths happened within the previous three weeks and have now been added to the overall total. Another 548 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive for the virus in the past day. Earlier on Thursday, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party would ""look very carefully"" at any new proposals. ""We recognise time is of the essence here - we do want to get a decision made,"" he said. ""We will do everything we can do get that arrangement. ""I'm not going to accept there will be a negative outcome - when the will is there, there is a way."" Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate Wait for clarity as Stormont tempers flare Hospitality return is 'act of vandalism', says doctor Speaking to RTÃ, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ""anything other than that is going against the public health advice"". ""The executive needs to make a decision today and that decision needs to be communicated to the public today,"" added the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president. ""It needs to be for two weeks - that's the clear, straightforward advice from the health team and that is where my support will lie."" On Sunday, Ms O'Neill had suggesteda partial and graduated reopening of some sectors was being considered by ministers. Two days later, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party supported Mr Swann's proposal of a two-week extension of all restrictions, which was blocked by the DUP. Mr Swann had warned his ministerial colleagues that doing nothing ""needs to be avoided"" at all costs and that some mitigations to curb the spread of coronavirus must be retained. A former DUP politician also criticised the executive, describing the delayed decision as ""shameful"". Jimmy Spratt, who has been receiving treatment for cancer, accused politicians of ""dithering"" on Thursday afternoon. ""If anyone is trying to run the clock down to midnight, the public will judge everyone in the executive at the next election,"" he told Talkback. He said ministers should remember Wednesday's news of three members of one family whodied within two weeks of each other with Covid-19. ""They should go to that family and ask them how they feel,"" he said. NI Covid restrictions extended for one more week Q&A: How does the Executive work? Can NI 'learn to live' with Covid-19?

"Goods for sale in The Range during lockdown Retailers and supermarkets have been accused of taking advantage of lockdown loopholes for Christmas trading while other stores remain closed. Homeware chain The Range has been encouraging consumers in England to ""Shop Christmas in-store and online"". The Plymouth-based firm - which sells groceries alongside soft furnishings and art supplies - says it's acting within the rules. But traders whose businesses are closed say some companies aren't playing fair. A competitor to The Range who didn't want to be named, told the BBC: ""It's the wild west out there. The legislation was rushed and now government has lost control, with some retailers taking liberties in a very unfair playing field."" But The Range said it was following government guidance. ""The Range is classed as an essential retailer and is complying with all aspects of government legislation and guidelines,"" a spokesman for the firm said. ""Our stores trade in a fully Covid-compliant manner, creating a safe environment for our customers and staff."" Which shops will still be open in lockdown? Advertising from The Range encourages consumers to 'shop Christmas' in-store and online Martin Coles-Evans runs a gifts and homeware store called Hargreaves & Sons in Buxton, Derbyshire. The business has been going for more than 150 years, but now he says times are ""tough"". ""Shops like ourselves, we're following the rules and we're making people stay safe so we're closed, and yet these bigger companies are trying on loopholes left, right and centre to stay open, when really they shouldn't be,"" he said. ""It does seem to be they're mopping up all the Christmas trade while we're just limping along, struggling trying to get by with some government support."" The gifts and homeware store owned by Martin Coles-Evans is closed during lockdown. The business owner says he visited a garden centre at the weekend that was also selling clothing, shoes, books, home dÃ©cor, candles and photo frames. He's written to his local MP to voice his concerns but so far he's heard nothing back. All non-essential retail stores - as well as hospitality and leisure venues - must remain closed in England from 5 November to 2 December. Toy store owner Hellen Stirling Baker was dismayed to find Lidl supermarket in Sheffield with shelves full of children's playthings, while her doors remain firmly closed. ""Lidl is stacked high with wooden toys and books. It feels like the big supermarkets are capitalising on the fact they are able to sell non-essential goods alongside their essentials, in the run up to Christmas,"" she said. Under government guidelines, Lidl is allowed to sell toys alongside essential items. Lidl says it is closely following government guidance, which states: ""A business selling a significant amount of essential retail may also continue to sell goods typically sold at non-essential retail. For example, a supermarket that sells food is not required to close off or cordon off aisles selling homeware."" ""Why is that allowed to happen?"" asks Ms Stirling Baker. ""It's definitely given the bigger supermarkets and retailers a massively unfair advantage."" Only stores that sell non-essential goods on another floor or in a different building are required to close those parts of their premises, according to the guidance. The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said the restrictions were necessary to slow the spread of coronavirus. ""These restrictions have been brought in because we have to limit social contact in order to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We recognise this continues to be a very difficult period for businesses, which is why we've confirmed that there will be a full package of financial support in place, with the furlough scheme extended and grants worth up to Â£3,000 per month for businesses legally required to close."" Toy store owner Hellen Stirling Baker says it seems 'incredibly unfair' that the supermarket chains can sell toys during lockdown But just six weeks out from Christmas, many store owners say that help doesn't go far enough to compensate business owners who've been forced to close. ""I don't think the government truly understand how retail works in the UK,"" says William Coe, who runs Coe's department store in Ipswich. ""They think if we pay their wages and give them a little towards overheads, they'll be alright. But these are key trading weeks that have massive implications for cash flow and stock and ongoing implications."" William Coe says government support doesn't go far enough for businesses closed at such a crucial time of year. Mr Coe says he understands the government is in a difficult position, ""but if you tell people they have to shut, you have to give them adequate support."" Other ""non-essential"" retailers includingbookstore owners and clothing firms have criticisedthe government's handling of the second coronavirus lockdown. James Daunt, the boss of Waterstones, told the BBC that ""arbitrary lines"" had been drawn, with smaller bookshops forced to shut, while large newsagents such as WHSmith, which sell books alongside other items, were able to stay open. But a spokesman for WHSmith said the chain isn't really benefitting from the rules, since lockdown means there are far fewer shoppers on High Streets anyway. He said the company is operating in line with government guidance, which allows newsagents and post offices to keep trading.

"Carrie Gracie (centre), pictured in 2018, received back pay and an apology from the broadcaster that year Former BBC journalist Carrie Gracie has said a report that found no unlawful pay discrimination against women at the BBC ""feels like a whitewash"". The Equalities and Human Rights Commission's investigation came after presenters like Gracie and Samira Ahmed were revealed to have been underpaid. The watchdog said the BBC didn't break the law but must ""increase transparency and rebuild trust"" with women. The BBC Women group said,externalit was ""deeply disappointed by the findings"". The commission defended its ""robust investigations"", but a statement from BBC Women, which represents female employees, said the findings ""do not reflect our experiences"". The report ""does not address the systemic issue of unequal pay suggested by the hundreds of pay increases and settlements the BBC has made to women"", the group added.

She took issue with the way the commission started by looking at 1,000 complaints from female BBC employees, whittled them down to 40, before focusing on 10. ""Seriously?"" She wrote on Twitter. ""FOLLOW THE Â£Â£ INSTEAD: #BBC forced to pay out to 100s of #bbcwomen. Moral of story: don't rely on regulator but stay strong, calm, united + JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL."" More than 500 women have been awarded rises since 2017 after making pay complaints. Gracie left the BBC in August after 33 years at the corporation. Meanwhile, earlier this yearan employment tribunal foundthat Newswatch presenter Ahmed had been paid one sixth of the amount Jeremy Vine received for doing similar work on Points of View. AndSarah Montague received a Â£400,000 settlementafter being paid less than former Radio 4 co-presenters like John Humphrys and Nick Robinson. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which launched its investigation in March 2019, said the BBC accepted that ""its historical practices were not fit for purpose and has made significant changes since 2015"". BBC director general Tim Davie pledged to implement the report's recommendations, saying: ""We have to work even harder to be best in class."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed (right) won an equal pay case against the BBC in January EHRC interim chair Caroline Waters said it was ""easy to see why trust between some women at the BBC and the organisation has broken down"". She said: ""Many women felt their voices were not being heard and have been left feeling confused as to how decisions about their pay have been made. ""This took a heavy emotional toll on those involved in the process and the strength of feeling of women at the BBC should not be understated. ""While we have not found any unlawful acts in our investigation, repairing the damage caused by these issues requires continued leadership and we hope the BBC board takes forward our recommendations."" How to know if you're getting equal pay Asked why the EHRC found no unlawful pay discrimination despite the high-profile cases, Suzanne Baxter, who led the investigation, explained: ""Our work here has been carried out under the equality act, and has a different remit to an employment tribunal. ""I do understand why there might be some surprise. Our investigation is broader, we're gathering every piece of evidence we can, which isn't always available to a tribunal. ""We think we've done robust investigations. The important thing here is the recommendations we make."" EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath added that ""we're looking at overarching systems, whereas employment tribunals look at a specific case"". She said they did find ""real concerns about the overall processes which led to concerns about trust and transparency"", and acknowledged that ""this is about real lives [of the women] at the centre of this investigation"". She added: ""We talked to them, they had gone though humiliation, anxiety, insomnia, were signed off work. One woman waited 370 days, another woman was passed between eight people in 10 months. These are real people having a terrible time."" Ms Baxter said she was ""very confident our recommendations will make a difference to women going forward"". The recommendations include better record keeping and a more transparent grievance process that it is done within a ""reasonable time limit"". The BBC has also been told to continue improving training and guidance for BBC staff making decisions about pay, and reviewing pay frameworks regularly. Tim Davie replaced Tony Hall as director general of the BBC in September Welcoming the report, Mr Davie said: ""Trust is vitally important and as an organisation that serves the public, the BBC must continue to lead the way on pay transparency and fairness. We are committed to building a truly inclusive culture. ""We agree with the Commission that we should continue to deliver on our reform programme which began in 2015. We accept every one of their recommendations and will implement them."" But the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said the report was not based on ""robust research"" because the ""strongest cases"" of pay discrimination were not properly examined. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said many members would feel the report ""doesn't address their lived experiences"" and there were ""still vital changes that need to take place"". Broadcasting union Bectu said the report ""highlights the importance of transparency in pay and terms and conditions"" and there are ""still improvements to be made, particularly in relation to pay progression"". Differences between men and women were exposed whenthe corporation published its first star salaries listin 2017. Only two of the top 14 earners were women, and men made up about two-thirds of the overall list. The corporation said most of the 500 salary increases rises awarded to women since 2017 related to the issue of fair pay rather than equal pay, and that 99% of pay queries had now been resolved. Four equal pay cases are still going through the tribunal process, with three more being dealt with by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). A further seven fair or equal pay complaints are going through the BBC's own internal procedure. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales in 2017-18 was the highest since records began. By 2019 youth violence was being called a ""national emergency"" with MPs calling on the government to ""get a grip"" on the crisis in the wake of a string of teenagers being killed. To find out more about what was going on behind the headlines the BBC started to track the killings across the UK in 2019, looking at the lives of the people affected. While the suggestion was that gang violence and cuts to police numbers was the problem, the BBC project highlighted a far more complicated picture. We reported on thefirst 100 victims of fatal stabbingsin 2019 which showed those killed were mostly young and male. But we also saw arise in ""invisible victims of knife crime""- those killed in incidents of domestic violence and highlighted how theexcessive use of drugs and alcoholwas a major factor in attacks across the UK. The project has now examined the first 100 killings. This includes fatal stabbings, as well as deaths caused by shooting, assault and smothering. We've identified 100 people held legally responsible for most of the deaths. In some cases, more than one killer was involved. The age range of killers is wide but more than a quarter were teenagers - 14 of them were children (under 18). Evidence in their trials revealed a pattern of abuse or neglect, mental health problems and limited educational attainment in the background of the young killers. The circumstances of each killing is varied but there are also some strikingly common themes. Many were influenced by drugs and alcohol and some impacted with serious mental health problems. But although such cases naturally grab the headlines, the violence generated by the market in illicit drugs doesn't tell the whole story. From the dozens of murder trials we followed across the country, the killings were actually more likely to be the result of rows settled under the influence of drink and drugs rather than turf wars. Most of the killers had been in trouble with the law before. Some were prolific offenders. Over a fifth of the killers had links to street gangs, illustrating why police and government prioritise tackling this to drive down serious violence. But domestic killings also feature prominently. Most of the 100 killings (66) led to criminal convictions, others went to inquests where a suspect had taken their own life after carrying out a homicide. Some trials are waiting to be heard, having been delayed by Covid-19. The 13 cases with no charges include those that went to inquests and seven which are currently unsolved. By January this year our research found thenumber of people killed across the UK actually fell in 2019for the first time in five years.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong opposition members announce mass resignation The Chinese government has condemned the mass resignation of most of Hong Kong's opposition from parliament as an ""open challenge"" to its authority. Nearly all pro-democracy lawmakers quit in protest after four of their colleagues were deemed threats to national security and dismissed. Many see Hong Kong's limited democracy as now being in its death throes. The UK government has accused China of breaching its commitments to protect Hong Kong's autonomy. The former British colony became part of China in 1997 but was promised it could keep some unique freedoms for 50 years. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said of Wednesday's move to remove the four lawmakers: ""Beijing's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong constitutes a clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration. ""China has once again broken its promises and undermined Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy."" The US also condemned what had happened,external, saying it was a move towards ""one-party dictatorship"", whilethe EU called for an immediate reversal of the decision.,external Hong Kong's government and authorities in Beijing have defended the disqualifications as lawful. This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained They were based on new rules from China saying elected legislators should be disqualified if they support Hong Kong's independence, refuse to acknowledge China's sovereignty, ask foreign forces to interfere in the city's affairs, or in other ways threaten national security. Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? The mainland authorities in Beijing have taken increasingly repressive measures in Hong Kong since mass protests rocked the city last year. Activists have fled and political parties have disbanded following Beijing's passing of a new National Security Law in June, which criminalises vague acts including ""subversion"". The imposition of the law was also deemed by Britain to have breached the joint declaration, which was signed in 1984. On Thursday, in response to the disqualification of their colleagues, 15 lawmakers sent in their resignation letters. Their exodus will leave a once-vibrant legislature filled with politicians seen as loyal to the mainland authorities. In a last act of defiance, one opposition lawmaker unfurled a banner in the assembly building on Thursday saying the city's leader, Carrie Lam, was hurting Hong Kong. ""She will stink for 10,000 years,"" it read. A last act of defiance from Hong Kong's opposition China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Thursday said the mass walk-out openly challenged the central government's authority and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution. It also said the move showed pro-democracy lawmakers' ""stance of stubborn resistance"" against the central government. ""If these lawmakers hope to make use of their resignation to provoke radical opposition and beg for foreign interference, they have miscalculated,"" a spokesperson said. by Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The four disqualified lawmakers will not face further consequences - at least for now. The decision to oust the lawmakers ""is not equivalent to any criminal proceedings"", government adviser Ronny Tong told me. The National Security Law, which took effect in June 30, is not retrospective, even though it is often criticised as broad and vague. On the other hand, political commentator Johnny Lau believes that Beijing has already achieved what he sees as its sole purpose - seizing control of the city's legislature, thus leaving no need for further action. ""The legislature is crippled,"" he says, adding that any further crackdown on the four lawmakers could be counterproductive and lead to more public sympathy. Instead, Mr Lau says, Beijing will focus its energy on passing laws deemed beneficial to the mainland in the remaining term of the parliament. One of the lawmakers who resigned, Claudia Mo, told the BBC that she and her colleagues felt they had to take a stand. ""We owe a display of solidarity with our colleagues who were ousted,"" she said. ""We need to protest against what could be the ultimate Beijing crackdown on Hong Kong - to silence the last bit of dissent in the city. ""They're lining us up to oust us bit by bit. What's the point of staying on like this, thinking will I be ousted today or not?"" China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong activist hailed as the 'real Mulan' The city's 70-seat legislature has 21 opposition members. Only two of those will now remain in the parliament. Hong Kong has seen waves of sometimes violent protests The four had already been disqualified from running in the next election, originally scheduled for September 2020 but postponed to next year. But until now they had remained in parliament. Beijing and Hong Kong officials have not given details on how exactly the four men had contravened the rules. All four are considered moderates and they have never supported Hong Kong independence. Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Kwok Ka-ki, Kenneth Leung and Dennis Kwok Alvin Yeung: Leader of the pro-democracy Civic party and a practising barrister. He was banned from taking part in this year's election after he signed a joint letter to US senators calling for sanctions on Hong Kong. Dennis Kwok: The barrister is a founding member of the Civic Party. He was earlier accused of paralysing LegCo by using filibustering tactics, ina move the Chinese government called ""malicious"",external. He was banned from elections after signing the sanctions letter. Kenneth Leung: The senior tax consultant is a member of the pro-democracy parliamentary group, the Professionals Guild. According to news site SCMP, officials barred him from the elections after accusing him of indirectly appealing to the US government for sanctions. Kwok Ka-ki: The Civic Party member was also barred from contesting in this year's elections. However, the urologist did not sign the joint letter or attend a trip to the US. Officials said he had a ""purported intention to call on foreign powers to sanction Hong Kong"", according to SCMP. The developments underscore the rapid expansion of Beijing's influence in the territory, pushing for loyalty from all levels of power. Observers say that without the pro-democracy lawmakers, there will be no effective opposition and LegCo will be reduced to a rubber-stamp parliament. Why students abroad fear Hong Kong's new law The city's leader is already chosen by pro-Beijing committees, and only half of the LegCo seats are directly elected. Hong Kong's LegCo - critics say it will now merely be a rubber-stamp legislature Under the terms of the handover between Britain and China, Hong Kong was meant to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech for 50 years. The ""one country, two systems"" principle - named so because such rights do not exist elsewhere in China - is enshrined in the Basic Law.

"Swansea University said it was looking to prioritise for students who live with someone vulnerable Not all students in Wales will be expected to take Covid tests before the Christmas holidays, the education minister has said. On Wednesday the Welsh Government said students would be offered fast turnaround tests a day before leaving. But Swansea University said it would not be possible to examine all students 24 hours before they went home. Tests would be there for those wanting ""extra reassurance"", Kirsty Williams told BBC Radio Wales. ""We are asking people to think about their personal circumstances and take some personal responsibility,"" she said. ""Testing will be available for those students who perhaps, maybe, are going home to particularly vulnerable family members."" Swansea University's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes earlier said it would not be logistically possible to test all 21,500 students within the time frame. How will students go home for Christmas? Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Students tear down 'prison-like' halls fencing All students in Wales have been asked to travel home by 9 Decemberat the latest. Plans are being put in place in Scotland totest up to 80,000 students twice- if they return negative results on both occasions, they will then be allowed to travel home. And, looking at university trials in England - where 45 staff have been testing 1,500 students a day, Mr Rhodes said such a scale would not be possible in Wales. ""If we were testing 21,500 people twice, at that rate of 1,500 tests a day, it would take a month - we've actually got about three days,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers. Students will need to leave by 9 December if they want to be home by Christmas ""It's not possible to test everyone in the time we've got now, from the time we've been asked to the time everybody will be set up to do this we could not test all students - and certainly not all students 24 hours before they left - nobody will really be able to do that. ""So what we're focused on now is prioritising the tests. So we would look to prioritise for people who are living with someone who may be vulnerable."" The University of South Wales has more than 20,000 students taught at its campuses across Cardiff, Newport and Pontypridd. University of South Wales was formed in 2013 following the merger of Glamorgan and Newport universities Its deputy vice-chancellor Dr Ben Calvert said: ""One thing that is clear is many of our students are not necessarily students who are living with us. It isn't a situation that 20,000 are returning to their parents. We have many students who commute to us from different parts of Wales."" But he agreed with Mr Rhodes: ""I don't think we will get everybody tested. The logistics of that will be very difficult."" He said testing would focus on ""priority groups - particularly students with their own vulnerabilities or who were returning home to parents with vulnerabilities"". He also said the university was looking at an earlier end to on-campus teaching. University of Wales Trinity Saint David said it had a programme for students and staff to report cases, and currently 36 students are self-isolating. It plans to offer asymptomatic testing from the beginning of December. Cardiff University said it was waiting for more details but its aim is to offer asymptomatic testing to all students who want it - and some of its teaching provision will need to continue into December. Cardiff Metropolitan University said mass testing posed ""significant challenges"" for universities. At Wrexham Glyndwr University students would be offered tests, especially if they had plans to go home and were vulnerable - or had vulnerable contacts. Bangor University said it was ""finalising"" its plans for Christmas. And Aberystwyth University said it is in talks with the government about delivering the testing scheme to students before they leave. The Welsh Government has said students have the option to take an asymptomatic test but""must make responsible choices"",externaland it was encouraging them to do so before returning to their families. Kirsty Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in Covid cases at university Ms Williams said travelling home later than 9 December would be allowed if students need to self-isolate following a positive test. It follows asimilar announcement in England, where students are being given a week to travel home after lockdown there ends. On Wednesday, she warned no-one should travel if they have symptoms, a positive test or if they have been asked to self-isolate by a contact tracer. The timing means students can complete quarantine and be home by Christmas Eve, the minister said, but she asked students to ""stay put"" and not return home until the first week of December. Tomos Evans, president of Cardiff University Student's Union, was asked by Claire Summers if he thought some students would choose not take a test over fears a positive result would mean they had to isolate. He said: ""I can certainly imagine part of the population who would rather sort of not know. ""I think that's probably something in all of us - ignorance is bliss, in a sense - but certainly from a student's perspective I'd encourage everyone to get tested."" The Welsh Government said new Covid-19 lateral flow tests would be provided to students who are travelling home. Universities have seen a number of outbreaks since students returned in the autumn, though Ms Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in recent days. Opposition parties broadly welcomed the announcement, although the Welsh Conservatives said testing should be for ""university life, not just for Christmas"".

"This video can not be played Adrian Grant, Gareth Delbridge's nephew, said the report was ""too little, too late"" Two workers were struck and killed by a train partly because of a long-term failure by Network Rail to improve track safety, an investigation found. Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael Lewis, 58, were hit by a Swansea to Paddington train in July 2019. The Rail Accidents Investigation Branch (RAIB) said they were part of a group of six carrying out maintenance work at Margam. Network Rail said: ""It should never have happened on our railway."" In its report, the RAIB said Network Rail's ""long-term failure to improve the safety of people working on the railway"" was an underlying factor in the deaths. Gareth Delbridge (L) and Michael Lewis (R) were hit by a train in July 2019 A third worker also came ""very close"" to being hit while the group of six carried out maintenance work, it said. ""Over a period of many years, Network Rail had not adequately addressed the protection of track workers from moving trains,"" the report said. ""The major changes required to fully implement significant changes to the standard governing track worker safety were not effectively implemented across Network Rail's maintenance organisation."" Families left 'devastated' Two rail workers killed near Port Talbot It made 11 recommendations, nine aimed specifically at Network Rail - which cover safe work planning processes, developing safety behaviours among staff, and research into train horns automatically sounding when safety brakes are applied. Network Rail's route director for Wales, Billy Kelly, said thoughts remained with the family of the men, adding the way it worked was ""fundamentally changing"". ""We've already halved the amount of work taking place while lines are open to traffic and are on course to dramatically reduce it further by 2022,"" he said. ""A safety task force, comprising of more than 100 people, has also been set up to further improve safety on the railway."" The men were hit and killed by the 09:29 service from Swansea to London Paddington Mr Delbridge's son-in-law, Adrian Grant, said the family were ""devastated"" but could take comfort that they can be part of ""putting something right"". He said: ""It is a real catalogue of errors. It's very antiquated and needs updating. It needs to be brought into the 21st Century. ""Even though the report goes into improvements and what network rail are trying to improve, for these two families it's too little too late. Mr Grant said the report was a ""catalogue of errors"" ""Today both families are in shock because it brings everything flooding back but we can take a little bit of comfort from these findings. ""And we just hope our voices are heard and Network Rail follow through on the recommendations. ""We'll never have full closure. Families can be prepared for a family member who is ill or poor health but these guys just went to work, something they've done all their lives but they never came home."" RAIB chief inspector of rail accidents Simon French said: ""I remain hopeful that the rail industry will find a way to address these thorny and persistent issues. ""There is now a real sense that things must change. We've come a long way since the days when fatal accidents involving track workers were commonplace. ""However, it's now time for some clear thinking on how best to further reduce the risk to our colleagues."" There wereno formally appointed lookoutsat the site where them men were hit and killed, the report found. ""All three workers were almost certainly wearing ear defenders, because one of them was using a noisy power tool, and all had become focused on the task they were undertaking,"" it added. ""None of them was aware that the train was approaching until it was too late for them to move to a position of safety."" The men were hit and killed by the 09:29 service from Swansea to London Paddington It also detailed how the driver made an ""emergency application of the train's brakes"" about nine seconds before the accident. The train was travelling at about 50mph (80km/h) when it hit the track workers. Planning paperwork indicated work was due to start at 12:30 to coincide with the planned blockage of the a line, but workers began at about 08:50. The Office of Road and Rail, which regulates the rail industry's health and safety performance, said it would continue its own investigation while welcoming the report's findings. Chief inspector of railways Ian Prosser said: ""Track worker safety is paramount and in the 18 months prior to the incident at Margam we undertook additional inspections following our growing concerns that Network Rail was not doing enough to control risks to track workers. ""These inspections had resulted in formal enforcement action being taken. Network Rail responded by forming a significant task force to bring about much needed improvements."" Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said: ""All parties in the industry need to reflect on the implications of the report and strive to put track safety as a top priority and make the necessary changes with the aim of eliminating fatalities and serious injuries.""

"Ms Letby spoke only to confirm her name, address and date of birth during the short hearing A nurse accused of murdering eight babies and the attempted murder of another 10 has appeared in court. Lucy Letby, 30, had previously been arrested in 2018 and 2019 as part of a probe into deaths at the neo-natal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The charges relate to baby deaths and non-fatal collapses at the hospital from June 2015 to June 2016. The judge at Warrington Magistrates' Court remanded her in custody to appear at Chester Crown Court on Friday. Ms Letby, of Arran Avenue, Hereford, is accused of murdering five baby boys and three girls. She is also accused of the attempted murder of another nine babies - five boys and four girls. Lucy Letby was arrested for a third time on Tuesday Ms Letby spoke only to confirm her name, address and date of birth during the 10-minute hearing. Pascale Jones, prosecuting, told the court Ms Letby should be remanded into custody for her own safety. She said: ""The crown will also stress there is substantial grounds to believe for her own protection this defendant should be remanded into custody."" Ms Letby was rearrested by police on Tuesday as part of the investigation into the hospital and charged on Wednesday evening. A Cheshire Police investigation launched in May 2017 looked into the deaths of 17 babies and 16 non-fatal collapses at the Countess of Chester between March 2015 and July 2016. On Tuesday, the force said parents of all the babies involved were being kept fully updated on developments and were supported by officers.

"Late-night gatherings have been identified as a key source of infection spread in New York New York has introduced new restrictions aimed at curbing coronavirus, with Mayor Bill de Blasio warning it was the city's ""last chance"" to stop a second wave. Bars, restaurants and gyms must close by 22:00 and people can only meet in groups of 10 or less. The US is seeing a surge in coronavirus - a record 65,368 Americans were in hospital on Wednesday. The Covid Tracking Project also reported a record 144,270 new cases. An average of over 900 people a day are now dying with the disease. More than a million new cases in November pushed the total confirmed cases to over 10 million nationally, with 233,080 deaths so far. The US has been seeing more than 100,000 new cases per day over the last eight days in what experts say may be a worse outbreak than those seen in the spring and summer. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? How will this endless US election end? How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Experts warn hospitals across the country could soon be overwhelmed. On Wednesday a member of President-elect Joe Biden's Covid-19 advisory panel said a four to six week lockdown could bring the pandemic under control. This video can not be played Fauci: ""We have got to double down"" to fight Covid Dr Michael Osterholm said that the government could borrow enough money to cover lost income for businesses during a shutdown. ""We're seeing a national and global Covid surge, and New York is a ship on the Covid tide,"" state Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday. New measures come into effect on Friday affecting hospitality after Mr Cuomo said contact tracing identified late-night gatherings as key virus spreaders in the state. Allow Twitter content?

If the rate of spread of infection continued to rise, Mayor Blasio said the New York City's public school system would close and children would begin online classes. ""This is our last chance to stop a second wave. We can do it, but we have to act now,"" Mr de Blasio tweeted. New York City was badly hit by the virus earlier this year when nearly 18,000 people died with Covid-19 in March, April and May,according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.,external States across the US have broken new case records this week with Texas becoming the first state to hit one million total cases on Tuesday. If Texas were a separate country, it would rank 11th in the world for most cases. Other states, including Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Florida, have also seen numbers rise. CBS News reports 15 states saw the numbers of patients in hospital due to the virus double in the last month. Some hospitals, such as in Idaho and Missouri, have had to turn patients away because they ran out of room. A queue for testing in California State leaders have been re-imposing pandemic restrictions as a result. Residents of Wisconsin and Nevada have been urged to stay at home for two weeks and in Minnesota, bars and restaurants must shut by 22:00. On Tuesday, Mr Osterholm warned of a ""perfect storm"". Speaking to CBS This Morning, Mr Osterholm said there was ""no question that our hospitals are about to be overrun"". He noted ""the darkest days of this pandemic between now and next spring"", before the vaccine arrives. Mr Osterholm, who heads the infectious disease research centre at the University of Minnesota, said during the summer spike after the Labour Day national holiday, new cases rose to 32,000 a day. ""Now we're running in the 120- to 130,000 cases a day,"" he said. ""Do not be at all surprised when we hit 200,000 cases a day."" The same day, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci offered some hopeful news. He said the new Covid vaccine by Pfizer was expected to go through an emergency authorisation process in the next week or so. Human trials suggest it is 90% effective. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? Dr Fauci told MSNBC: ""I'm going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer, I trust the [Food and Drug Administration]. These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists."" Amid the ongoing outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its research around masks, saying that wearing one not only protects others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. The CDC referenced several studies, including one case where two Covid-positive hair stylists interacted with 139 clients - but of the 67 clients researchers tested, none developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. Another study looking into the outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said.

Thanks for joining us, we hope to see you again on Friday. Today's contributors were Mal Siret, Joshua Nevett, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley. If you're just catching up, here's an overview of today's headlines from the UK and around the world. In the UK:  Elsewhere around the world:    We've just got some more information on the extension of restrictions in Northern Ireland. Close contact services including hair and beauty salons and driving lessons will reopen for appointments only on Friday, 20 November. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on that date. Northern Ireland's executive has said this will not include the purchase or consumption of alcohol on such premises. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November. Our story here will continue to be updated. Emily Ashton, from Bloomberg, asks the final set of questions. She first asks Powis: Lockdown
will end 2 December, is that the right thing to do given the rise in cases? She also asks Sharma: Can you categorically say that the
supply of the vaccine wonât be affected by Brexit disruption? Powis replies that that is ""a matter for our elected representatives"" but âwe will not be going back completely to normalâ after lockdown. âExactly what those measures are [after lockdown] itâs too early to say yet,â
he says. âWe need to see what transpires over the next few weeks.â Sharma says the government has been preparing for Brexit, including investing hundreds of
millions of pounds in border infrastructure. He says the key message is that businesses ""do need to be prepared"", adding that information for them is
available on the .gov website. All bars and restaurants in England have had to close for four weeks Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday,the executive has agreed. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Macer Hall from the Daily Express asks if the government is considering compulsory vaccination. He also wants to know if there will be a certification system so people can prove they have had the vaccine. Alok Sharma begins his reply by emphasizing that the vaccines will only be rolled out if they are safe and effective. ""Then of course we will follow the advice we get from the scientists and experts,"" he adds. ""We are good at vaccinations in this country,"" says Stephen Powis. He says he believes the public has confidence in the vaccine programme and will come forward to get it. Jane Merrick from the i raises public concern about the deployment of a vaccine and has another question about the prevalence of the virus in the north west: was the tiered system enough to have an impact there? Sharma says a plan for deployment of a vaccine will be set out and that the government will continue to communicate with people on the issue. Powis says he is âconfidentâ that the tiered
system has had an effect on the transmission of the virus and the number of
infections. In Liverpool âwe are beginning to see some of the effects of
tier three,â he says. But we will not see the benefits of national restrictions
until next week, he adds. Sam Coates from Sky asks if failure to strike a trade deal with the EU would make any difference to the sourcing of vaccines. Stephen Powis says the NHS has been preparing for the UK's exit from the EU ""for some time"". He adds that the focus is on getting the vaccines to those who need it. Alok Sharma praises the work of the vaccine taskforce, noting that it has secured 350 million vaccines ""across six of the most promising vaccine candidates"". Dan Hewitt from ITV asks about the resignation of Boris Johnson's top aideamid news of infighting in No 10during a pandemic. He directs a second question to Prof Powis, asking whether he regrets stopping routine surgery in the
first wave Sharma says: âAll of us in government are focused on one thing, which is protecting lives and livelihoods.â He goes on to say they have protected ""millions of jobs"" through schemes such as furlough. Prof Powis says at the start of the pandemic in March infection
rates and hospitalisations were ""rising incredibly rapidly"" and testing was more limited. It was ""absolutely critical we had to create capacity in the NHS
not knowing how large it would be and not knowing how the public would respond
to measures"", he says. It ""was right we ensured the NHS was ready for that"". He adds: ""Of course we donât want to step down elective surgery... That is why in the second wave this autumn we havenât done
that."" Lee Cain has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks if there is concern about today's dramatic jump in infections. Stephen Powis says it is important to look at a range of data not just the numbers for a single day. However, he adds that it is clear that infections are rising - and emphasises the importance of complying with restrictions. Sophie also asks if Brexit will affect the supply chain for the vaccine. Alok Sharma says the government has been working with businesses to make sure they are prepared for 31 December, when the UK leaves the Brexit transition period. The second question is from Laura from Sheffield, who asks that if the national lockdown restrictions end on 2 December, do we go
back to the tier our area was in? Sharma says the government has ""made it clear"" that the national
restrictions ""will come to an end"" on 2 December and England ""will move back to tiered
system"". He says it's important to continue to follow the rules to stop the spread of the virus. ""As we get to 2 December the prime minister will set out more details,"" he
says. We now turn to questions, and Chris asks how the vaccine will be rolled out. Alok Sharma says people will understand that the government wants to make sure that those most at risk get the vaccine first. Stephen Powis says GPs and pharmacies are well prepared and adds that they are also looking at vaccination centres. He says he will say more in the coming weeks once we know more about the vaccine. He adds that he is ""confident the NHS will be up to this huge logistical challenge"". Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for England, says the number of patients in hospital with coronavirus ""is
still rising"". ""As we know, that number will unfortunately continue to rise if
the infection rates continue to increase in communities,"" he says. He says the news this week about a potential vaccine is ""extremely
encouraging"" and is ""welcome news"". ""But the vaccine is not here yet,"" he warns. ""That is why it is vital we continue to follow all the guidelines."" Alok Sharma welcomes this week's positive progress on the Pfizer vaccine, but warns ""we still have a lot of hurdles to come"". He urges the public to continue following the guidance. ""The virus is still there, it is still a danger,"" he says. Turning to the economic situation, Sharma says the government will be ""distributing Â£2.2bn to local authorities tomorrow to allow them to make vital grant payments to businesses affected"". ""These measures are designed to help business stay afloat,"" he says. He adds that the government's Kickstart scheme has created 19,000 jobs. It is ""a ray of hope for young people"" he says. Travellers from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar and the Turks and Caicos islands will no longer have to self-isolate when they arrive to the UK after 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Current coronavirus restrictions mean that only people with valid reasons are supposed to travel abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Greece will be removed from the travel corridor list, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos. From 04:00 on Saturday travellers to the UK from this destination will need to self-isolate. He added that the travel ban on Denmark will be extended for a further 14 days. Alok Sharma begins by going through the coronavirus figures. He says the average number of positive Covid tests is 22,524 compared to 22,398 a week ago. He also says the average number of Covid patients in hospital is 14,196 across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago. ""This is a reminder to us about why we are taking action to stop the spread of the virus,"" he says. Business Secretary Alok Sharma and the national medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, have arrived for today's press conference. We'll bring you all the news as it comes. We are expecting a government press conference to start shortly, and could hear questions on both the state of the NHS and the economy. Todayfigures revealed that NHS waiting lists have grownsince Covid struck, with nearly 140,000 people waiting over a year for routine procedures. We've also learnt thatthe UK's economy has rebounded from recessionfollowing a six month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, and the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the pandemic. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has accused President Donald Trump of ""refusing to accept reality"" in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi told a news conference that the president and Republicans had ""ignored by delay, distortion, denial"" the impact of the health and economic crisis, which she called a ""red alert"". She said the ""devastating milestone"" of 10 million Americans infected with coronavirus had been passed, listing the dire economic consequences of that. ""And what are they doing now?,"" Pelosi said, referring to the Trump administration. ""Continuing to ignore in spite of these numbers that should be so compelling. ""Every kind of avoidance of taking responsibility has been witnessed. They're engaged in an absurd circus right now, refusing to accept reality."" Trump maintains that he has handled the pandemic well, arguing that his administration has provided ample medical equipment and accelerated the development of treatments. Allow Twitter content?

"Black people are twice as likely as white people to catch the coronavirus, a study of 18 million people suggests. The research also indicates Asian people are 1.5 times more likely than white people to be infected - and may be more likely to need intensive care. Researchers say their findings are of ""urgent public-health importance"" and raise questions about how vaccines will be prioritised within at-risk groups. The work, inEClinical Medicine,external, adds support to other studies' findings. There has beenmounting evidencepeople belonging to ethnic minorities are at greater risk from Covid-19. But whether the risks centre around a higher likelihood of catching the disease or of developing more severe illness from the virus is not fully understood. The researchers at the universities of Leicester and Nottingham looked at data from eight UK and 42 US studies. Some tentative evidence suggests Asian people may be at higher risk of death than other groups, they found. But lead researcher Dr Manish Pareek said there was little evidence the risks were driven by genetic factors. People belonging to ethnic minorities were more likely to work in front-line roles and live in large households with several generations, he added. This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? Fellow lead researcher Dr Shirley Sze said: ""The clear evidence of increased risk of infection among ethnic minority groups is of urgent public health importance. ""We must work to minimise exposure to the virus in these at-risk groups by facilitating their timely access to healthcare resources and target the social and structural disparities that contribute to health inequalities."" The researchers suggest ""racism and structural discrimination may also contribute to an increased risk of worse clinical outcomes within ethnic minority communities"". It comes after a scientific adviser to the governmentpreviously suggested racism did not explain the increased riskto people belonging to ethnic minorities. Dr Raghib Ali, speaking last month at a briefing on a government report about Covid disparities, said ethnicity should no longer be used to judge whether people were at greater risk from the virus. He added focusing on all those at higher risk due to the underlying factors, such as jobs and housing, would help more people overall - from all ethnic groups. TESTING:What tests are available?

The watchdog said the BBC didn't break the law but must ""increase transparency and rebuild trust"" with women. The BBC Women group said,externalit was ""deeply disappointed by the findings"". The commission defended its ""robust investigations"", but a statement from BBC Women, which represents female employees, said the findings ""do not reflect our experiences"". The report ""does not address the systemic issue of unequal pay suggested by the hundreds of pay increases and settlements the BBC has made to women"", the group added.

She took issue with the way the commission started by looking at 1,000 complaints from female BBC employees, whittled them down to 40, before focusing on 10. ""Seriously?"" She wrote on Twitter. ""FOLLOW THE Â£Â£ INSTEAD: #BBC forced to pay out to 100s of #bbcwomen. Moral of story: don't rely on regulator but stay strong, calm, united + JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL."" More than 500 women have been awarded rises since 2017 after making pay complaints. Gracie left the BBC in August after 33 years at the corporation. Meanwhile, earlier this yearan employment tribunal foundthat Newswatch presenter Ahmed had been paid one sixth of the amount Jeremy Vine received for doing similar work on Points of View. AndSarah Montague received a Â£400,000 settlementafter being paid less than former Radio 4 co-presenters like John Humphrys and Nick Robinson. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which launched its investigation in March 2019, said the BBC accepted that ""its historical practices were not fit for purpose and has made significant changes since 2015"". BBC director general Tim Davie pledged to implement the report's recommendations, saying: ""We have to work even harder to be best in class."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed (right) won an equal pay case against the BBC in January EHRC interim chair Caroline Waters said it was ""easy to see why trust between some women at the BBC and the organisation has broken down"". She said: ""Many women felt their voices were not being heard and have been left feeling confused as to how decisions about their pay have been made. ""This took a heavy emotional toll on those involved in the process and the strength of feeling of women at the BBC should not be understated. ""While we have not found any unlawful acts in our investigation, repairing the damage caused by these issues requires continued leadership and we hope the BBC board takes forward our recommendations."" How to know if you're getting equal pay Asked why the EHRC found no unlawful pay discrimination despite the high-profile cases, Suzanne Baxter, who led the investigation, explained: ""Our work here has been carried out under the equality act, and has a different remit to an employment tribunal. ""I do understand why there might be some surprise. Our investigation is broader, we're gathering every piece of evidence we can, which isn't always available to a tribunal. ""We think we've done robust investigations. The important thing here is the recommendations we make."" EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath added that ""we're looking at overarching systems, whereas employment tribunals look at a specific case"". She said they did find ""real concerns about the overall processes which led to concerns about trust and transparency"", and acknowledged that ""this is about real lives [of the women] at the centre of this investigation"". She added: ""We talked to them, they had gone though humiliation, anxiety, insomnia, were signed off work. One woman waited 370 days, another woman was passed between eight people in 10 months. These are real people having a terrible time."" Ms Baxter said she was ""very confident our recommendations will make a difference to women going forward"". The recommendations include better record keeping and a more transparent grievance process that it is done within a ""reasonable time limit"". The BBC has also been told to continue improving training and guidance for BBC staff making decisions about pay, and reviewing pay frameworks regularly. Tim Davie replaced Tony Hall as director general of the BBC in September Welcoming the report, Mr Davie said: ""Trust is vitally important and as an organisation that serves the public, the BBC must continue to lead the way on pay transparency and fairness. We are committed to building a truly inclusive culture. ""We agree with the Commission that we should continue to deliver on our reform programme which began in 2015. We accept every one of their recommendations and will implement them."" But the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said the report was not based on ""robust research"" because the ""strongest cases"" of pay discrimination were not properly examined. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said many members would feel the report ""doesn't address their lived experiences"" and there were ""still vital changes that need to take place"". Broadcasting union Bectu said the report ""highlights the importance of transparency in pay and terms and conditions"" and there are ""still improvements to be made, particularly in relation to pay progression"". Differences between men and women were exposed whenthe corporation published its first star salaries listin 2017. Only two of the top 14 earners were women, and men made up about two-thirds of the overall list. The corporation said most of the 500 salary increases rises awarded to women since 2017 related to the issue of fair pay rather than equal pay, and that 99% of pay queries had now been resolved. Four equal pay cases are still going through the tribunal process, with three more being dealt with by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas).

"The Queen is Britain's longest reigning monarch and the longest reigning living monarch in the world A ""once-in-a-generation show"" over a four-day bank holiday weekend will mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in 2022. The Queen, 94, hopes as many people as possible across the UK will have the opportunity to join the celebrations, Buckingham Palace said. She will have reigned for 70 years on 6 February 2022 but plans are in place to stage a series of events from 2-5 June. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be a ""truly historic moment"" and deserved a ""celebration to remember"". He added it would ""bring the entire nation and the Commonwealth together."" The events will reflect the Queen's reign, the longest of any British sovereign, and her impact on the UK and the world since her accession to the throne in 1952. MPs and peers search for gift fit for the Queen To create the four-day weekend in June 2022, the late May Spring Bank Holiday that year will be moved to Thursday 2 June and an additional Bank Holiday on Friday 3 June will be created. Mr Dowden told MPs that ministers were working with the Royal Household, the devolved administrations and ""leading creative minds"" to make this a ""jubilee weekend to remember - one that mixes the best of British ceremonial splendour and pageantry with cutting edge artistic and technological display"". He added there were also plans to plant trees across the UK to commemorate the occasion. 2 June 1953- The Queen's coronation 14 November 1973- The wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips 7 June 1977Â - The Queen's Silver Jubilee 29 July 1981- The wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer 3 June 2002- The Queen's Golden Jubilee 29 April 2011- The wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton 5 June 2012- The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Members of the Royal Family are expected to take part in the celebrations over the extended weekend and in the run-up to it. In keeping with tradition established with previous royal milestones, a Platinum Jubilee medal will be awarded to people who work in public service, including representatives of the Armed Forces, the emergency services and the prison services. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle announcedplans to commemorate the anniversary in Parliament. A stained-glass window was placed in the Palace of Westminster as a gift to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, and a sundial was built in parliamentary grounds for the Golden Jubilee. MPs and peers will be invited to fund the gift at their own discretion, Sir Lindsay said. The Queen toured the country for her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""The Platinum Jubilee offers an opportunity for the Queen to express her thanks for the support and loyalty Her Majesty has received throughout her reign. ""The Queen hopes that as many people as possible will have the opportunity to join the celebrations."" Like for the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February. The Queen also became monarch on the day of the death of her father King George VI and and is known not to want to celebrate on the specific day of his anniversary. The Queen marked her Golden Jubilee in 2002 The Royal Household and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) are organising the commemorations. The DCMS has said ""spectacular"" moments in London and other major cities will be complemented by events in communities across the UK and the Commonwealth.

"Ron Klain (left) with Mr Biden at a meeting in 2014 US President-elect Joe Biden has picked veteran political operative Ron Klain to be White House chief of staff. Mr Klain has served as a top aide to Mr Biden since the 1980s in the Senate and later when he was vice-president. The ultimate Washington insider, Mr Klain was also a senior White House aide to Barack Obama and chief of staff to Vice-President Al Gore. He was played by actor Kevin Spacey in the movie Recount, about the presidential election of 2000. The White House chief of staff - who manages the president's daily schedule and is often described as his gatekeeper - is a political appointee who does not require confirmation by the Senate. Live updates Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? Mr Biden paid tribute to Mr Klain in a statement issued by his transition team on Wednesday. ""His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum,"" said Mr Biden, ""is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again."" This video can not be played A transgender state senator and the youngest congressman are among the new faces making US political history In the same statement, Mr Klain said he was ""humbled"" by the president-elect's confidence in him. ""I look forward to helping him and the vice president-elect assemble a talented and diverse team to work in the White House, as we tackle their ambitious agenda for change, and seek to heal the divides in our country,"" said Mr Klain. He served as chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1989-92 when Mr Biden was chairman. He was also an adviser and speechwriter on Mr Biden's unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House campaigns. Mr Klain served as chief of staff to Mr Biden from 2009 to 2011, the first few years of Mr Biden's tenure as vice-president in the Obama White House. He later served as President Obama's ""Ebola czar"" during a minor outbreak of the deadly disease in 2014. The longstanding Democratic operative was also involved in both of Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns and was an adviser to John Kerry's failed White House run in 2004. He has been a presidential debate coach for Mr Clinton, Mr Gore, Mr Kerry, Mr Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden. This video can not be played President Trump attended a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery His role as chief of staff to Mr Gore, who retracted his initial concession in the disputed White House election of 2000, was turned into the HBO drama Recount. ""The plural of chad is chad?"" Mr Klain, played by Spacey, asks at one point in the film, referring to the fragments of punched ballots that became critical to the tally in Florida. Mr Gore's Republican opponent, George W Bush, was ultimately declared the winner. This video can not be played 'Now the world sees our vote matters' - how Biden depended on black voters Mr Klain often tweets about the episode, only last year posting: ""People frequently tell me that I should 'get over' the 2000 election and the recount. I haven't, and I don't think I ever will."" After his work on the Gore campaign, Mr Klain worked as a high-powered Washington lobbyist for a mortgage giant and a drugmaker that was under congressional investigation. He fell out with the now-president-elect five years ago after throwing in his lot with Mrs Clinton's campaign when Mr Biden, then-US vice-president, still hoped to compete for the party nomination. ""It's been a little hard for me to play such a role in the Biden demise,"" Mr Klain wrote of the man he had served as chief of staff in an email to Clinton presidential campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2015. ""I am definitely dead to them - but I'm glad to be on Team HRC,"" he added, using Mrs Clinton's initials. The message was disclosed by Wikileaks following a hack and Mr Klain refused to comment on the controversy in August when it was reported by news outlet, Politico. Mr Klain has since worked his way back into Mr Biden's good graces. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" During this year's White House race, President Donald Trump repeatedly mentioned Mr Klain as he attacked Mr Biden. The Republican president kept referring to Mr Klain's critical remarks about how the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2014-15 had been handled in the US. About 12,500 Americans died, though that disease was much less lethal than Covid-19. Mr Klain, appearing last year on a panel discussion, said: ""We did every possible thing wrong. And it's, you know, 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it's just purely a fortuity that this isn't one of the great mass casualty events in American history."" This video can not be played Why did so many Latinos back Trump? Mr Trump used Mr Klain's remarks as he sought to rebut Mr Biden's argument that he would bring experience and competence to handling America's current coronavirus crisis. Mr Biden is pressing ahead with preparations to assume the presidency despite Mr Trump's lack of a concession after all major US TV networks projected last Saturday that the Democrat had won the White House race. On Wednesday, he continued to field phone calls from foreign leaders, speaking to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. But the US Department of State, according to media reports, is not forwarding congratulatory messages to Mr Biden passed through diplomatic channels nor assisting foreign governments trying to contact the president-elect. This is because the General Services Administration, which helps co-ordinate presidential transitions, is yet to formally recognise the victory. The state department has in the past helped to facilitate and translate calls between a president-elect and foreign leaders but the Biden team is operating on its own, the BBC's US partner, CBS News, reports. This video can not be played Biden: ""Embarrassment"" that Trump has not conceded the election The president-elect has pledged to shape one of the most diverse presidential cabinets ever. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who was Mr Biden's biggest rival for the party nomination this year, told CNN on Wednesday he would be interested in becoming secretary of labour. According to the New York Times he is being considered but no deal has been made. Chris Coons, who took over Mr Biden's Senate seat in Delaware and serves on the Senate foreign relations committee, has been hotly tipped to become secretary of state. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and former Biden rival for the party nomination, is being talked about as possible treasury secretary. Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and Atlanta Federal Reserve president Raphael Bostic, who would be the first-African-American in the role, are also names being considered.

"The train came off the tracks as it passed through platform one at Sheffield station The derailment of a freight train as it passed through a station is likely to cause disruption for several days, officials say. The 34-wagon cement-carrying train derailed at low speed at Sheffield station, at 02:45 GMT on Wednesday. No-one was injured. But ""significant damage"" was caused and the train will need to be removed by crane, Network Rail said. It said repair work would cause disruption ""over the coming days"". A number of the wagons came off the tracks while passing though platform one on route from Hope, Derbyshire, to Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The arrival of the cranes will require a partial road closure of the A61 Sheaf Street, which runs in front of the station. The train was travelling from Hope to Dewsbury when it derailed An investigation into the derailment has been launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB). Read more news from across Yorkshire Network Rail route director Matt Rice, said: ""This is a significant incident, so it's only right that we take time to find out all of the facts and understand what has caused this. ""Once it is safe to do so, we will start work to remove the train, better assess the extent of the damage and make a plan for repairs.

"This video can not be played Hong Kong opposition members announce mass resignation The Chinese government has condemned the mass resignation of most of Hong Kong's opposition from parliament as an ""open challenge"" to its authority. Nearly all pro-democracy lawmakers quit in protest after four of their colleagues were deemed threats to national security and dismissed. Many see Hong Kong's limited democracy as now being in its death throes. The UK government has accused China of breaching its commitments to protect Hong Kong's autonomy. The former British colony became part of China in 1997 but was promised it could keep some unique freedoms for 50 years. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said of Wednesday's move to remove the four lawmakers: ""Beijing's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong constitutes a clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration. ""China has once again broken its promises and undermined Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy."" The US also condemned what had happened,external, saying it was a move towards ""one-party dictatorship"", whilethe EU called for an immediate reversal of the decision.,external Hong Kong's government and authorities in Beijing have defended the disqualifications as lawful. This video can not be played Tea, drugs and war: Hong Kong's British history explained They were based on new rules from China saying elected legislators should be disqualified if they support Hong Kong's independence, refuse to acknowledge China's sovereignty, ask foreign forces to interfere in the city's affairs, or in other ways threaten national security. Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? The mainland authorities in Beijing have taken increasingly repressive measures in Hong Kong since mass protests rocked the city last year. Activists have fled and political parties have disbanded following Beijing's passing of a new National Security Law in June, which criminalises vague acts including ""subversion"". The imposition of the law was also deemed by Britain to have breached the joint declaration, which was signed in 1984. On Thursday, in response to the disqualification of their colleagues, 15 lawmakers sent in their resignation letters. Their exodus will leave a once-vibrant legislature filled with politicians seen as loyal to the mainland authorities. In a last act of defiance, one opposition lawmaker unfurled a banner in the assembly building on Thursday saying the city's leader, Carrie Lam, was hurting Hong Kong. ""She will stink for 10,000 years,"" it read. A last act of defiance from Hong Kong's opposition China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Thursday said the mass walk-out openly challenged the central government's authority and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution. It also said the move showed pro-democracy lawmakers' ""stance of stubborn resistance"" against the central government. ""If these lawmakers hope to make use of their resignation to provoke radical opposition and beg for foreign interference, they have miscalculated,"" a spokesperson said. by Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The four disqualified lawmakers will not face further consequences - at least for now. The decision to oust the lawmakers ""is not equivalent to any criminal proceedings"", government adviser Ronny Tong told me. The National Security Law, which took effect in June 30, is not retrospective, even though it is often criticised as broad and vague. On the other hand, political commentator Johnny Lau believes that Beijing has already achieved what he sees as its sole purpose - seizing control of the city's legislature, thus leaving no need for further action. ""The legislature is crippled,"" he says, adding that any further crackdown on the four lawmakers could be counterproductive and lead to more public sympathy. Instead, Mr Lau says, Beijing will focus its energy on passing laws deemed beneficial to the mainland in the remaining term of the parliament. One of the lawmakers who resigned, Claudia Mo, told the BBC that she and her colleagues felt they had to take a stand. ""We owe a display of solidarity with our colleagues who were ousted,"" she said. ""We need to protest against what could be the ultimate Beijing crackdown on Hong Kong - to silence the last bit of dissent in the city. ""They're lining us up to oust us bit by bit. What's the point of staying on like this, thinking will I be ousted today or not?"" China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong activist hailed as the 'real Mulan' The city's 70-seat legislature has 21 opposition members. Only two of those will now remain in the parliament. Hong Kong has seen waves of sometimes violent protests The four had already been disqualified from running in the next election, originally scheduled for September 2020 but postponed to next year. But until now they had remained in parliament. Beijing and Hong Kong officials have not given details on how exactly the four men had contravened the rules. All four are considered moderates and they have never supported Hong Kong independence. Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Kwok Ka-ki, Kenneth Leung and Dennis Kwok Alvin Yeung: Leader of the pro-democracy Civic party and a practising barrister. He was banned from taking part in this year's election after he signed a joint letter to US senators calling for sanctions on Hong Kong. Dennis Kwok: The barrister is a founding member of the Civic Party. He was earlier accused of paralysing LegCo by using filibustering tactics, ina move the Chinese government called ""malicious"",external. He was banned from elections after signing the sanctions letter. Kenneth Leung: The senior tax consultant is a member of the pro-democracy parliamentary group, the Professionals Guild. According to news site SCMP, officials barred him from the elections after accusing him of indirectly appealing to the US government for sanctions. Kwok Ka-ki: The Civic Party member was also barred from contesting in this year's elections. However, the urologist did not sign the joint letter or attend a trip to the US. Officials said he had a ""purported intention to call on foreign powers to sanction Hong Kong"", according to SCMP. The developments underscore the rapid expansion of Beijing's influence in the territory, pushing for loyalty from all levels of power. Observers say that without the pro-democracy lawmakers, there will be no effective opposition and LegCo will be reduced to a rubber-stamp parliament. Why students abroad fear Hong Kong's new law The city's leader is already chosen by pro-Beijing committees, and only half of the LegCo seats are directly elected. Hong Kong's LegCo - critics say it will now merely be a rubber-stamp legislature Under the terms of the handover between Britain and China, Hong Kong was meant to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech for 50 years. The ""one country, two systems"" principle - named so because such rights do not exist elsewhere in China - is enshrined in the Basic Law.

Biden has expressed condolences to the families and friends of five American peacekeepers who died in a helicopter crash in Egypt's Sinai peninsula earlier on Thursday. In a tweet, the US president-elect also wished ""a speedy recovery"",externalto one US national who survived the crash. ""I join all Americans in honouring their sacrifice, as I keep their loved ones in my prayers,"" Biden wrote. The American death toll was initially given as six before later being revised to five.

The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) said the helicopter came down during a routine mission near the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.,external A French citizen and a Czech citizen also died. An investigation is now under way into what caused the crash. Read our full story here Twitter says that approximately 300,000 ""disputed and potentially misleading"" tweets had additional context added to them in the two-week period around the election, according to a report it released today. That represents some 0.2% of all election-related tweets sent during their study. Around 450 tweets were subjected to further censoring, with warning labels applied and restrictions about how they could be shared. The report,externalfocused on tweets sent from 27 October to 11 November. As you're probably aware, dozens of Trump tweets (including those claiming he had won re-election) were flagged under the Twitter rules that were temporarily put in place for the election. Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said. The analysis comes as Twitter begins to roll back some of their election-time restrictions. Donald Trump has issued an order banning American investments in Chinese firms the government determines have ties to the Chinese military. Inthe order,,externalTrump accused China of ""increasingly exploiting"" US investors ""to finance the development and modernisation of its military"". The ban is to go into effect in January. It could affect some of China's biggest publicly-listed firms, including China Telecom and tech firm Hikvision. Throughout his administration, Trump has made efforts to disentangle the US from its close economic ties with China. Read our full story here Joe Biden has been projected to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to beat Donald Trump in the race to the White House. What happens now? The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern. Read more here With just two weeks until Thanksgiving, the mayor of Chicago has issued a month-long advisory for residents to stay at home, warning that 1,000 more people could die in the city by the end of the year if no action is taken to stop the spread of coronavirus. Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

""If these lawmakers hope to make use of their resignation to provoke radical opposition and beg for foreign interference, they have miscalculated,"" a spokesperson said. by Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong The four disqualified lawmakers will not face further consequences - at least for now. The decision to oust the lawmakers ""is not equivalent to any criminal proceedings"", government adviser Ronny Tong told me. The National Security Law, which took effect in June 30, is not retrospective, even though it is often criticised as broad and vague. On the other hand, political commentator Johnny Lau believes that Beijing has already achieved what he sees as its sole purpose - seizing control of the city's legislature, thus leaving no need for further action. ""The legislature is crippled,"" he says, adding that any further crackdown on the four lawmakers could be counterproductive and lead to more public sympathy. Instead, Mr Lau says, Beijing will focus its energy on passing laws deemed beneficial to the mainland in the remaining term of the parliament. One of the lawmakers who resigned, Claudia Mo, told the BBC that she and her colleagues felt they had to take a stand. ""We owe a display of solidarity with our colleagues who were ousted,"" she said. ""We need to protest against what could be the ultimate Beijing crackdown on Hong Kong - to silence the last bit of dissent in the city. ""They're lining us up to oust us bit by bit. What's the point of staying on like this, thinking will I be ousted today or not?"" China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong activist hailed as the 'real Mulan' The city's 70-seat legislature has 21 opposition members. Only two of those will now remain in the parliament. Hong Kong has seen waves of sometimes violent protests The four had already been disqualified from running in the next election, originally scheduled for September 2020 but postponed to next year. But until now they had remained in parliament. Beijing and Hong Kong officials have not given details on how exactly the four men had contravened the rules. All four are considered moderates and they have never supported Hong Kong independence. Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Kwok Ka-ki, Kenneth Leung and Dennis Kwok Alvin Yeung: Leader of the pro-democracy Civic party and a practising barrister. He was banned from taking part in this year's election after he signed a joint letter to US senators calling for sanctions on Hong Kong. Dennis Kwok: The barrister is a founding member of the Civic Party. He was earlier accused of paralysing LegCo by using filibustering tactics, ina move the Chinese government called ""malicious"",external. He was banned from elections after signing the sanctions letter. Kenneth Leung: The senior tax consultant is a member of the pro-democracy parliamentary group, the Professionals Guild. According to news site SCMP, officials barred him from the elections after accusing him of indirectly appealing to the US government for sanctions. Kwok Ka-ki: The Civic Party member was also barred from contesting in this year's elections. However, the urologist did not sign the joint letter or attend a trip to the US. Officials said he had a ""purported intention to call on foreign powers to sanction Hong Kong"", according to SCMP. The developments underscore the rapid expansion of Beijing's influence in the territory, pushing for loyalty from all levels of power. Observers say that without the pro-democracy lawmakers, there will be no effective opposition and LegCo will be reduced to a rubber-stamp parliament. Why students abroad fear Hong Kong's new law The city's leader is already chosen by pro-Beijing committees, and only half of the LegCo seats are directly elected. Hong Kong's LegCo - critics say it will now merely be a rubber-stamp legislature Under the terms of the handover between Britain and China, Hong Kong was meant to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech for 50 years. The ""one country, two systems"" principle - named so because such rights do not exist elsewhere in China - is enshrined in the Basic Law.

The crash happened in Edmonton shortly before 19:00 GMT on Wednesday. The man then left the car and tried to set fire to the road using petrol, police said. Footage, posted on social media, showed a vehicle partially embedded in the entrance of the building. A man, aged 45, has been arrested on suspicion of arson, affray and criminal damage. He remains in custody. The Met Police said the incident was not being treated as terror-related. Both the London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were called to the crash on Fore Street.

"Senior Democrats urge Republicans to ""accept reality"" over the US presidential election President Trump is yet to concede and many other Republicans continue to back him Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the ""absurd circus"" meant the coronavirus pandemic was being neglected US President-elect Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, spoke with the Pope on Thursday Biden announces his chief of staff - his long-standing aide Ron Klain Reports suggest the Trump administration is withholding support from the incoming leader Three states have yet to be projected - Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina But Biden has an unassailable tally of 279 under the electoral college system, BBC projects Edited by Tom Spender We're pausing our live coverage of the US election aftermath - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap - here are the key developments in the past 24 hours:  Thursday's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington - Mal Siret, Ritu Prasad, Vicky Bisset, Yaroslav Lukov, Max Matza, Patrick Jackson and Thomas Spender. Biden has expressed condolences to the families and friends of five American peacekeepers who died in a helicopter crash in Egypt's Sinai peninsula earlier on Thursday. In a tweet, the US president-elect also wished ""a speedy recovery"",externalto one US national who survived the crash. ""I join all Americans in honouring their sacrifice, as I keep their loved ones in my prayers,"" Biden wrote. The American death toll was initially given as six before later being revised to five.

The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) said the helicopter came down during a routine mission near the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.,external A French citizen and a Czech citizen also died. An investigation is now under way into what caused the crash. Read our full story here Twitter says that approximately 300,000 ""disputed and potentially misleading"" tweets had additional context added to them in the two-week period around the election, according to a report it released today. That represents some 0.2% of all election-related tweets sent during their study. Around 450 tweets were subjected to further censoring, with warning labels applied and restrictions about how they could be shared. The report,externalfocused on tweets sent from 27 October to 11 November. As you're probably aware, dozens of Trump tweets (including those claiming he had won re-election) were flagged under the Twitter rules that were temporarily put in place for the election. Overall, about 75% of people that viewed the tweets in question did so after the labels were applied, Twitter says. The number of times the labelled tweets were shared in quote tweets was also down by nearly 30%, the firms said. The analysis comes as Twitter begins to roll back some of their election-time restrictions. Donald Trump has issued an order banning American investments in Chinese firms the government determines have ties to the Chinese military. Inthe order,,externalTrump accused China of ""increasingly exploiting"" US investors ""to finance the development and modernisation of its military"". The ban is to go into effect in January. It could affect some of China's biggest publicly-listed firms, including China Telecom and tech firm Hikvision. Throughout his administration, Trump has made efforts to disentangle the US from its close economic ties with China. Read our full story here Joe Biden has been projected to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to beat Donald Trump in the race to the White House. What happens now? The former vice-president does not get to move his furniture into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue straight away - there are a few things that need to happen first. It's usually a smooth process, but there are extra complications this time due to probable legal challenges to the election. The presidential transition is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. The incoming president assembles a group called a transition team who prepare to assume power immediately after inauguration - and the Biden team has already set up atransition website,external. They will pick people to serve in the cabinet, discuss policy priorities and prepare to govern. Read more here With just two weeks until Thanksgiving, the mayor of Chicago has issued a month-long advisory for residents to stay at home, warning that 1,000 more people could die in the city by the end of the year if no action is taken to stop the spread of coronavirus. Citing an ""alarming and ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases"",  Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on people in the city to remain at home except for essential reasons, to stop having guests from other households, avoid non-essential travel, and cancel ""traditional Thanksgiving plans"". She said that cases had risen from 500 per day a month ago to at least 1,9000 currently. While the mayor did not order a complete shutdown, she also announced a 10-person limit on social gatherings. Both measures will come into effect from 06:00 on Monday morning. Chicago is the latest US region to impose new restrictions as a second wave gathers pace in the US. President-elect Biden has made tackling the virus his top priority. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown but the top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that won't be necessary if people wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. Chuck Schumer (L) and Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters about the transition earlier on Thursday Biden has had talks with two top Democratic politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer. In a statement, the president-elect thanked them for their congratulations on his election victory and ""expressed his commitment to uniting the country after a hard-fought campaign"". The three leaders also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and the country's economy, saying that many Americans were facing a ""growing economic pain"". Hand counts in more than half of Arizona's counties show no evidence of discrepencies or other voting issues. Figures published by the state's official website,externalshowed that the audits covered districts where the vast majority of the state's votes were cast, including its major cities. The audit compared a hand-counted sample of ballots to the results of a machine count. Of Arizona's 15 countries, at least two districts did not perform audits because the Republican party had not designated the required members for a vote to proceed, while a number of others are yet to post their results. Arizona is one of three states yet to be projected, but current figures show a more than 11,000-vote lead for President-elect Joe Biden. More results from the state, which has 11 electoral college votes, are expected soon. President Donald Trump has still not conceded the election, despite projections showing a clear victory for his rival. He has continued to make repeated - and unfounded - allegations of fraud during the election. Attendees at a Proud Boys rally in Oregon in September A pro-Trump rally planned for Washington DC this weekend could bring violence to the nation's capital, according to experts on extremism. The Proud Boys, the group that Trump refused to condemn in his first debate and who have a reputation for street fights with their opponents, are planning to host the event despite not having a permit from local authorities. Members of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters militias have also said they will be attending, as have white nationalists and proponents of conspiracy theories. Pizzagate conspiracy proponent Alex Jones is reportedly leading a caravan from Texas and plans to bring a ""battle tank"". Police in Washington have warned attendees of the rally, dubbed variously the ""Million MAGA Marchâ, the âStop the Stealâ protest and the âMarch for Trumpâ, to leave guns at home or risk arrest. Experts say the groups could clash with counter-protesters outside the White House. This comes just days after businesses in Washington, and in cities around the US, began removing plywood barricades that were put up in the event of election-related unrest. It is not known how many votes could be affected by the court ruling A court in Pennsylvania has backed a complaint by the Trump camp, ruling that the key swing state may not count ballots where the voters had to provide identification proof and failed to do so by 9 November. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar had earlier extended the submission process for such voters until 12 November. But the court said on Thursday that she ""lacked statutory authority"" to provide this guidance,external, adding that all such votes may not be counted. It's unclear how many ballots are affected by the court verdict, and whether the Biden camp plans to appeal. The Democrat is currently leading Trump by just over 40,000 votes. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been days since the White House race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Donald Trump has yet to concede - or show any signs of acknowledging his defeat. Instead, he is making unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud, which he says tipped the race to Biden. The maths, however, are daunting - he trails by tens of thousands of votes in several states he would have to overturn in order to succeed. Most see it as a lost cause. Trump's position, in defiance of political norms and traditions, is sending tremors throughout the nation, as public officials and American voters react to a situation that, while telegraphed for months in advance, is still travelling uncharted terrain. Read more from Anthony on how some key groups are handling these days of uncertainty and how it might all play out Senator Lindsey Graham has joined a small but growing number of senior Republicans who say that Joe Biden should receive the presidential-level security briefings. When asked by journalists on Thursday whether Biden should have access to the President's Daily Briefing, Graham - who is an ally of Donald Trump - responded: ""I think so."" The top secret document is given every day to the US president and is customarily also made available to incoming presidents, but has been denied to Biden as Trump's administration refuses to accept the Democratic victory. As we've already reported, more than 150 former US officials warned today that witholding the briefing could damage US national security. Other Republicans expressing support for Biden receiving the briefing include the Senate's president pro tempore, Chuck Grassley, and Senate Majority Whip John Thune, both of whom spoke to CNN. However, not all senior members of the party agree. ""He's not president right now,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said of Biden. ""Don't know if he'll be president January 20th. But whoever is will get the information."" Earlier today, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell ignored reporters questions about the briefings as he made his way to the Senate floor. Brad Raffensperger earlier this week said there would be a manual recount in Georgia Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says he will start self-isolating after his wife Tricia tested positive for Covid-19. This comes as the key battleground state is preparing to manually recount votes in the presidential election. Biden currently has a razor-thin lead in the southern state, which carries 16 Electoral College votes. Earlier on Thursday, top Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski was confirmed to have been infected. The Republican party has become more authoritarian in recent years, an academic report has found, with one of the authors noting that the party's response to the 2020 election is likely to show a further drop in democratic behaviour. ""It is disturbing that most leading Republicans are still not objecting to President Trump's baseless claims of electoral fraud and attempts to declare himself the winner,"" Anna LÃ¼hrmann, a former MP and political scientist at the University of Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute,told the Washington Post,external. V-Dem's report,external, which was released last month and based on data until the end of 2018, ""shows that the Republican party in
the US has retreated from upholding democratic norms in recent
years"", adding that its rhetoric resembled that of ""authoritarian parties"" in power in Turkey and Hungary. However it said this was a global trend, with the ""median governing party"" in democracies having become more illiberal over recent decades. The Democratic
party, in contrast, ""has retained a commitment to longstanding democratic
standards"", it said. The data comes from the university's project into political parties around the world, with 665 country experts assessing each party's adherence to a number of democratic principles. Marco Rubio has called for the transition to get under way A number of leading Republicans have broken ranks, either congratulating Biden on his election victory or at least pushing for a smooth transition at the White House - despite the fact that Trump is refusing to concede. The group may be small - but it is growing and includes: Senators  Representatives  Meanwhile Democratic Senator Chris Coons from Delaware told CNN some Republicans are asking him to congratulate Biden on their behalf because they don't feel able to do so publicly. ""They call me to say, you know, 'Congratulations, please convey my well wishes to the President-elect, but I can't say that publicly yet',"" he told the broadcaster. ""My job here, I think, is to continue to urge them privately to do the right thing,"" he added. Several governors and former President George W Bush have also congratulated Biden. Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."" To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. George W Bush and Al Gore pictured in 2000 So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater. So what happened in Florida, and how is this year's election different? Find outhere Former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel joined dozens of ex-officials in signing the letter More than 150 former national security officials in the US have
joined the prominent voices urging the Trump administration to recognise Joe Biden as the
next president. In a letter to the General Services Administration, which was sent on Thursday,externaland obtained by news website Politico, they said that ""delaying the transition further poses a serious risk to our national security"". Under the Presidential Transition Act, the General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. But the body has so far declined to formally recognise Biden as president-elect, meaning that he is unable to access information such as the president's daily brief or obtain security clearances for key members of his transition team, as is usually the case after an election. The former officials noted that the 9/11 Commission had found that delays in transition after the 2000 election had led to key national security bodies not being fully staffed for six months, leaving ""our country more vulnerable to foreign adversaries"". ""In this moment of uncertainty, we must put politics aside,"" the letter concluded, warning that further delays would compromise ""the continuity and readiness of our national leadership, with potentially immense consequences for our national security"". The letter was signed by dozens of former officials, including former Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, former CIA and NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Other key former officials in the US and abroad have warned over the delay in transition, including former heads of the Department for Homeland Security and the Elders, a group of former heads of state founded by Nelson Mandela. Trump's own relationship with the leader of the Catholic faith got off to a rocky start during his 2016 campaign, after the Pope questioned whether Trump was really a Christian. ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,""Pope Francis saidwhen asked about Trump and his policy proposal of constructing a wall on the US-Mexico border. Trump hit back, calling it""disgraceful""that the Pope would say such a thing about him. ""No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith,"" he said. He also blamed the Mexican government, which he claimed ""convinced him that Trump is not a good guy"". Despite their differences, Trump travelled to Rome in 2017 wherehe held a 30 minute private meetingwith the pontiff. The two men have disagreed on many subjects, such as immigration, but on the topic of abortion, they seemed to agree. The Vatican statement after the meeting highlighted âthe joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscienceâ. This video can not be played Dr 
Anthony Fauci, America's top US infectious diseases expert, has said the country needs to 
""double down"" on public health measures such as mask-wearing and social 
distancing. Dr Fauci warned that the cold weather made for a 
""challenging and ominous situation"". His 
comments come as the US is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 
100,000 new infections per day for the past week. President-elect Joe Biden says he will make tackling the virus his top priority when he takes office. One of his coronavirus advisers has suggested a 4-6-week national lockdown. Biden met Pope Francis during the latter's 2015 trip to the US Joe Biden, who is to be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy, spoke on the phone with Pope Francis this morning, his transition team just announced. Biden, who is a devout member of the faith, ""thanked His Holiness for extending blessing and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" according to the readout of their call. ""The president-elected expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.""

"Sir Keir Starmer at a 2019 People's Vote campaign rally Two key members of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet have called for the party to issue a '""full throated apology"" for its stance on Brexit. Ex-party chairman Ian Lavery and former elections chief Jon Trickett say backing a second referendum at last year's election destroyed trust. In a new report, the pair call for the current leadership to apologise to both Remain and Leave voters. Sir Keir Starmer was a leading advocate of another referendum. The party's then Brexit spokesman was elected to replace Mr Corbyn as leader in April. In their report, to be published later, Mr Lavery  and Mr Trickett - who were both fired from the front bench by Sir Keir - say Leave and Remain voters were equally let down by the party's Brexit policy at the 2019 election. Can Starmer keep hold of his party machine? New leader not enough for victory - Labour report Labour leadership takes blame over election result ""Leave voters were too often sneered at and Remain voters were led up the garden path with a position - of overturning the referendum result - that was never seriously achievable. ""To put this aside, Leavers and Remainers need an apology."" The pair's report, entitled No Holding Back, was co-written with former MP Laura Smith, who lost Crewe and Nantwich to the Conservatives at the 2019 election. It is result of zoom conversations with Labour activists, trade unionists, voters and former voters. And the report indeed does not hold back on what the authors think went wrong at the general election. Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett maintain they warned their shadow cabinet colleagues of the electoral consequences of backing a second referendum. They say: ""Our argument, back in the summer of 2019, that seeking to overturn the referendum would lead to electoral disaster in the North and the Midlands was drowned out by other elements in the top ranks of the Partyâ¦ we opposed the moves which were made to turn the party into a Remain-facing political unit."" But their criticisms go beyond Brexit. Ian Lavery on the campaign trail last year The party machine was in 2019 under the control of Jeremy Corbyn's allies  - and Ian Lavery in particular played a prominent role in touring seats Labour needed to win or couldn't afford to lose. But the report acknowledges serious mistakes. It argues that ""we did not develop a narrative that threaded our policies together and told a story about what Labour would do in power. ""â¦ the 2019 general election was a hard lesson in how not to do policy - it was confused, contradictory in some places and was not believable to most voters."" The report analyses why Labour has recovered in the polls since Sir Keir Starmer became leader, It suggests he is picking up more support amongst former Liberal Democrats and middle-class voters in the South. In Leave-voting areas, the report argues that there has been ""a glacial pace of change among voters who are still overwhelmingly in the Tory camp. At present Sir Keir Starmer's leadership is yet to cut through."" Jon Trickett was a key member of Mr Corbyn's team Supporters of the current Labour leader maintain that Jeremy Corbyn was mentioned on the doorsteps during last year's election as a reason for not voting Labour more often than Brexit. And Sir Keir Starmer's personal ratings have not only been much higher than his predecessor's but have also run ahead of the prime minister's in some polls. The report acknowledges that the Corbyn leadership and his perceived lack of patriotism was an issue at the last election. It says that it had been a failing of the then leadership not to ""re-interpret what patriotism really means in a progressive sense"". But it also claims that ""media smears"" meant that he was viewed less favourably by the public in 2019 than at the 2017 election. The report suggests Labour's problems go much deeper than the issues of Brexit and leadership - that for too long in predominantly working class areas, voters felt they were being taken for granted - and that Labour was seen as the establishment party. From conversations with activists and trade unionists, the report's authors say: ""People repeatedly claimed that Labour had become too southern and too middle class."" They have some recommendations, too - including, when candidates are selected, introducing quotas for those from working-class backgrounds. Close to general elections, supporters of the party leadership - under Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn - have been selected with little say from local members. ""The old days of parachuting political professionals into working-class communities that they have no connection to must now end in totality,"" says the report. And while Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett left the shadow cabinet at Sir Keir Starmer's request, they have what they call some ""comradely advice"" for him: ""be bold and transformational"". Criticism of the Starmer leadership had been fairly muted until the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn. But the report from Jon Trickett, Ian Lavery and Laura Smith could signal a renewed willingness to speak out. Closely-fought elections to Labour's  ruling national executive conclude on Thursday, and will determine whether the Left's influence will continue to wane, or whether grassroots members want to limit Sir Keir's growing control of the party machine.

"The train came off the tracks as it passed through platform one at Sheffield station The derailment of a freight train as it passed through a station is likely to cause disruption for several days, officials say. The 34-wagon cement-carrying train derailed at low speed at Sheffield station, at 02:45 GMT on Wednesday. No-one was injured. But ""significant damage"" was caused and the train will need to be removed by crane, Network Rail said. It said repair work would cause disruption ""over the coming days"". A number of the wagons came off the tracks while passing though platform one on route from Hope, Derbyshire, to Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The arrival of the cranes will require a partial road closure of the A61 Sheaf Street, which runs in front of the station. The train was travelling from Hope to Dewsbury when it derailed An investigation into the derailment has been launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB). Read more news from across Yorkshire Network Rail route director Matt Rice, said: ""This is a significant incident, so it's only right that we take time to find out all of the facts and understand what has caused this. ""Once it is safe to do so, we will start work to remove the train, better assess the extent of the damage and make a plan for repairs. ""This process is taking some time and we are sorry for the disruption which this is causing. There will still be service changes tomorrow and over the coming days.

"Aboriginal activists had been campaigning to include traditional place names in addresses Australia Post says it will support the optional use of Aboriginal place names on mail addresses, following a large grassroots campaign. The national mail service changed its guidelines this week to include advice on how to include traditional names. While some areas are known by their original names, many Australians often have little knowledge of place names that pre-date European settlement. Activists welcomed the endorsement of their push for greater awareness. Aboriginal woman Rachael McPhail started the campaign on social media in August, noting Aboriginal people had lived in Australia for at least 60,000 years. ""Every area in this country had an original place name prior to being given its colonial town/city name, and I believe that it's important to acknowledge this,"" she said. Australia Post advised people to identify traditional place names froma map on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website,external, or through local land councils and cultural centres. Sydney -Eora Melbourne -Woiworung Canberra-Ngunawal Brisbane -Yuggera Adelaide -Kaurna Perth -Wajuk These traditional names represent language, social or nation groups. Their general locations have been mapped by AIATSIS, which notes boundaries are not exact. Source: AIATSIS Close to 15,000 people have signed her petition. ""These are excellent first steps towards social change, so thank you again to all of you for signing the petition and emailing Australia Post,"" Ms McPhail  said. In its new guidelines, Australia Post says mail senders can include original names to ""acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land your item is being delivered on"". It advises people to use the second line of the address - after the sender's name and before the street address. An example of how to include a traditional place name in the address lines It also plans to introduce envelopes and packaging printed with an ""Acknowledgement of Country"" message - a standard statement in Australia which acknowledges the local people's connection to the land. Ms McPhail said she would continue to lobby Australia Post to create a national database of traditional place names, through consulting with Aboriginal elders.

"This video can not be played Martin: A breakdown in talks between Europe and the UK would be ""very negative"". The UK has to ""knuckle down"" to get a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of the year, the Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. He also said failing to reach an agreement would be ""very, very damaging all round"". The UK and EU are in talks but big differences remain on fishing access and rules on state help for businesses. Boris Johnson has insisted there is a deal ""to be done"" and that the ""outlines"" of an agreement are clear. The UK officially left the EU on 31 January, but has been in a transition period since then - following many of the bloc's rules while a trade agreement is negotiated. That period is due to end on 31 December and if a deal is not reached, the UK will trade with the EU on World Trade Organization rules - leading to tariffs being introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs for businesses and consumers. Gove: Britain 'determined' to get Brexit deal What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? Speaking to the BBC, Irish prime minister Mr Martin warned that failure to get a deal would be ""ruinous"" for the UK and that Ireland would suffer. ""We've all had a very significant shock to our economic system because of Covid-19 - the last thing we need now across all of our respective economies is a second major shock,"" he said. He said US President-elect Joe Biden would introduce a ""greater thrust towards multilateralism"" and that the UK should follow his ""orientation"" by working with the EU. Mr Martin dismissed suggestions the EU had not compromised in the talks and said he believed a deal could still be reached. He also warned the UK government to be ""very careful that they do not do anything that could destabilise the politics of Northern Ireland"" as it leaves the transition period. Throughout the Brexit process the UK and EU have insisted they want to avoid a hard border - with cameras and border posts - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Mr Martin said failure to reach a deal could create ""tensions that are unnecessary"" and that there was a danger these concerns were not being taken seriously enough. He cited the UK government's Internal Market Bill as an example. The bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January - when the post-Brexit transition period runs out. The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit Government publishes post-Brexit export guidance Watchdog warns of post-Brexit border disruption It gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU Withdrawal Agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. UK ministers say the bill would provide a ""safety net"" in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The UK government has said the bill protects peace but Mr Martin said it did not ""take on board the implications for politics within Northern Ireland itself"". He added that the bill had created ""niggling doubts"" over whether the UK could be trusted. Joe Biden has said any UK-US trade deal had to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement Mr Martin also called Mr Biden ""probably the most Irish of presidents"" since John F Kennedy. He said Mr Biden was ""very committed"" to the Good Friday Agreement - the peace deal that among other things established power-sharing in Northern Ireland - and that he did not want Brexit to undermine it. Asked if he thought the new American president would be closer to the UK or Ireland, he said ""I don't buy that simplistic narrative. He loves Ireland and he has great time for the UK."" Speaking for the UK Labour Party, Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Rachel Reeves said failing to agree a deal with the EU would be ""a disaster for already stretched businesses and workers"". Ms Reeves said the UK government had to ""listen to industry, get prepared and ensure their incompetence doesn't disrupt businesses and cost jobs"".

"""I had been applying for all kinds of jobs and wasn't getting anywhere, but then this role came up... and it's been a godsend really."" Twenty four-year-old Geddy Stringer was unemployed after finishing his Masters in Musical Theatre online in September. He felt disheartened after applying for jobs across retail, hospitality and administration - without much luck. ""I was faced with an impossible situation and I had to sign on to Universal Credit. I didn't want to do it as I felt I didn't deserve it, and there were people out there more deserving than I was,"" he says. ""On top of the fact my industry is currently shut down, I didn't have much hope."" But last week, he started a new job as part of the government's Kickstart scheme. UK unemployment rate continues to surge Kickstart is open to 16-to-24 year olds who are claiming universal credit and the Treasury says more than 19,000 roles have been created so far. The scheme is good for ""getting young people valuable paid work experience at a time when job opportunities are few and far between"", says Kathleen Henehan, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, But she says more action is needed to tackle youth unemployment, which could exceed one million. Employers arecutting hundreds of thousands of jobsas the coronavirus crisis continues to shake the UK economy. And the unemployment rate among young people is far higher than the overall rate of 4.8%, reaching 14.6%. When lockdown restrictions were lessened in October, Geddy heard of a job opportunity as a front-of-house assistant at the Rathbone Boxing Club in central London. Although he was worried that the second national lockdown in England might mean this opportunity would vanish, he's mostly working from home as the gym offers Zoom classes and Instagram Live boxing sessions. On top of administrative work, he says he's been helping the business researching new fundraising opportunities and grants. ""It's been pretty fast-going and I feel I've been chucked in at the deep end in the best possible way."" But tens of thousands more placements like Geddy's will need to be created in the coming months - despite lockdown and a tough jobs market - if the government is to reach its target of 250,000. The Kickstart scheme aims to get young people who are currently claiming universal credit on work placements, which last for a period of up to six months. The government will cover 100% of minimum wage for 16-24-year-olds, up to 25 hours per week. They'll also cover National Insurance payments and any pension contributions. Per hour, that's Â£4.55 for under 18s, Â£6.45 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and Â£8.20 for 21 to 24-year-olds. Bosses can top up that payment if they wish. They also get Â£1,500 to set up support and training, and to pay for uniforms and other costs. The scheme opened for applications in August, and began last week. It will run until December 2021 - with the option of being extended. If you're currently claiming universal credit, your work coach will be able to help you look at the eligibility criteria. If you are eligible for any roles in the local area, you'll be able to apply for those as normal. Employers who have signed up so far include Bloomberg, Network Rail, and Tesco. The Â£2bn programme aims to create 250,000 work placements, with scope for more if it's a success. For young people in sectors hit particularly hard by the coronavirus crisis, such as hospitality or retail, the problem is that ""there are simply no vacancies available"", Ms Henehan says. ""What few job vacancies there are tend to be concentrated in sectors like healthcare. Making the career jump from hotels to healthcare is tough at the best of times, let alone during a recession."" In addition to Kickstart, she suggests companies should invest more in new jobs and ensure apprenticeships or other training opportunities go to young people. When the scheme was launched, there were also concerns over how small businesses could take part, as employers needed to provide at least 30 placements. But, the Treasury said that more than 500 ""gateways"" - organisations that act on behalf of employers with space for 29 or fewer placements - had signed up. For Geddy, he feels fortunate to have found a new role. ""They're not just seeing us as people who want to turn up, do the job and leave. ""But I do struggle with the idea [the Kickstart Scheme] came out at the time when people were being told to retrain for other careers."" ""I hope anybody else signing up for the scheme has someone who is supportive too, rather than just using them for cheap labour.""

"GCSEs, AS and A-level assessments will be done in classrooms in 2021 under teacher supervision There should be a review into whether to overhaul or scrap GCSEs, two commissioners have said. The future generations and children's commissioners for Wales said thecancellation of next year's exams due to Covid-19should spark a review into whether they are fit for purpose. They questioned whether exams at 16 were ""still relevant"" when most pupils go on to study A-levels. A group representing businesses said they are a valuable tool for employers. A Senedd debate on the cancellation of next year's exams is due to take place on Thursday, hearing evidence from Qualifications Wales, exam board the WJEC, college leaders and the Welsh Local Government Association. Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe said: ""Looking at skills for the future, the narrow regurgitating of knowledge is not useful. ""We need to focus on human skills such as creativity, emotional intelligence, empathy, critical thinking. ""I'd argue that GCSEs don't equip children for that."" Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped Fears for teachers' workload after exams cancelled Children 'worried' about education in pandemic But she said questions remained about the impact of potentially having a different exam system in Wales compared with England and the rest of the UK. Ms Howe added: ""We do need a broader debate about what GCSEs measureâ¦ we're forcing this system on children, but to what end? ""Kids are coming out of school without skills for the workplace."" Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland also welcomed the decision to scrap exams next year and said it should be a catalyst to review the current system. It comes after a survey of nearly 24,000 children across Wales highlighted concerns and anxiety among children about falling behind with learning and how exam results would be affected. Children's Commissioner Sally Holland says pupils have been listened to Ms Holland said: ""I'm delighted that the voice and rights of pupils have played such a central role in the government decision making. ""My focus will be on ensuring the process - the details - will be fair and will be one that protects young people's wellbeing.Â ""This should be a year of learning, not worry."" Ms Holland's office has also highlighted to the Welsh Government that the pandemic has provided an ""opportunity for Wales to re-examine whether formal examinations are the fairest way to assess learners' skills, knowledge and achievements"". Rhyl A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria and is also a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said he was concerned about a culture shift towards scrapping exams. ""I do think this will spark a conversation around whether we do need exams and a lot of people who have been quiet on the subject may begin to speak out,"" he said. ""I'm a supporter of the concept of exams, they test the ability to deal with pressure, think innovatively, evaluate thoughts in a specific way. ""Yes it might take away an element of luck like 'has someone had a good night's sleep' and 'have the questions gone their way on the day', but the problem with continual assessment is instead of pressure being mounted over a period of a couple of weeks, it will be mounted on you throughout the entire year."" Jonathon said revision for exams has also helped him to better understand subjects studied earlier in the year over a short period, by having to revisit them. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the exams system was an easily-understood and well-recognised method of assessment among employers. Ben Cottam, FSB Wales Head of External Affairs, said: ""If the exams system were to be scrapped then it would have to be replaced with a system that is equally easily recognisable and goes far enough to confidently demonstrate the skills, attributes and knowledge of the learner. ""Ultimately what businesses want is to be able to judge a prospective employees' levels of education, attainment and knowledge. ""Whatever the outcome, businesses and students must be reassured that the process is robust and that they can have confidence in it."" While many would not be drawn on the implications beyond next year Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, agreed GCSEs needed an overhaul to move away from what she described as a ""cliff-edge accountability system"". She said she would like a more nuanced series of exams reflecting youngsters' individual abilities and aptitudes as well as the ""richness"" of the new curriculum. ""GCSEs are a brand which people understand, however a new system is required to reflect the new curriculum so now is as good a time as any for that to begin,"" she said.

If you are eligible for any roles in the local area, you'll be able to apply for those as normal. Employers who have signed up so far include Bloomberg, Network Rail, and Tesco. The Â£2bn programme aims to create 250,000 work placements, with scope for more if it's a success. For young people in sectors hit particularly hard by the coronavirus crisis, such as hospitality or retail, the problem is that ""there are simply no vacancies available"", Ms Henehan says. ""What few job vacancies there are tend to be concentrated in sectors like healthcare. Making the career jump from hotels to healthcare is tough at the best of times, let alone during a recession."" In addition to Kickstart, she suggests companies should invest more in new jobs and ensure apprenticeships or other training opportunities go to young people. When the scheme was launched, there were also concerns over how small businesses could take part, as employers needed to provide at least 30 placements. But, the Treasury said that more than 500 ""gateways"" - organisations that act on behalf of employers with space for 29 or fewer placements - had signed up. For Geddy, he feels fortunate to have found a new role. ""They're not just seeing us as people who want to turn up, do the job and leave. ""But I do struggle with the idea [the Kickstart Scheme] came out at the time when people were being told to retrain for other careers."" ""I hope anybody else signing up for the scheme has someone who is supportive too, rather than just using them for cheap labour.""

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: 'There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic' The UK's economy rebounded from recession in July to September, but growth showed signs of slowing down at the end of the three months. Growth of 15.5% in July to September was the biggest on record,said the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. It came after a six-month slump induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. However, growth was weaker in September than in the preceding months, while the country's economy is still 8.2% smaller than before the virus struck. The economy had shrunk in the first three months of the year and then contracted by a record 19.8% in the April-to-June period. Two consecutive three-month periods of contraction are generally defined as a recession. What is a recession? UK unemployment rate continues to surge Despite the rebound in July to September, analysts warned that the economy was likely to shrink again in the final three months of the year because of the impact of renewed lockdowns in different parts of the country. A second lockdown began in England on 5 November and is due to finish on 2 December. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that in view of what had happened since, the figures felt ""not just like old news, but like ancient news"". ""We already know that GDP will struggle to rise in October as tighter restrictions were imposed and that it will take a hammering in November as the effects of the second Covid-19 lockdown are felt."" In September, growth was 1.1%, marking the fifth consecutive month of expansion. However, that was weaker than the levels seen in previous months. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said all sectors of the economy continued to recover, albeit more slowly. ""The return of children to school boosted activity in the education sector. Housebuilding also continued to recover, while business strengthened for lawyers and accountants after a poor August. ""However, pubs and restaurants saw less business after the Eat Out to Help Out scheme ended and accommodation saw less business after a successful summer."" In another sign of the impact of the pandemic on the economy, figures released on Tuesday showedthe unemployment rate rose to 4.8%in the three months to September, up from 4.5%. The number of people out of work rose by 243,000 in the three-month period, the largest increase since May 2009. Welsh food packaging firm Transcend Packaging saw its sales collapse by half during the depths of the first lockdown. But boss Lorenzo Angelucci says they have are now higher than they were at the start of the year - partly because the firm has started making personal protective equipment which kept sales buoyant. ""Obviously the beginning of the pandemic was pretty tough,"" he told the BBC. ""It forced us to be creative and come up with other types of products."" The firm, which supplies clients such as McDonald's, expects to benefit in coming months as takeaway services remain open. ""Food packaging is by default safer in this situation, because people still need to eat,"" he said. ""But the economy itself, I don't think will be in a very nice position for a long time."" Record growth for the UK economy in July to September is a welcome partial reverse from the record fall seen in the spring. It means that lights are going back on in the economy that were switched off in the first lockdown. It is, though, catch-up not recovery. It is rebound more than it is established bounce-back. The economy is still nearly a tenth smaller than it was before the pandemic struck. More than that, the data is a rear-view mirror on the economy. It reflects a period of falling infections, the boost to growth and to footfall from the chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out scheme. It shows the rate of this rebound slowing in September, even as there was a boost from the return of school pupils. Since then, there has obviously been a further, though less extensive shutdown, but both the Bank of England and the Treasury have boosted the economy. The great bit of sunlight on the horizon, however, is the vaccine. That will be the biggest economic stimulus imaginable. In a BBC interview, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was going to be ""a difficult winter"", but there were ""reasons for cautious optimism"". ""Our priority remains to protect as many jobs as possible,"" he said, adding that the extension of the furlough scheme and the creation of the Kickstart job scheme for young people would help to do this. He maintained that England would be able to exit its second lockdown as planned on 2 December. ""I am very confident that the measures we have put in place will do the job that we need them to do,"" he said. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy was likely to shrink by about 0.5% in the final three months of the year. ""On a monthly basis, it probably won't recover to September's level until the spring, when it should be possible for Covid-19 restrictions to be sustainably relaxed,"" he added. Looking further ahead, Sarah Hewin, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC there was ""uncertainty"" about the first three months of 2021, ""particularly if we have trade disruptions related to Brexit as the transition period comes to an end at the end of the year"". Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said news of a potential vaccine ""reduced uncertainty"" for business Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey welcomed news thata possible Covid-19 vaccine had performed well in clinical trials: ""It's encouraging for individuals, it's encouraging for businesses, and it's encouraging for the economy."" ""The sooner that way out of Covid comes into effect, the more businesses are likely to survive in financial terms,"" he told the Financial Times in a video interview. Mr Bailey said the news was ""broadly consistent"" with the Bank's latest set of economic forecasts, which assumed that the pandemic would start to recede after the winter as better treatments arrived. But the news ""reduces the huge level of uncertainty that we have in the forecasts"", he added. How fast is the UK's economy growing? What is a recession?

"This video can not be played This 2019 film shows the hospital when the plan was to open in 2021 A senior doctor has said she has ""huge concerns"" about patient safety if a new hospital opens next week, four months ahead of schedule. Deborah Wales said there were not enough doctors and nurses to staff the new Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran and existing hospitals. In an email seen by BBC Wales, she told colleagues it ""cannot function as intended"" amid a second Covid surge. Sarah Aitkin from the health board said a ""minority of doctors"" were worried. Dr Aitkin, medical director at Aneurin Bevan health board, said detailed work was under way to ensure patients' safety across all sites. ""We are very confident about opening this hospital safely, there is an enormous amount of planning that has gone into that. ""It is making Nevill Hall hospital and the Royal Gwent safe that is now in detailed planning, and that is what Dr Wales is concerned about. We are working through that patient-by-patient. The Â£350m new hospital in Llanfrechfa is a 471-bed facility which has taken three years to build, and will provide a range of services including accident and emergency for the most seriously ill or injured, and obstetrics. Deborah Wales is concerned the hospital ""cannot function as intended"" amid a second Covid surge The opening on 17 November is happening during the second wave of coronavirus cases. Dr Wales is a divisional director of unscheduled care at the health board, and in an email marked ""official - sensitive"" she outlined concerns about the opening of the new hospital. She wrote: ""I thought it important to write to everyone regarding the huge concerns that I have about patient safety if the GUH [Grange University Hospital] opens as planned in a week's time. ""I have been communicating these concerns via email and directly to executive colleagues however the plan remains to go ahead. ""We are in the midst of the Covid second surge; as such we will be going into the GUH in surge and it cannot function as intended."" Long Covid: Calls for specialist clinics in Wales Covid-19 in Wales: What do the stats tell us? 'Chatting indoors behind Covid cases spike before new lockdown' Dr Wales detailed how the new hospital will open with considerable changes to its planned services due to the pandemic, and set out her concerns that staffing levels would not match the demands faced at the new hospital and the area's existing hospitals. The workforce was ""depleted, stretched, tired"" and unprepared for the opening of the new hospital, she said, and highlighted a staff sickness rate ""in excess of 15%"". There was a shortage of doctors, she said, but that was ""dwarfed by the nursing deficit"". Efforts had been made to block-book temporary nursing staff, she added, but that there ""remain many wards with inadequate/no staffing"" at all at the health board's major hospitals including the new hospital. ""Trying to cope with the inpatients across four sites will inevitably reduce the ability to continue with elective work such as endoscopy. This presents further risk to our patients particularly in cancer work, where delays in diagnosis and treatment will cause increased mortality,"" she said. The workforce is ""depleted, stretched, tired"", and there is a shortage of doctors and nurses, the email said From 17 November the new hospital will become the accident and emergency department for everyone in the health board area, treating the most seriously ill patients, those with significant injuries, and babies under 12 months even if they have a minor injury or illness. There will be 24-hour minor injury units at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny and Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Ystrad Mynach. Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan in Ebbw Vale will continue to have a minor injury unit open from 09:00 to 19:00, Monday to Friday. Services at the Grange University Hospital will also include obstetric inpatients and high-risk births, a neonatal intensive care and special care baby unit, paediatrics, and cardiology among others. Tim Rogerson, clinical director for emergency medicine for the health board, said: ""We're going to be able to deliver the standard of care in an environment that we've always wanted to. ""The hospitals we've had have been great for their time but it has been time for quite a while for us to move onto a modern facility and this delivers that."" He added opening during a pandemic had not been ideal but ""everyone's really stepped up and delivered early"". ""The first wave was really hard and we saw things and did things that we never wanted to do in our career and I think all NHS staff are carrying a burden of that. ""How it feels in the department now is very similar to April and May with a steady and increasing flow of really sick people and not just the elderly - you know, young people, people at the same age as me have come in with numbers that are really worrying, so it's starting to feel like it did. ""Hopefully we'll see something from the firebreak that it will start to plateau the numbers but it's a stage that we didn't want to be at."" Look behind the scenes of a new Â£350m hospital.

"Mr Toobin has apologised to his wife, friends and colleagues A star reporter has been fired by the New Yorker magazine after he exposed himself on a staff Zoom call. Jeffrey Toobin, 60, who is also senior legal analyst for CNN, confirmed in a tweet that he had been sacked. The New Yorker's parent company Conde Nast wrote in an email to staff: ""I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously."" After he was suspended last month Mr Toobin said he had believed himself to be off-camera during the incident. Vice News, which broke the initial story, reported that senior colleagues had seen Mr Toobin masturbating while apparently on a separate video call. Allow Twitter content?

He added: ""We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct."" The incident happened on 15 October during an election simulation involving the New Yorker and WNYC radio. Mr Toobin was immediately suspended. In a statement to Vice last month, he said: ""I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera."" He apologised to his family, friends and colleagues. ""I believed I was not visible on Zoom,"" he told Vice. ""I thought no-one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video."" Vice quoted two anonymous sources who were at the meeting as saying they had witnessed the incident. The election simulation involved prominent New Yorker figures playing politicians, such as President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Mr Toobin was representing the courts. During a break in proceedings, according to Vice's sources, Mr Toobin appeared to be on a different video call but was seen moments later on camera touching his penis.

"There are two versions of the PS5 - one with a Bluray drive and another digital-only device PlayStation 4 is the most popular console of its generation, with over 112 million sold worldwide. Now, Sony is trying to replicate that success as it steps into a new era of gaming with the PlayStation 5. The big difference this time is ""sensory engagement"" according to Jim Ryan, the PlayStation boss. Speaking to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat about launching it in a pandemic, he says: ""It's easily the most extraordinary of all the launches we've ever done."" For more on the next generation of consoles check out the BBC's new games podcast Press X To Continue. Listen and subscribe to Press X To Continue on BBC Sounds Compared to previous generational changes in PlayStation consoles, the PS5 sees a more subtle shift but Jim says it's still going to be ""transformational"". Boss of PlayStation Jim Ryan explains why UK gamers will have to wait until 19 November for the PS5 The PS5 will cost about Â£450 and gamers will be getting a completely different experience in the console's look and feel compared to the current generation. ""It has more horsepower and runs faster with better graphics. But the difference goes way beyond that,"" Jim says. PS5 v Xbox: Who will win the next-gen console race? New controllers will change the game too, PlayStation hopes. ""You've got to get one of these controllers in your hands to really feel the action of pulling a bow or letting an arrow go or shooting a gun."" ""It's something people have been doing for years. But this is taking something that had become rather mundane, and adding a whole new layer of meaning and experience to it,"" he adds. The PS5 controller is seen as a gamechanger for gameplay experience Sony is following a similar strategy to the one that worked in 2013, selling discs and downloads for premium prices. But there's questions over the lack of big exclusive blockbuster games on release day - with big-hitting titles being seen as one of the reasons for the success of the PS4 over its competition. How does the Xbox Series X stack up? It's not a worry for Jim who says there'll be ""something for everyone"". This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with the PS5 Sonyhas saidthat dozens of popular PS4 games, including the 100 most played, will work on the PS5. As for future game releases? Fans don't need to look beyond the ""not too distant future"" for when new games will come out, he says. Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be available at launch on PS5. Those in the UK wanting to get the console will have a slightly longer and frustrating wait until 19 November. But Jim says with each generation of console, the wait between the UK and rest of the world is reducing. ""In a completely ideal world, we would like to launch everywhere in the world on the same day."" ""We just needed an extra few days to get everything in order to be able to have a proper, professional, seamless PlayStation-style launch,"" he adds. The launch of a console in the midst of a global pandemic has been ""a rollercoaster"" he says. ""The most extraordinary thing is all of this has taken place in 2020. The one thing I've learned is I'll never do this again in a pandemic"". The company's been ""astonished"" by the level of pre-orders. ""We're making more PS5's in this difficult environment then we made PS4s in that launch. If people are unable to find one at launch, we're very sorry and apologetic about that."" This video can not be played WATCH: PlayStation 5 console and games revealed ""They can rest assured we're working really hard to get significant supplies into the market before and after Christmas.""

"The diversity among bird species intrigued Charles Darwin Scientists have sequenced and recorded the genomes - the genetic make-up or ""code of life"" - of species from almost every branch of the bird family tree. The 363 species' genomes, including 267 sequenced for the first time, are cataloguedin the journal Nature,external. It is a list that now features more than 92% of the world's avian families. This has revealed the code for things ""Darwin was intrigued by and wrote about"", Dr Michael Braun from the Smithsonian Institution told BBC News. From wildly different coloured feathers, body sizes ranging from the giant ostrich to the diminutive wren and raptor flight speeds of up to 300km/h [186.4mph], ""it's all coded for in the genome"", he said. The information will help scientists understand the evolution of strange and elaborate courtship displays such as the Victoria's riflebird's And this milestone, he added, was ""just the beginning"". The project,externalaims eventually to include a genome from every living species of bird. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, which is a a key contributor through its vast collection of specimens, said this would ""advance research on the evolution of birds and aid in the conservation of threatened bird species"". The list of sequences so far now includes rare species such as the Henderson crake, which lives on only one small Pacific island. But Dr Braun said it was the humble chicken that was the ""model species"" for studying some extreme examples of avian evolution - including how giant, flightless birds like the ostrich evolved. Biologists have learned about the evolution of bird limbs by studying chickens ""We've intensively studied limb development in the chicken,"" he said. ""And we can apply that to this group of birds called the ratites - birds like the ostrich and emu. ""With the evolution of flightlessness, there were a lot to changes in the limb anatomy - wings get short, flight feathers become useless, their legs get longer and they lose toes, because they're running instead of perching. ""With these resources, you have the detail  - the code - of how that happened."" The acute vision and speed of flight is encoded into the genome of raptors such as the osprey Manchester Metropolitan University conservation biologist Dr Alexander Lees called the catalogue a ""goldmine of information"". ""It permits a refined look at the avian tree of life - stretching back into deep time - that may close the door on longstanding arguments between evolutionary biologists about 'who is whose' common ancestor,"" he said. And new data on more than 60 globally threatened species would be a ""crucial toolkit for conservation geneticists"". ""This is information that may prove crucial in reducing extinction risk in the long term for species with tiny population sizes today,"" Dr Lees added.

"The UK has now seen more than 50,000 deaths linked to Covid-19, according to the government's official figures. It is a tragic milestone, which illustrates the impact the pandemic has had on the country. But on its own it does not tell the full story. Behind the figure, there's a complex picture. The majority of the deaths came in the spring as the virus took the UK by surprise. Deaths rose rapidly in those early weeks of the pandemic, doubling ever four days at one point before peaking at 1,000 deaths a day in April. It then fell as lockdown and other measures had an impact. At points during the summer, daily deaths were in the single figures before the virus rebounded. Throughout the autumn, the number of deaths has been rising, albeit much more slowly than in the spring, with deaths doubling every two weeks or so at the moment. With signs infection rates are slowing and the prospect of a vaccine on the horizon, there is hope the rising numbers will slow, perhaps eventually to almost a stop. The government's death count just looks at those who have died within 28 days of a positive test. But if you look at death records it is clear that more people have been dying overall during the pandemic than would be expected. Up to the end of October, there were nearly 70,000 excess deaths. Some of these were judged to be linked to Covid by doctors who filled in the death certificates - an absence of testing in the early days meant a number of Covid deaths were not recorded as such. But some were what are known as indirect deaths. This includes deaths from other conditions such as heart disease because people did not get the treatment they needed. The average age of people who have died with Covid is above 80 with more than nine in 10 of the deaths among the over 65s, according to Office for National Statistics analyses of the pandemic. Deaths among the under 45s have been low - only a few hundred have been seen, including six children under the age of 14. There are marked differences when you look at deaths by area. There are a number of factors that have contributed to this from levels of infection to the age and health of the population. People from deprived backgrounds and ethnic minority groups have died in greater numbers. Whether you look at excess deaths or coronavirus deaths per head of population, the UK has seen one of the worst death tolls in the world. The blame has at times been laid at the door of the government. From the delay locking down, to the lack of testing in the early days and on-going struggling with contact tracing, a variety of factors have been put forward as to why the UK has seen so many deaths. But the UK is not the only country to have struggled. Ministers in Spain, France and Italy have come in for heavy criticism too. But putting aside the government's record, the size and age of the UK's population has also left us susceptible. In fact, if you adjust the death rate to take into account the age and size of the population the number of deaths seen in 2020 has been high. But it is not completely out of kilter with the death rate in the early years of the 21st century. Since then the population has got larger and older. A virus that carries such a significant risk to the frail and vulnerable and thrives on close contact has, sadly, taken its toll on a densely populated and ageing island.

"Lee Cain is one of the prime minister's closest allies What is going on? I know from time to time that's a question we ask on here. This time, it's about what is happening behind the shiny black door in Downing Street, and whether the government machine is ticking along as it should. The short answer, well, no. After a bumpy few weeks, late last night The Times and The Daily Mail reported that the prime minister had been in discussions about offering his director of communications, Lee Cain, a promotion to become his chief of staff. After the turmoil of recent weeks it's not exactly surprising that Boris Johnson wants to try to bring order to 'the house' as it's known on the inside. Leaks, u-turns, on top of the obvious political nightmare of trying to manage a pandemic mean it's not that surprising that the prime minister wants to try at least to create a calmer atmosphere where things happen in a slightly more conventional way. What's behind No 10's plan for new advisers? PM's new spin doctor was Daily Mirror chicken But just as soon as news of this potential appointment emerged, which several sources have told me has been discussed, with an actual offer made by the prime minister at the weekend, so did consternation among some MPs, some ministers, and other insiders in government. One Tory source even suggested that the prime minster's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, is understood to be unhappy about it and has made that clear. The new press spokesperson, Allegra Stratton, whose appointment created some tension with Mr Cain, is also thought to believe it would be a mistake to give him the position. And his influential policy adviser, Munira Mirza, is also though to be against. One insider told me that the prime minister was still mulling it as a possibility, and hadn't yet taken a final decision. Another suggested: ""Boris is a brave chap to do something that his leading ladies are not thrilled about."" From the outside, his influence has often been understated - he is a long serving and important part of the PM's operation, with influence well beyond his official brief of running communications. But the concern about increasing his power would be about extending the influence of the Vote Leave faction inside Number 10, rather than try to expand the range of advice, opinion, and experience in the machine. One Cabinet minister sniped: ""He is hardly Leo McGarry"" - a reference to the fictional chief of staff figure in The West Wing, the US political drama that nearly everyone in SW1 is obsessed with. Guess what? None of the people involved will comment officially about what is going on. So I'm afraid that it is extremely difficult to know what is really happening. One source even suggested to me that this had all blown up because Mr Cain was thesource of the leak of the government's decision to lock down again, although that is flatly denied by Number 10 who are running a leak inquiry. Others have told me that he has been threatening to leave government in frustration at how things are being handled, and this was an effort to make him stay. Whatever the truth, what actually matters about this is that it gives a flavour of an administration that's made up of different factions, vying for influence over the prime minister. The government has certainly faced challenges of epic proportions, but it seems often there is a dysfunction in how it operates that consumes political energy which is needed to solve the public's problems. The irony: a process designed in theory to bring order to Number 10, has created a disorder of its own.

"Croydon Council announced in the summer it wanted to cut staff numbers by 15% - about 410 roles Cash-strapped Labour-run Croydon Council has imposed emergency spending restrictions with ""immediate effect"", the BBC has learned. The Section 114 notice bans all new expenditure at Croydon Council, with the exception of statutory services for protecting vulnerable people. A document seen by the BBC said ""Croydon's financial pressures are not all related to the pandemic"". It is under a government review amid claims of ""irresponsible spending"". Section 114 notices are issued when a council cannot achieve a balanced budget. In June, the BBC found many large councils in England feared going effectively bankrupt because of the Covid-19 pandemic. To cope with coronavirus, councils revealed they were planning a mix of responses including using up cash reserves, reducing services and cancelling or postponing spending on big projects. Cash-strapped council under new government review Councils could spend Â£1.7bn over budget by March Croydon 'cannot guarantee' avoiding bankruptcy The Section 114 letter, which was sent by Croydon's director of finance Lisa Taylor, said she was not confident the council ""can make the level of savings required to deliver a balanced budget"". ""Despite the council having put in place spending controls over the summer 2020, non-essential cost have continued to be incurred,"" she said. ""I am still not seeing an organisation that is taking the necessary radical decisions to stop all but essential expenditure."" Last month Government minister Robert Jenrick announced a rapid non-statutory review into Croydon Council The document also says Â£17.7m of the Â£27.9m of the ""new savings"" presented to Croydon's cabinet on 21 September and the full council meeting on 28 September were ""incorrectly identified as new savings"". As a result it forecasted that overspend ""had not reduced by as much as previously reported"". Croydon is the first council to declare aSection 114 order since Northamptonshire County Council in 2018. Last month, Croydon's cabinet member for finance Simon Hall resigned from his role, while former council leader Tony Newman announced his departure a few days later. Both resignations came two weeks after the pair survived a vote of no confidence proposed by the Conservative opposition. Councillor Hamida Ali, who took over as leader, accepted that the council ""had made mistakes"" in addition to the impact of coronavirus. ""While we continue to work hard to find savings, we must focus our spending on essential services and protecting our vulnerable residents,"" she said. ""We're not going to fix these problems overnight and there will be difficult decisions ahead but I want to reassure local people that the council will still be here to support you."" Croydon's chief executive Jo Negrini also announced in August that she would be stepping down. The council's Conservative opposition leader Cllr Jason Cummings said the report was ""scathing"" and he had fears local residents ""would suffer most"". He added: ""Labour were warned repeatedly over the last few years but ploughed on anyway, they must take full responsibility for the damage they have caused."" Construction of the Â£1.4bn Croydon Westfield shopping project has been repeatedly delayed since it was approved in 2017 The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said Croydon's decision was ""necessary"" for it to manage its own finances. A spokesman said: ""We're aware of serious concerns around the council's governance and risk management andthe recent Public Interest Report was damning about the governancewithin Croydon Council, which has been entirely irresponsible with their spending and investments. ""The council has decided to issue a section 114 notice and we will consider the findings of the review which concludes later this month."" By BBC London's political correspondent Tim Donovan It's not often a council needs to issue a Section 114 - but the pressures of coping with coronavirus have combined with at least questionable previous investment strategies to push Croydon over the edge. It was heading for an overspend of Â£60m at the end of the year from dealing with the pandemic and government support didn't look like covering it. Croydon went into the coronavirus health crisis in a vulnerable state - with depleted reserves and Â£1.5bn debts. It's a financial position partially reached through buying up property including a hotel and a shopping centre. In good times, it's easy to see how that might have paid dividends but with weeks of lockdown, it left the council seriously exposed. The latest development means new spending must be stopped immediately except for on statutory services like social care. Now the council's administration has 21 days to come up with a strategy which looks likely to mean more job losses to add to at least 400 already being cut.

"Ron Klain (left) with Mr Biden at a meeting in 2014 US President-elect Joe Biden has picked veteran political operative Ron Klain to be White House chief of staff. Mr Klain has served as a top aide to Mr Biden since the 1980s in the Senate and later when he was vice-president. The ultimate Washington insider, Mr Klain was also a senior White House aide to Barack Obama and chief of staff to Vice-President Al Gore. He was played by actor Kevin Spacey in the movie Recount, about the presidential election of 2000. The White House chief of staff - who manages the president's daily schedule and is often described as his gatekeeper - is a political appointee who does not require confirmation by the Senate. Live updates Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? Mr Biden paid tribute to Mr Klain in a statement issued by his transition team on Wednesday. ""His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum,"" said Mr Biden, ""is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again."" This video can not be played A transgender state senator and the youngest congressman are among the new faces making US political history In the same statement, Mr Klain said he was ""humbled"" by the president-elect's confidence in him. ""I look forward to helping him and the vice president-elect assemble a talented and diverse team to work in the White House, as we tackle their ambitious agenda for change, and seek to heal the divides in our country,"" said Mr Klain. He served as chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1989-92 when Mr Biden was chairman. He was also an adviser and speechwriter on Mr Biden's unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House campaigns. Mr Klain served as chief of staff to Mr Biden from 2009 to 2011, the first few years of Mr Biden's tenure as vice-president in the Obama White House. He later served as President Obama's ""Ebola czar"" during a minor outbreak of the deadly disease in 2014. The longstanding Democratic operative was also involved in both of Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns and was an adviser to John Kerry's failed White House run in 2004. He has been a presidential debate coach for Mr Clinton, Mr Gore, Mr Kerry, Mr Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden. This video can not be played President Trump attended a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery His role as chief of staff to Mr Gore, who retracted his initial concession in the disputed White House election of 2000, was turned into the HBO drama Recount. ""The plural of chad is chad?"" Mr Klain, played by Spacey, asks at one point in the film, referring to the fragments of punched ballots that became critical to the tally in Florida. Mr Gore's Republican opponent, George W Bush, was ultimately declared the winner. This video can not be played 'Now the world sees our vote matters' - how Biden depended on black voters Mr Klain often tweets about the episode, only last year posting: ""People frequently tell me that I should 'get over' the 2000 election and the recount. I haven't, and I don't think I ever will."" After his work on the Gore campaign, Mr Klain worked as a high-powered Washington lobbyist for a mortgage giant and a drugmaker that was under congressional investigation. He fell out with the now-president-elect five years ago after throwing in his lot with Mrs Clinton's campaign when Mr Biden, then-US vice-president, still hoped to compete for the party nomination. ""It's been a little hard for me to play such a role in the Biden demise,"" Mr Klain wrote of the man he had served as chief of staff in an email to Clinton presidential campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2015. ""I am definitely dead to them - but I'm glad to be on Team HRC,"" he added, using Mrs Clinton's initials. The message was disclosed by Wikileaks following a hack and Mr Klain refused to comment on the controversy in August when it was reported by news outlet, Politico. Mr Klain has since worked his way back into Mr Biden's good graces. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" During this year's White House race, President Donald Trump repeatedly mentioned Mr Klain as he attacked Mr Biden. The Republican president kept referring to Mr Klain's critical remarks about how the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2014-15 had been handled in the US. About 12,500 Americans died, though that disease was much less lethal than Covid-19. Mr Klain, appearing last year on a panel discussion, said: ""We did every possible thing wrong. And it's, you know, 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it's just purely a fortuity that this isn't one of the great mass casualty events in American history."" This video can not be played Why did so many Latinos back Trump? Mr Trump used Mr Klain's remarks as he sought to rebut Mr Biden's argument that he would bring experience and competence to handling America's current coronavirus crisis. Mr Biden is pressing ahead with preparations to assume the presidency despite Mr Trump's lack of a concession after all major US TV networks projected last Saturday that the Democrat had won the White House race. On Wednesday, he continued to field phone calls from foreign leaders, speaking to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. But the US Department of State, according to media reports, is not forwarding congratulatory messages to Mr Biden passed through diplomatic channels nor assisting foreign governments trying to contact the president-elect. This is because the General Services Administration, which helps co-ordinate presidential transitions, is yet to formally recognise the victory. The state department has in the past helped to facilitate and translate calls between a president-elect and foreign leaders but the Biden team is operating on its own, the BBC's US partner, CBS News, reports. This video can not be played Biden: ""Embarrassment"" that Trump has not conceded the election The president-elect has pledged to shape one of the most diverse presidential cabinets ever. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who was Mr Biden's biggest rival for the party nomination this year, told CNN on Wednesday he would be interested in becoming secretary of labour. According to the New York Times he is being considered but no deal has been made. Chris Coons, who took over Mr Biden's Senate seat in Delaware and serves on the Senate foreign relations committee, has been hotly tipped to become secretary of state. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and former Biden rival for the party nomination, is being talked about as possible treasury secretary. Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and Atlanta Federal Reserve president Raphael Bostic, who would be the first-African-American in the role, are also names being considered.

"Asian giant hornets are not native to the Pacific North-West and kill honeybees Washington is unlikely to have seen its last Asian giant hornets, the state's agricultural department has said, after scientists found 200 queens in one nest. The nest - the first in the US - of the so-called murder hornetswas captured with a vacuum from a tree in October. Researchers believe more queens - which are responsible for establishing colonies - could remain at large. But they are confident the population can be brought under control. Asian giant hornets are an invasive species in the Pacific North-West. They target honeybees, which pollinate crops. The insect, which is native to Japan and South Korea, can slaughter a bee colony in a matter of hours. They can also spit venom and inflict numerous powerful stings on humans. Scientists in Washington extracted the US's first nest of Asian giant hornets in October ""We believe there are additional nests. There is no way to be certain we got them all,"" Sven-Erik Spichiger, who researches insects with the Washington State Department of Agriculture, said in a press conference on Tuesday. The nest was extracted from a tree in the city of Blaine, close to the Canadian border, on 24 October. Scientists then quarantined the 22cm (9 in) diameter nest and after 24 hours were able to open it to examine the contents. Inside they found evidence of almost 500 insects at various stages of life including 112 worker hornets and close to 200 queens. ""It's possible some [queens] emerged before we did the extraction. There is no way of knowing how many more,"" Mr Spichiger said, explaining that three queens were found in the local area after scientists had removed the nest. But he said they had arrived ""in the nick of time"" to prevent the majority of queens from leaving the nest and mating. ""Frankly we are encouraged because of the number of queens we were able to count and kill,"" he said. Queen hornets go on to establish new colonies when they mate with a male and successfully hibernate over the winter season. When they wake up in spring, a small portion go on to establish nests. Mr Spichiger said it was likely that the insects arrived in the Pacific North-West as part of international commerce. ""We will never know how they got here...but it could have been a vehicle, wood chips, hay bales,"" he explained. A nest was destroyed in Vancouver Island in Canada in December last year.,external The Washington State Department of Agriculture is committed to eradicating the invasive species from the region, he added. Asian giant hornets ""are not going to hunt you down and murder you"", Mr Spichiger explained, but that if a person were to walk into a nest, their life would be ""probably in danger"". Around 40 people are killed annually by the hornets in Asia,according to the Smithsonian museum in Washington DC,external.

"Lee Cain arrived for work on Thursday, having already handed in his notice to No 10 One of Boris Johnson's closest aides, director of communications Lee Cain, has resigned amid reports of internal tensions in Downing Street. He will leave next month, despite being offered a promotion to chief of staff. His departure prompted speculation about the future of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, but the BBC was told he would stay for now. No 10 denied Mr Johnson had been distracted by the saga, saying he was ""fully focussed"" on tackling Covid. Mr Cain has been at the PM's side since he was a press officer for the Vote Leave campaign under Mr Cummings. Many will not have heard of him before the story broke, but his resignation comes at a time when the government is facing big decisions over its coronavirus strategy and the future of post-Brexit trade with the EU. After a number of rows and U-turns within government in recent months, No 10 will see communications as key in connecting with the country and trying to gain support for its decisions. No 10 exit much more than a random resignation Newscast: Cain quits No 10 The news that Mr Cain - who worked with Mr Cummings and the PM in the Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU - could become Mr Johnson's chief of staff had led to consternation among some MPs and ministers, said BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. One Tory source even suggested that Mr Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds - a former head of communications for the Conservatives - had misgivings about that plan. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio: ""This is pathetic. I think millions of people will be waking up this morning, scratching their heads, saying what on earth is going on? ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we're all worried about our health and our families, we're all worried about our jobs, and this lot are squabbling behind the door of No 10. Pull yourselves together, focus on the job in hand."" But the PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson was concentrating on fighting coronavirus, adding: ""You can see the progress we are making, in terms of rolling out mass testing, in securing vaccines and also in terms of making improvements to test and trace."" Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said there was also a ""complete focus in government on making sure we can work with business and work with citizens in order to deliver on the promise of Brexit"". This is much more than a random resignation. Lee Cain was Boris Johnson's longest serving aide in No 10 and very close to his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. Arguments and rivalry in any Downing Street operation are not unusual. This feels different though, perhaps the final act of Vote Leave is playing out after months of building tensions. One insider - who until now has kept their counsel - spoke out in frustration last night, saying: ""I just can't describe to you how much of a mess it is."" This is about who is running the country and the prime minister's ability to manage his own operation. The question now is whether the chaos that has spilled into public spirals into something more serious, or whether it is the chance for a reset the prime minister requires. Allies of Mr Cain were unhappy about how he had been treated, which prompted initial speculation about Mr Cummings's own future. Mr Cummings and Mr Cain are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum. Mr Cain, who is set to step down next month, will be replaced as the director of communications by James Slack - a former journalist and one of the PM's spokesmen. Mr Johnson is thought to be looking to fill the post of chief of staff as part of a wider reorganisation, which will also see ex-BBC journalist Allegra Stratton take on a role fronting new daily televised press briefings.

He added: ""Members of Parliament have felt excluded from the decision-making process, and that's no secret. ""The real opportunity here is for the chief of staff position to be filled by someone who has good links with the Conservative Party and its representation in the House of Commons."" Fellow Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale said it was ""very worrying indeed"" that No 10 ""consider it proper to devote this amount of energy to internal squabbles"" in the midst of a pandemic and Brexit trade negotiations. He told BBC News: ""We really do need people there with their minds on the job. It really is time that Downing Street got in place, what I think is now in common parlance is known as somebody with big boy pants on. ""A prime minister, particularly one facing the difficulties that Mr Johnson is facing, needs heavyweight help.""
