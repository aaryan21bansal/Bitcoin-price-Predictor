"Top EU officials have expressed optimism that a Brexit deal can be struck by the end of the year. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said the chance of the UK and the EU reaching a deal has increased in the last few days and could be agreed by November. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said an agreement was possible by the end of 2018. But Irish PM Leo Varadkar said there is still ""a fair bit of work to be done"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. However, there is still no agreement on some issues, including how to avoid new checks on the Irish border. Both sides had hoped to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation by an EU summit in 11 days' time. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Speaking to the Austrian press on Friday and asked whether an agreement could be reached at the next meeting of European leaders on 17 October, Mr Juncker said: ""We are not that far yet. But our will is unbroken to reach agreement with the British government."" He said a deal could be agreed by November. ""I have reason to think that the rapprochement potential between both sides has increased in recent days,"" Mr Juncker added. He also reiterated his position that a no-deal scenario ""would not be good"" for either the UK or the EU. Speaking on Saturday, European Council President Mr Tusk said: ""We will try for it [agreeing a deal] in October... and I think there is a chance to have an accord by the end of the year."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan also expressed optimism that a deal could be reached before December. There were also reports from EU officials of a better atmosphere in talks over the Irish border. The upbeat assessment of progress in negotiations prompted sterling to rise against the Euro and the US dollar. But Mr Varadkar warned that the two sides had not crossed the finish line yet and the October summit was ""a time to take stock"". He told reporters: ""I would be hopeful at that point that there would be decisive progress allowing us to conclude an agreement by November. ""That remains to be seen yet. I think there is a fair bit of work to be done."" He added: ""It's increasingly important that we conclude a deal sooner rather than later."" Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker at the summit of the European Council in December last year The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said officials still ""seem to be pushing for the whole withdrawal agreement to basically be done"" by the EU summit. ""Although, if we have learned anything from Brexit it's that the timetable is incredibly flexible, to use diplomatic language,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Downing Street distanced itself from suggestions - reported in the Daily Mail newspaper - that they were concerned Mr Juncker was trying to ""bounce"" the UK into agreeing a Brexit deal by mid-October. Meanwhile,the Guardian reported,externalsenior Conservatives had been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs to persuade them to back Theresa May's Brexit deal. Some Labour MPs who were mentioned in the article took to Twitter to refute the claims. Rachel Reeves tweeted: ""All the Labour MPs listed work hard and fight Tories locally and nationally every day."" It comes weeks after the head of the European Council Donald Tusksaid Theresa May's Brexit plans were unworkable. Both sides had hoped to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation by the October summit. But last month, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that if both sides were ""realistic"" there could be an agreement by November, when a special one-off summit has been arranged. Please upgrade your browser The European Commission is also considering whether to publish an analysis of where the two sides agree on elements of their future relationship. It could appear alongside the EU's latest contingency plans for a no-deal scenario, which will be released next week. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, Sir Alan Duncan was also optimistic about the prospects of a deal. ""We are in the art of the possible here, and from what I see in government, I think that we will get a deal, be it in October or November at the two consecutive summits,"" he said. Currently, thousands of people cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland every day. Goods and services pass between the two areas easily without any restrictions. As the UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards, but after Brexit, all that could change. The UK wants to leave both the single market and customs union. Both the UK and EU have agreed they do not, in all circumstances, want a ""hard border"" - which means physical checks or installing infrastructure such as cameras or customs posts. Both sidessigned up to that promise in December 2017. They hope they can achieve that anyway in a future agreement on a new trading relationship after Brexit. But if there were to be a delay or a failure in reaching such an agreement, they have agreed there needs to be a ""backstop"" solution - which means a last resort plan - that would keep the Irish border open. The trouble is the two sides can't agree on what the backstop text should say. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The EU's proposed backstop solution would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea. Instead, it would like to see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. But the UK has now signalled that it is ""open to looking at some of the options on regulatory checks"". Negotiators are yet to find a solution that is acceptable to both sides.

"This video can not be played The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post Banksy has released a video showing how he secretly built a shredder into one of his paintings that self-destructed after it was sold for more than Â£1m. The framed Girl With Balloon, one of the artist's best known works, was auctioned by Sotheby's in London. Moments after the piece was sold, the canvas of a girl reaching for a heart-shaped balloon shredded itself. Quoting Picasso on his Instagram, Banksy wrote: ""The urge to destroy is also a creative urge - Picasso.""

The video then shows someone in a hoodie installing the device, before another caption, saying: ""In case it was ever put up for auction."" The video then shows the moment the painting shredded itself at the auction house on Friday, captured on a mobile phone. It is unclear how the shredder was activated. Moments before, the 2006 stencilled spray-painting had sold for Â£1.042m. ""It appears we just got Banksy-ed,"" said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's senior director and head of contemporary art in Europe.

John Brandler, director of Brandler Art Galleries, described Banksy as ""the ultimate publicity artist"" and said the stunt was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""He has made Damien Hirst look like an amateur,"" Mr Brandler said. Banksy rose to prominence through a series of graffiti pieces across the country. The enigmatic artist is thought to have grown up in Bristol, but his identity has remained a secret despite much speculation over the years. Among his recent works was the 2015 opening of Dismaland, a Disneyland-esque attractionat a lido in Weston-super-Mare, which he described as a ""family theme park unsuitable for children"". In 2017, Girl With Balloon, which originally appeared on a wall in Great Eastern Street, London, wasvoted the nation's favourite artwork. The gallery version featured spray paint and acrylic on canvas, mounted on a board. Sotheby's has not revealed who bought the piece before it was shredded. At the moment it is unclear whether their contract still stands. Mr Brancziktold the Financial Times,externalthe auction house was trying to ""figure out"" what the stunt means. He said: ""We have not experienced this situation in the pastâ...where a painting spontaneously shredded, upon achieving a [near-]record for the artist. ""We are busily figuring out what this means in an auction context.""

"This video can not be played The oil tanker collided with a car on a major road between two cities At least 50 people have died after an oil tanker collided with a car on a major road in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The incident occurred near the city of Kisantu, between the capital Kinshasa and the port of Matadi. One hundred people suffered second-degree burns, Atou Matabuana, the governor of Kongo Central region said. ""The flames spread rapidly, engulfing nearby houses,"" the UN's Okapi radio reported. Roads in the central African nation have often been neglected after years of war. In 2010, 220 people were killed when an overturned oil tanker explodedand set fire to parts of a village in the country. One witness told the AFP news agency that they had seen ""53 charred bodies"". A doctor at nearby hospital treating the victims said it was a race against time to treat survivors. ""We are trying to help them, we are trying to rehydrate them but sadly there are those who are dying,"" Dr Tresor told the agency. Mr Matabuana said local authorities had ""taken measures to take charge of all the victims"". However,the pro-democracy group Lucha criticised the response the lack of ambulances in a tweet,external.

"The number of referrals to Camhs has increased by over a quarter in five years, according to a report The number of referrals to child and adolescent mental health services in England has increased by 26% over the past five years, Education Policy Institute (EPI) research suggests. Its report also reveals one in four referrals was either rejected or deemed inappropriate for treatment. Out of 60 providers questioned, 54 gave a response. The Department of Health said it was investing an additional Â£1.4bn into mental health services for children. The figures, shared with BBC Radio 5 live Investigates, were compiled using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) and local authorities in England. Some providers in England were unable to give the full information requested - 33 supplied data about numbers of referrals over five years. Based on these figures, mental health referrals for under 18s increased from 157,000 in 2013-14 to 198,280 in 2017-18. According to data from more providers - 50 in total - for 2017-18 alone, children and adolescent mental health referrals topped 264,000. Child mental health: Camhs 'not fit for purpose' Caring for a child with mental health issues Child mental health: When it feels like no-one is listening George Hodgson, now 22, experienced problems accessing Camhs when he went for an assessment, after struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. Describing how he felt at the time, George told5 live Investigates:""I was a complete state, throughout the session I was crying and was having regular intrusive suicidal thoughts."" George struggled to access CAMHS when he was 16 After being told he would not be seen again for 40 weeks, George was left feeling frightened and that he was not being taken seriously. He and his family decided they could not wait that long and got help privately. Two years after the initial assessment, and after receiving no correspondence in the interim, they received a call saying George could now be seen by Camhs. Reflecting on his experience, George said: ""I don't know if I would have coped if private support wasn't there. I'm not sure I would be here today."" Jo Hutchinson, director of social mobility and vulnerable learners at the EPI, said the research provided little evidence of good news for children. ""While we have seen a reduction in some of the longest waiting times, many children still face a lengthy period of time before they can receive any specialist treatment and the number of referrals into these stretched services is rising."" According tothe EPI report,external, around 55,800 children under-18 did not meet the criteria for specialist treatment after being referred in 2017-18. Some reasons for excluding them from treatment include: self-harm referrals accepted only if accompanied by another mental health condition a weight loss of less than 15% from their ideal weight for an eating disorder (although this is against National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines) young people must have already engaged with early intervention services and waited a specified length of time. Many providers also said that some young people's needs should be met by other services, for example if they were homeless or had parents with a substance addiction. Some local authorities - 27 out of the 111 who responded to the FOI - said they had scrapped services related to the mental health and wellbeing of children over the last eight years. These included community-based early intervention services, family counselling and mental health support for looked-after children, as well as school-based programmes to support children with mild to moderate mental health difficulties. Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""We hear every day from young people who haven't been able to get the help they need from Camhs. ""Crucially, we also need to address the gaps in youth and community services that could provide help early on, before young people require more specialist treatment."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are transforming mental health services for children and young people with an additional Â£1.4bn and are on track to ensure that 70,000 more children a year have specialist mental health care by 2020-21. ""We are improving access to mental health services through schools with a brand new dedicated workforce, as well as piloting a four-week waiting time standard in some areas, so we can better understand how to reduce waiting times. ""We are completely committed to achieving parity between physical and mental health as part of our long-term plan for the NHS, backed by an additional Â£20.5bn of funding per year by 2023-24.""

"Tens of thousands of people have marched through Edinburgh in support of Scottish independence. A mass rally at Holyrood Park at the end of the march went ahead despite a ban from the body responsible for the park. Historic Environment Scotland said on Saturday its priority was to ""facilitate the march safely"". They had earlier said a rally could not be held as events of a ""political nature"" are not allowed. Indyref2 rally ban 'remains in force' Gary J Kelly, of organiser All Under One Banner, said he believed around 100,000 took part in the march. Police said the City of Edinburgh Council estimated that there were about 20,000 participants. It is the latest in a series of events across the country which have been organised by the political pressure group which campaigns for Scottish independence. Mr Kelly said the turnout proved there was desire for constitutional change. ""The passion is there for definite at the end of the day,"" he said. ""The people have spoken. The SNP asked us to speak, well the people have spoken. We've done it all year round."" Keith Brown, the deputy leader of the SNP, was among those taking part in the march Insp Murray Starkey, of Police Scotland, said one arrest was made in connection with a minor offence during the march. ""Both the participants and the wider public are thanked for their patience and cooperation during today's event,"" he added. Organiser Gary J Kelly estimated that 100,000 people took part in the march Independence supporters began gathering in the capital on Saturday morning with the march setting off from Johnston Terrace at 13:00. Stalls and a stage were erected in Holyrood Park. The park, which sits next to the Scottish Parliament building, is managed by public body Historic Environment Scotland. On Friday All Under One Banner claimed that they had been ""victorious"" in their campaign to have the ban on the rally overturned. But Historic Environment Scotland told BBC Scotland on Friday that the police had not overturned the ban, and that All Under One Banner still did not have permission ""for the set-up of stalls, staging, branding and other static presence within Holyrood Park"". On Saturday, a Historic Environment Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Our priority for today is to work with our partners including Police Scotland to facilitate the march safely through Holyrood Park. ""We will review the situation after the march."" The march set off from Johnston Terrace at 13:00 They headed down the Royal Mile towards the Scottish Parliament All Under One Banner said they were legally entitled to use Holyrood Park under the country's ""freedom to roam"" laws. They say the Land Reform Scotland Act allows them to remain in the park for recreational and educational purposes. However, the rules say that the rights of others must also be respected. Organiser Gary J Kelly criticiseda statement from Historic Environment Scotland,external, which said it did not permit ""political events of any nature"" within its properties. Mr Kelly said: ""They refused our application on political grounds. ""If you look at every castle around Scotland, it has a Union Jack above it - that's a political statement on its own.""

"Rowling has written four crime novels under her Robert Galbraith pseudonym JK Rowling has said she once suspected the BBC of revealing the fact she was writing crime novels under the alias Robert Galbraith. ""I thought it had probably leaked from the BBC,"" the author said, adding she had feared someone at the corporation had ""put two and two together"". Rowling's secret identity was actually revealed after a partner at a law firm told his wife's best friend. The friend then revealed Rowling's identity to a Sunday Times journalist. ""I was a bit unlucky the way it happened,"" the Harry Potter creator told BBC Radio 2's Graham Norton. ""My ambition was to try and get three [novels] out without being unmasked."" Tom Burke plays Cormoran Strike in the BBC's TV adaptations Rowling said she came to suspect the BBC had made the connection after her publisher was approached about adapting the first Robert Galbraith crime novel for television. ""The BBC actually approached Robert without knowing it was me, which put me in a real quandary,"" she explained. ""I had this bizarre meeting with my agent and my editor,"" she went on. ""I said to them 'Well, what do we do? This is an amazing thing that they've contacted us to try and adapt it for TV, but I obviously can't take this meeting.'"" Rowling said it was ""a bit of a shock""when she was outed in 2013. ""When it leaked initially, for about four horrible days actually, we didn't know how it had leaked because so few people knew the secret,"" she told Norton. ""I was a bit unlucky,"" Rowling told Graham Norton Rowling had already published one novel as Robert Galbraith, The Cuckoo's Calling, when it was revealed she was its author. She has gone on to write three more novels about war veteran turned private investigator Cormoran Strike - The Silkworm, Career of Evil and Lethal White,which came out last month. Rowling said she hopes to write as many as 10 Strike novels and already has ideas for the next two books. She also revealed that the Strike of her imagination was now ""a hybrid"" between her original conception and actor Tom Burke,who plays the characterin the BBC adaptations of the novels.

"Anthony Martial scored the goal that levelled the scores in the 76th minute Manchester United fought back from two down to beat Newcastle and avert a defeat that would have cranked up the pressure on manager Jose Mourinho. The hosts conceded twice in a lacklustre first 10 minutes, with Kenedy and Yoshinori Muto breezing in to score. United briefly roused themselves with Marcus Rashford heading wide from five yards, but also needed David de Gea's excellence to deny Muto his second and a potentially decisive third for the Magpies. The hosts departed at the break to jeers - some of which were aimed at the club's owner and executives, rather than the manager. But by the final whistle, it was the name of Mourinho that rang around Old Trafford. Analysis - two days bordering on the unbelievable for Mourinho I can cope with manhunt - Mourinho All the reaction from Old Trafford What else happened in the Premier League on Saturday? The Portuguese, who brought Alexis Sanchez, Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini off the bench in pursuit of victory, saw his side reenergised after the break, when two of his three substitutes found the net. As Newcastle dropped deeper, Mata swept home a free-kick with 20 minutes left to trigger an onslaught on the visiting goal. Martial curled home six minutes later from Paul Pogba's pass and, after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka pawed away Chris Smalling's effort, Sanchez delivered the winner in the last minute of normal time, heading in Ashley Young's cross. Yoshinori Muto marked his first Premier League start with a goal According to one report on Saturday, the club hierarchy had decided before this game to get rid of Mourinho regardless of today's result. BBC Sport's understanding is that Mourinho, in fact,still has the support of the club's board. Their faith might have been tested by an astonishing opening. As chief executive Ed Woodward watched on grim-faced in the stands, United's defence crumbled, conceding twice in the initial 10 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time. First, a lunging Nemanja Matic failed to intercept in midfield before Young tamely allowed Kenedy to turn on to his favoured left foot and fire in. Three minutes later, the hosts were either too uncertain or unwilling to close down Jonjo Shelvey, allowing him to sweep into the heart of the box, where Muto easily turned Young and buried Newcastle's second. Mourinho, who had joked with former Chelsea charge Kenedy in the tunnel and playfully squirted a water bottle at a television camera before kick-off, appeared far less jovial by then. As he gesticulated wildly on the sideline, his players looked at each other in apparent shock. Mourinho departed to cheers on the final whistle Mourinho acted quickly in response, sacrificing Eric Bailly, a Â£30m specialist signing, after just 19 minutes. He installed Scott McTominay, a relatively inexperienced midfielder, in the centre of defence in order to make space for Mata. That reflected a season of confusing decisions and a summer of transfer frustration during which Mourinho made no secret of his desire to sign another centre-back. Manchester United certainly looked no more solid after the switch as Muto came close to a third and Mohamed Diame strode within striking range unchallenged. The home side were on to their third defensive formation by the start of the second half as Fellaini replaced McTominay. With Mourinho's half-time words apparently having the desired effect, they finally hit on a line-up that worked. United were more purposeful and urgent, and chased down the game with a determination reminiscent of some of Sir Alex Ferguson's finest days. The glee on the final whistle should be tempered by the strength of the opposition, though. Newcastle are without a win in their eight league games this season and, once Mata's goal went in, lost belief and shape. Against tougher opponents, Manchester United may well have found such an escape impossible. Benitez's meeting with Mike Ashley this week was his first in five months After meeting manager Rafael Benitez and some of the squad at an Italian restaurant on Wednesday in an apparent bridge-building exercise, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was in attendance for his third match in a row. The visitors are in dire need of his interest and, more importantly, his investment. Two points from eight games represents the Magpies' worst start to a top-flight season in the era of three points for a win. With only goal difference keeping them from the bottom of the table, Benitez will surely lobby for more money to spend in January after failing to persuade Ashley to back his judgement in the summer. The substitute's composure on the ball spread throughout United once he was on the pitch. He recorded 91.4% passing accuracy in the Newcastle half - the best of any home player - and scored the critical goal to start the comeback.

""We have to stay calm and be sure we continue working in this way, because we will win games if we play like that."" Manchester United registered their seventh Premier League win after being two or more goals down at half-time - four more than any other team. This is Newcastle's worst-ever start to a top-flight season after eight games in terms of points (2). Newcastle are winless in their eight Premier League games this season - only in 1898-99 (first 10) have they gone longer without a win from the start of a top-flight campaign. Newcastle have lost eight Premier League matches when scoring first against Manchester United. Newcastle found themselves leading for the first time this season in any competition. Since his Premier League debut in August 2011, Mata has scored more direct free-kick goals in the Premier League than any other player (8). Paul Pogba has had a hand in 29 Premier League goals under Mourinho at Manchester United (13 goals, 16 assists), more than any other player. Since 2016/17, Manchester United attacker Alexis Sanchez has scored three 90+ minute winners in the Premier League, more than any other player. What's next?

"Anthony Martial scored the goal that levelled the scores in the 76th minute Manchester United fought back from two down to beat Newcastle and avert a defeat that would have cranked up the pressure on manager Jose Mourinho. The hosts conceded twice in a lacklustre first 10 minutes, with Kenedy and Yoshinori Muto breezing in to score. United briefly roused themselves with Marcus Rashford heading wide from five yards, but also needed David de Gea's excellence to deny Muto his second and a potentially decisive third for the Magpies. The hosts departed at the break to jeers - some of which were aimed at the club's owner and executives, rather than the manager. But by the final whistle, it was the name of Mourinho that rang around Old Trafford. Analysis - two days bordering on the unbelievable for Mourinho I can cope with manhunt - Mourinho All the reaction from Old Trafford What else happened in the Premier League on Saturday? The Portuguese, who brought Alexis Sanchez, Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini off the bench in pursuit of victory, saw his side reenergised after the break, when two of his three substitutes found the net. As Newcastle dropped deeper, Mata swept home a free-kick with 20 minutes left to trigger an onslaught on the visiting goal. Martial curled home six minutes later from Paul Pogba's pass and, after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka pawed away Chris Smalling's effort, Sanchez delivered the winner in the last minute of normal time, heading in Ashley Young's cross. Yoshinori Muto marked his first Premier League start with a goal According to one report on Saturday, the club hierarchy had decided before this game to get rid of Mourinho regardless of today's result. BBC Sport's understanding is that Mourinho, in fact,still has the support of the club's board. Their faith might have been tested by an astonishing opening. As chief executive Ed Woodward watched on grim-faced in the stands, United's defence crumbled, conceding twice in the initial 10 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time. First, a lunging Nemanja Matic failed to intercept in midfield before Young tamely allowed Kenedy to turn on to his favoured left foot and fire in. Three minutes later, the hosts were either too uncertain or unwilling to close down Jonjo Shelvey, allowing him to sweep into the heart of the box, where Muto easily turned Young and buried Newcastle's second. Mourinho, who had joked with former Chelsea charge Kenedy in the tunnel and playfully squirted a water bottle at a television camera before kick-off, appeared far less jovial by then. As he gesticulated wildly on the sideline, his players looked at each other in apparent shock.

"Barbara Broccoli, seen here with actor Daniel Craig, has co-produced eight Bond films James Bond will ""probably"" never be played by a female actress, the film series' executive producer has said. Barbara Broccoli, who is in charge of casting 007, toldthe Guardian:,external""Bond is male. He's a male character. He was written as a male and I think he'll probably stay as a male. ""And that's fine. We don't have to turn male characters into women."" Current Bond star Daniel Craig, has suggested the next film, due out in 2020,will be his last as 007. Idris Elba has been one of the actors rumoured to take on the role, afterposting a cryptic tweet earlier this year. Who is in the running to play 007? While others have wondered whether a woman could be cast in the role. Last year, Prime Minister Theresa Mayreportedly said,external""one day there should be a female James Bond"". Meanwhile, actresses Gillian Anderson and Vicky McClure have both joked they could be in the running as the next Bond incarnation. Anderson suggested she might rename the character Jane Bond, while McClure said it was ""genius"" to think of a ""Nottingham girl playing Bond"". Broccoli with Daniel Craig in 2005, shortly after Craig was announced to play Bond However, Ms Broccoli, 58, said instead of lobbying for a female James Bond, filmmakers should ""create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters"". She said the Bond character had ""transformed with the times"". ""I've tried to do my part, and I think particularly with the Daniel [Craig] films, they've become much more current in terms of the way women are viewed."" However, she said because the film was written in the 1950s there are ""certain things"" in the secret agent's DNA that my never change. Ms Broccoli, whose father Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli produced many of the Bond films, has previously shown support and mentored women working in the film industry.

"Mary Henfrey has praised the shared appointments she has attended in Northumberland Shared appointments at doctors' surgeries are being trialled across England - and patients like them, a group of GPs has said. Up to 15 patients with the same condition have shared GP appointments as part of tests at some surgeries, the Royal College of GPs said. It said patients benefited from support from other people, while GPs said it stopped them repeating advice. But Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said the approach would not work for everyone. The idea first came from the US around 10 years ago, but small scale trials have been increased in recent years across England, Prof Stokes-Lampard added. The appointments have been used for people with conditions ranging from raised blood pressure and  rheumatoid arthritis, to chronic back pain and asthma. GP online: Opportunity or threat? Pilot areas announced for NHS app Chronic migraine trial 'could change life' Mary Henfrey regularly attends shared appointments near her home in Northumberland and thinks the sessions are useful. ""The good part about it is people ask questions that you might not have thought of asking yourself,"" she told the BBC. ""It is nice to see other people, talk to them and get their experiences as well. And everybody who is there seems pleased to be there."" The sessions last for up to two hours and involve everyone signing a confidentiality agreement. Mrs Henfrey added: ""I know the first time I ever went to one of the group sessions... everyone was reminded of confidentiality. ""But once you have been to a number of these group sessions, you know everybody there and the confidentiality thing just doesn't arise. ""Everyone is interested in their own thing."" Dr Frazer Birrell says the sessions offer better care for patients with chronic conditions Dr Frazer Birrell, who runs groups in the North East, said there were more than 300 shared sessions taking place across England. ""It won't suit everyone, but what we are trying to do is offer people choices. ""The big trouble is we don't have enough nurses, we don't have enough doctors and waiting times are worse than we want. ""So this is one possible solution where if we see people together, we can offer them better care... and we can see the people with chronic conditions more regularly."" Prof Stokes-Lampard said the idea of group education has been around for many years, including antenatal classes and group cardiac rehab sessions. ""Those are just about information giving. This is something different. This is a two-way interactive process."" She said the sessions would never replace private one-on-one consultations, adding: ""This isn't going to be something that everyone is going to be offered and it would never be appropriate for huge numbers of people. ""Sometimes being unwell can be a very lonely place, and learning from colleagues, friends, and other patients can be a very powerful way of realising you are not alone."" She said the number of shared appointments is likely to continue to grow over the next decade. The Patients Association said group consultations could be ""reassuring"" as people could see others who shared the same concerns and challenges caused by their condition. But the group's chief executive, Rachel Power, added: ""Patients must be given the choice as to whether to participate, or to continue with more traditional GP services.""

"Royal Mail intervened when people started posting empty crisp packets back to Walkers Snack firm Walkers has announced a recycling scheme - after Royal Mail begged campaigners not to post empty crisp packets without envelopes. From December, snack fans will be able to post used bags - in envelopes, for free - directly to a recycling company. Campaigner Geraint Ashcroft, wholaunched the petition against Walkers, said it was ""a great first step"". The company said it had been in talks about the scheme since the beginning of the year. It will involve packets being turned into plastic items such as benches, watering cans and plant pots by recycling firm TerraCycle. Marine biology student Emily Stevenson wore a dress made out of crisp packets during her graduation ceremony, to put pressure on Walkers Mr Ashcroft, whose petition against the Leicester-based crisp maker has been signed by more than 330,000 people, said the announcement was ""really exciting"". ""I hope other snack companies get on board,"" he said. ""This is a great first step and makes all the work that's gone into the petition worthwhile."" Royal Mail: Stop posting crisp packets without envelopes What's the real price of getting rid of plastic packaging? Marine plastic: Hundreds of fragments in dead seabirds All the plastic you can and cannot recycle But the firm ""still have a lot to do to meet their pledge of making their packaging fully recyclable, compostable or biodegradable [by 2025]"", Mr Ashcroft added. Walkers crisps are packaged in metallised plastic film, to stop them from going rancid Campaign group 38 Degrees, which previously encouraged people to post their crisp packets back to the company, said it was ""delighted"" to hear about the scheme. ""It's proof that public pressure can shift big companies to do more to prevent waste,"" said executive director David Babbs. ""The public will be watching to make sure that the new recycling scheme isn't just a PR stunt,"" he added. Beach Guardian campaign group founder Emily Stevenson, who wore a dress made of crisp packets during her graduation ceremony, briefly said before catching a flight: ""We spoke, they listened and now they have acted."" Her father and fellow campaigner Rob Stevenson added: ""The public and media really supported her graduation dress and it enabled her to demonstrate her knowledge and passion about the subject. ""Exactly what she suggested on her TV appearances as a short-term solution has now been adopted by PepsiCo so it makes us very happy to see this action. ""We still think that a 2025 target is too long and look forward to hearing more positive steps along the way to the goal being achieved."" Walkers described its partnership with TerraCycle as ""the UK's first nationwide recycling scheme for crisp packets"". Any brand of crisp packets - not just Walkers - will be accepted. People will be encouraged to drop off their packets at one of hundreds of ""public access collection points"" around the country They can also put them in a box or envelope and post them to TerraCycle free of charge The packets will be cleaned, shredded and turned into small pellets which will be converted into plastic items The scheme is due to start in December. Walkers' packets are made from a fusion of plastic and aluminium foil. Crisps are packaged like this by many manufacturers because of their high fat content, which means they can quickly go rancid when exposed to oxygen. Walkers said its packets are technically recyclable, but until now they were not being separated or collected for recycling. Ian Ellington, general manager of Walkers' owner PepsiCo UK, said: ""We share people's concerns about the amount of plastic in our environment and are working on a number of both short and long-term solutions to reduce the impact of our packaging."" Campaigner Geraint Ashcroft met Duncan Gordon from Walkers' owner PepsiCo in August Laure Cucuron, general manager of TerraCycle Europe, said: ""We hope other snack manufacturers will follow suit, by investing in new ways to reduce the amount of packaging that goes to landfill and incineration.""

"Alistair Collier was last seen near the start of the race An aircraft has been brought in to search for a kayaker who went missing during a race off the Dorset coast. Alistair Collier, 60, from Worcester, was last seen at 12:00 BST on Saturday at the start of the course at Knoll Beach, Studland. An ""extensive search"" was carried out including a helicopter four coastguard rescue teams and three lifeboats. A coastguard fixed-wing aircraft is now being used as the hunt continues across an extended area. Duty commander Mark Rodaway from HM Coastguard said ""there has been no sign"" of Mr Collier since Saturday, adding the service was ""obviously very concerned for him"". He said: ""The search will be extended this morning to other areas to allow for the time that has passed and the possibility that he may have got to safety somewhere else."" Police say Mr Collier's kayak is white with a blue stripe The service said organisers raised the alarm at 13:45 BST when Mr Collier did not complete the race on Saturday. Police said Mr Collier was wearing a red life jacket and was in a white canoe with a stabiliser and a blue stripe on top.

"Protesters gather outside the US Supreme Court following an immigration ruling in June The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg could change the political composition of the US Supreme Court and has revived discussions about how nasty the selection process can be in the US. The debate is unlike any the UK has when justices at the Supreme Court are replaced, as a different appointment system means their political views are rarely publicly known and, according to experts, do not have any influence in the process. In the US, the nine-member Supreme Court is the third branch of the federal government and its decisions have a profound impact on American society. It is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between state and federal governments, and final appeals to stay executions. Under Article 2 of the constitution, the president has the power to make a nomination. ""There's no clear view as to why the president was granted this power,"" said Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law at Yale University. The Senate has the task to approve a candidate, in usually tense hearings, a method that enforces the concept of checks and balances between the powers envisioned by the Founding Fathers. Candidates do not have to meet any qualifications and serve lifetime terms - a contentious topic for many. That is why replacing a justice is one of the most consequential decisions of a president. So, unsurprisingly, every nomination is a highly politicised affair. Why is the US top court so important? Observers say recent nominees have been more ideological than in the past Divisions at the top court are not new, as presidents tend to nominate people with the same ideological positions, but scholars say there was little evidence of partisan division until recently. Dissent in the past was infrequent and, when it happened, did not tend to break along party lines, Prof Neal Devins and Prof Lawrence Baum wrote inHow Party Polarization Turned the Supreme Court into a Partisan Court,external. Take theDred Scott v Sandford case,external, in which the court declared in 1857 that slaves were not US citizens and could not sue in federal courts. The two diverging votes in one of the most important decisions of that time came from judges who had been appointed by both the Whig and Democratic parties. The lack of partisan divide remained over the following decades but signs of divisions started to emerge. Byron White was the last conservative-leaning nomination by a Democrat - President John F Kennedy in 1962 - whileDavid Souter,externalwas the last liberal-leaning justice appointed by a Republican president - George H W Bush in 1990. Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's choice for Supreme Court US Supreme Court: Who are the justices? Things changed in 2010, with the retirement ofJohn Paul Stevens,external, a liberal justice appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975. Since then, all of the nominations by Democrats have been liberal while all those appointed by Republicans are conservative, the first time in the court's history that ideological positions coincide with party lines, Prof Devins and Prof Baum wrote. ""Today's partisan split, while unprecedented, is likely enduring."" The partial exception, they said, was Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Republican appointee who sided with liberal justices on key issues like abortion, death penalty and gay rights, and has now retired. Now that Brett Kavanaugh, who by all accounts is a reliable conservative, has been confirmed as Mr Kennedy's replacement, he is expected to push the court to the right, restoring a conservative majority of 5-4. And being relatively young, 53 years old, he is likely to be there for many years. That is one of the reasons why his nomination has an even bigger significance. The confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees are usually tense and closely followed Analysts say Mr Kavanaugh's nomination hearings, which included a row over documents related to his years in the George W Bush administration that were shielded from Senate Democrats and the public as well as allegations of sexual misconduct that he denied, have been the most contentious in recent history, and highlighted how partisan divisions can dominate the process. Writing in theStanford Law Review Online in 2012,external, Eric Hamilton said: ""Politicisation of the Supreme Court causes the American public to lose faith in the Court"". In the UK, the12-member Supreme Court,externalwas created in 2009, replacing the Law Lords in Parliament, bringing the UK into line with many comparable modern states. It acts as a final court of appeal in cases of major public importance. The justices are nominated by an independent commission,external, chaired by the president of the court, a senior judge from anywhere in the UK to be named by the president and members of the appointment commissions from England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK Supreme Court was created in 2009 (File picture) A number of senior judges must be consulted by the commission before any decision is taken. Candidates must have been a senior judge for at least two years or a qualified lawyer for at least 15. When someone is chosen, the name is sent to the justice secretary, who can accept or reject it. If accepted, the nomination is then sent to the prime minister, who recommends it to the Queen, who makes the appointment. These rules, experts say, mean that political positions of nominees are often unknown or irrelevant in the process. Q&A: UK Supreme Court,external ""[Changes were not] very controversial at all. There was no discussion of it in the press when the names were announced and when we looked at the people who were there it was all understandable,"" said Alison Young, Prof of Public Law at the University of Cambridge. ""We have a completely independent process... It's almost seen like an internal promotion system rather than a politicised process,"" she added, saying that citizens can officially complain over alleged political bias. Another difference is that the UK has no codified, written constitution, so the court does not have the ability to strike down a law as unconstitutional, unlike in the US, where the court has also been involved in key political decisions. In 1997, in a case involving then President Bill Clinton, the US Supreme Court ruled thatsitting US presidents could be prosecuted,external. In 1974, itordered President Richard Nixon to deliver tape recordings,externalrelated to the Watergate scandal. There is no limit to UK justices' terms but they must retire when they are 75 years old. Similar age restrictions are in place in other Western European countries too. In Germany, for example, the top judges serve 12-year terms with no re-election allowed and must retire at the age of 68. In Switzerland, they serve six-year terms and can be re-elected an unlimited number of times - but theymust resign at the age of 68,external. (Both countries have different selection processes.) The partisan split at the Supreme Court is unprecedented, some experts say Lifetime appointments in the US were originally designed to isolate them from political pressure. But given the current climate, critics argue that, in fact, the opposite is happening and some have defended the introduction of fixed terms. ""It doesn't make sense at all,"" said Prof Ackerman, from Yale, about lifetime terms. And so, members nominated at a relatively young age - Justice Clarence Thomas, another controversial nomination, was 43 when he was appointed in 1991 - can serve for several decades. Opponents to terms, meanwhile, say theycould actually make the politicisation even worse,external, as presidents would be more inclined to make partisan nominations as justices would have temporary terms.

"Judge Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegations made by Prof Christine Blasey Ford The US Senate has narrowly advanced President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to a final vote. Friday's vote - 51-49 in favour - was a test of support for the embattled nominee who has faced sexual assault allegations from several women. All eyes are on several swing senators for Saturday's final vote. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would tilt America's highest court in favour of conservatives. The nine-member panel has the final say on issues such as abortion, gun control and voting rules and justices are appointed for life. Allow Twitter content?

Following Friday's vote, Mr Trump tweeted that he was ""very proud"". What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words The truth about false assault accusations Hundreds of protesters against Judge Kavanaugh were arrested in Washington DC, on Thursday, including comedian Amy Schumer. After Friday's vote, dozens also were arrested outside Republican Senator Jeff Flake's office. Mr Flake told reporters that unless ""something big"" changes, he will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. This video can not be played Protesters take to Capitol Hill Friday's ""cloture"" vote activated a 30-hour period of discussions in the Senate, which will be followed by the final simple majority vote on Saturday. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. But two key swing senators voted against their party colleagues: Republican Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin. Mr Manchin, of West Virginia, represents a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide. The self-described ""most centrist Democrat"" is also up for re-election this year. This video can not be played Collins: I vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh Ms Murkowski of Alaska, a state that also voted pro-Trump in 2016, has been undecided on Judge Kavanaugh throughout the hearings. She has been lobbied by sexual assault survivors to vote against the judge and represents a state with the highest sex crime rate by far in America,according to FBI data,external. Despite deciding against the nominee on Friday, she told reporters afterwards she has still not made up her mind on the confirmation vote, according to Reuters news agency. Another key Republican senator, Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, announced that she would vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh on Saturday. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh Given that Republicans have a razor-thin margin of control in the Senate, the party can potentially only afford another defection if it wants to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - assuming the two swing senators vote the same on Saturday. Complicating matters, the office of Republican Steve Daines said on Thursday he was planning to attend his daughter's wedding in Montana on Saturday. On Friday morning, he was reported to be arranging travel back to Washington DC for the final vote. The truth about lie detector tests Are young men in America scared? Simple guide to mid-term elections The judge has maintained he would be a neutral justice ina Wall Street Journal editorial titled, ""I am an independent, impartial judge"",external. Addressing his angry testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he branded the allegations against him an ""orchestrated political hit"", he wrote: ""I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News The margin of error for confirming Brett Kavanaugh has evaporated. With Lisa Murkowski voting No on a key procedural motion, it seems very likely she will be a No on the final vote, as well. Republicans had one vote among their ranks to spare. Now, unless someone like West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin crosses party lines, they have to hold ranks. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, whose change of heart prompted the current week-long delay in a final vote, has signalled he's a probable Yes. Republicans might be inclined to keep him comfortably sequestered in a quiet room in the Capitol until tomorrow. That leaves Susan Collins of Maine as the probable deciding vote. She'll announce her intentions later on Friday. If she says she's a Yes, Mr Kavanaugh can start shopping for Supreme Court robes. If she's a No, Saturday will get very interesting. Judge Kavanaugh has faced sexual assault allegations from several women, most prominently Professor Christine Blasey Ford. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Both gave public testimony last week in which Prof Ford said she had been assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in 1982.

After the testimony, President Trump agreed to a new FBI inquiry. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Federal agents are believed to have spoken to five witnesses regarding Prof Ford's accusations and another four other witnesses involving a separate accusation by Deborah Ramirez, who said the nominee had exposed himself to her when they were both at Yale University.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's nominee has been embroiled in a bitter battle over sexual assault allegations. After weeks of controversy, the US Senate has begun the final vote on the confirmation of President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh. If senators do not change their voting intentions, Judge Kavanaugh will be appointed to the top US court. Mr Kavanaugh has been embroiled in a bitter battle to stave off sexual assault allegations. His confirmation would strengthen conservative control of the court. The political fallout from the Kavanaugh vote The upper house is split 51-49 in favour of the Republicans and the vote will be largely along party lines. Mr Kavanaugh would actually only need a 50-50 vote, as that would force a tie-breaker in his favour from Vice-President Mike Pence. The tally in a procedural vote on Friday was 51-49. Brett Kavanaugh has faced a controversial nomination process It's looking as though there will be a similar two-vote margin in Saturday's vote, barring last-minute changes of mind. That's because Republican senators who had been wavering on the issue have come down, with one exception, on Mr Kavanaugh's side. This was the voting in a procedural, or cloture, vote on Friday The one exception is Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski. Although she said Mr Kavanaugh was a ""good man"", she said he was ""not the right person for the court at this time"" and his ""appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable"". She remains a no. However, Democrat Joe Manchin told the Senate on Friday he would vote yes. He is facing a difficult re-election campaign in West Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide. He said he ""found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist"", but later faced shouts of ""shame"" from protesters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two Republican waverers, Susan Collins and Jeff Flake, have finally decided to back the judge. Mr Flake has been a frequent critic of Mr Trump but said he would vote yes, barring any major changes in evidence. So the vote should be a duplicate 51-49. However, it has been complicated by the case of Senator Steve Daines. Mr Daines, a yes voter, will be absent to attend his daughter's wedding, so Senator Murkowski has opted instead to mark herself simply as ""present"". This means the vote is likely to be 50-48. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is all but certain. The Republican Party has the votes and the battle appears over. The political war, however, is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout. Read more from Anthony An FBI inquiry was launched into the sexual assault allegations and other issues after Judge Kavanaugh received initial backing for his nomination in a Senate committee vote last week. This video can not be played Collins on Friday: I vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh While the investigation has proved politically contentious, the wavering senators decided it had not provided sufficient grounds to oppose Mr Kavanaugh. Senator Collins said: ""We will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness."" In public testimony last week, Prof Christine Blasey Ford said she had been assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in 1982. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Judge Kavanaugh denied the claim - and allegations that he drank to the point of memory loss at the time - in a feisty confrontation with senators.

He denies Ms Ramirez's allegations, too. Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans said the new FBI report had cleared their nominee. Democratic senators said it had been incomplete. Basically, it's the final arbiter of US law. It has the ultimate say on such contentious issues as abortion and gun control. It has nine judges, all of whom are appointed for life, and the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is likely to give it a more conservative hue. The Democrats are still smarting from the previous Supreme Court appointment. Republicans last year successfully stalled the process, meaning it fell to Mr Trump, not Barack Obama, to nominate the new justice. Mr Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch strengthened the conservative leaning. All eyes will now be on November's mid-term elections. Mr Trump will be able to campaign on the back of an important victory, but commentators will be watching closely how the Kavanaugh affair affects women voters.

"This video can not be played A thermal imaging camera was used to find the girl A teenage girl who called 999 to report she was in an unknown location with a man who had just raped her was found by police using a drone. The 16-year-old contacted police in the early hours of Saturday to say she was on land in Boston with her attacker. Police recognised the description given as a levelled factory site and officers used a drone with a thermal imaging camera to track them both down.

"Anthony Martial scored the goal that levelled the scores in the 76th minute Manchester United fought back from two down to beat Newcastle and avert a defeat that would have cranked up the pressure on manager Jose Mourinho. The hosts conceded twice in a lacklustre first 10 minutes, with Kenedy and Yoshinori Muto breezing in to score. United briefly roused themselves with Marcus Rashford heading wide from five yards, but also needed David de Gea's excellence to deny Muto his second and a potentially decisive third for the Magpies. The hosts departed at the break to jeers - some of which were aimed at the club's owner and executives, rather than the manager. But by the final whistle, it was the name of Mourinho that rang around Old Trafford. Analysis - two days bordering on the unbelievable for Mourinho I can cope with manhunt - Mourinho All the reaction from Old Trafford What else happened in the Premier League on Saturday? The Portuguese, who brought Alexis Sanchez, Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini off the bench in pursuit of victory, saw his side reenergised after the break, when two of his three substitutes found the net. As Newcastle dropped deeper, Mata swept home a free-kick with 20 minutes left to trigger an onslaught on the visiting goal. Martial curled home six minutes later from Paul Pogba's pass and, after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka pawed away Chris Smalling's effort, Sanchez delivered the winner in the last minute of normal time, heading in Ashley Young's cross. Yoshinori Muto marked his first Premier League start with a goal According to one report on Saturday, the club hierarchy had decided before this game to get rid of Mourinho regardless of today's result. BBC Sport's understanding is that Mourinho, in fact,still has the support of the club's board. Their faith might have been tested by an astonishing opening. As chief executive Ed Woodward watched on grim-faced in the stands, United's defence crumbled, conceding twice in the initial 10 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time. First, a lunging Nemanja Matic failed to intercept in midfield before Young tamely allowed Kenedy to turn on to his favoured left foot and fire in. Three minutes later, the hosts were either too uncertain or unwilling to close down Jonjo Shelvey, allowing him to sweep into the heart of the box, where Muto easily turned Young and buried Newcastle's second. Mourinho, who had joked with former Chelsea charge Kenedy in the tunnel and playfully squirted a water bottle at a television camera before kick-off, appeared far less jovial by then. As he gesticulated wildly on the sideline, his players looked at each other in apparent shock. Mourinho departed to cheers on the final whistle Mourinho acted quickly in response, sacrificing Eric Bailly, a Â£30m specialist signing, after just 19 minutes. He installed Scott McTominay, a relatively inexperienced midfielder, in the centre of defence in order to make space for Mata. That reflected a season of confusing decisions and a summer of transfer frustration during which Mourinho made no secret of his desire to sign another centre-back. Manchester United certainly looked no more solid after the switch as Muto came close to a third and Mohamed Diame strode within striking range unchallenged. The home side were on to their third defensive formation by the start of the second half as Fellaini replaced McTominay. With Mourinho's half-time words apparently having the desired effect, they finally hit on a line-up that worked. United were more purposeful and urgent, and chased down the game with a determination reminiscent of some of Sir Alex Ferguson's finest days. The glee on the final whistle should be tempered by the strength of the opposition, though. Newcastle are without a win in their eight league games this season and, once Mata's goal went in, lost belief and shape. Against tougher opponents, Manchester United may well have found such an escape impossible. Benitez's meeting with Mike Ashley this week was his first in five months After meeting manager Rafael Benitez and some of the squad at an Italian restaurant on Wednesday in an apparent bridge-building exercise, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was in attendance for his third match in a row. The visitors are in dire need of his interest and, more importantly, his investment. Two points from eight games represents the Magpies' worst start to a top-flight season in the era of three points for a win. With only goal difference keeping them from the bottom of the table, Benitez will surely lobby for more money to spend in January after failing to persuade Ashley to back his judgement in the summer. The substitute's composure on the ball spread throughout United once he was on the pitch. He recorded 91.4% passing accuracy in the Newcastle half - the best of any home player - and scored the critical goal to start the comeback. This video can not be played Man Utd 3-2 Newcastle: Speculation won't end after win - Jose Mourinho Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:""Marcus Rashford was sad on the pitch, Scott McTominay was scared on the pitch. Even older players commit mistakes that are not normal. ""At half-time we had a good conversation. We didn't promise that we would win the match. We promised we would give absolutely everything without any fear, without any pressure, just the pressure of giving everything and of course they gave everything. ""We fought so much. They deserve even if the game ends 2-2. The feeling would be a positive feeling because nobody can promise to win matches."" This video can not be played Man Utd 3-2 Newcastle: Difficult result to take - Rafael Benitez Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez:""It is difficult to take because we did so well. At 2-0 we had chances to score the third and we had control against a very good team. ""When we conceded the first goal, we started to have problems because they have so many good players that they could bring off the bench, and it is difficult to contain them. ""We have to stay calm and be sure we continue working in this way, because we will win games if we play like that."" Manchester United registered their seventh Premier League win after being two or more goals down at half-time - four more than any other team. This is Newcastle's worst-ever start to a top-flight season after eight games in terms of points (2). Newcastle are winless in their eight Premier League games this season - only in 1898-99 (first 10) have they gone longer without a win from the start of a top-flight campaign. Newcastle have lost eight Premier League matches when scoring first against Manchester United. Newcastle found themselves leading for the first time this season in any competition. Since his Premier League debut in August 2011, Mata has scored more direct free-kick goals in the Premier League than any other player (8). Paul Pogba has had a hand in 29 Premier League goals under Mourinho at Manchester United (13 goals, 16 assists), more than any other player. Since 2016/17, Manchester United attacker Alexis Sanchez has scored three 90+ minute winners in the Premier League, more than any other player. What's next? Once the international break is over, Manchester United travel to Chelsea on Saturday 20 October (12:30 BST), and Newcastle entertain Brighton on the same day (15:00).

The framed Girl With Balloon, one of the artist's best known works, was auctioned by Sotheby's in London. Moments after the piece was sold, the canvas of a girl reaching for a heart-shaped balloon shredded itself.

The video then shows someone in a hoodie installing the device, before another caption, saying: ""In case it was ever put up for auction."" The video then shows the moment the painting shredded itself at the auction house on Friday, captured on a mobile phone. It is unclear how the shredder was activated. Moments before, the 2006 stencilled spray-painting had sold for Â£1.042m. ""It appears we just got Banksy-ed,"" said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's senior director and head of contemporary art in Europe.

John Brandler, director of Brandler Art Galleries, described Banksy as ""the ultimate publicity artist"" and said the stunt was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""He has made Damien Hirst look like an amateur,"" Mr Brandler said. Banksy rose to prominence through a series of graffiti pieces across the country. The enigmatic artist is thought to have grown up in Bristol, but his identity has remained a secret despite much speculation over the years. Among his recent works was the 2015 opening of Dismaland, a Disneyland-esque attractionat a lido in Weston-super-Mare, which he described as a ""family theme park unsuitable for children"". In 2017, Girl With Balloon, which originally appeared on a wall in Great Eastern Street, London, wasvoted the nation's favourite artwork. The gallery version featured spray paint and acrylic on canvas, mounted on a board. Sotheby's has not revealed who bought the piece before it was shredded. At the moment it is unclear whether their contract still stands. Mr Brancziktold the Financial Times,externalthe auction house was trying to ""figure out"" what the stunt means. He said: ""We have not experienced this situation in the pastâ...where a painting spontaneously shredded, upon achieving a [near-]record for the artist.

"This is not the face of a man who is concerned by events An Indian bus driver has been suspended - for letting a monkey ""drive"" his bus. This is despite not one of the 30-or-so passengers on board the vehicle in southern Karnataka state complaining about their furry chauffeur. However, when a video of the relaxed - and apparently competent - langur monkey taking the wheel went viral, the human driver's employers took action. The safety of passengers cannot be put at risk by ""allowing a monkey on the steering"" wheel, a spokesman said. Somewhat unsurprisingly, this has not been an entirely popular decision with internet users delighted by the short clip. ""So sweet. Why suspend.

In fairness to Mr Prakash, he does appear to have one hand on the wheel at all times.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's nominee has been embroiled in a bitter battle over sexual assault allegations. After weeks of controversy, the US Senate has begun the final vote on the confirmation of President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh. If senators do not change their voting intentions, Judge Kavanaugh will be appointed to the top US court. Mr Kavanaugh has been embroiled in a bitter battle to stave off sexual assault allegations. His confirmation would strengthen conservative control of the court. The political fallout from the Kavanaugh vote The upper house is split 51-49 in favour of the Republicans and the vote will be largely along party lines. Mr Kavanaugh would actually only need a 50-50 vote, as that would force a tie-breaker in his favour from Vice-President Mike Pence. The tally in a procedural vote on Friday was 51-49. Brett Kavanaugh has faced a controversial nomination process It's looking as though there will be a similar two-vote margin in Saturday's vote, barring last-minute changes of mind. That's because Republican senators who had been wavering on the issue have come down, with one exception, on Mr Kavanaugh's side. This was the voting in a procedural, or cloture, vote on Friday The one exception is Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski. Although she said Mr Kavanaugh was a ""good man"", she said he was ""not the right person for the court at this time"" and his ""appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable"". She remains a no. However, Democrat Joe Manchin told the Senate on Friday he would vote yes. He is facing a difficult re-election campaign in West Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide. He said he ""found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist"", but later faced shouts of ""shame"" from protesters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two Republican waverers, Susan Collins and Jeff Flake, have finally decided to back the judge. Mr Flake has been a frequent critic of Mr Trump but said he would vote yes, barring any major changes in evidence. So the vote should be a duplicate 51-49. However, it has been complicated by the case of Senator Steve Daines. Mr Daines, a yes voter, will be absent to attend his daughter's wedding, so Senator Murkowski has opted instead to mark herself simply as ""present"". This means the vote is likely to be 50-48. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is all but certain. The Republican Party has the votes and the battle appears over. The political war, however, is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout. Read more from Anthony An FBI inquiry was launched into the sexual assault allegations and other issues after Judge Kavanaugh received initial backing for his nomination in a Senate committee vote last week. This video can not be played Collins on Friday: I vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh While the investigation has proved politically contentious, the wavering senators decided it had not provided sufficient grounds to oppose Mr Kavanaugh. Senator Collins said: ""We will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness."" In public testimony last week, Prof Christine Blasey Ford said she had been assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in 1982. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Judge Kavanaugh denied the claim - and allegations that he drank to the point of memory loss at the time - in a feisty confrontation with senators. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Federal agents are believed to have spoken to five witnesses regarding Prof Ford's accusations and another four other witnesses involving a separate accusation by Deborah Ramirez, who said the nominee had exposed himself to her when they were both at Yale University. He denies Ms Ramirez's allegations, too. Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans said the new FBI report had cleared their nominee. Democratic senators said it had been incomplete. Basically, it's the final arbiter of US law. It has the ultimate say on such contentious issues as abortion and gun control. It has nine judges, all of whom are appointed for life, and the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is likely to give it a more conservative hue. The Democrats are still smarting from the previous Supreme Court appointment. Republicans last year successfully stalled the process, meaning it fell to Mr Trump, not Barack Obama, to nominate the new justice. Mr Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch strengthened the conservative leaning. All eyes will now be on November's mid-term elections. Mr Trump will be able to campaign on the back of an important victory, but commentators will be watching closely how the Kavanaugh affair affects women voters.

Victor Mallet is also vice-president of the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC), which upset local and Chinese authorities by hosting a separatist speaker in August. Hong Kong did not explain its visa decision. China is highly sensitive about the territory's sovereignty. The former British colony was handed back in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. China's ire puts Hong Kong activist in spotlight China operates a ""one country, two system"" agreement, with freedom of speech and press freedom among the key liberties that set Hong Kong apart from the mainland.

"At its peak, Steptoe and Son - starring Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H Corbett - drew audiences of 28m Ray Galton OBE, one of the ""fathers and creators of British sitcom"", has died aged 88. In their 1950s-70s heyday he and co-writer Alan Simpson created classics such as Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe and Son. In 2016, he and Simpson were awarded Bafta's highest honour, the Fellowship. The scriptwriter died on Friday night after a ""long and heartbreaking battle with dementia"", his family said in a statement. ""Ray passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family."" His manager Tessa Le Bars said: ""I have had the great honour of working with Ray for over 50 years and for the last 40 as his manager and friend. ""With his lifelong co-writer, the late Alan Simpson, they were regarded as the fathers and creators of British sitcom."" Mr Galton, left, is pictured here with long-term collaborator Alan Simpson The Galton and Simpson writing duo also wrote TV, film and stage scripts for comedy legends Frankie Howerd, Peter Sellers, Leonard Rossiter and Arthur Lowe. Galton first met the man with whom he would form a creative partnership spanning decades at Milford Sanatorium in Surrey - when both were diagnosed with tuberculosis as teenagers. Alan Simpson, appointed an OBE with Galton in 2000, died last year. Le Bars said it was ""the end of an iconic era, but the legacy of Hancock's Half Hour, Steptoe and Son and over 600 scripts is huge"". ""They will endure, inspire and bring laughter to the nation for evermore,"" she added. Galton and Simpson met in 1947 while recovering from tuberculosis in a sanatorium. Their first break came in 1951 with the radio comedy Happy Go Lucky. They wrote Hancock's Half Hour, a radio and later TV comedy starring Tony Hancock that ran between 1954 and 1961. Steptoe and Son originally began as a 30-minute one-off play for the BBC's Comedy Playhouse series in the early 1960s. Regularly voted one of the nation's favourite comedies, Steptoe ran for scores of episodes and spawned several movies. Awarded OBEs in 2000, Galton and Simpson were also honoured for a Lifetime Achievement by BAFTA in 2016. A blue plaque is on display at the former sanatorium, now Milford Hospital, where they met. Galton and Simpson were perhaps best known for Steptoe and Son, a BBC sitcom about father-and-son pair of rag-and-bone merchants on the make in west London. For more than 57 episodes, between 1962 and 1974, the grasping Albert Steptoe and long-suffering Harold inhabited the fictional street of Oil Drum Lane in Shepherd's Bush. At its peak the show was watched by 28 million people. It was adapted for US television as Sanford and Son and ran on NBC for several years. Born in Paddington - not far from Steptoe's future stamping ground - Galton continued to work into the 90s. His final sitcom was Get Well Soon, a comedy featuring Hugh Bonneville set soon after the establishment of the NHS following World War Two. Inspired by Galton and Simpson's own auspicious first meeting, it ran for six episodes in 1997.

"The UK government has demanded an ""urgent explanation"" of Victor Mallet's visa rejection Hong Kong has refused to renew a work visa for the Asia news editor of the Financial Times, sparking concerns from the UK government. Victor Mallet is also vice-president of the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC), which upset local and Chinese authorities by hosting a separatist speaker in August. Hong Kong did not explain its visa decision. China is highly sensitive about the territory's sovereignty. The former British colony was handed back in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. China's ire puts Hong Kong activist in spotlight China operates a ""one country, two system"" agreement, with freedom of speech and press freedom among the key liberties that set Hong Kong apart from the mainland. The UK Foreign Office says it has asked Hong Kong's authorities for an ""urgent explanation"" of the visa rejection. Press freedom protesters outside Hong Kong's immigration department after Mr Mallet's visa denial Mr Mallet was acting president at the FCC whenthe event featuring young independence activist Andy Chanwas held. China's ministry of foreign affairs urged the club to cancel it and Hong Kong's top official, Carrie Lam, criticised the talk as ""regrettable and inappropriate"". Pro-Beijing groups rallied outside the FCC, calling for the organisation to ""get out of Hong Kong"". However, the club defended its decision and the talk went ahead. What is the media like in Hong Kong? How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Mr Mallet has been running the Financial Times' Asia operations for almost two years. ""This is the first time we have encountered this situation in Hong Kong. We have not been given a reason for the rejection,"" the news organisation said in a statement. The FCC said: ""Hong Kong rightly prides itself on its reputation as a place where the rule of law applies and where freedom of speech is protected by law. In the absence of any reasonable explanation, the FCC calls on the Hong Kong authorities to rescind their decision."" In August, Hong Kong's former leaderCY Leung addressed an open Facebook letter to Mr Mallet,external, saying the FCC talk had ""nothing to do with press freedom"" What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row ""Press freedom is a core value that Hong Kong treasures so much that the government of Hong Kong leased the Club [the FFC] at a token rent the building on Ice House Street in Central,"" he wrote. He expressed concerns that after Mr Chan's talk the club could also invite Taiwanese separatist speakers. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and will not accept talk about its independence. Last month,Hong Kong banned the Hong Kong National Party (HKNP), saying that it posed a threat to national security. It was the first time that the territory has banned a political party since Hong Kong was returned to China from the UK.

""I've tried to do my part, and I think particularly with the Daniel [Craig] films, they've become much more current in terms of the way women are viewed.""

The 16-year-old contacted police in the early hours of Saturday to say she was on land in Boston with her attacker. Police recognised the description given as a levelled factory site and officers used a drone with a thermal imaging camera to track them both down. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of rape. Insp Ed Delderfield, of Lincolnshire Police, said the officers had the drone with the thermal camera in their car.

"Opera singer Montserrat CaballÃ©, whose duet with Freddie Mercury became the signature song of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, has died aged 85. She had been suffering from health complaints for some time and was admitted to hospital in Barcelona last month, according to news agency Efe. Her career spanned 50 years. She had stints with the Basel Opera and Bremen Opera before her international breakthrough in 1965 in Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall in New York. She went on to perform with the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera and Vienna State Opera, appearing opposite the likes of Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. The song Barcelona was first released in 1987 and later became an anthem for the city's 1992 Olympics, the year after Mercury died. CaballÃ© sang at the opening ceremony with Domingo and JosÃ© Carreras. Montserrat CaballÃ© was born in Barcelona, and at the age of nine was accepted for training at the city's Conservatori Liceu. She graduated in 1953, and went to Italy, where she sang some minor roles. Her career advanced rapidly after a successful appearance as Mimi in La BohÃ¨me at the Basel Opera.  In 1965 she made a triumphant debut in the United States, taking over the title role - at short notice - of Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall. Her performance brought widespread praise for the beauty of her voice and her dramatic interpretation, and established her as an international star. CaballÃ© performing in Vienna in 1979 The same year she appeared at Glyndebourne in Der Rosenkavalier and The Marriage of Figaro, but she waited another seven years for her Covent Garden debut - as Violetta in La Traviata. A short but imposing figure, CaballÃ© endeared herself to audiences around the world with her irrepressible personality. Her fans called her La Superba - the superb one. Her career was dogged by ill health. In 1985 she spent three months in hospital with a brain tumour, and had treatment for heart trouble in 1993. In 2015,she was given a six-month suspendedprison sentence for tax fraud. Spanish media say plans are being made for a funeral in Barcelona on Monday. CaballÃ© and Mercury perform Barcelona.

"At its peak, Steptoe and Son - starring Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H Corbett - drew audiences of 28m Ray Galton OBE, one of the ""fathers and creators of British sitcom"", has died aged 88. In their 1950s-70s heyday he and co-writer Alan Simpson created classics such as Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe and Son. In 2016, he and Simpson were awarded Bafta's highest honour, the Fellowship. The scriptwriter died on Friday night after a ""long and heartbreaking battle with dementia"", his family said in a statement. ""Ray passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family."" His manager Tessa Le Bars said: ""I have had the great honour of working with Ray for over 50 years and for the last 40 as his manager and friend. ""With his lifelong co-writer, the late Alan Simpson, they were regarded as the fathers and creators of British sitcom."" Mr Galton, left, is pictured here with long-term collaborator Alan Simpson The Galton and Simpson writing duo also wrote TV, film and stage scripts for comedy legends Frankie Howerd, Peter Sellers, Leonard Rossiter and Arthur Lowe. Galton first met the man with whom he would form a creative partnership spanning decades at Milford Sanatorium in Surrey - when both were diagnosed with tuberculosis as teenagers. Alan Simpson, appointed an OBE with Galton in 2000, died last year. Le Bars said it was ""the end of an iconic era, but the legacy of Hancock's Half Hour, Steptoe and Son and over 600 scripts is huge"". ""They will endure, inspire and bring laughter to the nation for evermore,"" she added. Galton and Simpson met in 1947 while recovering from tuberculosis in a sanatorium.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera looks at why the Russian cyber plot sting was surprising The Dutch government has defended a decision not to detain four Russians accused of an attempted cyber-attack on the global chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague. The suspected Russian agents were sent home as it was not a criminal inquiry, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. The US and UK have joined the Netherlands in blaming Russian spies for a series of cyber-plots worldwide. Russia has complained of a ""stage-managed propaganda campaign"". The decision in April not to prosecute the suspects starkly contrasted with a US announcement on Thursday to level charges against the four, as well as three other alleged members of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency. Reports from Moscow on Friday suggested the Dutch ambassador had been summoned by Russia. The Netherlands said it had caught four agents of Russia's GRU military intelligence red-handed in The Hague in April as they tried to hack the wifi network of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The OPCW was investigating a chemical attack on Syria and a nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal - a Russian ex-spy in the UK One of the four agents, the Dutch said, had been in Malaysia targeting the investigation into the MH17 plane, shot down over eastern Ukraine The US laid charges against seven agents for targeting its anti-doping agency, football's governing body Fifa and US nuclear energy company Westinghouse; of the seven charged, four were the men expelled from the Netherlands, while the other three were amongthose charged in July with hacking Democratic officials during the 2016 US elections Canada said ""with high confidence"" that Russia was behind breaches at its centre for ethics in sports and at the Montreal-based World Anti-Doping Agency The UK accused the GRU of four high-profile cyber-attacks, whose targets included firms in Russia and Ukraine; the US Democratic Party; and a small TV network in the UK Read more:Transparency - the tool to counter Russia By Steven Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent It's become a familiar pattern. The West accuses Moscow of violating international law and provides evidence; Moscow denies it and derides the claims. The military hackers story is no different. Russian officials and pro-Kremlin media have brushed aside Western claims of GRU cyber attacks with one phrase: ""spy mania"". The Izvestia newspaper claimed ""the virus of spy mania had once again infected the West"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta maintained the accusations of Russian military intelligence hacking were ""baseless"". Russia's foreign ministry has already dismissed ""Western hysteria about all-mighty Russian cyber-spies"". The tone is brash, mocking and belligerent.  The message to the West - between the lines - is that Russia cannot be pressured or isolated. But existing sanctions against Russia are beginning to bite and the country's economic problems are mounting. If the latest claims about GRU hackers spark a fresh round of Western sanctions, Russia's economic difficulties will only increase. The passports of all four suspects were seized by Dutch intelligence - this belonged to Alexei Morenets The four men had flown into Amsterdam's Schiphol airport in April on diplomatic passports, hired a car and parked it at the Marriott hotel in The Hague, next to the OPCW office. Their aim had been to intercept login details in the OPCW's wifi network from the boot of their car, said the head of the Dutch MIVD intelligence service, Maj-Gen Onno Eichelsheim. How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' on OPCW Russia, Fancy Bears and hacking Olympic athletes The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia He identified the men as hackers Alexei Morenets and Yevgeny Serebriakov, and support agents Oleg Sotnikov and Alexei Minin. Officials said they were from the GRU's Unit 26165, which has also been known as APT 28. The UK's ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Wilson, said the unit had ""sent officers around the world to conduct brazen close access cyber-operations"" - which involve hacking into wifi networks. When the men were stopped, a large amount of technical equipment, mobile phones and a laptop were seized. But the men themselves were escorted to the airport and flown home rather than being arrested. They had train tickets to travel on to the Swiss capital Berne and were planning to target a laboratory in Spiez where the OPCW analysed samples, Dutch officials said. Among the mobile phones seized, one was found to have been activated near the GRU building in Moscow. Also found was a receipt for a taxi journey from a street near the GRU to the airport. The taxi firm has confirmed to the BBC that the receipt is genuine. In a separate development, investigative website Bellingcat alleged that a car owned by one of the four, Alexei Morenets, was registered to an address on Komsomolsky Prospekt in Moscow - home to GRU's 26165 military unit.  It has found details of 305 individuals whose cars are registered to the same address on a vehicle database. Even though the men were travelling on diplomatic passports, they could still have been arrested because they were not accredited diplomats in the Netherlands. So questions have been asked about the decision to send the suspects home immediately, rather than detain them. Hours after the cyber-plot revelations, US justice officials levelled charges against the four suspects as well as three others. Dutch intelligence named the four suspects who had travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports in April Asked on Dutch TV on Thursday night why the men had not been arrested, Maj-Gen Eichelsheim explained that it had been a counter-intelligence operation with the specific aim of gathering intelligence and keeping the Netherlands safe. Political leaders agreed that the men had not been detained because it was an intelligence operation, rather than a criminal inquiry led by the police. According to Dutch expert Willemijn Aerdts from Leiden university, the intelligence services have no powers of arrest or prosecution. ""If they had arrested them, they would have had to inform the police,"" she told the BBC. ""It might have been a difficult decision but it was probably a political thing as well. The defence minister would have known."" The FBI released this ""wanted"" poster, naming and picturing the seven men ""I don't want to describe this as 'letting them go',"" said the head of Dutch military intelligence. ""We disrupted an operation. That's how we do this type of operation."" His over-riding thought in reacting to the alleged cyber-plot had been ""I'm not going to let this happen"", he said. The laptop seized from the suspects was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia, the Dutch officials said. According to the UK ambassador to the Netherlands, the cyber-operation in Malaysia had targeted the attorney general's office and Malaysian police as well as the investigation into the MH17 crash, in which 298 people died. Earlier this year Dutch-led international investigators concluded that the Buk missile which had brought the plane down had been transported by road from a Russian military base. Data from the laptop showed it had also been used in the Swiss city of Lausanne and was linked to the hacking of a laptop belonging to World anti-doping agency Wada, which has exposed doping by Russian athletes.

"Tens of thousands of people have marched through Edinburgh in support of Scottish independence. A mass rally at Holyrood Park at the end of the march went ahead despite a ban from the body responsible for the park. Historic Environment Scotland said on Saturday its priority was to ""facilitate the march safely"". They had earlier said a rally could not be held as events of a ""political nature"" are not allowed. Indyref2 rally ban 'remains in force' Gary J Kelly, of organiser All Under One Banner, said he believed around 100,000 took part in the march. Police said the City of Edinburgh Council estimated that there were about 20,000 participants. It is the latest in a series of events across the country which have been organised by the political pressure group which campaigns for Scottish independence. Mr Kelly said the turnout proved there was desire for constitutional change. ""The passion is there for definite at the end of the day,"" he said. ""The people have spoken. The SNP asked us to speak, well the people have spoken. We've done it all year round."" Keith Brown, the deputy leader of the SNP, was among those taking part in the march Insp Murray Starkey, of Police Scotland, said one arrest was made in connection with a minor offence during the march. ""Both the participants and the wider public are thanked for their patience and cooperation during today's event,"" he added. Organiser Gary J Kelly estimated that 100,000 people took part in the march Independence supporters began gathering in the capital on Saturday morning with the march setting off from Johnston Terrace at 13:00. Stalls and a stage were erected in Holyrood Park. The park, which sits next to the Scottish Parliament building, is managed by public body Historic Environment Scotland.

"Opera singer Montserrat CaballÃ©, whose duet with Freddie Mercury became the signature song of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, has died aged 85. She had been suffering from health complaints for some time and was admitted to hospital in Barcelona last month, according to news agency Efe. Her career spanned 50 years. She had stints with the Basel Opera and Bremen Opera before her international breakthrough in 1965 in Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall in New York. She went on to perform with the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera and Vienna State Opera, appearing opposite the likes of Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. The song Barcelona was first released in 1987 and later became an anthem for the city's 1992 Olympics, the year after Mercury died. CaballÃ© sang at the opening ceremony with Domingo and JosÃ© Carreras. Montserrat CaballÃ© was born in Barcelona, and at the age of nine was accepted for training at the city's Conservatori Liceu. She graduated in 1953, and went to Italy, where she sang some minor roles. Her career advanced rapidly after a successful appearance as Mimi in La BohÃ¨me at the Basel Opera.  In 1965 she made a triumphant debut in the United States, taking over the title role - at short notice - of Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall. Her performance brought widespread praise for the beauty of her voice and her dramatic interpretation, and established her as an international star. CaballÃ© performing in Vienna in 1979 The same year she appeared at Glyndebourne in Der Rosenkavalier and The Marriage of Figaro, but she waited another seven years for her Covent Garden debut - as Violetta in La Traviata. A short but imposing figure, CaballÃ© endeared herself to audiences around the world with her irrepressible personality. Her fans called her La Superba - the superb one. Her career was dogged by ill health. In 1985 she spent three months in hospital with a brain tumour, and had treatment for heart trouble in 1993. In 2015,she was given a six-month suspendedprison sentence for tax fraud. Spanish media say plans are being made for a funeral in Barcelona on Monday. CaballÃ© and Mercury perform Barcelona.

"The green mamba's bite is highly venomous and can be fatal in minutes (file photo) A highly venomous green mamba snake that escaped from its presumed owner on Tuesday after biting her in the Czech capital, Prague, has been caught. The snake had gone into hiding in a Prague district and residents were placed on alert and warned to keep an eye out for the reptile. The woman, who had not registered the snake, is in an induced coma at a city hospital after receiving an antidote. The snake was caught in a tree near its home on Friday. On Wednesday, police and paramedics were called to a house in Hlubocepy district in the south of the city where the woman was found unconscious. The house was evacuated, and herpetologists (zoologists who specialise in the study of snakes) were called in to help locate the reptile. Children at a nearby kindergarten were kept inside as a safety measure. Woman finds snake in oven Seven foot snake falls from attic hatch It was thought the snake was unlikely to leave the house because of the recent cool weather, but in the end it was found on a tree about 200 metres (656 ft) from its home. ""Mamba found! And caught!"" Miroslav Bobek, head of the Prague zoo whose employee caught the mamba, tweeted. He said thatthe mamba may have left its hiding place inside the house on the day of its capture after the weather warmed up,external. ""I would like to know when the snake set out on the trip, but yesterday's [Thursday] warm afternoon and a nearly subtropical Friday made it easier,"" he added. The woman who found it in her garden wrapped around a tree said she was still in shock and added that the snake appeared to have ""had enough"" too, reports say. Experts say the green mamba's venom spreads fast, and its bite can be fatal in as little as 30 minutes.

"A long-running dispute over train guards has led to further rail strikes. Talks between the RMT union and Northern collapsed, meaning only about 30% of Northern's services will run on Saturday, with more strikes planned for 13 and 20 October. The strikes are expected to affect people attending the Liverpool Giants street theatre festival, which is set to draw a crowd of thousands. South Western Railway union members began a 48-hour strike on Friday. Thousands are visiting the Liverpool Giants festival this weekend Northern said ""very few trains"" would be running throughout Saturday, with no services at all on some routes. It warned that trains would be ""extremely busy"". The firm advised passengers to ""plan their travel carefully,external"" and for those visiting Liverpool particularly to seek alternative means of travel where possible. Northern remained ""ready to talk"" to unions, it said. Passengers have taken to Twitter to express their frustration, with one saying they were ""stranded at Preston station for an hour waiting on a 2 & a 1/2 hour connecting bus to Manchester"".

"Mary Henfrey has praised the shared appointments she has attended in Northumberland Shared appointments at doctors' surgeries are being trialled across England - and patients like them, a group of GPs has said. Up to 15 patients with the same condition have shared GP appointments as part of tests at some surgeries, the Royal College of GPs said. It said patients benefited from support from other people, while GPs said it stopped them repeating advice. But Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said the approach would not work for everyone. The idea first came from the US around 10 years ago, but small scale trials have been increased in recent years across England, Prof Stokes-Lampard added. The appointments have been used for people with conditions ranging from raised blood pressure and  rheumatoid arthritis, to chronic back pain and asthma. GP online: Opportunity or threat? Pilot areas announced for NHS app Chronic migraine trial 'could change life' Mary Henfrey regularly attends shared appointments near her home in Northumberland and thinks the sessions are useful. ""The good part about it is people ask questions that you might not have thought of asking yourself,"" she told the BBC. ""It is nice to see other people, talk to them and get their experiences as well. And everybody who is there seems pleased to be there."" The sessions last for up to two hours and involve everyone signing a confidentiality agreement. Mrs Henfrey added: ""I know the first time I ever went to one of the group sessions... everyone was reminded of confidentiality. ""But once you have been to a number of these group sessions, you know everybody there and the confidentiality thing just doesn't arise. ""Everyone is interested in their own thing."" Dr Frazer Birrell says the sessions offer better care for patients with chronic conditions Dr Frazer Birrell, who runs groups in the North East, said there were more than 300 shared sessions taking place across England. ""It won't suit everyone, but what we are trying to do is offer people choices. ""The big trouble is we don't have enough nurses, we don't have enough doctors and waiting times are worse than we want. ""So this is one possible solution where if we see people together, we can offer them better care... and we can see the people with chronic conditions more regularly."" Prof Stokes-Lampard said the idea of group education has been around for many years, including antenatal classes and group cardiac rehab sessions. ""Those are just about information giving. This is something different. This is a two-way interactive process."" She said the sessions would never replace private one-on-one consultations, adding: ""This isn't going to be something that everyone is going to be offered and it would never be appropriate for huge numbers of people. ""Sometimes being unwell can be a very lonely place, and learning from colleagues, friends, and other patients can be a very powerful way of realising you are not alone."" She said the number of shared appointments is likely to continue to grow over the next decade. The Patients Association said group consultations could be ""reassuring"" as people could see others who shared the same concerns and challenges caused by their condition. But the group's chief executive, Rachel Power, added: ""Patients must be given the choice as to whether to participate, or to continue with more traditional GP services.""

"Cern, home to the Large Hadron Collider, was quick to condemn the talk More than 1,600 scientists have so far signed a statement condemning the remarks of the Italian researcher who stated that physics was ""built by men"". Prof Alessandro Strumia presented an analysis to an audience of predominantly young female physicists which he claimed ""proved"" women were less capable at the subject than men. The statement atparticlesforjustice.org,externalsays Prof Strumia's talk was ""fundamentally unsound"" and was ""followed by open discrimination and personal attacks"". In response, Prof Strumia told BBC News that the high-energy physics community was about 100 times bigger than the number that have so far signed the statement. He said that the signatories ""mostly come from those countries more affected by political correctness, which I indicated as the problem. This is what leads to academicians that want (to get) others fired for having 'morally reprehensible' ideas"". The Pisa University-affiliated researchermade his comments - first reported by the BBC - during a workshop at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern)- the lab on the Franco-Swiss border that discovered the Higgs Boson. Cern has since suspended his participation from any activities at the lab. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'We want to be accepted into the club' Four women who changed the face of physics First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Physicists from across the world are continuing to add their names to the statement. ""Strumia's arguments are morally reprehensible,"" it reads. ""Belittling the ability and legitimacy of scientists of colour and white women scientists using such flimsy pretexts is disgraceful, and it reveals a deep contempt for more than half of humanity that clearly comes from some source other than scientific logic."" The workshop at which Prof Strumia was speaking was aimed at helping women to become particle physicists. But the audience of early career researchers was upset and angered by his analysis of published research papers from an online library. He told them that his analysis showed that physics was not sexist against women. Professor Donna Strickland became the first woman in 55 years to win the Nobel prize in Physics earlier this week He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, demonstrated that women were hired over men whose research had been cited more highly in publications - an indication of higher quality. Prof Strumia also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers before men then overtook women as their careers progressed. In addition, he highlighted behavioural research that he said indicated that the ""assumption that men and women have identical brains is an ideology"". The statement at particlesforjustice.org forensically examines each of the claims and dismisses them. ""Strumia claimed to be proving that there is no discrimination against women, [but] his arguments were rooted in a circumscribed, biased reading of the data available, to the point of promoting a perspective that is biased against women,"" it states. ""The origin and validity of the data he presented have not yet been corroborated, but even if we take it at face value in all cases there are obvious alternative explanations that â¦ are directly in contradiction with his conclusions."" Professor Strumia denied that his use of data was biased. He told the BBC: ""The data about citations and hirings show that women are not discriminated (against) in fundamental physics. We reward merit, irrespective of gender."" The University of Pisa has said that it is considering a disciplinary review of his actions.

"A long-running dispute over train guards has led to further rail strikes. Talks between the RMT union and Northern collapsed, meaning only about 30% of Northern's services will run on Saturday, with more strikes planned for 13 and 20 October. The strikes are expected to affect people attending the Liverpool Giants street theatre festival, which is set to draw a crowd of thousands. South Western Railway union members began a 48-hour strike on Friday. Thousands are visiting the Liverpool Giants festival this weekend Northern said ""very few trains"" would be running throughout Saturday, with no services at all on some routes. It warned that trains would be ""extremely busy"". The firm advised passengers to ""plan their travel carefully,external"" and for those visiting Liverpool particularly to seek alternative means of travel where possible. Northern remained ""ready to talk"" to unions, it said. Passengers have taken to Twitter to express their frustration, with one saying they were ""stranded at Preston station for an hour waiting on a 2 & a 1/2 hour connecting bus to Manchester"".

"Relax! Take the afternoon off. You don't have to vacuum behind the sofa. The new Doctor Who isn't that scary. It has its moments, of course, but a trip to the dentist is far worse - at least it would be if...wellâ¦ Let us not even take the smallest step down a road that might lead to a plot spoiler. Suffice it to say that in the opening episode of season 11 (starting from the 2005 re-boot) there are goodies and baddies and surprises (nice and not so nice) and some strange events andâ¦a new Doctor. That we already know. Because it's beeneverywhere. What's more we met her at the end of the last episode when Peter Capaldi regenerated into Jodie Whittaker who promptly fell out of the TARDIS and plummeted to who-knew-where. Peter Capaldi as Dr Who regenerating at the end of Series 10 Turns out she was heading for one of the very few places in the entire unknowable universe of potentially a gazillion planets where the inhabitants not only speak her native language, but do so in the same accent. And so it is that the thirteenth Doctor Who gets to start her exciting stint of inter-galactic policing in present day Sheffield. Unfortunately for her there is no time to enjoy a stroll around the city's expansive parkland, or to take in a show at the Crucible Theatre. She is thrown in at the deep end with a life-threatening crisis to help avert. Grace (Sharon D Clarke), Ryan (Tosin Cole), and the new Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) From this we quickly learn that the new Doctor is not one to panic. No matter how serious the situation she always has a witty quip to hand to quell nerves and lighten the mood. These she delivers with puckish dry humour and perfect timing. If Capaldi's Doctor had a slightly chilly edge, Whittaker's is warmer than a mug of Yorkshire tea. She is a very talented actor, whose down-to-earth style plays cleverly with her character's otherworldly nature, in the way, say, Roger Moore's old-school charm subverted James Bond's cold-blooded ruthlessness. What to expect from the new series of Doctor Who From the moment she enters the fray Jodie Whittaker completely owns the part. Any chat about gender is rendered wholly irrelevant before she's finished her first sentence. She is Doctor Who, and that's it - some will love her interpretation of the Time Lord, others won't. A line-up of previous male Time Lords for the fiftieth anniversary of Dr Who in 2013 I'm in the former camp, but not without one small reservation. These are early days, she has another nine episodes to fully flesh out her version of The Doctor, but at this stage the character is a little too jolly and friendly, which makes building up dramatic tension almost impossible. David Tennant as The Doctor (The End of Time, 2009) was able to change mood in an instant David Tennant, who strikes me as the most similar to Whittaker's take on the role, was able to change mood in an instant: from class clown to a deadly serious galaxy-saving leader. She is yet to show that tonal transition from light to dark. On those occasions when she does dispense with the flippant asides for a more profound thought, her Doctor tends to come across more like a Sunday-school teacher than a masterful rhetorician who can inspire and intimidate in equal measure. The Doctor wielding her sonic screwdriver, but yet to show the tonal transition from light to dark That might well be a case of an experienced actor slowly developing the character to draw the audience in over the course of the run. Or, it could be the way the part is being written and directed. Doctor Who is a massive entertainment brand, which like most global products, requires constant refreshing both to enlist new customers and to keep existing punters interested. In that respect a TV franchise is no different than a Premiership football club. It's all showbiz; new faces are imperative: they all need to regenerate. And with that new public face almost always comes a new back-room team. As is the case with this all new Doctor Who, which sees previous show-runner Steven Moffat exit stage right, and Chris Chibnall come in to take up the reins (he worked with Whittaker on Broadchurch). Hopefully they will turn out to be a dream team. Actually, they have to be the dream team, because imagination is the only thing that will keep Doctor Who's TARDIS on the universe's super-highway. It would be good to see them challenge the concept of science fiction and push it beyond the hackneyed and obvious, in the way Charlie Brooker has re-thought the dystopian novel in the shape of his TV series Black Mirror, which focuses on 21st century concerns. It's fine for Sci-Fi to be funny, but it should be unsettling too - and the only way to do that is to make it real: Doctor Who needs to tell us our worst nightmares, contemporary stories that are so darkly embedded in our unconscious minds we need to hide behind a sofa when they are revealed to us.

"Barbara Broccoli, seen here with actor Daniel Craig, has co-produced eight Bond films James Bond will ""probably"" never be played by a female actress, the film series' executive producer has said. Barbara Broccoli, who is in charge of casting 007, toldthe Guardian:,external""Bond is male. He's a male character. He was written as a male and I think he'll probably stay as a male. ""And that's fine. We don't have to turn male characters into women."" Current Bond star Daniel Craig, has suggested the next film, due out in 2020,will be his last as 007. Idris Elba has been one of the actors rumoured to take on the role, afterposting a cryptic tweet earlier this year. Who is in the running to play 007? While others have wondered whether a woman could be cast in the role. Last year, Prime Minister Theresa Mayreportedly said,external""one day there should be a female James Bond"". Meanwhile, actresses Gillian Anderson and Vicky McClure have both joked they could be in the running as the next Bond incarnation. Anderson suggested she might rename the character Jane Bond, while McClure said it was ""genius"" to think of a ""Nottingham girl playing Bond"". Broccoli with Daniel Craig in 2005, shortly after Craig was announced to play Bond However, Ms Broccoli, 58, said instead of lobbying for a female James Bond, filmmakers should ""create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters"". She said the Bond character had ""transformed with the times"". ""I've tried to do my part, and I think particularly with the Daniel [Craig] films, they've become much more current in terms of the way women are viewed."" However, she said because the film was written in the 1950s there are ""certain things"" in the secret agent's DNA that my never change. Ms Broccoli, whose father Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli produced many of the Bond films, has previously shown support and mentored women working in the film industry. This video can not be played Barbara Broccoli calls for women in film to stick together She said she would ""of course"" like to see a female director or screenwriter on the next Bond film.

"Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation process has been one of the most contentious for years Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court seat looks all but confirmed after he won the backing of key senators despite an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations. Republican Senator Susan Collins and Joe Manchin, a Democrat, both indicated their backing for the judge on Friday. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would tilt America's highest court in favour of conservatives. The court has the final say on issues such as abortion and gun control. A final vote on whether Judge Kavanaugh will join the nine-member panel is scheduled for Saturday. If confirmed, the position is for life. Hours before the undecided senators indicated their backing, the US Senate narrowly advanced President Donald Trump's nominee to a final vote by voting to strictly limit debate on the issue. The political fallout from the Kavanaugh vote Friday's ""cloture"" vote - 51-49 in favour - was a test of support for the embattled nominee who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct from three women, including Prof Christine Blasey Ford. Senator Collins ended hopes she would side with Democrats in the final vote, telling fellow senators she did not believe the ""charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court"". ""The facts presented do not mean that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night or at some other time but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations failed to meet the more likely than not standard,"" she said. This video can not be played Collins: I vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh Senator Manchin, who is up for re-election in West Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide, told the Senate moments later he ""found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him"". The reaction has been swift, with former president George HW Bush and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders both tweeting their support for Ms Collins. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Manchin, however, has found himself in the firing line. A liberal group which raises money for Democratic candidates, Priorities USA, immediately said it would not be giving any funds to his re-election campaign. Outside, protesters shouted ""shame on you"" as Mr Manchin spoke to reporters about his decision. Meanwhile, a tweet asking someone to run for Senator Collins's seat in Maine when it comes up for re-election in 2020 from former White House communication chief, Jen Psaki, had a swift response from former UN ambassador Susan Rice.

Alaska's Lisa Murkowski - a Republican who voted against the nomination earlier on Friday - is yet to officially say which way she will vote on Saturday. However,former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeted she could ""see 2022 from my house"",external, suggesting Senator Murkowski would face a fight for her seat at the next election should she not side with her Republican colleagues in the vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is all but certain. The Republican Party has the votes and the battle appears over. The political war, however, is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout.

"The new boss of Coronation Street has reassured fans he won't drastically change the soap and doesn't have a ""hit list"" of characters to kill off. Iain MacLeod said ""only an idiot"" would try to ""change the DNA of the show"". He said: ""I'm the custodian of that DNA and that tone, so, no, I don't intend to do anything radically different."" His first shows in charge will air on ITV in the run-up to Christmas. ""It will be, as it has always been on Corrie, an evolution,"" he said. ""Corrie has done very well for nearly 60 years before I got here and it will hopefully continue to do extremely well for 60 years after I've gone."" The arrival of a new producer on a soap often means major changes to a cast. But MacLeod, who has joined from Emmerdale, said that was not his style. ""I haven't got a hit list,"" he said. ""I'm not going to be packing loads of people on to a bus that will... 'Oh, it's gone off a cliff, what a shame'. ""I think our viewers are very canny and they see that for what it is and it looks a bit cynical."" Recent storylines have included Aidan Connor's suicide - his body was found by his father Johnny, played by Richard Hawley MacLeod has taken over from Kate Oates, who faced criticism by some for making the show darker. But he defended her and said she ""told some massive, really socially important stories that changed people's lives"". He said: ""I think a lot of what she did was challenging but it was massively successful in terms of audience reaction and also social responsibility.""

"This video can not be played The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post Banksy has released a video showing how he secretly built a shredder into one of his paintings that self-destructed after it was sold for more than Â£1m. The framed Girl With Balloon, one of the artist's best known works, was auctioned by Sotheby's in London. Moments after the piece was sold, the canvas of a girl reaching for a heart-shaped balloon shredded itself. Quoting Picasso on his Instagram, Banksy wrote: ""The urge to destroy is also a creative urge - Picasso."" Early Banksy partially painted over Latest Banksy work appears in Hull Banksy Dismaland exhibition revealed The clip starts with a caption,external, saying: ""A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting."" The video then shows someone in a hoodie installing the device, before another caption, saying: ""In case it was ever put up for auction."" The video then shows the moment the painting shredded itself at the auction house on Friday, captured on a mobile phone. It is unclear how the shredder was activated. Moments before, the 2006 stencilled spray-painting had sold for Â£1.042m. ""It appears we just got Banksy-ed,"" said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's senior director and head of contemporary art in Europe. Earlier, Banksy posted a picture of the moment it happened on his Instagram, with the words: ""Going, going, gone..."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

John Brandler, director of Brandler Art Galleries, described Banksy as ""the ultimate publicity artist"" and said the stunt was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""He has made Damien Hirst look like an amateur,"" Mr Brandler said. Banksy rose to prominence through a series of graffiti pieces across the country. The enigmatic artist is thought to have grown up in Bristol, but his identity has remained a secret despite much speculation over the years. Among his recent works was the 2015 opening of Dismaland, a Disneyland-esque attractionat a lido in Weston-super-Mare, which he described as a ""family theme park unsuitable for children"". In 2017, Girl With Balloon, which originally appeared on a wall in Great Eastern Street, London, wasvoted the nation's favourite artwork. The gallery version featured spray paint and acrylic on canvas, mounted on a board. Sotheby's has not revealed who bought the piece before it was shredded. At the moment it is unclear whether their contract still stands. Mr Brancziktold the Financial Times,externalthe auction house was trying to ""figure out"" what the stunt means. He said: ""We have not experienced this situation in the pastâ...where a painting spontaneously shredded, upon achieving a [near-]record for the artist. ""We are busily figuring out what this means in an auction context."" In a statement on its website, Sotheby's described the incident as ""unexpected"" and said it had become ""instant art world history"". Allow Twitter content?

However, others have questioned whether the buyer would still have to pay for it - or would even want to. Mr Brandler said the more publicity works of art get, the pricier they tend to become.

"A long-running dispute over train guards has led to further rail strikes. Talks between the RMT union and Northern collapsed, meaning only about 30% of Northern's services will run on Saturday, with more strikes planned for 13 and 20 October. The strikes are expected to affect people attending the Liverpool Giants street theatre festival, which is set to draw a crowd of thousands. South Western Railway union members began a 48-hour strike on Friday. Thousands are visiting the Liverpool Giants festival this weekend Northern said ""very few trains"" would be running throughout Saturday, with no services at all on some routes. It warned that trains would be ""extremely busy"". The firm advised passengers to ""plan their travel carefully,external"" and for those visiting Liverpool particularly to seek alternative means of travel where possible. Northern remained ""ready to talk"" to unions, it said. Passengers have taken to Twitter to express their frustration, with one saying they were ""stranded at Preston station for an hour waiting on a 2 & a 1/2 hour connecting bus to Manchester"".

"Opera singer Montserrat CaballÃ©, whose duet with Freddie Mercury became the signature song of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, has died aged 85. She had been suffering from health complaints for some time and was admitted to hospital in Barcelona last month, according to news agency Efe. Her career spanned 50 years. She had stints with the Basel Opera and Bremen Opera before her international breakthrough in 1965 in Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall in New York. She went on to perform with the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera and Vienna State Opera, appearing opposite the likes of Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. The song Barcelona was first released in 1987 and later became an anthem for the city's 1992 Olympics, the year after Mercury died. CaballÃ© sang at the opening ceremony with Domingo and JosÃ© Carreras. Montserrat CaballÃ© was born in Barcelona, and at the age of nine was accepted for training at the city's Conservatori Liceu. She graduated in 1953, and went to Italy, where she sang some minor roles. Her career advanced rapidly after a successful appearance as Mimi in La BohÃ¨me at the Basel Opera.  In 1965 she made a triumphant debut in the United States, taking over the title role - at short notice - of Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall. Her performance brought widespread praise for the beauty of her voice and her dramatic interpretation, and established her as an international star. CaballÃ© performing in Vienna in 1979 The same year she appeared at Glyndebourne in Der Rosenkavalier and The Marriage of Figaro, but she waited another seven years for her Covent Garden debut - as Violetta in La Traviata. A short but imposing figure, CaballÃ© endeared herself to audiences around the world with her irrepressible personality. Her fans called her La Superba - the superb one. Her career was dogged by ill health. In 1985 she spent three months in hospital with a brain tumour, and had treatment for heart trouble in 1993. In 2015,she was given a six-month suspendedprison sentence for tax fraud. Spanish media say plans are being made for a funeral in Barcelona on Monday. CaballÃ© and Mercury perform Barcelona.

"Top EU officials have expressed optimism that a Brexit deal can be struck by the end of the year. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said the chance of the UK and the EU reaching a deal has increased in the last few days and could be agreed by November. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said an agreement was possible by the end of 2018. But Irish PM Leo Varadkar said there is still ""a fair bit of work to be done"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. However, there is still no agreement on some issues, including how to avoid new checks on the Irish border. Both sides had hoped to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation by an EU summit in 11 days' time. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Speaking to the Austrian press on Friday and asked whether an agreement could be reached at the next meeting of European leaders on 17 October, Mr Juncker said: ""We are not that far yet. But our will is unbroken to reach agreement with the British government."" He said a deal could be agreed by November. ""I have reason to think that the rapprochement potential between both sides has increased in recent days,"" Mr Juncker added. He also reiterated his position that a no-deal scenario ""would not be good"" for either the UK or the EU. Speaking on Saturday, European Council President Mr Tusk said: ""We will try for it [agreeing a deal] in October... and I think there is a chance to have an accord by the end of the year."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan also expressed optimism that a deal could be reached before December. There were also reports from EU officials of a better atmosphere in talks over the Irish border. The upbeat assessment of progress in negotiations prompted sterling to rise against the Euro and the US dollar. But Mr Varadkar warned that the two sides had not crossed the finish line yet and the October summit was ""a time to take stock"". He told reporters: ""I would be hopeful at that point that there would be decisive progress allowing us to conclude an agreement by November. ""That remains to be seen yet. I think there is a fair bit of work to be done."" He added: ""It's increasingly important that we conclude a deal sooner rather than later."" Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker at the summit of the European Council in December last year The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said officials still ""seem to be pushing for the whole withdrawal agreement to basically be done"" by the EU summit. ""Although, if we have learned anything from Brexit it's that the timetable is incredibly flexible, to use diplomatic language,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Downing Street distanced itself from suggestions - reported in the Daily Mail newspaper - that they were concerned Mr Juncker was trying to ""bounce"" the UK into agreeing a Brexit deal by mid-October. Meanwhile,the Guardian reported,externalsenior Conservatives had been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs to persuade them to back Theresa May's Brexit deal. Some Labour MPs who were mentioned in the article took to Twitter to refute the claims. Rachel Reeves tweeted: ""All the Labour MPs listed work hard and fight Tories locally and nationally every day."" It comes weeks after the head of the European Council Donald Tusksaid Theresa May's Brexit plans were unworkable. Both sides had hoped to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation by the October summit. But last month, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that if both sides were ""realistic"" there could be an agreement by November, when a special one-off summit has been arranged. Please upgrade your browser The European Commission is also considering whether to publish an analysis of where the two sides agree on elements of their future relationship. It could appear alongside the EU's latest contingency plans for a no-deal scenario, which will be released next week. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, Sir Alan Duncan was also optimistic about the prospects of a deal. ""We are in the art of the possible here, and from what I see in government, I think that we will get a deal, be it in October or November at the two consecutive summits,"" he said. Currently, thousands of people cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland every day. Goods and services pass between the two areas easily without any restrictions. As the UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards, but after Brexit, all that could change. The UK wants to leave both the single market and customs union. Both the UK and EU have agreed they do not, in all circumstances, want a ""hard border"" - which means physical checks or installing infrastructure such as cameras or customs posts. Both sidessigned up to that promise in December 2017. They hope they can achieve that anyway in a future agreement on a new trading relationship after Brexit. But if there were to be a delay or a failure in reaching such an agreement, they have agreed there needs to be a ""backstop"" solution - which means a last resort plan - that would keep the Irish border open. The trouble is the two sides can't agree on what the backstop text should say. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The EU's proposed backstop solution would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea. Instead, it would like to see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. But the UK has now signalled that it is ""open to looking at some of the options on regulatory checks"". Negotiators are yet to find a solution that is acceptable to both sides.

"Meng Hongwei was elected Interpol's head two years ago France has opened an investigation into the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, the Chinese head of the international police agency Interpol. His family have not heard from him since he left Interpol HQ in the French city of Lyon for a trip back to China on 25 September, officials said. ""He did not disappear in France,"" a source close to the inquiry told AFP. The South China Morning Post,externalquotes a source as saying Mr Meng, 64, was ""taken away"" for questioning in China. It is not clear why he was being investigated by ""discipline authorities"" or where he was being held, the Hong Kong-based newspaper adds. Chinese official to head Interpol Officials in China have so far made no public comments on Mr Meng, a senior Communist Party official there. It was opened after Mr Meng's wife went to police to report her husband missing. She was initially quoted by police sources as saying she has not heard from him since his departure on 29 September. But the French interior ministry later said the correct date was 25 September. ""Exchanges with Chinese authorities continue,"" the ministry said. ""France is puzzled about the situation of Interpol's president and concerned about the threats made to his wife."" It did not provide any further details. Analysis by BBC Asia Editor Celia Hatton Meng Hongwei's disappearance seems to fit in with a now familiar pattern among China's senior Communist Party officials. The official in question suddenly drops out of the public eye and an alarm is raised that the person is ""missing"", usually by members of the public. Eventually, the party issues a terse statement that the official is ""under investigation"", the official is then booted from the party for ""disciplinary infractions"" and - eventually - a prison sentence is announced. Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, well over a million party officials have been disciplined in some way. Mr Meng's case is notable for a few reasons. First, his wife notified the French authorities after he had only been missing for a few days. Family members of missing party officials rarely, if ever, reach out to foreign authorities, in fear their relatives will face ever greater punishment. Did the wife do this because she felt there was no other option? Also, at one time, China prized Mr Meng's lofty position at Interpol. If he has really gone missing within the Chinese state apparatus, whom did he anger, or what could he have done for Beijing to willingly, and publicly, forfeit the top job at Interpol? In a statement, the organisation said it was aware of reports of the ""alleged disappearance"" of Mr Meng. ""This is a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China,"" it said. Interpol added that the secretary general - not the president - was in charge of the day-to-day running of the 192-member organisation. Allow Twitter content?

As president, Mr Meng leads the Executive Committee, which provides the overall guidance and direction to Interpol. Mr Meng's term is scheduled to run until 2020. Before taking over at Interpol, Meng Hongwei was deputy minister in charge of public security in China. After his election human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country. Elected as Interpol's president in November 2016 Scheduled to serve until 2020 Is a senior Communist Party official in China and has served as Chinese vice-minister of public security Has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing Mr Meng said at the time that he was ready to do ""everything he could towards the cause of policing in the world"". Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control, according to Interpol. Interpol can issue a red notice - an international alert - for a wanted person. But it does not have the power to send officers into countries to arrest individuals or issue arrest warrants.

"This video can not be played Footage of the attack on Sir Robert drew gasps when it was shown in court A man who pushed a former Eurotunnel boss on to Tube tracks in central London has been found guilty of attempted murder. Sir Robert Malpas went ""flying"" from the platform at Marble Arch Station when he was shoved by Paul Crossley. The 91-year-old industrialist was rescued by a bystander but suffered a fractured pelvis and a head wound. An Old Bailey jury found Crossley, 46, of Leyton, east London, guilty of two counts of attempted murder. The second related to an unsuccessful attempt to push another passenger, Tobias French, on to the tracks at Tottenham Court Road station earlier on 27 April. Sir Robert watched proceedings from the public gallery and could be seen sobbing after the jury left, BBC Journalist Jeremy Britton reported from court. CCTV footage of the attack drew gasps from the court's public gallery when it was played in court for the first time. In it, Sir Robert can be seen walking along the platform, wearing a brown Burberry raincoat, suit and tie, and carrying an umbrella. He is then approached from behind by Crossley, who sends him sprawling on to the tracks with a two-handed push. Paul Crossley said his victims were chosen at random but claimed he had not intended to kill them. In a statement read in court, Sir Robert, who was knighted by the Queen in 1998, said: ""I felt myself flying over the tracks and landing on the rails."" He was rescued by passer-by Riyad El Hussani, who leapt from the platform to save him with one minute until the next train. Prosecutor Benjamin Aina QC said: ""Mr El Hussani bravely left where he was stood and ran down the platform and then jumped down on to the tracks."" ""As he landed he threw his hand forward to stop himself falling and he briefly touched the electrified track, causing a burn to his right hand."" The court heard members of the public pulled Sir Robert back on to the platform after Mr El Hussani managed to get him to the edge. Sir Robert Malpas, 91, was left with a fractured pelvis after being pushed on to the tracks Mr French, the court heard, managed to keep his balance when he was earlier pushed by Crossley as a train pulled in to Tottenham Court Road station. The defendant told the court he meant ""to scare"" Mr French, who had ""looked at me a bit funny"". Crossley told jurors his victims were chosen at random but claimed he had not intended to kill them. He had taken crack cocaine the previous day, the court heard, and began feeling paranoid as he made his way to the West End to get coffee. He said he was having a panic attack at the time he attacked Sir Robert, intending to ""push him over on to the floor"". Crossley had previously admitted the lesser charge of attempting to wound with intent against Sir Robert. He had denied an alternative count of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr French. Crossley, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was 17 years old, will be sentenced on 9 November after a psychiatric report has been prepared. Det Insp Darren Gough, of the British Transport Police, said: ""We could have easily been dealing with a double murder investigation had it not been for the brave actions of the public who stepped in and restrained Mr Crossley, and assisted the victims. ""I would like to remind the public that this type of incident is very rare and millions of journeys are made across the Underground without incident.""

"One of the world's most subscribed-to vloggers, Shane Dawson, is halfway through an eight-part series about fellow YouTuber Jake Paul. The videos are around 40 minutes in length, have stacked up more than 50m views and, probably unsurprising to most, are making a lot of money. An industry expert told Radio 1 Newsbeat that Shane could be making around $2m (Â£1.5m) a month.

Jake has also been involved in his fair share of controversial incidents. He's beenaccused of bullyingin the past, exploiting other YouTubers and creating content inappropriate for his young audience. In the opening episode, Shane asks: ""Could he be doing this series with me just to get views?"" But the reason Shane has made this series on his channel - which has around 18m subscribers - is because there's big business in getting ad sponsors at the beginning of his vlogs. Shane ""could definitely be paid anything from $85,000 to $170,000 for one video,"" explains Jessica Brennan, an influencer marketing manager for agency The Specialist Works. ""The fact he's probably making around 15 videos a month means he's earning around $2m a month."" That's a claim that Shane denied when he saw our story. Allow Twitter content?

During one of the earlier episodes Shane asks, ""Is Jake Paul a sociopath?"" - a comment which resulted in a lot of criticism for making a reckless claim without substance. Shane apologised on Snapchat, and now he's tweeted that he's taking a break from social media until the series is complete. Lesser-known YouTubers are uploading reaction videos to the series, something Jessica would advise channels to do. ""It's a great tactic to jump on the bandwagon, it means you get more views suddenly because people are searching for this subject,"" Jessica tells Newsbeat. It essentially creates a chain reaction, allowing other vloggers to capitalise on the original series. Fraser Macdonald, known as iNabber on the platform, appears in episode one and says it was a ""career-changing opportunity"". ""I've gained around 70,000 subscribers in a few days,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""It means the money's going to go up."" This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars Jake posted on his own channel that he's had no influence on the production of the series. Recently, vlogger Joe Suggtold Newsbeat he's hopinghis appearance on Strictly Come Dancing will allow social media stars to transition to mainstream media. But that might not be a priority for Shane. If one of his shows was on traditional TV, or even newer services like Netflix, he would have to split the money with the platform or TV channel. By creating a series like this, he gets to keep all the profits. Jessica says that could set a trend, with other vloggers ""evolving"" their channels to replicate what Shane is doing.

"This video can not be played Pupils harness pedal power during lessons A school has introduced pedal machines under its desks in a bid to tackle the ""rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes"". Thirty machines, costing Â£20 each, have been bought using the PE budget for pupils at Red Oak Primary in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Head teacher Heather Madsen said: ""This is about setting up activity levels for the rest of their lives."" She hopes to fund more machines across the 430-pupil school, asfirst reported in the East Anglian Daily Times,external. Pupils aged seven and eight have been ""road-testing"" the machines under their desks Their use is not compulsory, but the head teacher said pupils have welcomed them. ""It was initially a novelty and like the Tour de France here, but since then they've calmed down and some are doing it out of habit,"" she said. ""We were talking about initiatives that would stimulate the children's concentration and ensure they could still stay focused on lessons."" Funding for the Â£20 machines has come from the school's physical education budget The machines, which were introduced this term, feature a display that shows duration of pedalling, number of revolutions per minute and calorie consumption - with some pupils burning up to 800 calories a day. Evie-Rose, a pupil at the school, said: ""I enjoy it because it's really fun, your brain works faster and you get stronger and smarter at the same time."" Another pupil, Ella, said: ""Sometimes we try to beat each other in class. I feel really famous because we've had lots of visitors wanting to put us on their news.""

"This video can not be played Jason Van Dyke, left, listens as a jury in Chicago delivers its verdict A white police officer who killed a black teenager four years ago in Chicago has been found guilty of second-degree murder. Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan McDonald 16 times, seconds after arriving on the scene, saying he feared for his life as the 17-year-old had a knife. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, but has been convicted of the lesser charge. Chicago was braced for protests. The 20 October 2014 shooting sparked outcry. How a Chicago teenager was shot dead Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke, left, was led away in handcuffs after his guilty verdict Van Dyke was also found guilty on all 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm - one count per shot fired. The jury found him not guilty of official misconduct. His bail was revoked and he was taken into custody following the verdict. Van Dyke now faces a minimum of six years in prison and a maximum of over 15 years, with the possibility of probation. The jury of eight women and four men - one African-American, seven white, one Asian-American and three Hispanic - started deliberations on Thursday afternoon. Three other Chicago officers were charged last yearwith allegedly conspiring to cover up the fatal shooting, and they will be tried later this year. Laquan McDonald was 17-years-old when he was shot and killed in October 2014 Mr Van Dyke was arrested in 2015 after dashcam footage appeared to show him fatally shooting Mr McDonald as he moved away from officers, contradicting official accounts. He was the first Chicago officer to be charged with first-degree murder since 1980. According to prosecutors, Mr McDonald was holding a knife with a 3in (7.6cm) blade when he was stopped by police. Police said he had slashed a tyre on a patrol car, resulting in a stand-off between the teenager and officers. Van Dyke was not among the first officers to arrive - the officer who reached the scene first told prosecutors he saw no need to use force on Mr McDonald. Prosecutors say Van Dyke proceeded to open fire on Mr McDonald less than six seconds after he exited his patrol car, and he was the only officer to use his weapon. Mr McDonald still had a pulse when paramedics arrived, but was declared dead in hospital. A protester stands outside court after the guilty verdict in the murder trial of Jason Van Dyke in Chicago Van Dyke pleaded not guilty, with his defence arguing that had the teenager dropped his weapon, the officer would not have opened fire. When he took the stand, he told the jury the teenager had been ""advancing"" on him with the knife, with ""no expression"" on his face and eyes ""bugging out of his head"". Van Dyke said he continued to shoot ""at the knife"" after Mr McDonald was on the ground, because he ""just wanted him to get rid of that knife"". During the three-week trial, the officer was still a member of the Chicago Police Department, though he was suspended without pay pending the outcome. The trial heard from a truck driver, Rudy Barillas, who said he called police after Mr McDonald tried to stab him when he caught the teenager breaking into vehicles. But another witness, Jose Torres, told the court that as he watched Mr Van Dyke open fire on the teenager, he thought to himself: ""Why the eff are they still shooting him when he was on the ground?""

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement following the jury's verdict: ""As we absorb their decision, let us continue to hear each other and partner with each other."" A judge ordered police to release the dashcam footage in November 2015 after the Democratic city leader's administration fought to withhold the video for a year. The clip resulted in mass protests, culminating with the dismissal of the police chief and a Department of Justice investigation into the Chicago Police Department's use of force. The justice department issued a report last year that found the police had routinely violated the constitutional rights of the city's residents. Police superintendent Garry McCarthy was oustedand the county's top prosecutor, Anita Alvarez, lost her re-election bid amid harsh criticism of her investigation into the incident. In September, ahead of Mr Van Dyke's trial, Mayor Emanuel announced he would not run for re-election.

"Relax! Take the afternoon off. You don't have to vacuum behind the sofa. The new Doctor Who isn't that scary. It has its moments, of course, but a trip to the dentist is far worse - at least it would be if...wellâ¦ Let us not even take the smallest step down a road that might lead to a plot spoiler. Suffice it to say that in the opening episode of season 11 (starting from the 2005 re-boot) there are goodies and baddies and surprises (nice and not so nice) and some strange events andâ¦a new Doctor. That we already know. Because it's beeneverywhere. What's more we met her at the end of the last episode when Peter Capaldi regenerated into Jodie Whittaker who promptly fell out of the TARDIS and plummeted to who-knew-where. Peter Capaldi as Dr Who regenerating at the end of Series 10 Turns out she was heading for one of the very few places in the entire unknowable universe of potentially a gazillion planets where the inhabitants not only speak her native language, but do so in the same accent. And so it is that the thirteenth Doctor Who gets to start her exciting stint of inter-galactic policing in present day Sheffield. Unfortunately for her there is no time to enjoy a stroll around the city's expansive parkland, or to take in a show at the Crucible Theatre. She is thrown in at the deep end with a life-threatening crisis to help avert. Grace (Sharon D Clarke), Ryan (Tosin Cole), and the new Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) From this we quickly learn that the new Doctor is not one to panic. No matter how serious the situation she always has a witty quip to hand to quell nerves and lighten the mood. These she delivers with puckish dry humour and perfect timing. If Capaldi's Doctor had a slightly chilly edge, Whittaker's is warmer than a mug of Yorkshire tea. She is a very talented actor, whose down-to-earth style plays cleverly with her character's otherworldly nature, in the way, say, Roger Moore's old-school charm subverted James Bond's cold-blooded ruthlessness. What to expect from the new series of Doctor Who From the moment she enters the fray Jodie Whittaker completely owns the part. Any chat about gender is rendered wholly irrelevant before she's finished her first sentence. She is Doctor Who, and that's it - some will love her interpretation of the Time Lord, others won't. A line-up of previous male Time Lords for the fiftieth anniversary of Dr Who in 2013 I'm in the former camp, but not without one small reservation. These are early days, she has another nine episodes to fully flesh out her version of The Doctor, but at this stage the character is a little too jolly and friendly, which makes building up dramatic tension almost impossible. David Tennant as The Doctor (The End of Time, 2009) was able to change mood in an instant David Tennant, who strikes me as the most similar to Whittaker's take on the role, was able to change mood in an instant: from class clown to a deadly serious galaxy-saving leader. She is yet to show that tonal transition from light to dark. On those occasions when she does dispense with the flippant asides for a more profound thought, her Doctor tends to come across more like a Sunday-school teacher than a masterful rhetorician who can inspire and intimidate in equal measure. The Doctor wielding her sonic screwdriver, but yet to show the tonal transition from light to dark That might well be a case of an experienced actor slowly developing the character to draw the audience in over the course of the run. Or, it could be the way the part is being written and directed. Doctor Who is a massive entertainment brand, which like most global products, requires constant refreshing both to enlist new customers and to keep existing punters interested. In that respect a TV franchise is no different than a Premiership football club. It's all showbiz; new faces are imperative: they all need to regenerate. And with that new public face almost always comes a new back-room team. As is the case with this all new Doctor Who, which sees previous show-runner Steven Moffat exit stage right, and Chris Chibnall come in to take up the reins (he worked with Whittaker on Broadchurch). Hopefully they will turn out to be a dream team. Actually, they have to be the dream team, because imagination is the only thing that will keep Doctor Who's TARDIS on the universe's super-highway. It would be good to see them challenge the concept of science fiction and push it beyond the hackneyed and obvious, in the way Charlie Brooker has re-thought the dystopian novel in the shape of his TV series Black Mirror, which focuses on 21st century concerns. It's fine for Sci-Fi to be funny, but it should be unsettling too - and the only way to do that is to make it real: Doctor Who needs to tell us our worst nightmares, contemporary stories that are so darkly embedded in our unconscious minds we need to hide behind a sofa when they are revealed to us.
