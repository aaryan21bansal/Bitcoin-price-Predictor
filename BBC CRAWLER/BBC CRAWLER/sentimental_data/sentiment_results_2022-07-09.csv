"This video can not be played Wimbledon: Watch highlights as Rybakina beats Jabeur in Wimbledon final Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Elena Rybakina became the first player from Kazakhstan to win a Grand Slam title by beating Tunisian third seed Ons Jabeur in a gripping Wimbledon final. Rybakina, 23, fought back to win 3-6 6-2 6-2 and become the youngest Wimbledon singles champion since 2011. After a shaky first set, she improved and pressured Jabeur into errors. Rybakina was born in Moscow and her victory comes in a year where Wimbledon banned Russians from playing. The All England Club did not allow Russian and Belarusian players to compete at this year's tournament in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rybakina, who changed allegiance in 2018 after receiving greater financial support from Kazakhstan, was presented with the Venus Rosewater Dish by the Duchess of Cambridge, whohas publicly supported Ukraine's fight. The 17th seed clinched victory with her first match point when Jabeur pulled a backhand wide. Initially there was little emotion from the new champion, who simply raised her right arm in the air as part of a muted celebration. After sharing a warm embrace with Jabeur at the net, Rybakina received a respectful round of applause before then running up a gangway of the stairs to hug her team. ""Words can't say how happy I am,"" she said. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Elena Rybakina stunned by singles win World number 23 Rybakina has won two WTA titles and reached a highest ranking of 12th in January. On only her second main-draw appearance at Wimbledon, Rybakina had quietly moved through the rounds this fortnight, using her height and power to great effect. Eventually that also proved to be the case in a match against a player of contrasting style and personality. Going into the final, Rybakina had dropped only one set when she fought back to beat Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic in the quarter-finals. But Jabeur, full of slice and variety, settled the quicker to break Rybakina's serve twice and race away with the opening set. Rybakina showed no nerves in a powerful semi-final display against 2019 champion Simona Halep, but handling those in all pomp and prestige of a first Grand Slam final was a different proposition. Eventually she settled down and the contest suddenly took a change of direction at the start of the second set. A loose service game from Jabeur was seized upon by Rybakina, who had begun to rediscover the level that got her to this stage. Rybakina backed up the break for a 2-0 lead and, while she had to continue working hard for her holds, moved a double break ahead at 4-1 as the errors crept into Jabeur's shots. After sealing the second set, Rybakina broke again at the start of the decider and Jabeur looked increasingly despondent. But the tension mounted again in a sixth game that almost swung momentum back to world number two Jabeur. After a 0-40 lead, Jabeur thought she had landed the second of three break points with a clipped forehand but the line-calling technology said it was out. Rybakina fought back to hold and then broke in the seventh game to leave her serving for the championship. Jabeur led 15-30 but sprayed a forehand wide to bring up championship point, which Rybakina took to become the youngest champion since Petra Kvitova in 2011 and the first woman since Amelie Mauresmo in 2006 to come back from a set down to win the final. Tunisian trailblazer Jabeur was aiming to create more history by becoming the first Arab player to win a Grand Slam title. A popular and entertaining player, she had more support among the 15,000 crowd on Centre Court and the mood dampened as the match moved away from her. Jabeur's story is one of an inspirational late bloomer who lacked patience in her younger days before finding the right mentality to complement her talent. That has enabled her to win WTA tournaments, rise up the rankings and regularly break down barriers. Known as the 'Minister of Happiness' in her country, Jabeur is a popular figure in Tunisia, the Arab world and Africa. Jabeur's first appearance in a Grand Slam final came on the same day as Eid al-Adha - an important public holiday for Muslims. While it did not turn out to be a double celebration, Jabeur will still receive a public reception when she returns home. ""I love this tournament so much and I feel really sad, but it's tennis - there is only one winner,"" Jabeur said. ""I'm trying to inspire many generations from my country. I hope they are listening.""

"Mourners at the site of the assassination in Nara Japanese police have admitted there were flaws in the security for former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was shot dead in the southern city of Nara on Friday. ""It is undeniable that there were problems in the security,"" said Nara police chief Tomoaki Onizuka. A gunman opened fire on Abe at a political campaign event - a crime that has profoundly shocked Japan. Sunday's elections for the upper house went ahead as planned. Voting began at 07:00 local time (22:00GMT on Saturday), just two days after Abe's assassination, and closed at 21:00. Exit polls suggested the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in which Abe was a leading and hugely influential figure, and its junior coalition partner Komeito were set to retain their majority. A moment of silence for Abe was held at the LDP Tokyo headquarters as members waited for the results to come in, Reuters report. Elections for Japan's less-powerful upper house of parliament are typically seen as a referendum on the current government. But a big victory for the LDP would strengthen the current prime minister's ability to push though his key policies, including a doubling of defence spending. Shinzo Abe: The legacy of Japan's longest serving PM A shock killing that could change Japan forever How Shinzo Abe aimed to revitalise Japan's economy World leaders express shock over Abe assassination Police say the suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, held a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". Japanese media quote sources close to the investigation, who say Yamagami believed Abe to be linked to a religious group which, Yamagami alleged, had ruined his mother financially. The suspect has admitted shooting Abe with a homemade gun, according to police. ""The urgent matter is for us to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify what happened,"" police chief Onizuka said, without specifying where he saw failings. He was on the verge of tears, addressing journalists. Yamagami told police he had served in Japan's navy, the Maritime Self-Defense Force, for three years. More recently, he had worked at a factory in western Japan. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister and died aged 67. He was campaigning for the LDP in the run-up to upper house parliamentary elections on Sunday. Current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, also an LDP member, said he was ""simply speechless"", vowing that Japan's democracy would ""never yield to violence"". Gun violence is extremely rare in Japan, where handguns are banned and incidences of political violence are almost unheard of. The hearse carrying Abe's body arrived at his Tokyo residence on Saturday Police are investigating why Abe was targeted and whether his killer acted alone. Abe was giving a speech on behalf of a political candidate at a road junction when he was shot from behind. Photos show the suspect standing close to Abe moments beforehand. Witnesses described seeing a man carrying a large gun moving within a few metres of Abe and firing twice. The former prime minister fell to the ground as bystanders screamed in shock and disbelief. Security officers dived on to the gunman, who made no attempt to run. The twin-barrelled weapon that killed Abe was crudely made with metal and wood, wrapped in heavy-duty black tape. Several other handmade guns and explosives were later found at the suspect's home. Abe was wounded in the neck and was bleeding profusely as he was airlifted to hospital. He was said to be conscious and responsive in the minutes after the attack, but doctors said no vital signs were detected by the time he was transferred for treatment. Medics worked for hours to save him before he was pronounced dead at 17:03 local time (08:03 GMT) on Friday. The suspect was confronted by a police officer following the shooting On Japanese social media, the hashtag ""We want democracy, not violence"" was trending throughout Friday, with many users expressing their horror and disgust over the incident. In 2014, there were just six incidents of gun deaths in Japan, compared to 33,599 in the US. People have to undergo a strict exam and mental health tests in order to buy a gun. Even then, only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. Abe first held office for a year in 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2020 before stepping down, citing health reasons. While he was in office, he pushed more assertive policies on defence and foreign policy and had long sought to amend Japan's pacifist post-war constitution. He also pushed foran economic policy that came to be known as ""Abenomics"", built on monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms.

"A burning apartment block hit by Russian fire in Siversk, eastern Ukraine Russian missile and rocket strikes have caused more widespread damage in towns and cities across eastern and southern Ukraine, regional officials say. Four civilians died in a strike on Siversk, a town in Donetsk region, local governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Civilian areas of Druzhkivka, in the same region, were also hit. A supermarket was destroyed and a large crater appeared nearby. The BBC was unable to verify details of the latest strikes. Russian ground forces do not appear to have made significant advances in the past 24 hours in their push to take the rest of Donetsk region. A suspected Russian missile gouged out this crater in Druzhkivka Ukrainian officials also reported Russian missile strikes on parts of Kharkiv, in the north, Mykolaiv in the south and Kryvyi Rih, a southern city north-east of Mykolaiv. Ukrainian forces are fiercely defending Mykolaiv, a strategic river port on a key route to Odesa, which is Ukraine's main export hub. The Russian navy is still preventing Ukraine from shipping grain out of Odesa. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has urged residents to leave Russian-occupied parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. The warning appeared to herald further Ukrainian counter-attacks. The Russians are occupying the city of Kherson, but Ukrainian forces have taken back some parts of the region. Police in the region accuse Russia of deliberately destroying crops.In a Facebook post,externalthey show photos of burning fields and say: ""Large-scale fires occur every day, hundreds of hectares of wheat, barley and other grain crops have already burned."" They also accuse Russian troops of destroying granaries and agricultural equipment, and of preventing locals from extinguishing the fires. Kherson police say Russian troops are deliberately destroying crops (pic: Kherson police) In Kryvyi Rih, Russian Grad rockets damaged a school and housing, killing a 41-year-old woman, local governor Valentyn Reznichenko said. Russia's defence ministry said its forces had destroyed a hangar storing US M777 howitzers in Chasiv Yar, near Kramatorsk. The cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk are expected to be Russia's next major targets in Donetsk. The US says it is supplying four more high-precision rocket systems to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky says the HIMARS rockets are being used to hit ammunition depots and warehouses in Russian-held territory, making Moscow's attempts at resupply much harder. In the UK, British Army bases are now being used totrain Ukrainians in combat,external, the UK government says. It aims to train up to 10,000 Ukrainians over the coming months. In a new intelligence update,the UK military says,externalRussia is moving reserve forces from across the country to positions near Ukraine for future operations.

"Ty Pawb is attracting creatives and people from many walks of life to Wrexham city centre A venue aiming to be named museum of the year has been called ""one of the most unusual"" candidates the competition has seen. Wrexham's Ty Pawb is on the shortlist for the UK Museum of the Year prize. The centre has market stalls, gallery space, cultural events and workshops. The chairwoman of the Art Fund, which awards the prize, Jenny Waldman, said it was a ""fantastic combination"" of ""art, commerce and people"" with a ""dedication to diversity"". It is the first time Ty Pawb has been shortlisted for the UK Museum of the Year, which carries a prize of Â£100,000. Wrexham's People's Market renamed Ty Pawb Wrexham arts project used to build friendships Wrexhamwas officially named a city in Mayand it is hoped a second new title can be added in 2022. Ms Waldman, who recently visited with other judges, said there were some ""brilliant"" museums across the UK, but they were looking for something that ""marks it out as special"". Jenny Waldman was impressed by what she saw on a visit to Wrexham ""We're looking for those ones who are just taking museum work in a different direction, or doing something either with their commitment to their collections, or with each other, that really kind of pushes museum practice on more,"" she said. ""After Covid, museums have a real mission to serve their community, to get involved and to be useful to the people all around them."" Creative Director Jo Marsh said Ty Pawb's ""unique resilience"" is the reason she thinks it has been shortlisted. She said: ""We're standing here in the market hall - I've got the food court to one side of me and the gallery over here to the right. ""So I think it's the way that particularly coming through the pandemic, the different aspects of Ty Pawb, have supported one another... the customers coming in to buy their wool, then visiting the galleries and then maybe seeing an activity that they have gone on to bring their children to."" Community notices serve an example of the central role Ty Pawb plays in the area She added that the transformation of one of the two gallery spaces into the Useful Art Space, which welcomes different groups of people each week, had also attracted the judges' attention. ""For example today, there's a group called Bom Dia Cymru, a group of Portuguese elders that we began working with during lockdown by posting materials through their letterboxes. ""And now the Useful Art Space is very much a home for them,"" she added. Ty Pawb has alsoworked with refugees and asylum seekersto develop creative and practical craft skills, making product lines which have then gone on sale there. Liam Stokes-Massey is a commercial artist working out of a shepherd's hut in Ty Pawb, and said the space was a ""brilliant"" place to work because of the ""wide spectrum"" of things on offer. ""On busy days, a certain event on, I tend to get a lot of people sticking their head in. They'll coming to have a look at what I am working on, which is great, often that leads to work, or buying prints and things like that,"" he said. Mr Stokes-Massey said he believed it was time for Wrexham to get some recognition, after recently missing out onbeing named City of Culture 2025. Mared Jones is a regular visitor to the centre ""It shows it's on the up. Compare it to 10, 15 years ago, to even have things of that magnitude in such a short space of time,"" he added. Mared Jones, from Wrexham, is a regular at Ty Pawb's food court and said there was always lots going on. ""It's very nice. They have a lot of events and it's a really welcoming place,"" she added. Ty Pawb, which opened in 2018, is one of the hosts of the annual music festival Focus Wales, as well as holding regular art exhibitions in its gallery space. Adam Jones tried to capture the essence of Wrexham in his quilt Its flagship summer exhibition, The Tailor's Tale, formed a backdrop to the UK Museum of the Year judges' visit to Wrexham. It brings together artistic responses to the famous Wrexham Tailor's Quilt, created by James Williams between 1842 and 1852, and now kept permanently at St Fagans National Museum of History, Cardiff,itself a Museum of the Year winnerin 2019. The exhibition features a Wrexham quilt for 2022 created by Wrexham-born, London-based fashion designer Adam Jones. ""Wrexham constantly creeps into my work. Things I would see on walks, the nature, using old Welsh lace... Wrexham bar towels from the brewery,"" he said. ""Wrexham's changed a lot since I lived here... things like Ty Pawb, it's very exciting to see something like this. ""You can be inspired by local artists, artists from further afield, you can get involved in things."" Jo Marsh believes winning would be great for the whole of Wrexham He said the nomination for City of Culture, and the UK Museum of the Year made him proud of coming from Wrexham. ""It kind of feels very interesting and cool to say you are from Wrexham now,"" he added. It is a sentiment echoed by Jo Marsh, who said even being nominated for City of Culture demonstrated the ""richness"" of the cultural landscape. ""If we won Museum of the Year, that would be another really great affirmation,"" she added. ""That would really be a prize for the whole of Wrexham."" The other four shortlisted museums are Museum of Making (Derby), Horniman Museum and Gardens (London), People's History Museum (Manchester) and The Story Museum (Oxford). All shortlisted museums receive Â£15,000, with the winner to be announced on 14 July.

"Cwmann falls within the River Teifi Special Area of Conservation catchment A lack of affordable housing will only worsen while phosphate pollution targets put plans to build new homes on hold, a housing association has said. Tougher targets were brought in for nine Welsh rivers in January 2021,,externalwith 12 areas halting planning decisions until the new standards can be met. Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said there were no quick fixes or ""silver bullets"" to resolve the crisis. The Welsh government said it was hosting a summit to discuss the issue. New builds 'at standstill' due to pollution target Climate change in Wales in charts It added it aimed to deliver 20,000 low-carbon homes by the end of the Senedd term, while the health of rivers was also of ""paramount importance"". Proposals for residential development within Special Conservation Areas (SAC) must show they will not increase phosphate levels. Phosphates are naturally occurring minerals found in human and animal waste. They are vital for plant growth but at high concentrations in water bodies, phosphates can cause dramatic growth of algae, which leads to depleted oxygen levels, damaging aquatic plant and animal life. The new phosphate targets are estimated to be 50 to 80% stricter than previous levels, and while Welsh Water said it was technically feasible to upgrade treatment works to strip phosphates, in reality it would be impossible due to the huge investment needed. In March, plans to build 20 affordable houses at the old Coedmor primary school in Cwmann, Carmarthenshire, in the River Teifi SAC, were put on hold by phosphate targets. Geraint Roberts says his housing association cannot build new homes due to the tougher pollution target Geraint Roberts, a senior development officer for the housing association Barcud which submitted the plans, said: ""You can't build a dwelling that connects to the main sewers system, so it's putting a stop to hundreds of homes."" ""We've got data that shows there is a massive need for affordable housing in these rural areas and the Welsh government is providing grant money that allows us to build these houses, but we can't take advantage of it because we can't get planning permission to build."" He said the simple answer would be to add phosphate stripping into the sewerage system. ""Until there's a solution we can't build any houses in these areas. The lack of affordable housing will just get worse,"" Mr Roberts added. Ioan Williams, lead specialist advisor on SAC rivers to Natural Resources Wales (NRW), said the targets were ""in place for a very good reason"" and there was ""no silver bullet or simple answer to this"". He said: ""Phosphates will come from run-off from agriculture. It'll come from our waste water treatment works, from our septic tanks. There's phosphate in everything from toothpaste to dishwasher tablets."" He welcomed Welsh government plans to host a summit at the Royal Welsh Show, and warned the planning paralysis was likely to continue unless solutions were found. Housing association Barcud wanted to turn this former primary school in Cwmann into social housing BBC Wales has seen a letter sent by Welsh Water last year to planners which showed only 46 waste water treatment plants have phosphate stripping capabilities out of a total of 829. A further 12 will be added by 2025. Steve Wilson, managing director for waste water services at Welsh Water, said there was ""surprise"" when the new targets were announced. He said: ""We tend to work in five-year investment cycles with our environmental regulators, so we're always looking ahead to decided what investment we need to do for the future."" Mr Wilson said even if phosphate stripping was added to many sewage treatment works ""they won't pass those new standards"" and it would not solve the issue. Mr Wilson said initial research by Welsh Water from the Usk and Wye catchments showed about 25 to 30% of phosphates came from waste water treatment works, with the rest coming from sources such as agriculture and private septic tanks. Welsh Water is currently developing wetlands in Herefordshire to try to mitigate the impact of phosphates. The wetland is planted with a mixture of plants which have been selected to maximise the uptake of phosphates. The Welsh government said: ""The case for social housing is as strong as ever, which is why it is a priority for this government and why we have set out the challenging commitment to deliver 20,000 new low-carbon homes for rent within the social sector during this government term. ""The health of our rivers is also of paramount importance to this government. ""It is for this very reason that we are holding the SAC Rivers Summit which will provide a focused opportunity for all parties to consider how they can play their part and contribute to solutions.""

"This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister's home on fire, after protesters broke in and set it alight Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has announced he will step down after protesters stormed his official residence and set the prime minister's house on fire. Neither the PM nor the president were in the buildings at the time. Hundreds of thousands descended on the capital Colombo, calling for Mr Rajapaksa to resign after months of protests over economic mismanagement. Mr Rajapaksa will step down on 13 July. PM Wickremesinghe has agreed to resign. The speaker of parliament said the president decided to step down ""to ensure a peaceful handover of power"" and called on the public to ""respect the law"". The announcement triggered an eruption of celebratory fireworks in the city. Political leaders are due to hold further meetings to discuss a smooth transition of power. Sri Lanka's military has appealed to people to cooperate with security forces to maintain calm. After Saturday's events, the United States appealed to the Sri Lankan leadership to act promptly to resolve the country's economic crisis. The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? One protester, Fiona Sirmana, who was demonstrating at the president's house, said it was time ""to get rid of the president and the prime minister and to have a new era for Sri Lanka"". ""I feel very, very sad that they didn't go earlier because had they gone earlier there wouldn't have been any destruction,"" she told Reuters. Dozens of people were injured in Saturday's protests, and a spokesperson for Colombo's main hospital told AFP news agency that three people were being treated for gunshot wounds. Sri Lanka is suffering rampant inflation and is struggling to import food, fuel and medicine amid the country's worst economic crisis in 70 years. It has run out of foreign currency and has had to impose a ban on sales of petrol and diesel for private vehicles, leading to days-long queues for fuel. Protesters made their way into the house, chanting slogans and waving the national flag The extraordinary events of Saturday appeared to be the culmination of months of mainly peaceful protests in Sri Lanka. Huge crowds converged on the official residence of President Rajapaksa, chanting slogans and waving the national flag before breaking through the barricades and entering the property. Footage online showed people roaming through the house and swimming in the president's pool, while others emptied out a chest of drawers, picked through the president's belongings and used his luxurious bathroom. The contrast between the luxury of the palace and the months of hardship endured by the country's 22 million people was not lost on the protesters. ""When the whole country is under such strain people have come here to release that pressure. When you see the luxuries in this house it is obvious that they don't have time to work for the country,"" Chanuka Jayasuriya told Reuters. By Ethirajan Anbarasan, BBC News, Colombo These are some extraordinary times for Sri Lanka. After a day of fury and violence, the two senior leaders of the country have agreed to step down. The news triggered jubilation at the main protest site in Colombo. Firecrackers were set off in many parts of the city. I am at the Galle Face protest site - many protesters have started returning home, thousands are still present. Some have been singing and playing musical instruments, celebrating. What a turnaround of events. A few days ago a photo of President Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe smiling in parliament was widely shared on social media. Many vented their anger, saying the two men appeared to be happy while millions were struggling to eat three meals a day. But a week is a long time in politics. Read more here. Mr Rajapaksa vacated his official residence on Friday as a safety precaution ahead of the planned protests, two defence ministry sources said, according to Reuters. Although it is Mr Rajapaksa's official residence, he usually sleeps at a separate house nearby. The BBC has been unable to confirm the president's whereabouts. Many protesters posed for selfies after entering the palace Protesters cheer inside the president's residence in Colombo Protesters also set fire to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's private home in an affluent neighbourhood of Colombo. He said earlier that he was willing to resign to ensure the safety of civilians and to make way for an all-party government, but soon after his announcement videos started circulating of his house up in flames. The prime minister lives with his family in the private home and uses his official residence for official business only. Whether or not the president's and the prime minister's planned resignations will be enough to appease the protesters is not yet clear. ""Just two resignations alone will not satisfy the demands, the demand of a system change, but at least this is a start if the president and the prime minister depart,"" said Bhavani Fonseka, a prominent human rights lawyer in Colombo. ""There has to be a peaceful transition of power which is yet to be seen,"" she warned. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"Several people queued up to Vkusno i Tochka's opening in Moscow following McDonald's departure from Russia after 30 years Some restaurants in the newly opened ""Tasty and that's it"" fast food chain, which replaced McDonald's in Russia, will temporarily stop serving fries, according to Russian media. A shortage of the correct variety of potatoes means diners will have to find a different side dish to accompany their burgers and nuggets. The company says it expects to have fries back on the menu by autumn. McDonald's pulled out of Russia in protest at the invasion of Ukraine. The American fast food giant sold its restaurants to a Russian businessman, and in June several of its outlets reopened under the name ""Vkusno i Tochka"", which translates as ""Tasty and that's it"". But a month after opening, one of the key items on the menu is in short supply. ""Rustic potatoes"" - a thicker-cut version of the traditional French fry - may also be unavailable. Russia unveils 'tasty' McDonald's substitute In a statement to Russian news agency Tass, the company explained that 2021 yielded a poor harvest for the variety of potato needed to make fries. It said that the company generally tried to source potatoes from Russian producers, but that it had also become impossible to import potatoes from markets that could offer a temporary replacement to the domestic crop. However, in a statement on Telegram titled ""There are potatoes - and that's it"", Russia's agriculture ministry sought to play down any concerns over a potato shortage. ""The Russian market is fully supplied with potatoes, including processed ones. In addition, crops from the new harvest are already arriving, which rules out the possibility of a shortage,"" the ministry said. McDonald's opened its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990, a sign of Soviet Russia forming closer economic and cultural ties with the West. But more than three decades later, the American icon pulled out of Russia along with dozens of other Western companies, in protest at Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is now under wide-ranging Western sanctions, which are disrupting supply chains and increasing unemployment. The Russian economy is expected to shrink by up to 10% in 2022.

"This video can not be played Wimbledon: Watch highlights as Rybakina beats Jabeur in Wimbledon final Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Elena Rybakina became the first player from Kazakhstan to win a Grand Slam title by beating Tunisian third seed Ons Jabeur in a gripping Wimbledon final. Rybakina, 23, fought back to win 3-6 6-2 6-2 and become the youngest Wimbledon singles champion since 2011. After a shaky first set, she improved and pressured Jabeur into errors. Rybakina was born in Moscow and her victory comes in a year where Wimbledon banned Russians from playing. The All England Club did not allow Russian and Belarusian players to compete at this year's tournament in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rybakina, who changed allegiance in 2018 after receiving greater financial support from Kazakhstan, was presented with the Venus Rosewater Dish by the Duchess of Cambridge, whohas publicly supported Ukraine's fight. The 17th seed clinched victory with her first match point when Jabeur pulled a backhand wide. Initially there was little emotion from the new champion, who simply raised her right arm in the air as part of a muted celebration. After sharing a warm embrace with Jabeur at the net, Rybakina received a respectful round of applause before then running up a gangway of the stairs to hug her team. ""Words can't say how happy I am,"" she said. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Elena Rybakina stunned by singles win World number 23 Rybakina has won two WTA titles and reached a highest ranking of 12th in January. On only her second main-draw appearance at Wimbledon, Rybakina had quietly moved through the rounds this fortnight, using her height and power to great effect. Eventually that also proved to be the case in a match against a player of contrasting style and personality. Going into the final, Rybakina had dropped only one set when she fought back to beat Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic in the quarter-finals. But Jabeur, full of slice and variety, settled the quicker to break Rybakina's serve twice and race away with the opening set. Rybakina showed no nerves in a powerful semi-final display against 2019 champion Simona Halep, but handling those in all pomp and prestige of a first Grand Slam final was a different proposition. Eventually she settled down and the contest suddenly took a change of direction at the start of the second set. A loose service game from Jabeur was seized upon by Rybakina, who had begun to rediscover the level that got her to this stage. Rybakina backed up the break for a 2-0 lead and, while she had to continue working hard for her holds, moved a double break ahead at 4-1 as the errors crept into Jabeur's shots. After sealing the second set, Rybakina broke again at the start of the decider and Jabeur looked increasingly despondent. But the tension mounted again in a sixth game that almost swung momentum back to world number two Jabeur. After a 0-40 lead, Jabeur thought she had landed the second of three break points with a clipped forehand but the line-calling technology said it was out. Rybakina fought back to hold and then broke in the seventh game to leave her serving for the championship. Jabeur led 15-30 but sprayed a forehand wide to bring up championship point, which Rybakina took to become the youngest champion since Petra Kvitova in 2011 and the first woman since Amelie Mauresmo in 2006 to come back from a set down to win the final. Tunisian trailblazer Jabeur was aiming to create more history by becoming the first Arab player to win a Grand Slam title. A popular and entertaining player, she had more support among the 15,000 crowd on Centre Court and the mood dampened as the match moved away from her. Jabeur's story is one of an inspirational late bloomer who lacked patience in her younger days before finding the right mentality to complement her talent. That has enabled her to win WTA tournaments, rise up the rankings and regularly break down barriers. Known as the 'Minister of Happiness' in her country, Jabeur is a popular figure in Tunisia, the Arab world and Africa. Jabeur's first appearance in a Grand Slam final came on the same day as Eid al-Adha - an important public holiday for Muslims. While it did not turn out to be a double celebration, Jabeur will still receive a public reception when she returns home. ""I love this tournament so much and I feel really sad, but it's tennis - there is only one winner,"" Jabeur said. ""I'm trying to inspire many generations from my country. I hope they are listening.""

She really started well against Rybakina's serve in the beginning. But as the match went on, Rybakina just said 'I'm going to hit the ball harder.

"Elon Musk is seeking to end his $44bn (Â£36bn) bid to buy Twitter, alleging multiple breaches of the agreement. The announcement is the latest twist in a long-running saga after the world's richest person decided to buy Twitter in April. Mr Musk said he had backed out because Twitter failed to provide enough information on the number of spam and fake accounts. Twitter says it plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement. ""The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,""Twitter chairman Bret Taylor wrote in a tweet,external, setting up a potentially long and protracted legal battle between the two sides. The original merger agreement includes a $1bn (Â£830m) break-up fee. In May, Mr Musk said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" as he was awaiting data on the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter. The billionaire businessman had asked for evidence to back the company's assertion that spam and bot accounts make up less than 5% of its total users. In a letter filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,external, Mr Musk's lawyer said Twitter had failed or refused to provide this information. ""Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,"" the letter reads. Spam accounts are designed to spread information to large numbers of people and manipulate the way they interact with the platform. On Thursday, Twitter said it removed around 1 million such accounts each day. Mr Musk believes that spam or bot accounts could account for 20% or more of Twitter users. Shares in Twitter fell by 7% in extended trading after the announcement. Elon Musk has for weeks been trying to get information about how many daily active users Twitter has. Twitter has a problem with bots. In fact only yesterday it said it removed a million spam accounts a day. In a filing, Mr Musk said he'd repeatedly been refused information about the number of bot accounts on Twitter - which is why he wished to terminate the deal. Elon Musk though has already put pen to paper on this deal, and it is not totally clear whether he can back out at this stage. Mr Musk will need to prove that Twitter breached their agreement. There are other potential reasons why Mr Musk might want to pull out of the deal. The stock market price for large tech companies has fallen steeply in the last few months - did Musk offer too much? And then there was the impact the potential merger was having on Mr Musk's other companies. Tesla's share price has fallen significantly since he announced his interest in Twitter. His position on free speech and how Twitter might moderate in the future - based on the laws of individual countries - also at times came across as naÃ¯ve. Did Elon Musk ultimately decide he had bitten off more than he could chew? Read more from Jameshere Mr Musk, said to be the world's richest person, is the founder of rocket company SpaceX and CEO of electric car company Tesla. A self-described ""free speech absolutist"", he had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership. He has long criticised Twitter's ban of some accounts, like that of former US President Donald Trump. He has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users, a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences.

"Mourners at the site of the assassination in Nara Japanese police have admitted there were flaws in the security for former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was shot dead in the southern city of Nara on Friday. ""It is undeniable that there were problems in the security,"" said Nara police chief Tomoaki Onizuka. A gunman opened fire on Abe at a political campaign event - a crime that has profoundly shocked Japan. Sunday's elections for the upper house went ahead as planned. Voting began at 07:00 local time (22:00GMT on Saturday), just two days after Abe's assassination, and closed at 21:00. Exit polls suggested the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in which Abe was a leading and hugely influential figure, and its junior coalition partner Komeito were set to retain their majority. A moment of silence for Abe was held at the LDP Tokyo headquarters as members waited for the results to come in, Reuters report. Elections for Japan's less-powerful upper house of parliament are typically seen as a referendum on the current government. But a big victory for the LDP would strengthen the current prime minister's ability to push though his key policies, including a doubling of defence spending. Shinzo Abe: The legacy of Japan's longest serving PM A shock killing that could change Japan forever How Shinzo Abe aimed to revitalise Japan's economy World leaders express shock over Abe assassination Police say the suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, held a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". Japanese media quote sources close to the investigation, who say Yamagami believed Abe to be linked to a religious group which, Yamagami alleged, had ruined his mother financially. The suspect has admitted shooting Abe with a homemade gun, according to police. ""The urgent matter is for us to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify what happened,"" police chief Onizuka said, without specifying where he saw failings. He was on the verge of tears, addressing journalists. Yamagami told police he had served in Japan's navy, the Maritime Self-Defense Force, for three years. More recently, he had worked at a factory in western Japan. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister and died aged 67. He was campaigning for the LDP in the run-up to upper house parliamentary elections on Sunday. Current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, also an LDP member, said he was ""simply speechless"", vowing that Japan's democracy would ""never yield to violence"". Gun violence is extremely rare in Japan, where handguns are banned and incidences of political violence are almost unheard of. The hearse carrying Abe's body arrived at his Tokyo residence on Saturday Police are investigating why Abe was targeted and whether his killer acted alone. Abe was giving a speech on behalf of a political candidate at a road junction when he was shot from behind. Photos show the suspect standing close to Abe moments beforehand. Witnesses described seeing a man carrying a large gun moving within a few metres of Abe and firing twice. The former prime minister fell to the ground as bystanders screamed in shock and disbelief. Security officers dived on to the gunman, who made no attempt to run. The twin-barrelled weapon that killed Abe was crudely made with metal and wood, wrapped in heavy-duty black tape. Several other handmade guns and explosives were later found at the suspect's home. Abe was wounded in the neck and was bleeding profusely as he was airlifted to hospital. He was said to be conscious and responsive in the minutes after the attack, but doctors said no vital signs were detected by the time he was transferred for treatment. Medics worked for hours to save him before he was pronounced dead at 17:03 local time (08:03 GMT) on Friday. The suspect was confronted by a police officer following the shooting On Japanese social media, the hashtag ""We want democracy, not violence"" was trending throughout Friday, with many users expressing their horror and disgust over the incident. In 2014, there were just six incidents of gun deaths in Japan, compared to 33,599 in the US. People have to undergo a strict exam and mental health tests in order to buy a gun. Even then, only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. Abe first held office for a year in 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2020 before stepping down, citing health reasons. While he was in office, he pushed more assertive policies on defence and foreign policy and had long sought to amend Japan's pacifist post-war constitution. He also pushed foran economic policy that came to be known as ""Abenomics"", built on monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms.

"Defence Secretary Ben Wallace rules himself out of the running for the leadership of the Conservative Party Wallace says he is concentrating on his current job and hopes the Tories ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues that we are all elected to address"" A No 10 source accuses leadership contender Rishi Sunak of having a ""short memory"" after Boris Johnson ""backed him to the hilt"". The ex-chancellor has launched his campaign, saying ""someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions"" Former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the latest Conservative MP to enter the Tory leadership race Attorney General Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, have also said they are running Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also expected to launch a bid, as are Liz Truss, Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi Edited by Jeremy Gahagan The defence secretary says he hopes the Conservatives can ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues"". We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

"Rishi Sunak has entered the race to be the next leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister. The former chancellor is the most high profile figure so far to announce his candidacy. His resignation from the cabinet on Tuesday helped trigger the mass walkout of ministers that forced Boris Johnson to stand down as Tory leader. Mr Johnson intends to stay on as prime minister until the Tory party chooses a successor. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat, Attorney General Suella Braverman and former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch have announced their plans to stand. Why did Rishi Sunak resign? Follow the latest developments in Tory leadership contest Who is Rishi Sunak? Meanwhile, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, and former Health Secretary Sajid Javid are said to be considering leadership bids. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker had signalled he was considering standing for the leadership buthas dropped his bid and is backing Attorney General Suella Braverman,external. A timetable for the Tory leadership race is due to be confirmed next week and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. Rishi Sunak's video is typically slick and glossy. His brand was well built already - as his profile rocketed during the Covid pandemic - with a strong team behind him, which is one challenge for his competitors to rival. One thing that knocked his 'brand' were reports about his wife's previous non-dom tax status, and his critics using his wealth to brand him 'out of touch' during a cost of living crisis. But like Sajid Javid, Steve Baker and Nadhim Zahawi - who are widely tipped to run - he has used the film to emphasise his more humble background. He describes his grandmother emigrating to Britain and his mother working hard to become a pharmacist so she and his NHS GP father could give their children opportunities. It's this tale of opportunity - and his experience running the economy - that will play a strong part in his campaign. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". He added: ""Someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions."" ""Do we confront this moment with honesty seriousness and determination or do we tell ourselves comforting fairy tales that might make us feel better in the moment but will leave our children worse off tomorrow,"" he asked. He promised ""to lead this country in the right direction"" based on values of ""patriotism, fairness and hard work"". He said the country faced ""huge challenges"" and that decisions made now would determine whether the next generation got ""the chance of a better future"". Pointing to his credentials to be leader, Mr Sunak said he had run the ""toughest department in government during the toughest times when we faced the nightmare of Covid"". Several senior Tory MPs have endorsed Mr Sunak's candidacy, tweeting their support and promoting his campaign slogan ""Ready for Rishi"". Oliver Dowden -who resigned as party chairman last month- said: ""Rishi is the best person to lead our country and unquestionably the best person to beat Labour."" And Commons Leader Mark Spencerwrote,external: ""Rishi is the leader that can unite the Party, bring the whole country together and win us that fifth general election victory."" In his launch video, Mr Sunak told the story of his Indian mother, who emigrated from East Africa to the UK in the 1960s. The Tory MP explained how his mother went on to run her own pharmacy, and met his father, a GP, in Southampton. ""My family gave me opportunities they could only dream of,"" Mr Sunak said. Mr Sunak, 42, was an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs, and was later a partner in two hedge funds, before becoming an MP for the North Yorkshire constituency of Richmond in 2015. He was once seen as the leading contender to succeed Mr Johnson as Conservative Party leader and prime minister. Appointed chancellor in February 2020, Mr Sunak had to grapple with the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, spending huge amounts to keep the economy afloat. But his reputation was dented bya controversy over his wife's tax affairsand being fined for breaching lockdown rules during the pandemic. Mr Sunak was fined by the Metropolitan Police, along with Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie, for breaching Covid rules by attending a birthday party for the prime minister in June 2020. A backer of Brexit, Mr Sunak was loyal to Mr Johnson, despite tensions over economic policy and the prime minister's wish to cut taxes more quickly as living costs rise. But their relationship ultimately broke down when Mr Sunak dramatically resigned shortly after close ally and former cabinet colleague, Mr Javid. In his resignation letter, Mr Sunak said ""the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously"". Mr Sunak also referenced tensions over the economy in his resignation letter, telling the PM their approaches had become ""fundamentally too different"". His resignation and that of Mr Javid triggered a mass exodus of ministers and precipitated the downfall of Mr Johnson's government.

"Life has become a long queue for Sri Lankans - the lack of cash means fuel, food and other basics are in short supply In Sri Lanka right now, before you've woken up, you're losing. Power cuts that run late into the sweltering nights steal hours of sleep as the fans cease; whole families waking up sapped from the months-long trial of shuffling their lives around daily blackouts after the country went bankrupt and essentially ran out of fuel. There are long days to be lived; work days, errands to be run, daily essentials to be bought at twice the price they had been last month. All this, you're starting a little more broken than you were last week. Once you've had breakfast - eating less than you used to, or perhaps nothing at all - the battle to find transport beckons. There have been long queues for fuel for months - now it's all but run out In the cities, fuel queues curl around entire suburbs like gargantuan metal pythons, growing longer and fatter by the day, choking roads and crushing livelihoods. Tuk-tuk drivers with their eight-litre tanks are forced to spend days lining up before they can run hires again, for 48 hours perhaps, before they are forced to rejoin the queue, bringing pillows, changes of clothes and water to see them through the ordeal. Drivers have taken to sleeping in their vehicles as they wait For a while, middle- and upper-class folk had brought meal packets and soft drinks for those queuing in their neighbourhoods. Lately, the cost of food, of cooking gas, of clothes, transport, and even what electricity the state will allow you to have, has sky-rocketed so egregiously as the rupee's value plummeted, that even largesse from the moneyed has been in short supply. People here are waiting in line in Colombo for kerosene to cook with In working-class neighbourhoods, families have begun to band together around wood fire stoves, to prepare the simplest of meals - rice, and coconut sambol. Even dhal, a staple of the diet all over South Asia, has become a luxury. Meat? At three times the price it used to be? Forget it. Fresh fish was once abundant and affordable. Now, boats can't go out to sea, because there is no diesel. The fishermen that can go out sell their catch at vastly inflated rates to hotels and restaurants out of reach to most. Many others have taken to using firewood as an alternative to gas Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. A majority of Sri Lankan children have now been forced to subsist on a diet with almost no protein. This is a crisis that has hit on every level from the macroeconomic to the molecular. Are children's brains, their organs, their muscles, their bones, getting what is required? Milk powder, most of which is imported, has barely been seen on market shelves for months. The UN is now warning of malnutrition and a humanitarian crisis. For many here, the crisis has been roiling for months. Trains are more and more crowded - but getting on them is a nightmare... Those who can find rides generally commute on buses and train carriages bursting with evermore passengers. Young men cling for their lives on the footboards, while the mashed throng inside gasps for air. ... many cling on outside For decades Sri Lanka has failed to invest appropriately in its public transport, while the island's wealthier residents continued to complain about the indiscipline of bus and trishaw drivers. There is a growing view that it's this perceived disdain for regular people from both the political and financial elites that has brought the nation to its knees. And yet it's the lower-middle and working classes that must bear the worst of the economic collapse. 'Living in my car for two days to buy fuel' Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? How war heroes became villains Private hospitals continue to function, albeit less well than they used to. In North Central Anuradhapura, a 16-year old who had suffered a snakebite died as his father rushed desperately from pharmacy to pharmacy to look for the anti-venom the public hospital had run out of. The healthcare sector can no longer afford many lifesaving medicines. In May, a jaundiced two-day-old died after her parents could not find a trishaw to take her to hospital. As economists have pointed out, it is the sweeping tax cuts of 2019 - lobbied for and cheered on by many corporate and professional groups - that contributed to emptying Sri Lanka's coffers, and helped bring the nation to this brink. On the black market, fuel can still be bought at vastly inflated prices, some of it to run the larger private vehicles, and home electricity generators. Lower down the economic ladder, people attempt to buy bicycles to make trips into work, and find the exchange rate has put even that form of transport out of reach. A man on a bicycle carries an empty cooking gas cylinder - Colombo's roads are almost deserted It had been the worst of the power cuts that set off Colombo's major protests, late in March. Back then, the 13-hour daily outages had left a nation exhausted in the hottest weeks of the year. That fatigue had sparked widespread fury, and a crowd of thousands descended on the eastern Colombo suburb of Mirihana, where the president resides. Of all the demonstrations in the country over the past year, this was perhaps the most visceral. A man in a motorcycle helmet made a speech railing at the political forces, clergy and media that had delivered the nation into the hands of what was now widely perceived as simultaneously the most self-serving and inept government here in generations. Later, that man, Sudara Nadeesh, was beaten brutally by the police and arrested, along with several dozen others who suffered the same violent fate. Sri Lanka had been strung up in a 26-year civil war, but even through that unspeakably violent stretch, the island has never had a president so close to the military's top brass as former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The south has found out in the past few months, what northerners have known for decades: dissent is routinely met with state violence. In recent monthslargely peaceful protesters have had live rounds shot into their midst, tear gas has been indiscriminately fired at crowds in which small children were present. In queues for essentials, the mildest shows of displeasure have been met with brutal beatings. The police have been criticised for using disproportionate force against largely peaceful protests Police say some officers suffered injuries when stones were thrown, but as protesters have lost lives, or ended up in hospital, the police response has been viewed as being wildly disproportionate. On social media, politicians offer sympathy, posting photos of the public's hardship while asking for change. This has mostly only inspired more outrage. Was it not the politicians who led us here? And yet, while nationwide protests have called for the removal of the president and his cohort, they remain obstinately in place, their perceived disdain for the public's will evident in the backroom deals that many feel continue to poison the island's politics. The same leaders accused of crashing Sri Lanka into this ravine insist that only they can lift the island out again, and the policies they devise are met with sharp criticism. There is now a concerted push, for example, to send more Sri Lankans overseas to work as housemaids, drivers and mechanics in the Middle East, with those emigrants expected to send their earnings home. This may only deepen the hardship of many of its most vulnerable citizens, as poor Sri Lankans with no hope of finding local employment are forced to leave their families for nations in which they have few protections and little agency. One anthropologist online described this vision for Sri Lanka in stark terms: ""the vampire state"". What the future holds for Sri Lanka - no one can say with certainty By evening in Sri Lanka's crisis, you're drained beyond imagination. Beyond the almost impossible commute because of the lack of petrol and diesel, the everyday functioning of a workplace has itself become a relentless onslaught of crises, with supply chains having broken down, most potential customers having long since refused to spend on anything but essentials, and staff failing to show up. Then late-night power cuts come again, and you survive on lighter evening meals with each passing week, unable to buy enough food for your home, unable to cook what little you've bought, unable to give your parents their medication, or your children the education they deserve. Schools are presently shut, as there is no fuel to take them. Classes are online for the third year running. The government continually fails to deliver what little it's promised, relatives and neighbours call to ask for money you don't have to spare, the police and military bear down on what little hope remains, and through all this you're still grateful, because many around you have it so much worse. Last week, a mother threw herself and her two children into a river. Every day, a fresh heartbreak. Andrew Fidel Fernando is an award-winning author and journalist, based in Sri Lanka.

"Defence Secretary Ben Wallace rules himself out of the running for the leadership of the Conservative Party Wallace says he is concentrating on his current job and hopes the Tories ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues that we are all elected to address"" A No 10 source accuses leadership contender Rishi Sunak of having a ""short memory"" after Boris Johnson ""backed him to the hilt"". The ex-chancellor has launched his campaign, saying ""someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions"" Former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the latest Conservative MP to enter the Tory leadership race Attorney General Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, have also said they are running Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also expected to launch a bid, as are Liz Truss, Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi Edited by Jeremy Gahagan The defence secretary says he hopes the Conservatives can ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues"". We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

"The International Monetary Fund is lending Sri Lanka $3bn (Â£2.4bn) to help it deal with its worst economic crisis in its history as an independent nation. Soaring prices, shortages of essential goods and crippling international debts sparked nationwide protests last year which caused the president to flee the country. In early 2022, Sri Lankans started experiencing power cuts and shortages of basics such as fuel. The rate of inflation rose to 50% a year. As a result, protests broke out in the capital Colombo in April that year and spread across the country. The country ran short of fuel for essential services such as buses, trains and medical vehicles because it did not have enough reserves of foreign currency to import any more. The fuel shortage caused petrol and diesel prices to rise dramatically. In June last year, the government banned the sale of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles for two weeks. Sales of fuelremain severely restricted. Schools had to close, and people were asked to work from home to help conserve supplies. Sri Lankan PM tells military to restore order A dramatic day and moment of danger for Sri Lanka Sri Lanka has been unable to buy goods it needs from abroad. And in May 2022 itfailed to make an interest payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. Long queues for fuel - like this one in Colombo - have made normal life impossible This damaged its reputation with lenders, making it even harder to borrow money on the international markets. In the face of massive protests, President Gotabaya Rajapaksaresignedin June last year.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe became acting presidentand declared a nationwide state of emergency across the country. Mr Wickremesinghe has been prime minister six times, without seeing out a full term in office The mass protests have subsided, but the new president is trying to deal with a huge financial crisis. Sri Lanka owes about $7bn (Â£5.7bn) to China and around $1bn to India. Last month, both these countries agreed to restructure their loans, giving Sri Lanka more time to repay them. Thanks to this, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to lend Sri Lanka $3bn. That is on top of a $600m loan that the World Bank made last year. Sri Lanka's government says it will raise funds to repay its debts by restructuring state-owned enterprises and privatising the national airline. Banging dishes together to protest at the food price hikes. In early 2023 the country introduced income taxes for higher earners, ranging from 12.5% to more than 36%. It also raised other taxes to pay for critical purchases, including fuel and food. The government blamed the Covid pandemic, which badly affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also said tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame Mr Rajapaksa's economic policies. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ends a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades At the end of its civil war in 2009, Sri Lanka chose to focus on providing goods to its domestic market, instead of trying to boost foreign trade. This meant its income from exports to other countries remained low, while the bill for imports kept growing. Sri Lanka now imports $3bn more than it exports every year, and that is why it ran out of foreign currency. At the end of 2019, Sri Lanka had $7.6bn in foreign currency reserves, which have dropped to around $250m. Mr Rajapaksa also introduced big tax cuts in 2019, which lost the government more than $1.4bn a year in revenues. How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains Sri Lanka's suffering was avoidable - bank boss The switch to organic fertilisers resulted in widespread crop failure, exacerbating foreign currency shortages When Sri Lanka's foreign currency shortages became a serious problem in early 2021, its government tried to tackle the issue by banning imports of chemical fertilisers. It told farmers to use locally sourced organic fertilisers, instead. This led to widespread crop failures. Sri Lanka had to supplement its food stocks from abroad, which made its foreign currency shortage even worse.

"This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's home Thousands of protesters have stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence in the capital of Sri Lanka. Demonstrators from all over the country marched to Colombo demanding his resignation after months of protests over mismanagement of the country's economic crisis. Reports say he has already been moved to a safer location. The country is suffering rampant inflation and is struggling to import food, fuel and medicine. The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Living in my car for two days to buy fuel' Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? Thousands of anti-government protesters travelled to the capital, with officials telling AFP news agency that some had even ""commandeered"" trains to get there. They swarmed into Colombo's government district, shouting slogans such as ""Gota go home!"" and breaking through several police barricades to reach President Rajapaksa's house. Police fired shots in the air and used tear gas to try to prevent angry crowds from overrunning the residence, but were unable to stop some of the crowd from entering. ""The president was escorted to safety,"" a senior defence source told AFP. ""He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."" The authorities tried to stop the protests with a curfew but had to lift it Facebook livestream footage from inside the building showed hundreds of protesters packing into rooms and corridors, while hundreds also milled around the grounds outside. BBC footage showed scores of people taking a dip in the palace pool. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool Protesters at a different location also managed to enter the president's office, which has been the focus of demonstrations for months. At least 33 people, including members of the security forces, were injured and were being treated at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo, a hospital spokesperson told the BBC Sinhala service. Authorities had attempted to stop the demonstration from taking place by imposing a curfew on Friday night. But protesters were undeterred, and the curfew was lifted after civil society groups and opposition parties strongly objected to it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has summoned an emergency meeting of leaders of Sri Lanka's political parties to discuss the crisis. He is also asking the Speaker to convene parliament. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. Last week, the authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve the country's dwindling fuel stocks. Protesters blame Gotabaya (right) and Mahinda Rajapaksa for the current crisis The government has been trying to secure fuel on credit from countries including Russia- so far with no success. It has requested emergency financial help and it blames the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners - for the crisis. How war heroes became villains But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. Demonstrations have been taking place since March demanding that President Rajapaksa quit.

"Defence Secretary Ben Wallace rules himself out of the running for the leadership of the Conservative Party Wallace says he is concentrating on his current job and hopes the Tories ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues that we are all elected to address"" A No 10 source accuses leadership contender Rishi Sunak of having a ""short memory"" after Boris Johnson ""backed him to the hilt"". The ex-chancellor has launched his campaign, saying ""someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions"" Former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the latest Conservative MP to enter the Tory leadership race Attorney General Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, have also said they are running Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also expected to launch a bid, as are Liz Truss, Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi Edited by Jeremy Gahagan The defence secretary says he hopes the Conservatives can ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues"". We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

"Elon Musk is seeking to end his $44bn (Â£36bn) bid to buy Twitter, alleging multiple breaches of the agreement. The announcement is the latest twist in a long-running saga after the world's richest person decided to buy Twitter in April. Mr Musk said he had backed out because Twitter failed to provide enough information on the number of spam and fake accounts. Twitter says it plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement. ""The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,""Twitter chairman Bret Taylor wrote in a tweet,external, setting up a potentially long and protracted legal battle between the two sides. The original merger agreement includes a $1bn (Â£830m) break-up fee. In May, Mr Musk said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" as he was awaiting data on the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter. The billionaire businessman had asked for evidence to back the company's assertion that spam and bot accounts make up less than 5% of its total users. In a letter filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,external, Mr Musk's lawyer said Twitter had failed or refused to provide this information. ""Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,"" the letter reads. Spam accounts are designed to spread information to large numbers of people and manipulate the way they interact with the platform. On Thursday, Twitter said it removed around 1 million such accounts each day. Mr Musk believes that spam or bot accounts could account for 20% or more of Twitter users. Shares in Twitter fell by 7% in extended trading after the announcement. Elon Musk has for weeks been trying to get information about how many daily active users Twitter has. Twitter has a problem with bots. In fact only yesterday it said it removed a million spam accounts a day. In a filing, Mr Musk said he'd repeatedly been refused information about the number of bot accounts on Twitter - which is why he wished to terminate the deal. Elon Musk though has already put pen to paper on this deal, and it is not totally clear whether he can back out at this stage. Mr Musk will need to prove that Twitter breached their agreement. There are other potential reasons why Mr Musk might want to pull out of the deal. The stock market price for large tech companies has fallen steeply in the last few months - did Musk offer too much? And then there was the impact the potential merger was having on Mr Musk's other companies. Tesla's share price has fallen significantly since he announced his interest in Twitter. His position on free speech and how Twitter might moderate in the future - based on the laws of individual countries - also at times came across as naÃ¯ve. Did Elon Musk ultimately decide he had bitten off more than he could chew? Read more from Jameshere Mr Musk, said to be the world's richest person, is the founder of rocket company SpaceX and CEO of electric car company Tesla. A self-described ""free speech absolutist"", he had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership. He has long criticised Twitter's ban of some accounts, like that of former US President Donald Trump. He has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users, a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences.

"This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's home Thousands of protesters have stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence in the capital of Sri Lanka. Demonstrators from all over the country marched to Colombo demanding his resignation after months of protests over mismanagement of the country's economic crisis. Reports say he has already been moved to a safer location. The country is suffering rampant inflation and is struggling to import food, fuel and medicine. The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Living in my car for two days to buy fuel' Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? Thousands of anti-government protesters travelled to the capital, with officials telling AFP news agency that some had even ""commandeered"" trains to get there. They swarmed into Colombo's government district, shouting slogans such as ""Gota go home!"" and breaking through several police barricades to reach President Rajapaksa's house. Police fired shots in the air and used tear gas to try to prevent angry crowds from overrunning the residence, but were unable to stop some of the crowd from entering. ""The president was escorted to safety,"" a senior defence source told AFP. ""He is still the president, he is being protected by a military unit."" The authorities tried to stop the protests with a curfew but had to lift it Facebook livestream footage from inside the building showed hundreds of protesters packing into rooms and corridors, while hundreds also milled around the grounds outside. BBC footage showed scores of people taking a dip in the palace pool. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool Protesters at a different location also managed to enter the president's office, which has been the focus of demonstrations for months. At least 33 people, including members of the security forces, were injured and were being treated at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo, a hospital spokesperson told the BBC Sinhala service. Authorities had attempted to stop the demonstration from taking place by imposing a curfew on Friday night. But protesters were undeterred, and the curfew was lifted after civil society groups and opposition parties strongly objected to it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has summoned an emergency meeting of leaders of Sri Lanka's political parties to discuss the crisis. He is also asking the Speaker to convene parliament. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. Last week, the authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve the country's dwindling fuel stocks. Protesters blame Gotabaya (right) and Mahinda Rajapaksa for the current crisis The government has been trying to secure fuel on credit from countries including Russia- so far with no success. It has requested emergency financial help and it blames the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners - for the crisis. How war heroes became villains But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. Demonstrations have been taking place since March demanding that President Rajapaksa quit. The deepening economic crisis saw the president's older brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, forced to resign as prime minister in May.

"Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has hit a six-year high, the national space agency, Inpe, reports. Some 3,988 square kilometres (1,540 square miles) of land were cleared in the region between January and June. Last year, 3,088 square kilometres of the rainforest were destroyed during the same period. The Amazon plays an essential role in the planet's oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles, absorbing vast amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Environmentalists blame the increasing levels of deforestation on Brazil's right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has rolled back environmental protections. Brazil's environment ministry said it had been forceful in fighting environmental crimes, although in a statement it failed to mention the spike in deforestation. Record high deforestation of Amazon in January Amazon near environmental tipping point - study Bodies of Phillips and Pereira returned to families The Amazon is the world's largest rainforest, but its trees are felled for their wood and to clear space for crops that in turn supply global food companies. The high level of deforestation is also feeding a higher than usual number of fires for this time of year, Dr Manoela Machado from the University of Oxford told Reuters news agency. After trees are cut down, fires are often set in order to clear the land for agriculture, so more deforestation means more fires, Dr Machado said. As well as being rich in biodiversity, the area is home to communities who say they need to use the forest for mining and commercial farming in order to make a living. At the same time, indigenous communities living in the Amazon fight to protect the rainforest and their ways of life. In March, researchers concluded from over three decades worth of satellite data that the health of the Amazon rainforest is deteriorating. They said there were signs of a loss of resilience in more than 75% of the forest, with trees taking longer to recover from the effects of droughts largely driven by climate change, as well as human impacts such as deforestation and fires. At the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow last year, more than 100 governments promised to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030.

"Elon Musk at a Tesla event in Berlin in March 2022 Elon Musk's offer to buy Twitter was initially met with resistance. In fact, Twitter evoked a ""poison pill"" provision to stop Musk from forcibly buying the company. Eventually the company accepted the offer - a deal that Musk greeted with a one word tweet. ""Yesss!!!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

A few weeks later though, Mr Musk appeared to have developed buyer's remorse. Having done all the running, having got what he wanted, he now had some questions. ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users"" he tweeted.. Mr Musk was arguing that Twitter had no way of verifying how many of its 229m daily active users were actually human. Twitter's CEO, Parag Agrawal, answered back with a 13-tweet thread - publicly stating that fewer than 5% of its accounts were bots. Allow Twitter content?

That was on 16 May, and it appears not much has changed since then. In Musk's filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday he said he had ""repeatedly"" requested further information on spam accounts - data that was not forthcoming. Yet sceptics argue that Musk's interest in bots is a distraction. Twitter is well known for having a significant number of fake accounts. In fact, Twitter announced on Thursday that it removes a million bot accounts every day. Twitter would readily have admitted it had a relatively small but persistent bot problem before Musk put in an offer. Instead it's posited that bot and spam accounts are being weaponised by Musk, as an exit ramp out of this deal. Who is Elon Musk? When Musk first looked into buying Twitter the tech economy was in a very different place. At the end of March Tesla stock, which is the driver of most of Musk's fortune, was worth well over $1,000 (Â£830) a share. Musk was feeling bullish. But since April, Tesla has lost about a third of its value. Many other tech stocks have also done poorly. Musk's deal - that valued Twitter at $44bn (Â£36bn) - started to seem a little steep. Many Tesla shareholders also began to worry that Musk's time, already spread between his companies Neuralink, Space X, the Boring Company and Tesla, would be spread even thinner with the acquisition of Twitter. It's difficult to see how it wouldn't. Musk had other problems too. He claimed he wanted to take over Twitter because it had lost its way. He wanted Twitter to champion ""free speech"". And yet he struggled to define how he was going to effectively moderate the platform to that end. ""By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law,"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. But critics argued that that definition was naive. For one it would encourage countries to pass laws that restricted free speech. It would also cause a moderation nightmare - with different tweets being assessed in real-time for whether they broke the law (or not) in hundreds of jurisdictions. And then there was Twitter itself. Musk never ingratiated himself to the bulk of Twitter's employees. He said that Twitter clearly had a ""left wing bias"" and joked that its head office could be used as a homeless shelter. Many Twitter workers were worried that his swashbuckling approach could undo years of carefully-thought-out moderation policy. And as for Mr Musk's plan for Twitter? Well he had an ambitious growth forecast. In fact,he claimed he wanted to grow Twitter's userbase from 200 million to over 900 million in 2028. Yet there was no clear vision of how he was going to do that. It felt like numbers picked almost at random. To Musk's critics, he had bought a company at a high price, a company whose employees mostly didn't like him, and a company that he had struggled to present a coherent vision for. To his supporters, Musk was going to change Twitter for the better. Donald Trump would be invited back. Twitter's overzealous restrictions on free speech would be reined in. Its inherent left-wing bias would be addressed. Mr Musk may now never get the chance to enact that change. But this deal isn't over. Twitter has already claimed that Musk is legally committed to buying the company - at the price agreed. Twitter board member Bret Taylor has said they will take the matter to court.

It raises the bizarre spectre that Elon Musk could, unwillingly, end up buying a $44 billion company - an extraordinary thing. A lot is still on the line.

"Elon Musk put his takeover of Twitter on hold last week The head of Twitter has hit back after Elon Musk said his $44bn deal to buy the platform was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts. In a series of tweets, Parag Agrawal defended the firm's estimates that spam accounts were less than 5% of users. Mr Musk responded with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure. Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away. Those theories were fuelled further on Monday, afterBloomberg reported,externalthat Mr Musk had said at a tech conference that a deal at a lower price was ""not out of the question"". He also said spam accounts might be four times Twitter's claims. Mr Agrawal defended the firm's count, saying he would discuss the issue ""with the benefit of data, facts, and context"". He said the company used a combination of public and private data to determine which accounts were real, reviewing random samples every few months.  He added that Twitter suspended roughly 500,000 suspect accounts daily and locked millions more. The margins of error are well within its estimate of spam accounts representing less than 5% of daily users, Mr Agrawal said.
