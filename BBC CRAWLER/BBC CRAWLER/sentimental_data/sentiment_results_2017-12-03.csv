"ABC's incorrect report on Michael Flynn (pictured) hit US stock markets US news network ABC has suspended its chief investigative reporter after he made a ""serious error"" about Donald Trump's former top aide, Michael Flynn. Brian Ross reported Mr Trump was a candidate when he directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Moscow. But he later clarified that the orders came when Mr Trump was president-elect. The actions of Mr Trump's campaign team are under investigation over whether they colluded with Russia to help sway the election in his favour. On Friday, Michael Flynn - who Mr Trump sacked as national security adviser - pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials prior to the president's inauguration in January. Six big takeaways from the Flynn deal Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words As part of a plea bargain, Mr Flynn agreed to co-operate with special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ahead of the 2016 election. US intelligence agencies have already concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a state effort to influence the US election in favour of Mr Trump. President Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement, andtweeted on Sunday that he had never asked former FBI director James Comey to stop the investigation into Mr Flynn,external. Brian Ross's special report was aired after Mr Flynn's plea deal was announced on Friday. Quoting a single anonymous source, it said he was prepared to testify that Mr Trump had directed him to make contact with Russian officials when he was still a candidate for the presidency. If found true, the claim would have conflicted with the president's comments at the time of Mr Flynn's sacking earlier this year. In February, he told reporters: ""No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it, okay?"" Off the back of the report, Wall Street's main indexes fell by more than one percent. In a later edition of ABC's World News Tonight, Mr Ross clarified that his source had in fact said that Donald Trump's orders came during the presidential transition, after the election had taken place. ""It was shortly after the election that President-elect Trump directed Flynn to contact Russian officials on topics that included working jointly against ISIS (so-called Islamic State),"" he said. But the news network was criticised for simply clarifying the error and was later forced to issue a full correction. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Mr Milburn said Brexit meant ministers were unlikely to have the energy to tackle ""one of the biggest challenges"" facing the UK All four members of the board of the government's Social Mobility Commission have stood down in protest at the lack of progress towards a ""fairer Britain"". Ex-Labour minister Alan Milburn, who chairs the commission, said he had ""little hope"" the current government could make the ""necessary"" progress. The government was too focused on Brexit to deal with the issue, he said. The government said Mr Milburn's term had come to an end and it had already decided to get some ""fresh blood"" in. The commission is charged with monitoring the government's progress in ""freeing children from poverty and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential"". In hisresignation letter,externalto Theresa May, published in The Observer, Mr Milburn said he did not doubt her ""personal belief"" in social justice, but he saw ""little evidence of that being translated into meaningful action"". He said individual ministers, such as the education secretary, had shown a deep commitment to social mobility. But it had ""become obvious that the government as a whole is unable to commit the same level of support"". Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Sour grapes? Political point scoring? Neither, according to the former Labour minister and his colleagues on the board who include a former Conservative education secretary. Their frustration demonstrates the extent to which Brexit is all-consuming for the government. Leaving the EU is taking up so much time, energy and effort that there is little capacity for anything else to get done. Even on an issue which is a personal priority for the prime minister. Mr Milburn, a former health secretary, took up his role at the commission in July 2012, under the coalition government led by David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said divisions in Britain were becoming wider - pointing to the ongoing squeeze on wages. The government lacked the ""bandwidth"" to tackle social division while also dealing with Brexit, he said, describing his task as being like ""pushing water uphill"". Mr Milburn said Education Secretary Justine Greening had been a ""champion for the cause"" and had wanted him to stay in post - which Ms Greening, who also appeared on the show, would not be drawn on. ""He has done a fantastic job, but his term had come to an end and I think it was about getting some fresh blood into the commission,"" she said. She denied the government lacked the will to tackle inequality, but admitted more needed to be done. In areport published last week,external, the commission said economic, social and local divisions laid bare by the Brexit vote needed to be addressed to prevent a rise in far right or hard left extremism. It said London and its commuter belt appeared to be a ""different country"" to coastal, rural and former industrial areas, with young people there facing lower pay and fewer top jobs. The worst places to grow up poor The resignations come as Mrs May, who entered Downing Street in July 2016 promising to tackle the ""burning injustices"" that hold back poorer people, faces questions over the future of senior minister Damian Green - who is effectively her second in command - and is under pressure as Brexit talks continue. In an interview in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Milburn said: ""There has been indecision, dysfunctionality and a lack of leadership."" Theresa May pledged to ""make Britain a country that works for everyone"" when she became PM The government said it was making ""good progress"" on social mobility and focusing on disadvantaged areas. It said it had already told Mr Milburn it planned to appoint a new chair and would hold an open application process for the role. It said it was committed to fighting injustice ""and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them"". It highlighted its increase of the national living wage, cuts in income tax for the lowest paid and doubling of free childcare in England. The process of appointing a new chairperson and commissioners would begin as soon as possible, it added. The other board members standing down include deputy chair of the commission and Tory former education secretary Baroness Shephard. Paul Gregg, a professor of economic and social policy at the University of Bath, and David Johnston, the chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation charity, are also leaving. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said the resignations came as ""no surprise"". ""As inequality has grown under the Tories, social mobility has totally stalled,"" he said. ""How well people do in life is still based on class background rather than on talent or effort.""

"Cafe owner David Thomas said he was told the occupants were in an area of the lorry trailer which was not refrigerated Eleven people, including six children, were found locked in the back of a lorry in a lay-by. Firefighters cut the locks after police were called to reports of banging from inside the vehicle, which was parked at Willoughby Hedge on the A303 at West Knoyle on Saturday afternoon. The Home Office said immigration enforcement officers found 10 Iraqi nationals and one Afghan national. Police said the driver was helping with inquiries but had not been arrested. The driver of the lorry had been returning to Taunton from Belgium and had stopped for lunch at a roadside cafe. David Thomas, who runs the cafe, said the driver could not open the back doors because they had been glued shut. He said the occupants had been ""pretty lucky"" because part of the lorry was refrigerated. ""The compartment they were in contained a few pallets of rather expensive Belgian chocolate and was at a normal temperature,"" he said. ""I understand from the driver if they'd been in the front compartment that was quite well-chilled so they would have had a few problems there."" Police were called to the Willoughby Hedge lay-by on Saturday afternoon A Wiltshire Police spokesman said the adults found in the lorry were being kept in custody overnight and would be handed to Home Office officials on Monday. ""We are currently working with colleagues from the Home Office Immigration Department as our inquiries progress,"" a spokesman said. ""Where someone has no right to remain in the UK, we will take action to remove them,"" a Home Office spokeswoman added.

"Daisy Ridley has denied reports that she wants to give up the role of Rey at the end of the current series. Daisy will be in the latest movie Star Wars: The Last Jedi and is due to be in the ninth episode. ""When I did sign up, I did sign up for three films and that's where I sort of saw the story ending,"" she said. ""I think everyone has perhaps taken that as me going, 'I don't want anything to do with it' which is vastly untrue because this is awesome."" Daisy said it was meaningful that Rey features as the leading female role in a film produced by a major firm, Walt Disney Studios. She also hailed director JJ Abrams who introduced Rey in the first instalment of the new era, The Force Awakens. Earlier this year, it was announced that JJ wouldreturn to directStar Wars: Episode IX which is expected to be released December 2019. ""JJ has always put brilliant females in his things,"" Ridley said. ""So I think it was wonderful and then the fact it came from a big studio says a lot too, and I think there's a big change already. ""Obviously there's still a long way to go."" According to research by the Centre for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women account for just 29% of lead solo roles and 37% of major roles in the top 100 grossing Hollywood films of last year.

"This video can not be played South Korea's coast guard divers search for survivors At least 13 people have died after a fishing boat collided with a 336-tonne tanker and capsized off South Korea's west coast. Two others were missing, South Korea's coast guard said, as a search and rescue operation continued. The chartered fishing boat, the Seonchang-1, had been carrying 20 passengers and two crew during  a fishing tour at the time of the crash. Footage from the scene showed the upturned boat being searched by divers. Navy helicopters and dozens of ships were taking part in the search southwest of Incheon, near Yeongheung island. Seven people were taken to hospital for treatment. The captain of the 10-tonne fishing boat was among the missing, according to one report from AFP. There were no reported injuries on board the 336-tonne fuel tanker. The coast guard took seven people to hospital South Korean news agency Yonhap said the collision happened nine minutes after the boat departed from the shoreline, possibly as the two vessels passed each other under a bridge. ""There's no specific problem related to weather conditions, sailing reports or other (pre-departure) preparations,"" a coast guard official told reporters. ""We are investigating how the accident happened."" Cold water temperatures may also have contributed to casualties, the official said. The accident is believed to be the worst in South Korea since 15 people died on a fishing tour near Jeju in 2015. The year before, a passenger ferry capsized and more than 300 people died, most of them school children on an outing. The ship, the Sewol, was raised from the sea bed earlier this year.

"Germany is on high alert for attacks following last year's fatal attack on a Christmas market in Berlin Police investigating a bomb found at a Christmas market in Germany on Friday say it was not terrorism but an attempt to blackmail the shipping company, DHL. The nail bomb was sent in a parcel to a pharmacy near a market in Potsdam. Police performed a controlled explosion on the device, which was full of explosives but had no detonator. After scanning a QR code on the package, police found that those involved demanded millions of euros to not set the bomb off. ""The good news is it that we can say, with all likelihood, that the package was not aimed at the Christmas market,"" Brandenburg's Interior Minister Karl-Heinz SchrÃ¶ter said. But he and others warned that there might be more such attempts. Police said a similar package was sent to an online trader based in Frankfurt an der Oder recently. Germany is on a heightened terror alert, a year after 12 people died in an Islamist attack at a Berlin Christmas market. Officials have warned people to call the police instead of opening suspicious packages. They said people should watch out for smudges, visible wires and unfamiliar or missing return addresses.

"This video can not be played HR McMaster: 'There isn't much time left' to address threat from North Korea White House national security adviser HR McMaster says the US is ""in a race"" to address the threat from North Korea. The potential for war is increasing every day but armed conflict is not the only solution, he told a defence forum. His comments came three days after North Korea carried out its first ballistic missile test in two months, in defiance of UN resolutions. The latest missile flew higher than any others previously tested, before falling into Japanese waters. Tensions have heated up in recent months over the north's continued development of its nuclear and missile programme, in spite of global condemnation and international sanctions. Pyongyang conducted its sixth nuclear test in September. What could tip the balance into full conflict? North Korean missile pictures and what they tell us What damage could North Korea do? This video can not be played A statement read on North Korean state-run TV blamed the ""reckless nuclear war mania of the US"" for any possible escalation The Pentagon was also reported to be scouting sites on the west coast of America to deploy extra defences, amid claims from North Korea that its latest missile could reach the whole of continental United States. President Donald Trump's national security adviser gave his unscripted comments at a forum in California on Saturday. ""There are ways to address this problem short of armed conflict, but it is a race because he's getting closer and closer, and there's not much time left,"" Mr McMaster said, in reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? He singled out China, urging the Beijing government to enforce a total oil embargo on the north to make it difficult to fuel missile launches. ""We're asking China to act in China's interest, as they should, and we believe increasingly that it's in China's urgent interest to do more."" ""You can't shoot a missile without fuel,"" he added. North Korea, meanwhile, has accused the US and neighbouring South Korea of being warmongers ahead of large-scale joint air exercises between the two allies that begin on Monday. ""It is an open, all-out provocation against the DPRK [North Korea], which may lead to a nuclear war any moment,"" an editorial in the ruling party's Rodong newspaper said. North Korea said the Hwasong-15 missile it fired on Thursday, which reached an altitude of 4,475km (2,780 miles) and flew 950km in 53 minutes, could have been tipped with a ""super-large heavy warhead"" capable of striking the US mainland. This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC However, while analysts agree the missile could have travelled more than 13,000km on a standard trajectory and reached the US, they have cast doubts over whether the missile would have been able successfully to carry a heavy warhead that distance. They do not believe North Korea has mastered the technology to prevent the warhead from breaking up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. Reuters news agency reported on Sunday that research was under way to locate new sites on the US west coast for the possible installation of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those already deployed in South Korea to protect against potential attacks from the north. It quoted two congressmen, who said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) was aiming to install extra defences, although no details on locations or timing were given. However, the MDA, which is part of the US defence department, says it has not yet received instructions to deploy Thaad systems. What impact could Thaad have on the Korean peninsula? Two Thaad systems have already been deployed to South Korea and the US Pacific territory of Guam, which is 3,400km from Pyongyang. In August, Kim Jong-un announced plans to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based alongside more than 160,000 US citizens. Thaad systems are able to shoot down short and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight using hit-to-kill technology where kinetic energy destroys the incoming warhead.

"Daisy Ridley has denied reports that she wants to give up the role of Rey at the end of the current series. Daisy will be in the latest movie Star Wars: The Last Jedi and is due to be in the ninth episode. ""When I did sign up, I did sign up for three films and that's where I sort of saw the story ending,"" she said. ""I think everyone has perhaps taken that as me going, 'I don't want anything to do with it' which is vastly untrue because this is awesome."" Daisy said it was meaningful that Rey features as the leading female role in a film produced by a major firm, Walt Disney Studios. She also hailed director JJ Abrams who introduced Rey in the first instalment of the new era, The Force Awakens. Earlier this year, it was announced that JJ wouldreturn to directStar Wars: Episode IX which is expected to be released December 2019. ""JJ has always put brilliant females in his things,"" Ridley said. ""So I think it was wonderful and then the fact it came from a big studio says a lot too, and I think there's a big change already. ""Obviously there's still a long way to go."" According to research by the Centre for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women account for just 29% of lead solo roles and 37% of major roles in the top 100 grossing Hollywood films of last year.

"Donald Trump's presidency has been overshadowed by the inquiry into collusion with Russia Donald Trump lashed out at the FBI on Sunday, issuing a fresh denial that he asked former director James Comey to drop an investigation into the conduct of one of his top aides, Michael Flynn. In a Twitter tirade, Mr Trump said the FBI's reputation was ""in tatters"". His attack came amid a flurry of developments in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the US election. Mr Trump denies that his team colluded with Russia to get him elected. Reports emerged over the weekend that Mr Mueller, a former FBI director, had dismissed an FBI officer from the investigation during the summer after he was discovered to have made anti-Trump remarks in text messages. The president seized on the officer's dismissal, tweeting: ""Report: 'ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE' Now it all starts to make sense!"" Allow Twitter content?

A spokesman for Mr Mueller said the officer was dismissed from the investigating team as soon as the messages were discovered. Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, announced on Friday that he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's investigation, in return for pleading guilty to a lesser charge. The former general admitted lying to the FBI and has been offered a reduced sentence of six months. Analysts say the deal indicates that Mr Flynn has incriminating information about one or more senior members of the Trump administration. Six big takeaways from the Flynn deal Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words In a series of tweets posted on Sunday morning, Mr Trump again attacked his former rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI ahead of the election after it emerged she had used a private email server to conduct state department business. No charges were brought against Mrs Clinton or her team. This video can not be played After Flynn's guilty plea, what next for the Russia investigation? In another tweet, the president accused ABC News of ""horrendously inaccurate and dishonest reporting"", after one of the network's reportersacknowledged making an errorin a story about the president. Chief investigative reporter Brian Ross reported that Mr Trump was a candidate when he directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Moscow. He later corrected his report to say Mr Trump was president-elect when he gave the order to Mr Flynn. Mr Ross has been suspended by the network for four weeks. The Comey-Flynncontroversy The president fired Mr Flynn in February for misrepresenting the nature of his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak to Vice-President Mike Pence. Then-FBI director James Comey alleges that in a private meeting the day after Mr Flynn was fired, the president asked him to show leniency to the dismissed aide, saying, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go."" Michael Flynn was sacked in February, just 25 days after taking the job Mr Comey took notes immediately after the meeting and shared copies with senior FBI officials. President Trump fired Mr Comey in May. Tweeting on Sunday, Mr Trump issued a fresh denial that he had pushed Mr Comey to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Legal experts say Mr Trump could theoretically have obstructed justice if he had attempted to have the FBI investigation into Mr Flynn squashed. The president's surprising admission in a tweet on Saturday - that he knew Mr Flynn had lied to the FBI when he fired him - contradicted his own account from the time, and may have added weight to accusations that he obstructed justice. White House lawyer John Dowd later told the Axios news website that he had drafted the controversial tweet and sent the text to White House social media director Dan Scavino. The revelations soured what should have been a celebratory weekend for the president, after his sweepingtax reform bill scraped through the Senateearly on Saturday morning.

"Theresa May will hold talks with Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday There will be no Brexit at all unless Theresa May is supported, a cabinet minister has warned. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was not about a choice between ""this Brexit and that Brexit"". He was speaking as leading Brexit campaigners issued demands for Mrs May before agreeing any payments to the EU, including ending the European court's jurisdiction the moment the UK leaves. The UK voted for Brexit last year and is due to leave in March 2019. But negotiations between the EU and the UK have not yet reached a breakthrough. Brexit: All you need to know Farage: I'd take my EU pension What will the EU say at the summit? Reality Check: What's happening with Brexit divorce bill? Mr Hunt's remark, in an ITV interview, came as he defended the PM and sought to reassure critics that UK courts would be supreme after Brexit. He added: ""I think there's an even bigger point here, that the choice we face now is not between this Brexit and that Brexit; if we don't back Theresa May we will have no Brexit - and she is doing an unbelievably challenging job amazingly well."" Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Monday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, hoping the EU will agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far to begin trade talks. The BBC's Katya Adler says the mood in Brussels is positive, with diplomats working through the night to get details right. Our Europe editor said the status of the Irish border remains an ""outstanding issue"" but there was ""cautious optimism"" that enough progress has been made to widen the discussions.

The amount of money the UK will pay as part of Brexit has been one of the main sticking points so far The talks so far have focused on what happens to citizens' rights after Brexit, the amount of money the UK will pay, and the future of the Irish border. On the ""divorce bill"", the UK is understood to have recently increased its offer, which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). There has also been lots of focus on the Ireland question in recent weeks, with the Irish government seeking more information on the ""frictionless border"" the UK wants to establish so customs checks are not needed. Will Ireland's demands delay Brexit? The EU will only move on to talk about future issues like trade when ""sufficient progress"" has been made on these subjects - and is due to decide whether this has happened at a summit on 14 and 15 December. The campaign group describes itself as the ""campaign for a clean Brexit"". Signatories of itsletter,externalto the prime minister include former Tory cabinet ministers Owen Paterson, John Redwood and Lord Lawson and ex-Brexit minister David Jones. Backbench MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg (Conservative) and Labour's Graham Stringer have signed it, as have several economists and business leaders. Former Conservative leader Lord Howard - who hasn't signed the letter - told the BBC's Sunday Politics he shared the ""aspirations"" it contains. The letter says the EU has not matched the ""patience and goodwill"" Theresa May has shown so far, and says the UK should make no ""further financial commitment"" until it agrees to certain conditions. From March 2019, they say: There should be an ""in principle"" agreement for a free trade deal to be in place The current free movement of EU citizens into the UK should end No new EU regulations should apply in the UK The European Court of Justice should ""cease to have any jurisdiction whatsoever"" in the UK Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Rees-Mogg said if the UK remains subject to European court rulings after March 2019 ""we will have stayed in the European Union"". Theresa May has promised that Brexit will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. But she has suggested its remit might continue during an ""implementation period"" after March 2019, which would not satisfy the Leave Means Leave demands. On immigration, ministers have said free movement must end with the UK's EU membership but have promised businesses a ""cliff edge"" will be avoided in terms of employing foreign workers. Meanwhile, there have been more warnings on the subject of the EU court from former Court of Appeal judge Sir Richard Aitkens and ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. TheSunday Telegraph reports,externalthat Sir Richard, the president of the Lawyers for Britain group, has written to Mrs May saying that giving the ECJ the exclusive jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights would be ""tantamount to reversing the result of the 2016 referendum"". Speaking to BBC News, Mr Duncan Smith said that while the UK's courts would be able to take into account the European Court of Justice's decisions, it would be ""unacceptable"" for them to be bound by those decisions.

""Friday night was a disaster at Euston, and we were about two hours delayed getting up to Manchester,"" he said. He said he was told by Virgin at around 11:00 on Sunday that he couldn't have a refund. After 30 minutes on the phone, he said, he was told to proceed as normal as his train wasn't being delayed. ""I was asked where I heard about the disruption, because there was no disruption. I was slightly shocked and surprised, given the guidance on their website was not to travel and to contact them for a refund."" Network Rail had advised passengers not to travel unless it was necessary. Tickets valid for travel on Sunday would be accepted on Monday, it added.

"The Good Friday Agreement is ""at risk because of Brexit"" after the UK leaves the EU, former prime minister Tony Blair has told the BBC. UK and Irish membership of the EU was ""central"" to the 1998 deal, he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. Free movement on the border had been key to reaching an agreement, he said. The Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveneywarned against a hard borderbecoming the ""collateral damage"" of Brexit. Mr Coveney, who is also Ireland's foreign minister, told BBC One's Andrew Marr show that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were ""uniquely vulnerable and exposed to a potentially bad outcome"" from Brexit. ""We cannot allow some kind of collateral damage or unintended consequence of Brexit to [be] the recreation of a border on the island of Ireland,"" he said. Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? Brexit bill: Will we ever know how much? Mr Blair said the prospect of a hard border posed ""real challenges"" to the peace process and it was difficult to see how the issue would be resolved. The ex-PM, who helped orchestrate the Good Friday Agreement, said that the UK and Ireland's EU membership made it ""easy"" to appease nationalist feelings in 1998. The free movement of people, goods and an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was ""part of that expression that the island of Ireland was together"", he said. But there are concerns thatBrexit could lead to a ""hard border""like that seen before the Good Friday Agreement - for example, by reintroducing customs checks between the two countries. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the UK government was opposed to reintroducing a hard border - but said the Irish government or EU could make a ""political choice"" to impose one. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""If the Irish and EU wish to impose a border that would be a matter for them, but they don't have to do it, it is a question of political choice."" Mr Blair said: ""If you end up with a hard border, obviously that causes tensions. ""It doesn't mean that you should abandon the Good Friday Agreement, but it poses real challenges to it."" He urged negotiators to overcome the ""conundrum"" of creating a hard border between the UK and the rest of Europe, while preventing one from re-emerging between Northern Ireland and the South. Brexit negotiators have said that the Common Travel Area between the two countries, which predates the EU, will remain in place. Mr Blair said Theresa May and Philip Hammond were trying to negotiate the ""fundamentally unnegotiable"" by leaving the EU, while also trying to maintain preferential treatment in the EU's common market. ""They're trying to negotiate getting out of the single market, but recreate all of its benefits,"" he said. ""That's not going to happen. ""The risk is, frankly, you end up with a muddle and the worst of both worlds."" Mr Blair, who was speaking about housing policies proposed in a new report by theTony Blair Institute for Global Change,external, also blamed Brexit for distracting the government from the ""huge problem"" of housing supply. ""The whole of the political class, as it were, is simply centred on Brexit,"" he said. He proposed a series of policies designed to tackle the housing crisis - including a new ""land value tax"" which would see the value of underlying land taxed instead of property. He also said there would be ""no extra money"" for the NHS through Brexit. Tony Blair and the former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern signing the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 However, he said Mrs May was ""right"" tocriticise US President Donald Trump's recent tweeting of far-right videos. He said it was the ""minimum"" she could have said - considering she needs to cooperate with the US. You can hear the full interview with Tony Blair at 13:00 GMT on Radio 4'sThe World This Weekend.

"Children and young people in England are to be able to access mental health support at school or college under government plans to improve services. The proposals include introducing a four-week waiting time for youngsters needing specialist support and new mental health support teams in schools. It is hoped around one in four schools in England will have this provision in place by 2022. Campaigners say it was welcome, but overdue and ""only a start"". The issue of young people's mental health has long been of concern, with parents, charities and healthcare professionals warning that families are not getting the support they need. According to new NHS figures, around one in 10 girls aged 16 or 17 were referred to specialist mental health services in England last year. The government's new green paper proposes: training for senior designated mental health leads in schools to improve prevention work earlier access to services through the creation of new mental health support teams working in and directly with schools a new four-week waiting time for NHS children and young people's mental health services every primary and secondary school in England to be offered mental health awareness training all pupils to be taught about mental health and wellbeing as part of improved relationships education and PSHE [personal, social, health and economic] lessons The new measures are part of a Â£300m investment by the Departments of Health and Education. For 18-year-old Sienna (not her real name), the onset of an eating disorder and depression five years ago has meant she has been in and out of hospital units, sometimes for long periods. For her, the main frustration with the current system has been the lack of joined-up care. ""One of the things is that I've had no continuity, because I've been sent to quite a lot of units and stuff and had different teams. I've never had one person that's been there the whole way. ""It's all very mixed up. It feels really out of control and like I've not got one person - I've just been sent to loads of different places, I've been given bits and bobs, but it doesn't all fit. ""It would have been helpful if I could just have had someone from the start or had a therapist that sort of stayed with me,  some continuous treatment that isn't literally just putting me in hospital and keeping me alive and then discharging me. ""I've never had anything that's sort of continuous, so how do I know what works?"" Sienna says she felt while the symptoms of her anorexia were addressed, the underlining issues causing them were not. Rachel says her other children have also suffered ""I just feel like I've never been properly treated for the mental side - they just sort of put me in hospital when my physical side's bad and they don't treat anything else, and then they wonder why it keeps happening, why I have to keep going back into hospital."" For her mother Rachel, the visits to various hospitals - on one occasion 300 miles away from home - have left her in need of therapy. ""It's the most horrible feeling when you have your daughter or your young person taken away from you. ""It feels like you've had your heart ripped out. You keep going and you keep going to do all you can to aid their recovery and you travel wherever you've got to travel. ""It's so tough leaving them somewhere where you don't know the staff and getting on a plane or in a car travelling all those miles back home. It's difficult for them and it's excruciating for the family really left behind."" Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity Young Minds, said while the government's green paper was very welcome, it was ""still only a start"". ""What we want to see is a long-term strategy for children and young people's mental health.,"" she said. Ms Brennan said a postcode lottery in provision must also be addressed. The green paper will be published on Monday and will be followed by a 12-week consultation period. The Local Government Association has previously said that it wanted it to ""deliver the root and branch reform"". Its chairman, Cllr Richard Watts, said: ""We cannot continue with a system that is leaving thousands of children and families in distress"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:  ""Around half of all mental illness starts before the age of 14, so it is vital children get support as soon as they need it - in the classroom. ""If we catch mental ill health early we can treat it and stop it turning into something more serious."" Education Secretary Justine Greening added that prevention and addressing mental health issues early was key. ""It actually really affects young people's learning when they're not able to engage at school as much as we want them to,"" she said. ""So it's about more expertise on the doorstep for schools, better organisation between schools and the health service and improving the waiting time steadily so that young people can get faster care.""

"ABC's incorrect report on Michael Flynn (pictured) hit US stock markets US news network ABC has suspended its chief investigative reporter after he made a ""serious error"" about Donald Trump's former top aide, Michael Flynn. Brian Ross reported Mr Trump was a candidate when he directed Michael Flynn to make contact with Moscow. But he later clarified that the orders came when Mr Trump was president-elect. The actions of Mr Trump's campaign team are under investigation over whether they colluded with Russia to help sway the election in his favour. On Friday, Michael Flynn - who Mr Trump sacked as national security adviser - pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials prior to the president's inauguration in January. Six big takeaways from the Flynn deal Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words As part of a plea bargain, Mr Flynn agreed to co-operate with special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ahead of the 2016 election. US intelligence agencies have already concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a state effort to influence the US election in favour of Mr Trump. President Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement, andtweeted on Sunday that he had never asked former FBI director James Comey to stop the investigation into Mr Flynn,external. Brian Ross's special report was aired after Mr Flynn's plea deal was announced on Friday. Quoting a single anonymous source, it said he was prepared to testify that Mr Trump had directed him to make contact with Russian officials when he was still a candidate for the presidency. If found true, the claim would have conflicted with the president's comments at the time of Mr Flynn's sacking earlier this year. In February, he told reporters: ""No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it, okay?"" Off the back of the report, Wall Street's main indexes fell by more than one percent. In a later edition of ABC's World News Tonight, Mr Ross clarified that his source had in fact said that Donald Trump's orders came during the presidential transition, after the election had taken place. ""It was shortly after the election that President-elect Trump directed Flynn to contact Russian officials on topics that included working jointly against ISIS (so-called Islamic State),"" he said. But the news network was criticised for simply clarifying the error and was later forced to issue a full correction. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Theresa May will hold talks with Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday There will be no Brexit at all unless Theresa May is supported, a cabinet minister has warned. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was not about a choice between ""this Brexit and that Brexit"". He was speaking as leading Brexit campaigners issued demands for Mrs May before agreeing any payments to the EU, including ending the European court's jurisdiction the moment the UK leaves. The UK voted for Brexit last year and is due to leave in March 2019. But negotiations between the EU and the UK have not yet reached a breakthrough. Brexit: All you need to know Farage: I'd take my EU pension What will the EU say at the summit? Reality Check: What's happening with Brexit divorce bill? Mr Hunt's remark, in an ITV interview, came as he defended the PM and sought to reassure critics that UK courts would be supreme after Brexit. He added: ""I think there's an even bigger point here, that the choice we face now is not between this Brexit and that Brexit; if we don't back Theresa May we will have no Brexit - and she is doing an unbelievably challenging job amazingly well."" Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Monday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, hoping the EU will agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far to begin trade talks. The BBC's Katya Adler says the mood in Brussels is positive, with diplomats working through the night to get details right. Our Europe editor said the status of the Irish border remains an ""outstanding issue"" but there was ""cautious optimism"" that enough progress has been made to widen the discussions.

The amount of money the UK will pay as part of Brexit has been one of the main sticking points so far The talks so far have focused on what happens to citizens' rights after Brexit, the amount of money the UK will pay, and the future of the Irish border. On the ""divorce bill"", the UK is understood to have recently increased its offer, which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). There has also been lots of focus on the Ireland question in recent weeks, with the Irish government seeking more information on the ""frictionless border"" the UK wants to establish so customs checks are not needed. Will Ireland's demands delay Brexit? The EU will only move on to talk about future issues like trade when ""sufficient progress"" has been made on these subjects - and is due to decide whether this has happened at a summit on 14 and 15 December. The campaign group describes itself as the ""campaign for a clean Brexit"". Signatories of itsletter,externalto the prime minister include former Tory cabinet ministers Owen Paterson, John Redwood and Lord Lawson and ex-Brexit minister David Jones. Backbench MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg (Conservative) and Labour's Graham Stringer have signed it, as have several economists and business leaders. Former Conservative leader Lord Howard - who hasn't signed the letter - told the BBC's Sunday Politics he shared the ""aspirations"" it contains. The letter says the EU has not matched the ""patience and goodwill"" Theresa May has shown so far, and says the UK should make no ""further financial commitment"" until it agrees to certain conditions. From March 2019, they say: There should be an ""in principle"" agreement for a free trade deal to be in place The current free movement of EU citizens into the UK should end No new EU regulations should apply in the UK The European Court of Justice should ""cease to have any jurisdiction whatsoever"" in the UK Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Rees-Mogg said if the UK remains subject to European court rulings after March 2019 ""we will have stayed in the European Union"". Theresa May has promised that Brexit will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. But she has suggested its remit might continue during an ""implementation period"" after March 2019, which would not satisfy the Leave Means Leave demands. On immigration, ministers have said free movement must end with the UK's EU membership but have promised businesses a ""cliff edge"" will be avoided in terms of employing foreign workers. Meanwhile, there have been more warnings on the subject of the EU court from former Court of Appeal judge Sir Richard Aitkens and ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. TheSunday Telegraph reports,externalthat Sir Richard, the president of the Lawyers for Britain group, has written to Mrs May saying that giving the ECJ the exclusive jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights would be ""tantamount to reversing the result of the 2016 referendum"". Speaking to BBC News, Mr Duncan Smith said that while the UK's courts would be able to take into account the European Court of Justice's decisions, it would be ""unacceptable"" for them to be bound by those decisions.

"Jarvis Cocker's BBC 6 Music show will finish at the end of December, the Pulp frontman has announced. His weekly Sunday Service programme was launched in January 2010.

"The Good Friday Agreement is ""at risk because of Brexit"" after the UK leaves the EU, former prime minister Tony Blair has told the BBC. UK and Irish membership of the EU was ""central"" to the 1998 deal, he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. Free movement on the border had been key to reaching an agreement, he said. The Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveneywarned against a hard borderbecoming the ""collateral damage"" of Brexit. Mr Coveney, who is also Ireland's foreign minister, told BBC One's Andrew Marr show that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were ""uniquely vulnerable and exposed to a potentially bad outcome"" from Brexit. ""We cannot allow some kind of collateral damage or unintended consequence of Brexit to [be] the recreation of a border on the island of Ireland,"" he said. Why is the Northern Ireland border question so hard? Brexit bill: Will we ever know how much? Mr Blair said the prospect of a hard border posed ""real challenges"" to the peace process and it was difficult to see how the issue would be resolved. The ex-PM, who helped orchestrate the Good Friday Agreement, said that the UK and Ireland's EU membership made it ""easy"" to appease nationalist feelings in 1998. The free movement of people, goods and an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was ""part of that expression that the island of Ireland was together"", he said. But there are concerns thatBrexit could lead to a ""hard border""like that seen before the Good Friday Agreement - for example, by reintroducing customs checks between the two countries. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the UK government was opposed to reintroducing a hard border - but said the Irish government or EU could make a ""political choice"" to impose one. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""If the Irish and EU wish to impose a border that would be a matter for them, but they don't have to do it, it is a question of political choice."" Mr Blair said: ""If you end up with a hard border, obviously that causes tensions. ""It doesn't mean that you should abandon the Good Friday Agreement, but it poses real challenges to it."" He urged negotiators to overcome the ""conundrum"" of creating a hard border between the UK and the rest of Europe, while preventing one from re-emerging between Northern Ireland and the South. Brexit negotiators have said that the Common Travel Area between the two countries, which predates the EU, will remain in place. Mr Blair said Theresa May and Philip Hammond were trying to negotiate the ""fundamentally unnegotiable"" by leaving the EU, while also trying to maintain preferential treatment in the EU's common market. ""They're trying to negotiate getting out of the single market, but recreate all of its benefits,"" he said. ""That's not going to happen. ""The risk is, frankly, you end up with a muddle and the worst of both worlds."" Mr Blair, who was speaking about housing policies proposed in a new report by theTony Blair Institute for Global Change,external, also blamed Brexit for distracting the government from the ""huge problem"" of housing supply. ""The whole of the political class, as it were, is simply centred on Brexit,"" he said. He proposed a series of policies designed to tackle the housing crisis - including a new ""land value tax"" which would see the value of underlying land taxed instead of property. He also said there would be ""no extra money"" for the NHS through Brexit. Tony Blair and the former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern signing the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 However, he said Mrs May was ""right"" tocriticise US President Donald Trump's recent tweeting of far-right videos. He said it was the ""minimum"" she could have said - considering she needs to cooperate with the US. You can hear the full interview with Tony Blair at 13:00 GMT on Radio 4'sThe World This Weekend.

"This video can not be played Trump on Russia inquiry: ""What has been shown is no collusion"" Donald Trump has responded to a guilty plea by his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying Mr Flynn's actions as a member of his transition team ""were lawful"". Mr Flynn has entered a plea deal and agreed to co-operate with an inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia. The deal, for a lesser charge than he might have faced, prompted speculation that he has incriminating evidence. The president wrote on Twitter on Saturday that he had ""nothing to hide"". Mr Flynn is co-operating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia ahead of the 2016 election. On Saturday, a day after Mr Flynn's indictment, it emerged that a veteran FBI agent had been dismissed from Mr Mueller's team after the discovery that he had sent anti-Trump text messages. Peter Strzok was removed from the investigation in summer, a spokesman for the special counsel's office, told theNew York Times,external. Saturday was a momentous day for Mr Trump, after his sweepingtax reform billfinally scraped through the senate in the early hours of the morning with 51 votes to 49. But as he left the White House hours after the vote he was quick to address Michael Flynn's admission the day before of lying to the FBI. ""What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion. There has been absolutely no collusion. So we're very happy,"" he told reporters. In denying that Mr Flynn had acted unlawfully as part of his transition team, Mr Trump appeared in his tweet to admit that he knew the former general had lied to the FBI before he fired him in February - contradicting the president's account at the time.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Analysts say if Mr Trump knew that Mr Flynn had lied to the FBI, at a time when he appeared to pressure then-FBI director James Comey to drop the agency's investigation into the former general, it could amount to obstruction of justice by the president. Matthew Miller, a former Obama administration Justice Department official, said in a tweet: ""Oh my god, he just admitted to obstruction of justice. If Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he asked Comey to let it go, then there is your case."" Sources close to the president told the Washington Post that the tweet had been drafted by Mr Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, who later apologised and said he should have been more careful with his language. The White House has yet to comment. Meanwhile,the New York Times reported,externalthat it had obtained internal emails sent by Mr Trump's transition team that disputed the White House assertion that Mr Flynn acted alone in his contacts with Russian officials. Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? How Comey testimony damaged Trump In one email quoted by the paper, a senior adviser appeared to say that Russia had ""just thrown the U.S.A. election to him"", referring to Mr Trump. A White House lawyer told the paper that the adviser, KT McFarland, had meant only that the Democrats were portraying it that way. Under the terms of the plea deal with Mr Mueller, Mr Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI, a significantly lesser charge than he might have faced for illegally dealing with Russian officials. Analysts say the deal suggests that the former general has evidence implicating one or more senior members of the Trump administration. Mr Flynn has admitted lying about his contact with the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December 2016 - after Mr Trump was elected but before he became president. This video can not be played After Flynn's guilty plea, what next for the Russia investigation? The charging documents against Mr Flynn state that he was directed to make contact with Russian officials by a ""very senior member"" of the Trump transition team. Several US news organisations report the very senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. US intelligence agencies say Russia's President Vladimir Putin directed a state effort to influence the US election in favour of Mr Trump. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign or transition team colluded in Russian actions. Mr Flynn was questioned by the FBI shortly after Mr Trump took office in January about his December meetings with Mr Kislyak. He was forced to resign in February, 23 days into his job. According to the FBI's statement of offence signed by Mr Flynn, he discussed Russia's response to US sanctions as well as a UN Security Council resolution on Israel, at the direction of the Trump team. Under the Logan Act it is illegal for a private US citizen, as Mr Flynn was during the transition period, to conduct foreign affairs without the permission or involvement of the US government. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe The charge of making false statements normally carries up to five years in prison, but under the terms of his plea deal Mr Flynn faces a lighter sentence of only up to six months, court filings show. The administration has sought to distance itself from Mr Flynn. White House lawyer Ty Cobb said on Friday: ""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn."" Who is Michael Flynn? Six big takeaways from Flynn's plea deal Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Michael Flynn previously served in the Obama administration before being fired. Mr Obama reportedly advised his successor not to hire the former general, but Mr Trump appointed him to one of the most senior positions in the country. Mr Flynn is not the first former Trump official to be charged.

"James Levine was also a conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra New York's Metropolitan Opera says it has suspended the renowned conductor James Levine following allegations of sexual misconduct. The Met said Mr Levine, 74, would not appear this season and it had appointed a law firm to investigate his actions. Three men have now accused Mr Levine of abusing them decades ago when they were teenagers. Mr Levine, who was music director at the Met for 40 years, has not commented publicly on the accusations. He retired for health reasons in 2016 but has continued to work with the opera as music director emeritus. The Met announced on Saturday it was investigating a claim based on a 2016 police report in which a man accused Mr Levine of abusing him as a teenager in the 1980s. Peter Gelb, general manager of the Met, told the New York Times,externalon Sunday that it had decided to suspend its relationship with the conductor and cancel his forthcoming engagements after learning of the accounts of two other men who described similar sexual encounters beginning in the late 1960s. ""While we await the results of the investigation, based on these news reports, the Met has made the decision to act now,"" Mr Gelb said in a statement on Twitter, adding: ""This is a tragedy for anyone whose life has been affected."" The Times said the Met had been aware of the police report since last year. However, Mr Levine had denied the accusations and the Met had heard nothing further from police, the newspaper added. The accusations follow a series of sexual abuse and harassment claims made against high-profile figures in the entertainment industry. Allow Twitter content?

An Illinois police report, seen by the New York Times, said one of the alleged victims claimed that the abuse began in 1985 when he was 15 and Mr Levine was 41, and continued until 1993. During his career Mr Levine has conducted more than 2,500 performances at the Met. He made his debut there in June 1971 with Puccini's Tosca, becoming principal conductor in the 1973-74 season and music director in 1976-77. He conducted 85 different operas and also worked with the Three Tenors - Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo. He has struggled with Parkinson's disease and other health issues and now conducts from a motorised wheelchair.

"The ""supermoon"" rising above Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire. Skywatchers have enjoyed spectacular views of this month's ""supermoon"" - when the Moon appears larger and brighter in the sky. The supermoon phenomenon happens when the Moon reaches its closest point to Earth, known as a perigee Moon. The Moon circuits the Earth in an elliptical or oval orbit - a supermoon occurs when the perigee Moon is also a full Moon. The supermoon was the last opportunity to see one in 2017. The moon loomed above Yeadon, in Leeds To observers, the Moon appears about 7% larger and 15% brighter, although the difference is barely noticeable to the human eye. Last year the Moon made its closest approach to Earth since 1948- it will not be that close again until 25 November 2034. Nasa has called this weekend's sighting the first in a ""supermoon trilogy"",externalover the next two months, with others to come on 1 January and 31 January. Top tips to photograph a supermoon December's full Moon is traditionally known as the cold Moon. The full Moon on Sunday afternoon - when it sits opposite the sun in the sky - was 222,761 miles from Earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles. The supermoon over the Christmas light trail at Blenheim Palace The supermoon has also been seen over a lighthouse in South Shields, South Tyneside. This Moon's elliptical orbit means that its distance from Earth is not constant but varies across a full orbit. But within this uneven orbit there are further variations caused by the Earth's movements around the Sun. These mean that the perigee - the closest approach - and full moon are not always in sync. But occasions when the perigee and full moon coincide have become known as supermoons. The supermoon was visible around the world, with this view coming from Washington This picture of the supermoon was taken in Jakarta, Indonesia At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"A Labour peer is to repay parliamentary travel expenses after accepting it would have been ""more appropriate"" not to have claimed the money. TheMail On Sunday reports,externalLord Bassam, Labour's chief whip in the Lords, claimed the cost of travelling to and from his home in Brighton since 2010. He also got an annual Â£36,366 allowance for overnight stays in London. Lord Bassam said he had not been told rules were breached, but would not submit such claims again. The Mail on Sunday reported Lord Bassam was making an hour-long train journey between his home on the south coast and London, claiming about Â£6,400 a year in expenses to cover train tickets and taxi fares. But according to the paper, as chief whip and because his main home is not in London, Lord Bassam is one of a small number of front bench peers entitled to theLords office holders allowance,external. The payment is included in his salary and designed to cover ""expenses in staying overnight away from their main or only residence"". In a statement Lord Bassam said: ""With my home outside of London, I have been in receipt of the relevant office holders allowance for the opposition chief whip in the Lords. ""At the same time, in accordance with rules laid down by the House, I have claimed costs for my regular travel to and from Parliament. ""While I have not been advised that any breach of the rules has taken place, waiving the right to such travel claims would perhaps have been a more appropriate response on my part. ""I will not be submitting any further claims in this way, and instead use the office holders allowance to cover those additional costs. I will also discuss with House officials the steps necessary to repay previous travel claims.""

"Theresa May will hold talks with Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday There will be no Brexit at all unless Theresa May is supported, a cabinet minister has warned. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was not about a choice between ""this Brexit and that Brexit"". He was speaking as leading Brexit campaigners issued demands for Mrs May before agreeing any payments to the EU, including ending the European court's jurisdiction the moment the UK leaves. The UK voted for Brexit last year and is due to leave in March 2019. But negotiations between the EU and the UK have not yet reached a breakthrough. Brexit: All you need to know Farage: I'd take my EU pension What will the EU say at the summit? Reality Check: What's happening with Brexit divorce bill? Mr Hunt's remark, in an ITV interview, came as he defended the PM and sought to reassure critics that UK courts would be supreme after Brexit. He added: ""I think there's an even bigger point here, that the choice we face now is not between this Brexit and that Brexit; if we don't back Theresa May we will have no Brexit - and she is doing an unbelievably challenging job amazingly well."" Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Monday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, hoping the EU will agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far to begin trade talks. The BBC's Katya Adler says the mood in Brussels is positive, with diplomats working through the night to get details right. Our Europe editor said the status of the Irish border remains an ""outstanding issue"" but there was ""cautious optimism"" that enough progress has been made to widen the discussions.

The amount of money the UK will pay as part of Brexit has been one of the main sticking points so far The talks so far have focused on what happens to citizens' rights after Brexit, the amount of money the UK will pay, and the future of the Irish border. On the ""divorce bill"", the UK is understood to have recently increased its offer, which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). There has also been lots of focus on the Ireland question in recent weeks, with the Irish government seeking more information on the ""frictionless border"" the UK wants to establish so customs checks are not needed. Will Ireland's demands delay Brexit? The EU will only move on to talk about future issues like trade when ""sufficient progress"" has been made on these subjects - and is due to decide whether this has happened at a summit on 14 and 15 December. The campaign group describes itself as the ""campaign for a clean Brexit"". Signatories of itsletter,externalto the prime minister include former Tory cabinet ministers Owen Paterson, John Redwood and Lord Lawson and ex-Brexit minister David Jones. Backbench MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg (Conservative) and Labour's Graham Stringer have signed it, as have several economists and business leaders. Former Conservative leader Lord Howard - who hasn't signed the letter - told the BBC's Sunday Politics he shared the ""aspirations"" it contains. The letter says the EU has not matched the ""patience and goodwill"" Theresa May has shown so far, and says the UK should make no ""further financial commitment"" until it agrees to certain conditions. From March 2019, they say: There should be an ""in principle"" agreement for a free trade deal to be in place The current free movement of EU citizens into the UK should end No new EU regulations should apply in the UK The European Court of Justice should ""cease to have any jurisdiction whatsoever"" in the UK Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Rees-Mogg said if the UK remains subject to European court rulings after March 2019 ""we will have stayed in the European Union"". Theresa May has promised that Brexit will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. But she has suggested its remit might continue during an ""implementation period"" after March 2019, which would not satisfy the Leave Means Leave demands. On immigration, ministers have said free movement must end with the UK's EU membership but have promised businesses a ""cliff edge"" will be avoided in terms of employing foreign workers. Meanwhile, there have been more warnings on the subject of the EU court from former Court of Appeal judge Sir Richard Aitkens and ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. TheSunday Telegraph reports,externalthat Sir Richard, the president of the Lawyers for Britain group, has written to Mrs May saying that giving the ECJ the exclusive jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights would be ""tantamount to reversing the result of the 2016 referendum"". Speaking to BBC News, Mr Duncan Smith said that while the UK's courts would be able to take into account the European Court of Justice's decisions, it would be ""unacceptable"" for them to be bound by those decisions.

"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford Ex-detectives who disclosed that legal pornography was found on Damian Green's office computer are in ""dangerous territory"", a former police chief says. Sir Peter Fahy, ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester, said it was vital police were ""not involved in politics"". And a watchdog warned that serving officers could be sacked or prosecuted for leaking confidential information. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quickmade his claims,externalafter the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Davis 'warns No 10 not to sack Green' 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. Sir Peter, Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the former officers had a duty to protect confidential information uncovered during an investigation. He said: ""It is very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgements about whether a politician is lying or not. ""That should only happen in a criminal investigation, and even then, ultimately it is for a court to decide."" Peter Fahy, a former chief constable, said police had a duty to protect confidential information Scotland Yard's department for professional standards is examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

"James Levine was also a conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra New York's Metropolitan Opera says it has suspended the renowned conductor James Levine following allegations of sexual misconduct. The Met said Mr Levine, 74, would not appear this season and it had appointed a law firm to investigate his actions. Three men have now accused Mr Levine of abusing them decades ago when they were teenagers. Mr Levine, who was music director at the Met for 40 years, has not commented publicly on the accusations. He retired for health reasons in 2016 but has continued to work with the opera as music director emeritus. The Met announced on Saturday it was investigating a claim based on a 2016 police report in which a man accused Mr Levine of abusing him as a teenager in the 1980s. Peter Gelb, general manager of the Met, told the New York Times,externalon Sunday that it had decided to suspend its relationship with the conductor and cancel his forthcoming engagements after learning of the accounts of two other men who described similar sexual encounters beginning in the late 1960s. ""While we await the results of the investigation, based on these news reports, the Met has made the decision to act now,"" Mr Gelb said in a statement on Twitter, adding: ""This is a tragedy for anyone whose life has been affected."" The Times said the Met had been aware of the police report since last year. However, Mr Levine had denied the accusations and the Met had heard nothing further from police, the newspaper added. The accusations follow a series of sexual abuse and harassment claims made against high-profile figures in the entertainment industry. Allow Twitter content?

"The ""supermoon"" rising above Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire. Skywatchers have enjoyed spectacular views of this month's ""supermoon"" - when the Moon appears larger and brighter in the sky. The supermoon phenomenon happens when the Moon reaches its closest point to Earth, known as a perigee Moon. The Moon circuits the Earth in an elliptical or oval orbit - a supermoon occurs when the perigee Moon is also a full Moon. The supermoon was the last opportunity to see one in 2017. The moon loomed above Yeadon, in Leeds To observers, the Moon appears about 7% larger and 15% brighter, although the difference is barely noticeable to the human eye. Last year the Moon made its closest approach to Earth since 1948- it will not be that close again until 25 November 2034. Nasa has called this weekend's sighting the first in a ""supermoon trilogy"",externalover the next two months, with others to come on 1 January and 31 January. Top tips to photograph a supermoon December's full Moon is traditionally known as the cold Moon. The full Moon on Sunday afternoon - when it sits opposite the sun in the sky - was 222,761 miles from Earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles. The supermoon over the Christmas light trail at Blenheim Palace The supermoon has also been seen over a lighthouse in South Shields, South Tyneside. This Moon's elliptical orbit means that its distance from Earth is not constant but varies across a full orbit. But within this uneven orbit there are further variations caused by the Earth's movements around the Sun. These mean that the perigee - the closest approach - and full moon are not always in sync. But occasions when the perigee and full moon coincide have become known as supermoons. The supermoon was visible around the world, with this view coming from Washington This picture of the supermoon was taken in Jakarta, Indonesia At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"MPsare demanding to know,externalwhy the white goods manufacturer Whirlpool ended a product replacement scheme for dangerous tumble dryers. The Commons business committee says one million of the defective machines remain in UK homes. Last week, a coronerblamed a fault in a Whirlpool dryerfor a 2014 fire that killed two men in north Wales. The firm says it is still offering free repairs, but ended a Â£50 offer for a replacement machine after demand fell. The affected machines include dryers manufactured under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan or Proline brands between April 2004 and October 2015. After problems with the machines first emerged, Whirlpool initially told customers that the dryers were safe to use but should not be left unattended, but later said the machines should be unplugged until they could be repaired. With growing waiting lists for a repair, the company then said it would allow customers to purchase a replacement dryer for the reduced price of Â£50. The Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has written to Whirlpool, asking why it has now chosen to end this replacement scheme. Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves accused the US manufacturer of ""falling significantly short of their responsibilities"" and asked why boss Ian Moverly failed to mention the end of the replacement scheme when he gave evidence to her committee in October. Tumble dryer firm's repairs 'too slow' Sears stops selling Whirlpool appliances Whirlpool said anyone with an affected dryer was still eligible for a free repair, and should contact them immediately to arrange it. It said in a statement: ""After two years of extensive measures to raise awareness, the number of consumers coming forward has fallen sharply. ""This suggests that few affected appliances remain in service."" It told customers who still owned one of the appliances it was ""never too late"" to get in touch. Doug McTavish and Bernard Hender died in the fire at the flat in Llanrwst It continued: ""Previously, consumers who wished to upgrade their products to a newer model were offered the additional option of a brand-new dryer in exchange for a small contribution to the total cost. ""The scheme has now ended due to a fall in demand."" The coroner fromthe inquests into the deaths of Doug McTavish and Bernard Henderin Llanrwst, north Wales, told Whirlpool that it had to ""take action"". He said the fire was caused ""on the balance of probabilities"" by an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. He described evidence presented at the inquest by Whirlpool as ""defensive and dismissive"" and said the company's approach was an ""obstacle"" to finding steps to prevent future fires. Hisfinal report has been sent to the company,external, which has until 26 December to respond. Consumer group Which? criticised both Whirlpool and the government, which it called on to step in. The company's managing director of home products and services, Alex Neill, said: 'It is completely unacceptable that Whirlpool has shut down its replacement scheme for these dangerous tumble dryers. ""It is irresponsible that despite one million households potentially still using an affected machine, Whirlpool seems unwilling to do everything possible to deal with this issue. ""The government must step in and force Whirlpool to fully recall the remaining tumble dryers.""

"Divorce by a man saying ""talaq"" three times was declared unlawful in August Husbands who attempt ""instant divorce"" could be sentenced to three years in prison under draft legislation being considered in India. The traditional practice involves a Muslim man saying ""talaq"" (divorce) three times - in any form, including email or text message. It was declared unconstitutional by India's Supreme Court in August, but officials say it has continued since. The proposed law also provides for fines and support for affected women. The draft Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill has now been sent to regional governments for consultation. It would explicitly ban ""triple talaq"", in line with the Supreme Court ruling, and lay out procedures legal procedures for a ""subsistence allowance"" and custody arrangements, the Press Trust of India said. This video can not be played Triple talaq: Why I fought instant divorce Those provisions have been made ""to ensure that in case the husband asks the wife to leave the house she should have legal protection,"" it quoted a high-level official as saying. Under the current draft, people suspected of the offence would not be eligible for bail. It would also ban the practice in any form - including in writing, or by text message. How Muslim women fought, and won, divorce battle The women who sleep with a stranger to save their marriage Indian news outlets said the legislation is due to be considered during the winter parliamentary sessions, which begins in mid-December. Muslims are India's largest minority group, and it is one of a few countries where the practice of triple talaq - which has no basis in the Koran - has survived. The Supreme Court ruling came after five women petitions the court, arguing the traditional practice violated their fundamental rights.

"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford Ex-detectives who disclosed that legal pornography was found on Damian Green's office computer are in ""dangerous territory"", a former police chief says. Sir Peter Fahy, ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester, said it was vital police were ""not involved in politics"". And a watchdog warned that serving officers could be sacked or prosecuted for leaking confidential information. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quickmade his claims,externalafter the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Davis 'warns No 10 not to sack Green' 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. Sir Peter, Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the former officers had a duty to protect confidential information uncovered during an investigation. He said: ""It is very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgements about whether a politician is lying or not. ""That should only happen in a criminal investigation, and even then, ultimately it is for a court to decide."" Peter Fahy, a former chief constable, said police had a duty to protect confidential information Scotland Yard's department for professional standards is examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

"Divorce by a man saying ""talaq"" three times was declared unlawful in August Husbands who attempt ""instant divorce"" could be sentenced to three years in prison under draft legislation being considered in India. The traditional practice involves a Muslim man saying ""talaq"" (divorce) three times - in any form, including email or text message. It was declared unconstitutional by India's Supreme Court in August, but officials say it has continued since. The proposed law also provides for fines and support for affected women. The draft Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill has now been sent to regional governments for consultation. It would explicitly ban ""triple talaq"", in line with the Supreme Court ruling, and lay out procedures legal procedures for a ""subsistence allowance"" and custody arrangements, the Press Trust of India said. This video can not be played Triple talaq: Why I fought instant divorce Those provisions have been made ""to ensure that in case the husband asks the wife to leave the house she should have legal protection,"" it quoted a high-level official as saying. Under the current draft, people suspected of the offence would not be eligible for bail. It would also ban the practice in any form - including in writing, or by text message. How Muslim women fought, and won, divorce battle The women who sleep with a stranger to save their marriage Indian news outlets said the legislation is due to be considered during the winter parliamentary sessions, which begins in mid-December. Muslims are India's largest minority group, and it is one of a few countries where the practice of triple talaq - which has no basis in the Koran - has survived. The Supreme Court ruling came after five women petitions the court, arguing the traditional practice violated their fundamental rights. The court ruled 3-2 in their favour, and labelled it ""un-Islamic"".

"MPsare demanding to know,externalwhy the white goods manufacturer Whirlpool ended a product replacement scheme for dangerous tumble dryers. The Commons business committee says one million of the defective machines remain in UK homes. Last week, a coronerblamed a fault in a Whirlpool dryerfor a 2014 fire that killed two men in north Wales. The firm says it is still offering free repairs, but ended a Â£50 offer for a replacement machine after demand fell. The affected machines include dryers manufactured under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan or Proline brands between April 2004 and October 2015. After problems with the machines first emerged, Whirlpool initially told customers that the dryers were safe to use but should not be left unattended, but later said the machines should be unplugged until they could be repaired. With growing waiting lists for a repair, the company then said it would allow customers to purchase a replacement dryer for the reduced price of Â£50. The Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has written to Whirlpool, asking why it has now chosen to end this replacement scheme. Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves accused the US manufacturer of ""falling significantly short of their responsibilities"" and asked why boss Ian Moverly failed to mention the end of the replacement scheme when he gave evidence to her committee in October. Tumble dryer firm's repairs 'too slow' Sears stops selling Whirlpool appliances Whirlpool said anyone with an affected dryer was still eligible for a free repair, and should contact them immediately to arrange it. It said in a statement: ""After two years of extensive measures to raise awareness, the number of consumers coming forward has fallen sharply. ""This suggests that few affected appliances remain in service."" It told customers who still owned one of the appliances it was ""never too late"" to get in touch. Doug McTavish and Bernard Hender died in the fire at the flat in Llanrwst It continued: ""Previously, consumers who wished to upgrade their products to a newer model were offered the additional option of a brand-new dryer in exchange for a small contribution to the total cost. ""The scheme has now ended due to a fall in demand."" The coroner fromthe inquests into the deaths of Doug McTavish and Bernard Henderin Llanrwst, north Wales, told Whirlpool that it had to ""take action"". He said the fire was caused ""on the balance of probabilities"" by an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. He described evidence presented at the inquest by Whirlpool as ""defensive and dismissive"" and said the company's approach was an ""obstacle"" to finding steps to prevent future fires. Hisfinal report has been sent to the company,external, which has until 26 December to respond. Consumer group Which? criticised both Whirlpool and the government, which it called on to step in. The company's managing director of home products and services, Alex Neill, said: 'It is completely unacceptable that Whirlpool has shut down its replacement scheme for these dangerous tumble dryers. ""It is irresponsible that despite one million households potentially still using an affected machine, Whirlpool seems unwilling to do everything possible to deal with this issue. ""The government must step in and force Whirlpool to fully recall the remaining tumble dryers.""

"Children and young people in England are to be able to access mental health support at school or college under government plans to improve services. The proposals include introducing a four-week waiting time for youngsters needing specialist support and new mental health support teams in schools. It is hoped around one in four schools in England will have this provision in place by 2022. Campaigners say it was welcome, but overdue and ""only a start"". The issue of young people's mental health has long been of concern, with parents, charities and healthcare professionals warning that families are not getting the support they need. According to new NHS figures, around one in 10 girls aged 16 or 17 were referred to specialist mental health services in England last year. The government's new green paper proposes: training for senior designated mental health leads in schools to improve prevention work earlier access to services through the creation of new mental health support teams working in and directly with schools a new four-week waiting time for NHS children and young people's mental health services every primary and secondary school in England to be offered mental health awareness training all pupils to be taught about mental health and wellbeing as part of improved relationships education and PSHE [personal, social, health and economic] lessons The new measures are part of a Â£300m investment by the Departments of Health and Education. For 18-year-old Sienna (not her real name), the onset of an eating disorder and depression five years ago has meant she has been in and out of hospital units, sometimes for long periods. For her, the main frustration with the current system has been the lack of joined-up care. ""One of the things is that I've had no continuity, because I've been sent to quite a lot of units and stuff and had different teams. I've never had one person that's been there the whole way. ""It's all very mixed up. It feels really out of control and like I've not got one person - I've just been sent to loads of different places, I've been given bits and bobs, but it doesn't all fit. ""It would have been helpful if I could just have had someone from the start or had a therapist that sort of stayed with me,  some continuous treatment that isn't literally just putting me in hospital and keeping me alive and then discharging me. ""I've never had anything that's sort of continuous, so how do I know what works?"" Sienna says she felt while the symptoms of her anorexia were addressed, the underlining issues causing them were not. Rachel says her other children have also suffered ""I just feel like I've never been properly treated for the mental side - they just sort of put me in hospital when my physical side's bad and they don't treat anything else, and then they wonder why it keeps happening, why I have to keep going back into hospital."" For her mother Rachel, the visits to various hospitals - on one occasion 300 miles away from home - have left her in need of therapy. ""It's the most horrible feeling when you have your daughter or your young person taken away from you. ""It feels like you've had your heart ripped out. You keep going and you keep going to do all you can to aid their recovery and you travel wherever you've got to travel. ""It's so tough leaving them somewhere where you don't know the staff and getting on a plane or in a car travelling all those miles back home. It's difficult for them and it's excruciating for the family really left behind."" Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity Young Minds, said while the government's green paper was very welcome, it was ""still only a start"". ""What we want to see is a long-term strategy for children and young people's mental health.,"" she said. Ms Brennan said a postcode lottery in provision must also be addressed. The green paper will be published on Monday and will be followed by a 12-week consultation period. The Local Government Association has previously said that it wanted it to ""deliver the root and branch reform"". Its chairman, Cllr Richard Watts, said: ""We cannot continue with a system that is leaving thousands of children and families in distress"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:  ""Around half of all mental illness starts before the age of 14, so it is vital children get support as soon as they need it - in the classroom. ""If we catch mental ill health early we can treat it and stop it turning into something more serious."" Education Secretary Justine Greening added that prevention and addressing mental health issues early was key. ""It actually really affects young people's learning when they're not able to engage at school as much as we want them to,"" she said. ""So it's about more expertise on the doorstep for schools, better organisation between schools and the health service and improving the waiting time steadily so that young people can get faster care.""

"The children's commissioner told BBC Scotland he cannot rule out legal action on the issue Scotland's children's commissioner has said he may consider legal action over the Universal Credit rollout if it further disadvantages young people. Bruce Adamson said poverty was the biggest human rights issue facing children in Scotland. He told the BBC reforms to the benefits systems could be resulting in some children going without basics like a warm home and hot meals. The UK government said Universal Credit was helping people improve their lives. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the system was ""working"" and that as a result of Universal Credit people were ""moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system"". What do Universal Credit reforms mean? Call to fix 'flaws' in Universal Credit What is universal credit? The controversial measure, which is being rolled out across the UK, brings six existing benefit payments into one. It faced criticism over claims some people had to wait six weeks for their first payment, contributing to a rise in debt, rent arrears and evictions. Chancellor Philip Hammond announced changes aimed at speeding up claim times in his autumn budget last month. Mr Adamson said he was engaging with ministers, from the both the UK and Scottish governments, about the impact the benefit changes were having on the human rights of children and young people. He called for ""political leadership"" on the issue, but said he could not rule of the possibility of legal action in the future. In an extended interview broadcast onBBC Radio Scotland on Sunday, the children's commissioner said: ""Poverty is the biggest human rights issue facing children in Scotland at the moment. ""And there's a number of issues around the way in which Universal Credit is calculated and how it is paid. But this leads to a much, much deeper issue. We are talking about the rights of children and the right to benefit from social security. ""We are talking about things like having a warm and secure place to live, having regular hot, nutritious meals and also the ability to access things like transport to get to school and to enjoy social and cultural activities that we know are so important to their development."" Asked if there was any prospect of legal redress in Scotland, Mr Adamson said: ""While we don't have the Convention on the Rights of the Child within our domestic law yet, we do have the Humans Rights Act which brings in the European Convention on Human Rights and the courts look very closely if a state falls below that minimum standard required, where the state fails to provide those basics of life. ""So certainly if children in Scotland aren't getting those basic things then legal action may be the way to take this forward. But it's not the best way."" He added: ""We really need political leadership here and we need to make sure that we are never in a situation where children are going without the basics that they need."" The Unite union organised a day of action on Universal Credit on Saturday, with demonstrations held around Scotland The DWP spokesman said no-one who needed support had to wait six weeks. He added: ""In December, claimants can request an advance of up to 50% of their first payment and a further 50% in January if they need it, repayable over 12 months. ""Universal Credit lies at the heart of our commitment to help people improve their lives and raise their incomes. It provides additional, tailored support to help people move into work and stop claiming benefits altogether."" Speaking on the BBC'sSunday Politics Scotland programme,Brexit Minister Mike Russell said he thought the Scottish government would be ""very sympathetic"" to potential legal action against Universal Credit if it infringed the human rights of children. He said: ""The approach of the UK government on social security and welfare is truly appalling. It is impoverishing people. It is leading to despair. ""I think anybody who is standing up against that and arguing for a practical resolution, to what are awful, ideological problems being brought by the Tories, I think deserves all the support he can get."" On Saturday, a day of action, organised by the Unite union, saw demonstrations staged at various locations around Scotland protesting against changes to the benefits system.
