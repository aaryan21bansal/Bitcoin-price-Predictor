"Rafael Nadal has lost only two matches at the French Open since debuting in 2005 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:28 May- 11 June Coverage:Listen to live radio commentary and follow text coverage of selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and online. Rafael Nadal continued his superb form with a dominant 6-1 6-2 6-2 win over Roberto Bautista Agut to move easily into the French Open quarter-finals. Second seedNovak Djokovicremains on course to face Nadal in the semi-finals after a 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 6-3 win against 19th seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas. Nadal, 31, is looking to become the first man to win 10 titles at a single Grand Slam event. He will face another Spaniard,Pablo Carreno Busta,in the last eight. Live scores and schedule Muguruza unhappy with Paris crowd Not ready for home yet - Andy Murray column Margaret Court is the only player to have won 10 or more titles at one Grand Slam event, winning the Australian Open on 11 occasions between 1960 and 1973. Nadal now has a 76-2 win-loss record at Roland Garros with his only defeats coming against Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009 and Djokovic in the 2015 quarter-finals. Nadal's victory was not quite as simple as Friday's incredible 6-0 6-1 6-0defeat of Nikoloz Basilashvilibut the fourth seed has not dropped a set yet. It is the 11th time he has reached the quarter-finals at the French Open - a record shared with Roger Federer. Carreno Busta has lost all three of his previous matches against Nadal Carreno Busta, 25, reached his first Grand Slam quarter-final with a 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 8-6 win over Canadian fifth seed Milos Raonic. Carreno Busta, seeded 20th, failed to convert six match points in the deciding set before eventually grinding down last year's Wimbledon runner-up. And a first career win against a top-10 ranked opponent will be rewarded with a meeting against nine-time champion Nadal. Twelve-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic, 30, has not found his way through the draw as easily as old rival Nadal - especially during a gruelling five-set win against unseeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman in the previous round. Ramos-Vinolas' resistance in a 73-minute opening set, where Djokovic had his serve broken twice to trail 4-2 before fighting back to win the tie-breaker, indicated it could be another battle for the Serb. But any fears he might have had were unfounded. Djokovic won the first four games on his way to wrapping up the second set in 28 minutes, then broke again in the sixth game of the third set - after Ramos-Vinolas saved a break point two games earlier following a thrilling 41-shot rally - before serving out to victory. Novak Djokovic equalled Jimmy Connors' mark of 233 wins in Grand Slam singles matches. Roger Federer leads with 314 Before thinking about the prospect of facing Nadal in the last four, Djokovic's first task is to overcome sixth seedDominic Thiem. The 23-year-old Austrian - like Nadal and third seed Stan Wawrinka - has not dropped a set on his way to the last eight, needing little over an hour and a half to win 6-1 6-3 6-1 against unseeded Argentine Horacio Zeballos. Japan's eighth seedKei Nishikorisurvived a scare to beat unseeded South Korean Hyeon Chung in five sets. Nishikori, 27, needed almost four hours to win 7-5 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 0-6 6-4 in a third-round match finished on Sunday after the previous day's rain delay. ""I think the rain helped me a lot, because I was really down in the fourth set and mentally I wasn't ready,"" said Nishikori, whose only Grand Slam final appearance came when he lost at the 2014 US Open. ""I knew I had to change something to beat him, so I think I made some adjustments to make it a little better than yesterday."" Nishikori celebrated his 100th Tour-level match on clay with a hard-fought win Big-serving American John Isner, seeded 21, was knocked out in his third-round match byKaren Khachanovof Russia, who won 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-3). The 21-year-old will now face British world number one Andy Murray in the fourth round on Monday. French 15th seedGael Monfilsreached the fourth round for a seventh time when compatriot Richard Gasquet withdrew from their rain-delayed match with a thigh injury. Monfils, 30, was leading 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 4-3 when his opponent withdrew, setting up a last-16 meeting with Wawrinka.

"This video can not be played ""Run, run, run, they're stabbing everyone"": The eyewitness accounts The Costa coffee shop near London Bridge is rammed with families, couples and police officers. It offers some relief after a long night. Horrific scenes unfolded in the surrounding streets on Saturday. Seven people were killed and 48 injured before the attackers were shot dead by police. Paula Worrall, 38 from Liverpool, is still in her party dress. She was unable to return to the nearby Premier Inn hotel after her night out ended so suddenly. ""You have to carry on regardless but it definitely puts you on edge,"" she says. ""It's a bit eerie here. But the police have been fabulous. We just want a shower, a pair of jeans and some flat shoes."" London attack: Live updates What we know so far PM: General election will go ahead Dario Barbagallo, 33, stands by the police cordon after returning to the scene - less than 24 hours after being caught up in the attack. He was walking through London Bridge when he saw what he described as a ""huge fight"". ""I thought it was drunk people but then I saw the police coming out. ""I saw a terrorist stab an officer and a citizen. I was frozen. I saw three bodies on the pavement. The paramedics were doing CPR and a few of their friends were trying to help them."" Dario, who is originally from Italy, credits the police for doing an ""amazing job"" and says he wants to come back to the scene because he ""feels part of the city"". He adds: ""Even though I'm not British I feel this place is my home. If something happens I'm part of that as well."" Flowers are laid at the scene, as people come to pay their respects to the victims. Imam Abdul Arif, 27, from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, says he wants to ""show solidarity"". ""I'm a Londoner,"" he says. ""I came here because it happened to my home city and it happened in the name of my religion. ""I came to show solidarity and to show it's not in my name."" Imam Arif was breaking fast and finishing his evening prayer as part of Ramadan when he heard the news of the attack. ""Ramadan is a time when you should be worshiping and serving humanity more than ever and these people perpetrated such a crime. ""My hope is that everybody is united and show the individuals who want to divide us they won't be successful."" Several tourists walk past wheeling their suitcases as they attempt to make their way out of the capital. Many are glued to their phones as they try to navigate the police cordons which remain in the area. They look tired but upbeat as they wait patiently to be allowed back into their hotels. Susan Dixon, 39, was visiting London from Newcastle with her husband Martin, 37, and their children Alex, five and Niamh, seven. Susan says: ""Our children have asked about it as they overheard a lot in the pub. We just told them there are some nasty people out there but lots of good people."" Ian Stewart, 48, from Glasgow, was stuck outside his hotel after the attack. ""We were waiting outside the Shangri-La hotel when about 50 people came rushing up the road with their hands on their heads,"" he says. ""The police had guns on them and were videoing them. At that point we decided to leave the area."" Ian said hotel staff had refused to let stranded people into their hotel. ""They were terrible. They wouldn't let us charge our phones. There were four bouncers on the door. ""It wasn't like Manchester where everyone stuck together."" Paul Brackley, general manager of Shangri-La Hotel, said: ""We deeply regret not being able to allow Mr Stewart into the hotel when he was in the area. ""We were able to shelter 40 people who came into the hotel to seek assistance immediately following the incident. ""At one point, we were instructed by the police not to allow anyone to enter or exit the hotel as part of the emergency response. ""We apologise for any misunderstanding, and our thoughts are with the victims and their friends and family."" Many of the bars and restaurants that would normally be ready to welcome families for Sunday lunch have their shutters down on Sunday. But the Borough off-licence is open. Shop worker Arife Buz, 34, says: ""It's business as usual for us. ""We checked with the police whether we could open and they said it was okay. ""It looks so busy here. It's not usually like this at the weekend as all the offices around here are closed. ""I freaked out when I heard about the attack. It's very scary."" Earlier, hospital staff and railway workers struggled to get through the extensive police cordon. William Gendo, a chef at Guy's Hospital, was unable to get to work for his morning shift. ""Its completely closed. There's no way to get through. We've been trying for a few hours,"" he says. William woke to the news of the attack, with friends and family contacting him to see if he was okay. ""I was a little bit worried travelling in but I set off anyway. You have to try. What else can we do?"" Estefany Alcivar, who is a kitchen assistant, says she spoke to a nurse last night who told her staff were staying on to do extra hours and help patients with their food. ""We don't know what to do,"" she says. ""There will be no hot food but they will have sandwiches and tea and coffee."" She says she felt ""worried"" hearing about the attack. ""It's very near my work and I'm in London Bridge all of the time. It feels weird."" Security officer Mohammed Osman, who works on Borough High Street, had to wait for an hour before he was allowed through to his place of work. He says: ""I'm not feeling worried. I'm strong enough. ""These enemies are trying to divide us but we have to be together."" Police arrest 12 after London terror attack In pictures: London Bridge attack Moment police locked down bar.

"Following the London terror attack, which left seven people dead and 48 injured, Theresa May has said the UK must adapt to a ""new trend"" in terrorism. There were 255 terrorism-related arrests in the year ending 31 March 2016,external, according to the latest statistics from the Home Office. The arrests led to 37 prosecutions. In 2015, 128 terrorist and extremist prisoners were released from custody, the Home Office says. Reality Check has been looking into the main powers the police and security services have to stop suspected terrorists. Under Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 the police can stop and search a suspect if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities. It's difficult to know how many stop and searches are carried out under this power as most police forces don't separate Section 43 from other types of stop and search. One force that does hold the data is the Met police. They say that 541 people were searched under the Terrorism Act in the 12 months to March 2016 - a rise of 32% on the previous year. The police also have the power to search suspects even if they don't have suspicion of any links to terrorist activities. In May 2012 the rules were tightened: the police can only carry out searches in designated places where they have reasonable grounds to believe an act of terrorism will take place. At present anyone arrested under the Terrorism Act can be held without charge for up to 14 days. In 2006 the law was changed in order to double the maximum period to 28 days. Only six suspects were ever held for that length. In 2011 it reverted back to 14 days,external. This was during the coalition government when it was decided not to proceed with the annual vote in Parliament to keep it at 28 days. Theresa May was home secretary at the time. In the year to March 2016, 46 people were detained under the powers - 25 of whom were charged. The longest anyone was held for was 13 days, which happened on three occasions during that year. The police can arrest individuals who they suspect of planning an attack. Section 5 of the 2006 Terrorism Act made it a specific offence to prepare (or help others prepare) for an act of terrorism. The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for life. According to the CPS, 25 people were convicted under Section 5 in the year ending September 2016, up from 11 in the previous 12 months. There is no specific offence for carrying out a terrorist act. If a perpetrator was arrested after committing an attack they would be charged with offences such as murder or grievous bodily harm. It is also an offence for someone not to tell the police about someone they believe is involved in planning a terrorism act. A conviction for this offence can lead to a five year maximum sentence. Organisations can be banned by the home secretary if they are believed to be participating, promoting or encouraging terrorism. Being a member - or claiming to be a member - of a banned organisation can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and or a fine. TheHome Office says,external71 international terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. A small number of agencies are able to carry out surveillance inside residential premises or private vehicles. The power requires authorisation by the secretary of state. The Office of Surveillance Commissioners provides independent oversight. The security services also have the power to intercept communication data. The power is available to nine agencies, including GCHQ and MI5. The Investigatory Powers Act, passed in 2016, compels internet companies to keep records of every website and messaging service UK-based citizens visit for a year. Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, or TPims, are a form of house arrest. It applies to people who are deemed a threat but cannot be prosecuted or deported if they are a foreign national. They were first introduced in 2012 and replaced controversial control orders. Those under TPims can be subjected to electronic tagging, having to report regularly to the police and surrendering travel documents. A suspect must live at home and stay there overnight - possibly for up to 10 hours. Electronic tags are used to monitor the movements of criminals The suspect is allowed to use a mobile phone and the internet to work and study, subject to conditions. In 2015, TPims were toughened by granting the ability to relocate subjects up to 200 miles away from their normal residence. TPims initially last for one year, although they can be extended to two. It is possible for them to remain beyond the two-year maximum if there is suspicion of further terrorism activity. A breach of the TPims can lead to imprisonment. As of November 2016, seven people were subjected to TPims - six of whom were British citizens. Temporary Exclusion Orders (TEOs) were created by the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act. They apply to British citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad. They are designed to stop suspects from re-entering the UK unless they give themselves up at the border. Those subjected to TEOs are only allowed to return if they make contact with the UK authorities. If they do come back, they are likely to face either prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers. The Orders last for up to two years at a time and can be renewed. Breaches could lead to a prison sentence. The home secretary applies the TEO where they ""reasonably suspect that the subject is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity while outside the UK"". The government released details on its disruptive and investigatory powers in February. In the wake of the Manchester bombing, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed they had been used once so far. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police the power to stop, search and hold individuals at ports, airports and international railway stations. Initially individuals could be questioned for up to nine hours - although a change in the guidelines means it is now up to six hours. The police also have the power to inspect electronic devices such as phones and laptops. The police do not need prior knowledge or suspicion to use Schedule 7 - although the Home Office says it's done after ""informed considerations"". A total of 23,717 people were stopped under the power in the year ending June 2016, a fall of 23% on the previous year. Despite fewer people being stopped, the number detained under the power has increased by 7%, rising from 1,649 to 1,760 in the same period.

"Rival claims to East Jerusalem remains one of the most burning issues From a monastery rooftop just outside Jerusalem's ancient walls there is a spectacular view of the Dome of the Rock, rising in gold above the Old City. The author Meir Shalev was brought to this spot as a boy to look across at the Western Wall - which at the time could not be accessed by Israelis. He would gaze at the top few bricks of this holy Jewish site while his father told him: ""You will grow up, you will become a soldier and you will fight over this city."" At the time Jerusalem was divided between Israeli and Jordanian control. It followed the 1949 armistice that divided the new Jewish state of Israel from other parts of what had been British Mandate Palestine. For Meir Shalev's father, a well-known Israeli poet, the exclusion of Jews from their holiest sites represented a tragedy for his people. The outbreak of war on 5 June 1967 would change many lives - and reshape that part of the Middle East. Israel launched a pre-emptive attack on Egypt and battled Jordanian and Syrian forces the same day. Mr Shalev was about to turn 19 - the age of his country at the time - and remembers a national mood of panic before the conflict. ""People were talking about the possibility of Israel being destroyed and us being exiled or killed,"" he says. ""We were very eager to fight,"" he remembers. ""We thought: 'This is our chance'."" This video can not be played Meir Shalev: We cannot hold on to the West Bank Mr Shalev found himself in action against Syrian troops on the Golan heights during a series of battles that would lead to Israel's capture of that territory. But it was the occupation of the West Bank that he believes consumed Israel's energy - something he says it has had to ""deal with"" ever since its victory in 1967. He recalls how after the war he told his father in a heated confrontation: ""We took a bite we will suffocate on."" Other Israelis saw a divine purpose in the fighting to bring a return to their biblical Jewish lands. In Jerusalem, the conflict saw Israeli troops involved in close quarters fighting with Jordanians. Another young soldier, Yoel Ben Nun, was being transported to a checkpoint that separated control of the city. This video can not be played Yoel Ben Nun: 'I saw a miracle' He speaks of surrounding the Old City at night, facing a battalion of the Jordanian Legion which rapidly retreated. ""That was a miracle,"" he says, recalling Israel's victory in six days. Yoel Ben Nun told his commander at the time that he felt like two millennia of history had passed. ""The meaning was that for 2,000 years the people of Israel were in exile - persecuted, tortured, subjected to anti-Semitism. Those 2,000 years were over,"" he says. ""This is what I felt on the Temple Mount at the time,"" referring to the revered hilltop also known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Why aren't Israel and the Palestinians talking? Yoel Ben Nun later became a rabbi and joined the movement building Jewish settlements in the West Bank - the territory that Palestinians want for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. For Palestinians, the war represented the loss of land following what they saw as the catastrophe of the first Israeli-Arab conflict two decades earlier. Fatima Khadir was eight years old in 1967 when her family - whom she says were already displaced from their village in the previous war - fled Jerusalem's Old City. She points to the side of her left eye, explaining she was injured by shrapnel from the debris of Israeli bombing. Fatima Khadir: 'We are still suffering' ""I was looking around me, everyone was grabbing whatever they could - mothers and fathers carrying their babies and children"". She ended up with her parents in a refugee camp in the desert border area of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Fifty years on, from her home in East Jerusalem, she speaks of her desire to return to her family's village of the 1940s. ""I still feel the hurt, pain and intolerable struggle,"" she says. ""We were never able to go back. I'm still hurting. We are still suffering."" The outbreak of war had been accompanied by enthusiastic, but false, radio reports of Arab success in the fighting. This video can not be played Azzam Abu Saud: 'We were completely defeated' Mahmoud Erdisat was training to be a fighter pilot - and would later become a major general in the Jordanian air force. ""We were very excited that finally we would get the chance to fight the Israelis and get Palestine back,"" he recalls. But he says it soon became apparent that Israel was overwhelming its opponents. The Israeli territorial increase, claims Mr Erdisat, made it harder to negotiate a ""just solution"" on the issue of Palestinian statehood. He believes the Arab defeat also had a profound impact on the way Israel's neighbours came to view themselves. ""It was a blow to Arab nationalism,"" he says.

"The aircraft crashed in open land on the edge of Stockport town centre Fifty years ago a plane returning from Majorca plunged to the ground in Stockport, Greater Manchester, killing 72 people. Here survivors and eyewitnesses recall what remains one of Britain's worst, but lesser-known, air disasters. The British Midland flight was full of returning holidaymakers bound for Manchester Airport when, on the morning of 4 June 1967, it suddenly lost power and began to fall. Terrified residents watched the aircraft hurtling across rooftops, so low they could see people inside, banging on the windows. Moments later it crashed on a small patch of open ground at Hopes Carr, on the edge of the town centre, striking a garage building and lighting up in a ball of fire. Of its 84 passengers and crew, 72 died and the remaining 12 were seriously injured. They included a stewardess and the captain. ""We were met with a scene of sheer horror,"" said retired Stockport firefighter Mike Phillips, who was 21 at the time. The cause of the crash was found to be a problem with the aircraft's fuel lines ""There were bodies all over the place, and body parts. Members of the public were just screaming for us to do something."" The aircraft had narrowly avoided hitting rows of nearby houses, averting an even greater disaster. Incredibly, no-one on the ground was hurt. ""There was this thick black smoke,"" Mr Phillips said. ""Hundreds of people arrived. I always say the real heroes are the civilians who got stuck in and were a real help to us. ""I saw the body of a young boy, and he just looked like there was nothing wrong with him. That stayed with me."" An air accident investigation found the cause of the crash to be ""fuel starvation"" due to a fault in the fuel lines and the Canadair C-4 Argonaut propeller aircraft's poor warning system. It is still considered one of the worst air disasters in British aviation history, alongsideLockerbie,externalin 1988 andStaines 16 years earlier. There is evidence to suggest the pilot made efforts to steer the aircraft away from homes Captain Harry Marlow was not blamed, and there were strong indications he made concerted efforts to steer the aircraft away from people's homes. The former RAF display pilot suffered amnesia and never flew again. He died in 2009. Survivor Harold Wood was 15 at the time of the crash. Remembering the flight's final moments, he said: ""We were banking quite steeply and I could see a gentleman coming out of a shop and getting into his little Anglia van and looking up at the aircraft. We were that low that I could really at that time tell you the registration. ""I thought to myself at this point 'we aren't going to make this'. ""And at this point this is where I can't remember a thing about the actual flight other than actually waking up in the aircraft itself, surrounded by flames and my brother next to me. ""I saw a hole in the side of the aircraft so I thought, right, let's get out of here."" Mr Wood's brother, Bill, also survived but his father did not. A plaque was placed at the scene of the crash in memory of the victims Vivienne Thornber, who was 19 and travelling with friend, Susan Howarth, remembers the plane plunging ""as low as the bedroom windows"". The pair later escaped the smouldering wreckage with the help of policemen. She said: ""There was no mention of 'fasten your seatbelts' or anything like that. We were not informed that there was anything wrong and we hadn't realised until we knew that we were too low to go anywhere. ""I woke up after the impact and saw the cabin door swinging backwards and forwards. ""There were flames and I thought 'come on Vivienne, do something or else you are going to get burned alive here."" Emergency services were helped by many members of the public during the rescue effort Charles Hunt, now aged 95, was a police inspector placed in charge of a makeshift mortuary. He had the upsetting task of dealing with the dead. ""Casualties had been brought in,"" he said. ""They were all dead of course. There were 32 in there. ""The only two that could be identified were a little girl of about six, with hardly a mark on her body, and the co-pilot had a head injury. The rest were all burned beyond recognition. ""It was upsetting to see all the passengers' belongings. They had just been on holiday, and this was the end of it."" Another view of the wreckage shows just how close the crash came to buildings in the town A service will be held on Sunday at the site of the crash, where two memorials stand in tribute to the victims and the rescuers. An hour-long documentary has also been made to mark 50 years since the disaster. Six Miles from Home will be shown shown at the Stockport Plaza on 10 June, from 19:30 BST. Aviation expert Ian Barrie, who produced the film with Roger Boden, said: ""I was four years old at the time, and Roger was a boy who cycled to the scene on his bike. ""While we all grew up knowing about the plane crash, it seems to often be forgotten. ""What emerged very quickly was what a human story it was. People were sitting in their kitchens making a slice of toast, there was a huge boom, they looked outside and it was an air liner. ""It's just hard to comprehend."" An hour-long documentary has been made to mark the anniversary of the disaster Though the flight ended in such horror, some survivors said one thing that impressed them was the response from the people of Stockport. Ms Thornber said the messages she received while battling severe injuries were ""wonderful and very, very moving"". ""When I was in hospital there were a lot of letters written to me most of whom I have to say I've no idea who they were, just normal people wishing me all the best. ""The kind people at Stockport Infirmary forwarded more letters.  It was just marvellous that people would even think of doing that for somebody they'd never even met.""

"Luis de Carvajal used gold leaf from Bibles to decorate the diary A story of torture, betrayal and persecution is captivating Mexicans almost 500 years after it happened. The dramatic life and death of the Carvajal family in 16th-Century Mexico is in the spotlight after a decades-long search for a national treasure came to an unexpected happy ending. Luis de Carvajal ""The Young"" came to Mexico - then known as New Spain - with his large, well-to-do family during the early colonisation of the Americas. His family governed part of northern Mexico and soon made enemies, including a power-hungry viceroy keen to topple them from power. The ambitious viceroy discovered that Luis de Carvajal was a practising Jew, a crime punishable by death in the times of the Spanish Inquisition Older relatives had urged Luis de Carvajal to convert to Catholicism for his own safety, but he staunchly stuck to his faith. When he was first arrested, the authorities let him off with a warning but kept tabs on him. Far from giving up his religion, Luis de Carvajal became a leader in Mexico's underground Jewish community. Luis de Carvajal chronicled his fall from governor to being sentenced to death in his tiny handwriting When the inquisitors caught up with him again a few years later, he was sentenced to death. He was just 30 years old. Before he was executed, he was tortured so badly that he revealed the names of 120 fellow Jewish people, historian Alicia Gojman explains. His captors forced him to listen as those ""heretics"", which included his own mother, were tortured in the cell next to him. ""He tried to commit suicide because he couldn't cope with having told them about his family and friends, but didn't manage it,"" says Ms Gojman. We know the excruciating details of Luis de Carvajal's persecution because he managed to keep secret diaries. But these were not any old notebooks. They were painstakingly crafted, miniature manuscripts with almost microscopic handwriting in Latin and Spanish. Some pages were intricately decorated with gold leaf he scraped from pages of a Bible. Each of the three memoirs was no larger than a present-day iPhone, most likely so he could keep them hidden away under his hat. The small size of the diaries meant they could be hidden easily Luis de Carvajal wrote about being a young Jew in the New World, about exploring his heritage and practising his beliefs despite the dangers. But much of the memoirs focus on his final tragic days before he was burned at the stake, with vivid descriptions of him falling to his knees upon hearing his mother's tortured screams as she was pulled on the rack. Luis de Carvajal found comfort in poetry, writing verses and prayers to reaffirm his faith in the face of so much cruelty. Luis de Carvajal's memoirs are treasured by Mexico's Jewish population as chronicles of keeping faith despite the ruthlessness of the Spanish Inquisition. ""Children who go to Jewish schools study the Carvajal family history,"" says Mauricio Lulka, executive director of the Central Committee for the Jewish Community in Mexico. The history told in the diaries is taught in Jewish schools in Mexico today For centuries, the delicate manuscripts were kept in Mexico's National Archives. They were treasured as being among the first artefacts documenting the arrival of Jews to the Americas and were studied by researchers from around the world. But in 1932 they vanished, leading to suspicions among the small group of academics who had access to them that one of them may have stolen the precious diaries. After all, they were small enough to hide under a hat. With no trace of the documents, the search was eventually suspended and the trail went cold. More than 80 years after their disappearance, the London auction house Swann in 2016 listed ""replicas"" of the manuscript at an initial price of $1,500 (Â£1,150). But a US collector of Judaica, Leonard Milberg, was suspicious. Why would someone go to the trouble of recreating the minuscule handwriting of Luis de Carvajal's original to create a replica? Intrigued, he contacted the Mexican consulate which confirmed that the originals were still missing and sent experts to check the ""replicas"" out. Baltazar Brito is the director of the National Library of Anthropology and History in Mexico and one of the experts sent to assess the documents. ""When I got there, something told me they were originals, I knew it in my heart,"" he says. Baltazar Brito said he had a ""gut feeling"" the documents were originals For Mr Brito, the documents have relevance beyond their time. ""They tell the story of religious intolerance that we shouldn't let happen again in the world,"" he says. ""Despite that, it still happens."" Leonard Milberg felt the manuscripts belonged in Mexico, so the collector made it his mission to deal with all the international agencies involved and covered the costs of sending them back. Their safe return was welcome news for Mexico's now thriving Jewish community of about 50,000 people, many of whom were drawn to the country by its modern-day commitment to religious freedom. After they were briefly exhibited in Mexico City they are now safely stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the National Library of Anthropology and History in Mexico, as no one wants to risk the miniature manuscripts disappearing for another eight decades.

"Dutch artists Alfons and Adrie Kennis created an Oetzi lookalike High in a remote area of the Oetztaler Alps in northern Italy, 5,300 years ago, Oetzi the Iceman was shot in the back with an arrow. It hit a main artery and he probably bled to death within minutes. His body was preserved in the ice, making him one of the oldest and best-preserved mummies on Earth. Oetzi was first discovered in 1991 and scientists discovered the flint arrowhead lodged in his shoulder 10 years later. But only in recent months have investigators, led by a senior police detective, focused more intently on how Oetzi was shot. Was it murder? And who might have killed him? DNA traces origins of Iceman's ragtag wardrobe Link to Oetzi the Iceman found in living Austrians Angelika Fleckinger, director of the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, where Oetzi's body is on display, called on a professional to investigate. He is Detective Chief Inspector Alexander Horn of the Munich Police Department, who is also head of behavioural analysis with the Bavarian police. He admits to being slightly taken aback at the request. ""It was a funny situation, because when I was asked by the director if I work on cold cases, I said 'yes, I do',"" Inspector Horn said. But this case was colder than most. ""The usual cold case that we have is 20 or maybe 30 years old, and now I was asked to work on a case 5,300 years old,"" he said. Initially, Inspector Horn did not think he could help. ""I thought that probably the body would be in a bad condition. But what I learnt very soon was that it was in perfect condition. It's even in a better condition than some of the bodies I am working on nowadays."" As well as visiting the scene of the crime high in the Alps, the inspector was able to draw on the extensive research done on Oetzi over the last 25 years, which includes detailed analysis of his stomach contents and the injuries on his body. Both were to prove key to Inspector Horn's theories. ""It looks a lot like a murder,"" he says. Oetzi the Iceman had a stomach bug, researchers say The killer seems to have caught Oetzi by surprise. ""Oetzi was shot probably from quite a distance, about 30m (100 ft), which is not a close-contact killing; it's a distance killing."" Inspector Horn says Oetzi seems to have been quite relaxed up on the glacier just before he was shot. His own bow wasn't ready for use. Oetzi was discovered in 1991 - well preserved in the ice of the Italian Alps Scientists were able to study what he was eating, wearing - and even to identify his modern descendants ""About half an hour before he was killed, he was having a rest up there. He was having quite a heavy lunch or meal at least, so it doesn't seem like he was in a rush or fleeing from something."" Another crucial clue came from the injury on Oetzi's right hand - a wound he received one or two days before his death, probably during a fight. ""That injury was something we would define as a classic active defence wound. That would be like if somebody... threatens you with an knife and he stabs you, if you grab into the knife and... try to push it away."" Oetzi did not suffer other defence injuries, so Inspector Horn believes he won the initial fight - which possibly took place down in the valley. ""What we thinkâ¦ is that the killing up on the glacier is probably the continuation of this fight that happened about one-and-a-half days before."" Knowing that he was unlikely to win in hand-to-hand combat, Oetzi's killer probably stealthily followed him up the mountain and shot him. The glacier ""is a very remote area and probably not a place where you would randomly run into each other"", Alexander Horn says. But who was the offender and what were his motives? Inspector Horn says the offender didn't steal Oetzi's valuable copper blade axe and other gear, so it is unlikely to have been a crime for profit. He speculates that it was probably due to ""some strong personal emotion"". ""If there was hate, if it was jealousy, if it was revenge, we will not be able to tell you."" Angelika Fleckinger from the Museum of Archaeology says she is very happy so much progress has been made into the big mystery of Oetzi's death. But Inspector Horn says he is still unsatisfied. ""I don't think there is a high likelihood we will ever be able to solve that case."" The offender ""got away with that murder - which I don't like, being in charge of investigations,"" he said with a wry smile. ""I don't like the fact that we have an unsolved homicide there.""

"Call me pedantic, but London City Island in the capital's Docklands is not really an island at all. A bird's eye view reveals that it is actually a peninsula, caused by an oxbow bend in the River Lea, shortly before it flows into the Thames. But before I go too far in pricking the balloon of the marketing team that invented the island concept, it is worth pointing out that whoever named the nearby Isle of Dogs had the same problem; that too is very definitely joined to the mainland. That said, London City Island - as I shall agree to call it - is a remarkable, if expensive, development. There is certainly lots of water here, although at low tide there is also quite a lot of mud. Given that it is corralled by a loop in the river, it also has the appeal of a very individual and separate place. Hayleigh O'Farrell, head of communications at Ballymore Developments, accepts it may not be a physical island, but says, ""It's got that different, kind of island feel."" It also has truly excellent transport links. After residents walk over the footbridge to the tube station, it is just a 20-minute ride into the very centre of London, according to Transport for London's journey planner. Within a couple of years the 12-acre island will also be home to the English National Ballet (ENB), and the London Film School. The ENB will base its production facilities there, and stage rehearsals. Lorries will be able to drive in and out to transport sets all over the world. For that reason Sean Mulryan, the Irish billionaire behind the development, has described it as his ""island of dance"". This is no dormitory suburb. When it is fully finished, it will be a place that some say will be a spectacle in its own right. Once the site of a margarine factory, the 1,700 flats are being built in double-quick time. Most of the units were prefabricated in a factory in Holland, and shipped to the UK, enabling the first phase to be finished in less than a year. ""They go up like Lego,"" says Ms O'Farrell. ""It's one of the fastest-paced constructions to go up in London."" The design is modelled after the colourful apartment blocks typical of Manhattan or Chicago. ""They are super-bold colours - so each of the bricks really pops."" So what sort of person will be living here? Given the big gym on-site, one imagines the residents being highly athletic, ballet aficionados who are pretty wealthy. The kind that spend their weekends at Glyndebourne perhaps. ""They've clearly set out to provide a very sophisticated product for what they hope will be a sophisticated - and wealthy - clientele,"" says property commentator Henry Pryor. He believes most buyers will be asking the Bank of Mum and Dad for support. ""If asked to help their kids afford these kind of properties, they're going to say, 'Look, it's something that we can justify because not only does it work for you, but darling, we can come and stay there too.'"" However, the developers point out that there are 119 affordable properties in the development, around 7% of the total. They also say that among the 650 people who've already moved in are artists, writers and animators. Presumably many of the others are wealthy bankers who work at nearby Canary Wharf, just four minutes away by tube. ""It is a young profile, a lot of people working in the area,"" says Ms O'Farrell. ""What really surprised us is that people have moved from all over London: 10% I think were from Battersea, and there are people who moved from Chelsea and from Tower Hamlets."" By any definition, you have to be wealthy to buy here. Prices start at Â£495,000 for a one bedroom flat, rising to just over Â£1m. On that basis, anyone putting down a 25% deposit of Â£124,000 would need to earn Â£80,000 to Â£90,000 a year to afford the mortgage. In a market where central London house prices have fallen by 20% in a year, some experts believe such prices are now too high. ""The question is: will it suffer the same issues and challenges that so many of the shiny developments strung out along the river from Putney Bridge to Greenwich are suffering from now? Are there people who can afford to pay the prices that are being sought here?"" says Mr Pryor. He points out that many of the foreign buyers that used to inflate demand for London properties have now disappeared. ""The prices are clearly going to be incredibly challenging in this market, because they appear to be priced for buyers from 18 months ago."" Ballymore insists the flats are not over-priced. Since launching in 2014, it says 85% of the properties have already been sold. Ballymore is about to launch its next development nearby, close to Trinity Buoy Wharf. With its Victorian lighthouse, and surviving brickwork from old shipyards, this too is likely to become an interesting place to live - as long as it does not spoil the area's wonderful industrial heritage. From both places the views along the river are spectacular. ""As developments go, this has been incredibly well-thought-through, and deserves every expectation that it will succeed,"" says Mr Pryor. But if you want to live on a real island, London City Island may not be the place for you.

"Rafael Nadal has lost only two matches at the French Open since debuting in 2005 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:28 May- 11 June Coverage:Listen to live radio commentary and follow text coverage of selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and online. Rafael Nadal continued his superb form with a dominant 6-1 6-2 6-2 win over Roberto Bautista Agut to move easily into the French Open quarter-finals. Second seedNovak Djokovicremains on course to face Nadal in the semi-finals after a 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 6-3 win against 19th seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas. Nadal, 31, is looking to become the first man to win 10 titles at a single Grand Slam event. He will face another Spaniard,Pablo Carreno Busta,in the last eight. Live scores and schedule Muguruza unhappy with Paris crowd Not ready for home yet - Andy Murray column Margaret Court is the only player to have won 10 or more titles at one Grand Slam event, winning the Australian Open on 11 occasions between 1960 and 1973. Nadal now has a 76-2 win-loss record at Roland Garros with his only defeats coming against Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009 and Djokovic in the 2015 quarter-finals. Nadal's victory was not quite as simple as Friday's incredible 6-0 6-1 6-0defeat of Nikoloz Basilashvilibut the fourth seed has not dropped a set yet. It is the 11th time he has reached the quarter-finals at the French Open - a record shared with Roger Federer. Carreno Busta has lost all three of his previous matches against Nadal Carreno Busta, 25, reached his first Grand Slam quarter-final with a 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 8-6 win over Canadian fifth seed Milos Raonic. Carreno Busta, seeded 20th, failed to convert six match points in the deciding set before eventually grinding down last year's Wimbledon runner-up. And a first career win against a top-10 ranked opponent will be rewarded with a meeting against nine-time champion Nadal. Twelve-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic, 30, has not found his way through the draw as easily as old rival Nadal - especially during a gruelling five-set win against unseeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman in the previous round. Ramos-Vinolas' resistance in a 73-minute opening set, where Djokovic had his serve broken twice to trail 4-2 before fighting back to win the tie-breaker, indicated it could be another battle for the Serb. But any fears he might have had were unfounded. Djokovic won the first four games on his way to wrapping up the second set in 28 minutes, then broke again in the sixth game of the third set - after Ramos-Vinolas saved a break point two games earlier following a thrilling 41-shot rally - before serving out to victory. Novak Djokovic equalled Jimmy Connors' mark of 233 wins in Grand Slam singles matches. Roger Federer leads with 314 Before thinking about the prospect of facing Nadal in the last four, Djokovic's first task is to overcome sixth seedDominic Thiem. The 23-year-old Austrian - like Nadal and third seed Stan Wawrinka - has not dropped a set on his way to the last eight, needing little over an hour and a half to win 6-1 6-3 6-1 against unseeded Argentine Horacio Zeballos. Japan's eighth seedKei Nishikorisurvived a scare to beat unseeded South Korean Hyeon Chung in five sets. Nishikori, 27, needed almost four hours to win 7-5 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 0-6 6-4 in a third-round match finished on Sunday after the previous day's rain delay. ""I think the rain helped me a lot, because I was really down in the fourth set and mentally I wasn't ready,"" said Nishikori, whose only Grand Slam final appearance came when he lost at the 2014 US Open. ""I knew I had to change something to beat him, so I think I made some adjustments to make it a little better than yesterday."" Nishikori celebrated his 100th Tour-level match on clay with a hard-fought win Big-serving American John Isner, seeded 21, was knocked out in his third-round match byKaren Khachanovof Russia, who won 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-3). The 21-year-old will now face British world number one Andy Murray in the fourth round on Monday.

"Rafael Nadal has lost only two matches at the French Open since debuting in 2005 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:28 May- 11 June Coverage:Listen to live radio commentary and follow text coverage of selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and online. Rafael Nadal continued his superb form with a dominant 6-1 6-2 6-2 win over Roberto Bautista Agut to move easily into the French Open quarter-finals. Second seedNovak Djokovicremains on course to face Nadal in the semi-finals after a 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 6-3 win against 19th seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas. Nadal, 31, is looking to become the first man to win 10 titles at a single Grand Slam event. He will face another Spaniard,Pablo Carreno Busta,in the last eight. Live scores and schedule Muguruza unhappy with Paris crowd Not ready for home yet - Andy Murray column Margaret Court is the only player to have won 10 or more titles at one Grand Slam event, winning the Australian Open on 11 occasions between 1960 and 1973. Nadal now has a 76-2 win-loss record at Roland Garros with his only defeats coming against Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009 and Djokovic in the 2015 quarter-finals. Nadal's victory was not quite as simple as Friday's incredible 6-0 6-1 6-0defeat of Nikoloz Basilashvilibut the fourth seed has not dropped a set yet. It is the 11th time he has reached the quarter-finals at the French Open - a record shared with Roger Federer. Carreno Busta has lost all three of his previous matches against Nadal Carreno Busta, 25, reached his first Grand Slam quarter-final with a 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 8-6 win over Canadian fifth seed Milos Raonic. Carreno Busta, seeded 20th, failed to convert six match points in the deciding set before eventually grinding down last year's Wimbledon runner-up. And a first career win against a top-10 ranked opponent will be rewarded with a meeting against nine-time champion Nadal. Twelve-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic, 30, has not found his way through the draw as easily as old rival Nadal - especially during a gruelling five-set win against unseeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman in the previous round. Ramos-Vinolas' resistance in a 73-minute opening set, where Djokovic had his serve broken twice to trail 4-2 before fighting back to win the tie-breaker, indicated it could be another battle for the Serb. But any fears he might have had were unfounded. Djokovic won the first four games on his way to wrapping up the second set in 28 minutes, then broke again in the sixth game of the third set - after Ramos-Vinolas saved a break point two games earlier following a thrilling 41-shot rally - before serving out to victory. Novak Djokovic equalled Jimmy Connors' mark of 233 wins in Grand Slam singles matches. Roger Federer leads with 314 Before thinking about the prospect of facing Nadal in the last four, Djokovic's first task is to overcome sixth seedDominic Thiem. The 23-year-old Austrian - like Nadal and third seed Stan Wawrinka - has not dropped a set on his way to the last eight, needing little over an hour and a half to win 6-1 6-3 6-1 against unseeded Argentine Horacio Zeballos. Japan's eighth seedKei Nishikorisurvived a scare to beat unseeded South Korean Hyeon Chung in five sets. Nishikori, 27, needed almost four hours to win 7-5 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 0-6 6-4 in a third-round match finished on Sunday after the previous day's rain delay. ""I think the rain helped me a lot, because I was really down in the fourth set and mentally I wasn't ready,"" said Nishikori, whose only Grand Slam final appearance came when he lost at the 2014 US Open. ""I knew I had to change something to beat him, so I think I made some adjustments to make it a little better than yesterday."" Nishikori celebrated his 100th Tour-level match on clay with a hard-fought win Big-serving American John Isner, seeded 21, was knocked out in his third-round match byKaren Khachanovof Russia, who won 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-3). The 21-year-old will now face British world number one Andy Murray in the fourth round on Monday. French 15th seedGael Monfilsreached the fourth round for a seventh time when compatriot Richard Gasquet withdrew from their rain-delayed match with a thigh injury. Monfils, 30, was leading 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 4-3 when his opponent withdrew, setting up a last-16 meeting with Wawrinka.

He'll know he's been in a match though - some of those points in this set were sensational. Top-class tennis.

Ramos-Vinolas seals a remarkable hold thanks to two rogue forehands from the world number two. How he has held I don't know. Neither does he probably. Ramos-Vinolas 6-7 1-6 1-2 Djokovic* WOW! If there has been a better point in this tournament, then I haven't seen it. Chatrier give the pair a standing ovation after a41-shotrally on break point for Djokovic. A long rally is broken up by a drop-shot by Djokovic, ARV is scrabbling but survives, another long rally, then another Djoko drop-shot. Ramos-Vinolas can't survive again. Can he? Yes! A mis-hit from the Serb flies into the tramlines. Back to deuce... Ramos-Vinolas 6-7 1-6 1-2 Djokovic* As the match clock kicks over the two-hour mark, just a little reminder - should you need it - that we have about another hour of light left in Paris before darkness falls. Djokovic doesn't want to go that far. He grimaces as he slaps a backhand into the net at 30-30, then breathes a sigh of relief when he pats down an overhead net volley after ARV somehow reaches a drop-shot with a slide. Deuce... *Ramos-Vinolas 6-7 1-6 1-2 Djokovic Well, well, well. Djokovic's passage into the last 16 was not the simplest, and his patchy form is continuing here. ARV pins Djoko back with some rasping forehands, changing tack with a neat drop-shot to bamboozle the Serb. Three break points... And he only needs one! Djokovic can't pick up a, er, pick-up as he scuffs more clay than ball. Ramos-Vinolas 6-7 1-6 0-2 Djokovic* The Spaniard's serve is creaking like the dodgy floorboards in your attic. If you've got an attic, of course. Two break points for Djokovic... he only needs one. Another overcooked forehand from ARV hands over the game on a plate. *Ramos-Vinolas 6-7 1-6 0-1 Djokovic Ramos-Vinolas can't convert, however, spooning a forehand over the opposite baseline. Chance gone? One assumes so. The Spaniard is not completely gone yet, a backhand winner pegging Djokovic back from game point. But he can't hold on next time and the Serb eventually holds in an eight-minute opening game. A trio of Smurfs in the Chatrier crowd are happy.

"Three million citizens of other European Union countries live in the UK. Many never sought British citizenship because they never imagined Brexit would happen. Now that it is happening, how do they feel about a general election dominated by Brexit, in which they cannot vote? Romanian citizen Raluca Enescu, 27, lives in south London On Facebook, people were talking about the election. I said: ""I'm an immigrant, I have no right to vote. If there are any people who are too disgusted to vote, please vote for me."" So I now have a guy in Manchester who will vote on my behalf. A lot of people are complaining immigrants are not integrated into society. But political participation is part of being integrated, isn't it? It does mean a lot for me that I'm disqualified from voting. I have no idea how my status in the UK will change as a result of the referendum. I'm one of those people who is facing uncertainty about whether I will be able to secure permanent residency or not. I came here as a Masters student about five years ago. I think I chose the university rather than London - the London School of Economics had the best programme in my field. But I settled in right away. I met my friends, my boyfriend, and I work in public health policy. Now, I don't have the same sense of loyalty to this country that I used to have. If I hadn't met my boyfriend I might have already moved somewhere else. London feels very sympathetic, but smaller, monocultural towns are not safe places to be immigrants. EU migrants didn't vote in the referendum either. I feel like this whole situation has happened because of how disenfranchised immigrants are. The person who has been given the biggest voice and listened to the most is the small-town working-class person who doesn't like immigration. I remember feeling angry when Russell Brand was saying: ""I can't be bothered voting."" As someone who couldn't vote, I desperately wished I could. Polish-born Michal Siewniak, 37, lives in Watford, Hertfordshire I remember well, as a child growing up during communism, when my parents were not able to freely cast their vote. I was 10 when the Berlin Wall collapsed. I remember my parents then being able to express their views in the democratic process. So for me, not being able to vote is like going back 20 years. I was proud to vote in the council elections.  I must admit that I love doing it. But I won't be able to vote in the general election. As a local activist and former councillor, I now wonder, will I be able to vote again, or stand in the local elections, when the UK leaves the EU? Voting, standing in any elections - local or national - is such an important part of being a fully integrated part of any society. So I do feel like a second-class citizen. I'm seen as a burden and my contribution is not recognised. I've been here 12 years. I have a life here. My kids, aged 11, eight and two, go to school here. Working in the charity sector, I do my best to help others to integrate. We know that we are leaving the EU. The fact that we are leaving gives me and my family uncertainty. I am worried that many EU citizens, who come here for good reasons, will face discrimination in all walks of life just because of where we come from and irrespective of what we bring. There was a lot of hate crime last year. People felt ignored and expressed their frustration in an unpleasant way. A friend of mine opened a Polish restaurant and it was vandalised. I know people are concerned about immigration. Iread in the newspaper,externalthe other day that in Boston the number of migrants was up 460% and that has changed the local community. I'm not surprised people are upset. But migrants are here to work. If British people don't want to do fruit-picking jobs, who's going to do them? They aren't coming here because they want to take jobs away from British people. There's a demand. I want to have a platform to raise my concerns. I also hope that the prime minister will recognise that many EU nationals in the UK are keen not only to work in Britain, but also to shape the future of this country by being part of the political process. Mirjam Kaerma, 22, originally from Estonia, is a music technology student in Cardiff In some ways I can understand why British people want to leave. The EU used to be all about free movement of goods, services and people - these are positive things. But the EU has become more and more controlling. You can't elect commissioners so they are untouchable. If I look at it from my own country's perspective, I see how laws are forced on Estonia. So I think the UK should try to negotiate a better deal - for example, follow a similar path to Norway, staying a member of the single market. I think most British people are tolerant and are OK with immigrants who offer some sort of value to the system. Talent is always valued and with British people it's always easy to make friends. What annoys people is immigrants who are disrespectful towards their country's culture, laws and customs. I think if you don't like these then you should go back to your home country or move on to somewhere else. I moved here in 2014 to study and experience the UK's culture. As an international EU student I am not eligible for a student loan for living costs. Nevertheless, I am able to support myself by working in a hotel as a waitress and giving piano lessons because free movement includes the right to work.  Also, last summer I set up a business with my two sisters and my brother, making healthy refreshment drinks based on birch sap. At the moment, the business is based in Estonia and our idea is to bring it to the UK. However, Brexit really makes us think twice. How would we be able to sustain the business if Brexit happens without a deal? It might be hard for us. It's quite frustrating not being able to vote, especially if you like being here and you are helping the economy to grow. Of course, British people's opinions should be prioritised as this is their home, after all. Maybe there should be a separate vote for British people at the general election and another for the EU citizens who live here. I think it's very important their opinions are heard - as well as those of British people who live in EU countries, what about their opinions? Italian Maria Iacuzio, 45, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey I had a good job back in Italy but I left it for love. I studied at Reading University, then I went back to work in Florence and Milan. But I kept in touch with John, who would later become my husband. We had a long talk. Because my English is good and my husband's Italian is not we moved here. I have been here 19 years. It wasn't easy - I have all my family there. If I had known that England would come out of the EU maybe me and my husband would have made a different decision. We feel betrayed. After 19 years I've not got the right to vote. It's very frustrating. So I talk to people. It's the only thing that's in my power. I try to make the British people aware of what it's like for us, because they are not aware. They don't know how hard it is just to put all the documents together for the permanent residency card. My children are worrying about what will happen to me. They are bilingual, aged 10 and nine. They understand what's going on, especially after the referendum. They ask: ""Mummy, are you going back to Italy?"" They go to a Catholic school, there are a lot of Polish parents there. Lots of children there are worried about their parents too. I haven't come here to steal someone else's job. I teach Italian. Who's going to do my job better than me? There's many English people who feel frustrated and want to come out of the EU. You can want to come out but why are you trying to affect people that have been here and have been producing for the country? We haven't done anything wrong. We have just followed the rules of the country. Finnish Ari Luukkonen, 50, lives in Manchester I have been with my British boyfriend for 12 years. He suffers from a terminal illness called COPD and I am his carer. I'm doing the job of three nurses who would have to look after my partner 24 hours a day if I left. I'm doing that job for Â£62 a week. Before I became a carer I worked hard in this country and paid my taxes. I've been living here for 16 years. I'm quite an outgoing person, but recently I have stopped talking to strangers in the pub because my accent always gives me away and people ask where I'm from. I get weird looks and occasionally a comment like: ""Why don't you just go back to your own country?"" At the moment I live in fear of what's in store for me in the future - deportation perhaps, because the government isn't telling us what their plans are concerning EU immigrants. Furthermore, I feel more vulnerable because of the fact that I am only a carer. I, like the other three million EU immigrants, didn't have a vote in the referendum. I can vote in local elections but not in national elections. It's frustrating because I can't get my voice heard. I've been living here for 16 years and I still can't do anything. The only thing I can do is be more vocal on social media. I can get other friends to see my point of view. I'm applying for permanent residency. It's really, really difficult because I don't know what's going to happen to me. And I still need to look after my partner. What's going to happen to him?
