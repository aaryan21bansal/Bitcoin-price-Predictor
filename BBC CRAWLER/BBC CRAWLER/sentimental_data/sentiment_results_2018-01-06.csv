"This video can not be played Cars frozen in floodwaters in Revere, Massachusetts North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking freeze in the wake of a deadly ""bomb cyclone"" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In parts of US and Canada, temperatures were forecast to fall below -20F (-29C), with wind chill making it feel more like -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Canada, high winds have knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia. Thousands of snow ploughs are clearing roads across the US East Coast. The extreme weather has so far been linked to up to 19 deaths in the US and two more in Canada, according to reports. Four deaths were reported in traffic accidents in North and South Carolina. Further fatalities occurred in Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas. Travellers at New York's JFK airport reported chaos at terminals on Friday and Saturday, and hours-long waits in aircraft stranded waiting for a gate. One passenger tweeted to say people were calling the police and threatening to break the doors open after hours waiting aboard a flight from Montreal. Allow Twitter content?

Amid the chaos at JFK, two passenger jets collided early on Saturday, according to officials from the Port Authority, which manages the airport. The right wing of a China Southern plane struck the tail of a Kuwait airliner. Both aircraft were damaged but no injuries were reported. In a separate incident,two planes collided at Toronto's Pearson airport late on Friday night, sparking a fire on one aircraft and requiring passengers to evacuate via emergency slides in the cold. The frozen Hudson River in New York City on America's East Coast Residents of Boston, Massachusetts, clear the streets after heavy snowfall The record-breaking cold comes just days after a phenomenon described as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought heavy snowfall to a wide area along the US East Coast, as well as hurricane-force winds. The National Weather Service (NWS) said on Saturday it expected dangerously low temperatures to last into Monday, as an arctic surge brought freezing air down from the North North Pole. ""An arctic outbreak will keep temperatures 20F to 30F degrees below average across the north-eastern US,"" the NWS said, adding that there was a ""chance for many daily temperature records to be broken"". Watch: What caused the US storm? New Hampshire's Mount Washington, which boasts of having the ""world's worst weather"", experienced record low wind-chill temperatures of -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Massachusetts, residents of Boston, which received over 1ft (30cm) of snowfall, were clearing the streets with shovels. Boston harbour's tide gauge matched its record at 15.1ft - previously set during the great blizzard of 1978. Flooding affected the city's newly renovated seaport district and deluged a downtown subway station, and giant waves saw freezing floodwaters inundate parts of the New England coast. Mayor Marty Walsh blamed climate change. ""If anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,"" he said. Temperatures were forecast to plunge below -20F (-29C) in parts The storm has so far forced hundreds of schools and businesses to close in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Panicked New York City residents rushed to shops before the snow came, clearing shelves of milk, eggs, and kale, the New York Times reported. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida, wherethe cold snap has caused iguanas to lose their grip and fall from trees. Natural gas prices in the US north-east have risen to an all-time high, driven by demand for heating fuel. In Philadelphia, a car was unable to stop at a railway line at the bottom of a steep hill and was hit by a commuter train, killing a passenger in the vehicle. In Virginia, a girl was fatally struck by a car while sledging, and a 75-year-old man was killed after being hit by a snow plough. A 13-year-old girl died and 35 others suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning in an apartment building in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where the temperature averaged 20F (-7C) on Thursday night. Seven of those treated were first responders.

"Restrictions on the sale of alcohol at UK airports could be introduced in an effort to reduce the number of drink-related rage incidents on planes. Airports are currently exempt from legislation governing when they can sell alcohol. In 2017, a House of Lords report found disruptive incidents on flights ""more often than not"" involved passengers who had had alcohol before boarding. A BBC investigation also found a50% increase in arrests of drunken flyers. The Home Office says passengers should be able to enjoy their holidays without having their flight disrupted by ""a small minority of people"". It is expected to begin assessing the impact of implementing the Licensing Act 2003 on airside premises - as recommended in a Lords committee report  - in a few weeks. Airport pubs and bars can currently sell alcohol at any time of the day. If introduced, the act would give councils the power to restrict the timing of alcohol sales and bring the rules governing airport bars in line with the UK high street. It would also give them the ability to close down bars that breached the limits. The Chief Executive of Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said he was encouraged by the move. ""All the evidence does show that this is a problem that is only getting worse. ""The number of incidents of poor behaviour on board flights is increasing year on year and we need to work together to get a handle on it as soon as possible."" A Home Office spokesman added that there were already ""tough penalties"" in place for drunkenness on an aircraft: ""You can be imprisoned for up to two years or given an unlimited fine. ""Pilots also have the power to issue the removal passengers from the plane if they are drunk and the safety of the aircraft or its passengers is threatened."" Last yearRyanair called on UK airports to ban the sale of alcohol before 10amand to limit the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two. The company has alreadybanned passengers from taking alcohol on certain flightsto improve ""comfort and safety"".

"North Korea's possible participation in the Pyeongchang Games could lead to progress A North Korean Olympic official has said that his country is ""likely to participate"" in next month's Winter Olympic Games, reports say. Chang Ung, Pyongyang's representative to the International Olympic Committee, reportedly made the comment at Beijing International Airport on Saturday. Mr Chang is believed to be travelling to Switzerland to discuss the subject, Japanese news agency Kyodo reports. It comes a day after Pyongyang agreed to official talks with South Korea. US President Donald Trump, who has exchanged insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said the talks showed his ""tough stance"" had worked. He said he wanted the talks to go ""beyond the Olympics"". Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism What we know of Koreas' red and green phones During his New Year's Day address, Mr Kim said he hoped that the Pyeongchang Winter Games would be a success, adding that he was considering sending a delegation. In response, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in proposed a meeting with North Korean officials to discuss the subject in detail. Kim Jong-un appeared to extend an olive branch to South Korea on 1 January Mr Moon's proposal and Mr Kim's remarks about the Olympics were the result of two secret meetings between South and North Korean sports officials, which took place in China in late December. In those meetings, the two Koreas agreed to participate in sports exchanges during 2018. North Korea this week accepted an offer to attend a meeting on 9 January that will focus on finding a way for its athletes to attend the Games in South Korea from 9-25 February. It will be the first such meeting in more than two years and is expected to be held at Panmunjom, the so-called peace village in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) where the two sides have historically held talks. It is not yet clear who will be attending. According to an official from South Korea's presidential office, the meeting's priority will be the Pyeongchang Winter Games. However, he told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that he believed there would also ""be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North's participation in the Olympics becomes final"". Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics The tentative moves towards the Olympic appearance come after months of escalating rhetoric from North Korea and the US. The leaders of both countries have previously each threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. Now, as part of efforts to smooth the path to the Olympics, the US has agreed to a request from South Korea to suspend joint military operations, scheduled to take place during the Games. North and South Korea had a brief initial call Earlier this week, North Korea also restored a telephone hotline at their mutual border, to enable the first contact about talks to be made. Mr Kim has said that sending a delegation to the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"". ""We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula,"" he added. While Mr Moon has previously said he sees the Winter Olympics as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations between the Koreas, the two countries still technically at war. Some have expressed uncertainty over the significance of next week's talks and the North's possible participation in the Games. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that it was unclear whether the agreement was ""a real olive branch"" or a ""one-off from [Mr Kim]"". Japan's defence minister said his country would remain vigilant, adding that the North went through ""phases of apparent dialogue and provocation"" and would continue its weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? In his New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim said that Pyongyang had ""achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017"", adding: ""We need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment."" North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles. Mr Moon has said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics?

"Ladbrokes, Easyjet and Virgin Money are among the major companies to reveal gender pay gaps of more than 15% in favour of men for mean hourly pay. Organisations with 250 or more workers must publish their figures by April and so far527 firms have done so,external. Women's hourly pay rates are 52% lower than men's at Easyjet. On average, women earn 15% less per hour at Ladbrokes and 33% less at Virgin Money. All three firms say men and women are paid equally when in the same role. AtEasyjet,external, for example, 6% of its UK pilots are women - a role which pays Â£92,400 a year on average - whereas 69% of lower-paid cabin crew are women, with an average annual salary of Â£24,800. The carrier said it had set a target that one in five of new entrant pilots should be female by 2020. TheLadbrokes Coral,externalgroup put its gender pay gap largely down to ""weak representation at our senior levels"" andVirgin Money,externalsaid it was ""confident"" men and women were paid equally for the same jobs. The gender pay gap is the pay discrepancy between men and women irrespective of their job or position. That is distinct from equal pay - when companies are required to ensure that men and women carrying out the same or similar roles are paid the same for the amount of work they do. There were calls for more action on tackling equal pay from the Women's Equality Party, who issued a response on Twitter: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In 2016, the UK gender pay gap was 9.4% for full-time workers, or 18.1% for all staff. Employers of about half of the UK's workforce will be affected by the reporting rules, which reveal discrepancies in pay and bonuses, with the results published on agovernment database,external. What is the gender pay gap like where you are? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Companies have been publishing figures ad hoc ahead of the 6 April cut-off, including the BBC, which revealed women's mean hourly rate was 10.7% lower. The firm to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% lower mean hourly rate for female staff. Phase Eight's chief executive Benjamin Barnett said the figure did not reflect the ""true story"" of the business, since most male employees worked in head office roles rather than in shops. As of last April, 39 of Phase Eight's 44 male employees worked in the corporate head office - where pay tends to be higher - which Mr Barnett said was likely to be the case at other women's fashion retailers. Mr Kipling cakes owner Premier Foods was among those to have already reported Government departments, retailers, banks and energy firms are among the employers to reveal pay differences in mean hourly pay: Cambridgeshire Police12.9% higher for women Unilever UK limited8.8% higher Evans Cycles6.5% higher The British Museum0% pay gap UK armed forces0.9% lower for women Department for Communities and Local Government5.9% lower Rolls-Royce plc6.3% lower Florette UK and Ireland7.7% lower Virgin Media9% lower Oliver Bonas9.6% lower Premier Foods Group Limited10% lower The Home Office10.1% lower BBC10.7% lower Ladbrokes Coral Group plc15% lower Npower limited19% lower The Co-Operative Bank30.3% lower Virgin Money32.5% lower Easyjet51.7% lower Phase Eight64.8% lower Employers with low or no gender pay gaps include the British Museum (0%) and the armed forces (0.9%). In the armed forces, there are far fewer women in the lower ranks than men, particularly in combat roles where women have not previously been able to apply. There are proportionally more women in officer ranks. There was some criticism of the way the data was presented, some made the point that men are paid more than women in certain companies because they are in higher-paid positions. Jeremy Miles AM of Welsh Labour said that lack of women in higher-paid roles is an issue in itself: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Firms paying women significantly more include mattress retailer Sweet Dreams - which said women were paid 46.4% more - and nursery business Yellow Dot, where women's hourly rate is 35.4% more. Yellow Dot, which runs 12 nurseries in Hampshire, said its team was ""predominantly female"" with the majority of the male team employed in ""the lower skill areas of childcare"". It said 7% of apprentices last year were men, compared with zero in 2016, while 41% of roles involving helping at children's tea time were filled by men - compared with 25% in 2016. The firm said it was ""working hard"" to encourage men to join and it was ""confident"" it could increase the number who stay in the childcare industry. Many financial firms feature in the list, including the Co-op Bank - where mean hourly pay is 30.3% lower for women. Steven Pickering, the bank's chief risk officer, said it was aiming to achieve a ""material increase"" in the number of women in senior roles. Last year,a report published by the BBC,externalfound there was a 10.7% gender pay gap in favour of men when the mean average hourly pay rates were compared. Like many firms, the BBC also measured the gap on a median average basis and found a 9.3% gap in favour of male staff. Director general Lord Hall pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

"This video can not be played FA Cup: Coventry 2-1 Stoke highlights Coventry City claimed a shock FA Cup third-round victory over Premier League Stoke City as manager Mark Robins called for Sky Blues fans to return to the club. Jordan Willis' towering header put the League Two side ahead, before the defender felled Ramadan Sobhi after the break and Charlie Adam levelled from the spot. But right-back Jack Grimmer fired his side back ahead from outside the area with 20 minutes to play and Coventry held on for an historic victory. After the game Stoke bossMark Hughes was sackedfollowing a run of six defeats in eight matches. Watch highlights from FA Cup third-round matches Listen to 5 live Football Daily podcast - third-round reaction Twenty years ago Coventry were a Premier League side attracting home crowds of over 20,000. But this season, having been relegated to English football's fourth tier for the first time since 1959, and with continuing unrest under owners Sisu, the average attendance at the Ricoh Arena has fallen to an average of just 7,500. This video can not be played FA Cup Shuffle: Mystic Murphy, amazing skills, shocks & FA Cup funnies ""The atmosphere was outstanding and the supporters desperately want to grab on to something,"" Robins said of Saturday's 14,199-strong crowd. ""They're lifeblood of the club. Some are staying away at the moment but we want them back. ""I can't ask them to come, as it's so expensive. But we need every penny we can in the transfer market. We're trying to build something."" Stoke showed their quality in the first period as two of manager Hughes' four changes justified their starts from the off. Stephen Ireland and Mame Biram Diouf twice combined well in the box but Stoke failed to take their chances and the home side took the lead through Willis, from debutant Jordan Maguire-Drew's corner. The visitors turned the screw after the break as first-half hero Willis conceded a penalty, but when the Stoke players failed to close down Grimmer on the edge of the area, the defender took his chance and beat Jack Butland at his near post. There was a delay in play in the final minutes of the game as frustrations boiled over and a flare was thrown on to the pitch, but it was the Coventry fans who were left celebrating an unlikely win. This video can not be played Grimmer's screamer knocks out Stoke In 1987 Coventry City beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 at Wembley to lift the FA Cup, but in the 31 years since, the Midlands club have endured a spectacular fall from grace. Twenty years ago Coventry were a Premier League side, 10 years ago they were competing against Saturday's opponents Stoke in the Championship, but this season they began life as a League Two side. Off the field, the Sky Blues' unrest was compounded when they wereput into administration in 2013and they were forced to spend a year in exile in Northampton in 2013-14 because of a dispute over stadium rent. But despite their fans' frustration with owners Sisu, the side have made a bright start in League Two, winning four of their five games over the festive period to climb into the automatic promotion places. Stoke City have lost eight of their last 11 games A desperate run had plunged Stoke into the relegation zone and manager Hughes was in dire need of a win - even against a League Two side in the FA Cup. But instead Stoke exited the competition to a team from the fourth tier or below, while themselves playing in the top flight, for the first time since January 1938. In their1-0 Premier League defeat by Newcastleon New Year's Day, a handful of Stoke supporters displayed banners demanding Hughes be sacked, and they had their way on Saturday evening when the Welshman's departure was confirmed. They should have had the quality to overcome a resurgent Sky Blues side but once again they lacked a clinical goal-scorer and the banners came back out after Coventry's first goal. This video can not be played Watch Hughes' final BBC interview as Stoke manager Diouf made a bright start without hitting the target, while his strike partner Saido Berahino was barely noticeable for much of the game. And despite boasting a far stronger bench - with Peter Crouch and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting introduced in the latter stages - neither could make a meaningful contribution as Coventry's defence held strong under full fire at the end. Coventry City manager Mark Robins:""For us it's brilliant, we're in the fourth-round draw. Hopefully we'll get a big club away from home - Manchester United away would be perfect. ""I'm proud. Regardless of the current troubles at Stoke, and the pressure on them, we equipped ourselves really well. We went toe-to-toe with them. We could have been 3-0 up in the first half."" Stoke manager Mark Hughes speaking before his sacking:""It's clearly a difficult time for us. When we make mistakes, they're getting penalised. We're not giving ourselves the right defensive platform at the moment and when that happens you're always vulnerable. ""Clearly, the only way to quieten down the noise around the club is to win games. We need to turn it around and quickly. We're good enough in this league - we've proved it during my tenure - but we've got to be better in key moments. ""We're all under pressure. I can take the pressure and the focus. I'm not naive and I realise people will talk about my position. But we've got good owners who will make the right decisions for the club. They have done before and they'll do it again.""

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi Victims of serial sex attacker John Worboys feel ""betrayed"" by the decision to release him, a solicitor has said. The former black-cab driver, who was convicted of 19 offences and is suspected of attacking more than 100 women, has served ten years in jail. Kim Harrison, who represented 11 women in civil cases against Worboys, said they were ""absolutely terrified"" by the prospect of his release. The Parole Board chief said the panel was ""confident"" he would not reoffend. Worboys, now 60, is due to be released from prison at the end of the month. He was convicted in 2009 of 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 passengers and one charge of rape. Black cab rapist: ""I screamed at him to get off me"" Sex attack victims sue cabbie John Worboys and his insurers Worboys police were 'overworked',external Why was he released from indefinite term? Worboys picked up his lone victims in London's West End and gave them champagne, claiming he had won large amounts of money on the lottery or at casinos. But these drinks were mixed with sedatives and his victims were unable to prevent him assaulting them. Many women were left with little memory of their ordeals and could only recall falling asleep in the back of the vehicle before waking up at home. He was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and told he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women. Ms Harrison said her clients had been given the ""clear impression"" Worboys would be imprisoned for ""a very long time"" when they came forward. Worboys was convicted in relation to three of the solicitor's clients. All gave full statements to the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), she said, but the remaining eight were told their cases would not be progressed as there was already enough evidence against Worboys. ""They're left feeling betrayed and devastated and they want answers as to why he could be released so early and why their cases weren't taken forward at the time,"" she said. Ms Harrison called for files on the case to be re-examined, and said victims wanted reassurance that Worboys, who had continued to protest his innocence during civil proceedings in 2013, was no longer a threat to them. ""If he hasn't admitted his guilt then he's still a danger to women,"" she said. Worboys told his victims he had won the lottery and invited them to celebrate with him ""If he has admitted guilt then he's admitted a modus operandi which involves luring women to his cab and sexually assaulting or raping them and that needs to be investigated"". Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick previously said the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. Prof Hardwick apologised after it emerged some victims had not been informed of the decision to release Worboys. The CPS said 83 complaints were made during the initial investigation, but many did not pass the evidential test. Questions have been raised as to why no further prosecutions were brought, even though police say they had suspicions Worboys may have assaulted other women. Barrister John Cooper QC said it could be possible to launch a fresh prosecution. ""If there is other evidence out there, then let's have it,"" he said. ""If there is, he could be prosecuted. There is no sell by date in prosecution."" However, Tim Grattan Kane, the senior investigating officer of the initial Worboys investigation, said that although many women came forward, it was a difficult case to prosecute. ""The very nature of the offences committed by Worboys and the fact he was using drugs to facilitate his offending meant that many of these people didn't have a clear recollection of exactly what had happened and when it had happened. ""So, we were not always able to get the strongest of cases."" Police have said any new information about Worboys will be investigated. Worboys, who spent time in prison on remand before his conviction, will be subject to licence conditions including weekly reporting to his supervisor. Any breach of his conditions could lead to his recall to prison. Why was Worboys released now? 'Black-cab rapist' to be freed from jail Worboys victim distressed, says solicitor.

"Syria and Russia deny targeting hospitals or other civilian areas At least 10 hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria have suffered direct air or artillery attacks over the past 10 days, aid workers say. An adviser to a coalition of medical charities told the BBC that the attacks had been the most intense for a year. A senior UN official also told the BBC that health facilities in Syria had been hit ""yet again"". Meanwhile, 17 civilians died in air raids in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, on Saturday, a monitor said. The most deadly raid was in Hammuriyeh where 12 people, including two children, died, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Last week, at least 25 civilians were reported killed in air strikes on two towns in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. About 400,000 people there have been under siege by Russian-backed Syrian government forces since 2013. Urgent transfer of sick Syrians ends Why is there a war in Syria? The Syrian government and Russia military have consistently denied targeting civilian areas. Aid agencies said medical centres hit by recent air strikes included a maternity hospital in Maarrat al-Numan, in Idlib province, which was reportedly hit three times in four days. Five people died in the worst attack, on Wednesday, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), and the hospital was temporarily put out of service. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who advises the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), said other attacks in recent days had targeted hospitals predominantly in Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of the capital. ""This has been at a level, again, we haven't seen,"" he said. This video can not be played Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim Mr De Bretton-Gordon said many children in Eastern Ghouta needed medical evacuation. ""There are over 125 children needing live-saving surgery, including three very young children [whose injuries are] too graphic almost to describe,"" he said. ""A six-month old who has lost an eye who will die if he doesn't receive surgery and an eight-year old girl who weighs only 8kg [17lb] who is dying of malnutrition."" The UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Syria, Jan Egeland, also told the BBC that several of the remaining health facilities in the Eastern Ghouta had been hit ""yet again"". ""This war is continuing as bad in 2018 as it ended in 2017,"" he said. Other attacks on medical facilities documented by UOSSM include: An air strike on a health centre in Harasta, Eastern Ghouta, on 31 December that injured two nurses and damaged the building A paramedic was killed when an artillery shell struck a hospital in Harasta on 30 December A barrel bomb attack in Maarrat al-Numan, Idlib, on 28 December killed a woman and injured three children at a primary health care centre UOSSM chairman Dr Ghanem Tayara condemned the attacks,external. ""This fresh wave of attacks on medical facilities is sickening and unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. ""These attacks force facilities to shut down, terrorise staff and result in undue hardship for patients already suffering."" He added: ""Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been hundreds of well-documented attacks on medical facilities in Syria. It's shameful that there has never been a formal prosecution for these war crimes and it severely undermines the UN's credibility."" At least 25 civilians were reported killed in air strikes in Eastern Ghouta last week The Syrian government recently allowed Red Cross teams to evacuate 29 critically-ill patients from the Eastern Ghouta as part of a deal that saw rebels release the same number of prisoners. However, hundreds more patients are in urgent need of evacuation from the enclave. The Eastern Ghouta is designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's other main ally, along with Turkey, which backs the rebels. But hostilities intensified in mid-November when the Syrian military stepped up air and artillery attacks on the enclave in response to a rebel offensive. Race to rescue injured Syrian baby.

"Ladbrokes, Easyjet and Virgin Money are among the major companies to reveal gender pay gaps of more than 15% in favour of men for mean hourly pay. Organisations with 250 or more workers must publish their figures by April and so far527 firms have done so,external. Women's hourly pay rates are 52% lower than men's at Easyjet. On average, women earn 15% less per hour at Ladbrokes and 33% less at Virgin Money. All three firms say men and women are paid equally when in the same role. AtEasyjet,external, for example, 6% of its UK pilots are women - a role which pays Â£92,400 a year on average - whereas 69% of lower-paid cabin crew are women, with an average annual salary of Â£24,800. The carrier said it had set a target that one in five of new entrant pilots should be female by 2020. TheLadbrokes Coral,externalgroup put its gender pay gap largely down to ""weak representation at our senior levels"" andVirgin Money,externalsaid it was ""confident"" men and women were paid equally for the same jobs. The gender pay gap is the pay discrepancy between men and women irrespective of their job or position. That is distinct from equal pay - when companies are required to ensure that men and women carrying out the same or similar roles are paid the same for the amount of work they do. There were calls for more action on tackling equal pay from the Women's Equality Party, who issued a response on Twitter: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In 2016, the UK gender pay gap was 9.4% for full-time workers, or 18.1% for all staff. Employers of about half of the UK's workforce will be affected by the reporting rules, which reveal discrepancies in pay and bonuses, with the results published on agovernment database,external. What is the gender pay gap like where you are? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Companies have been publishing figures ad hoc ahead of the 6 April cut-off, including the BBC, which revealed women's mean hourly rate was 10.7% lower. The firm to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% lower mean hourly rate for female staff. Phase Eight's chief executive Benjamin Barnett said the figure did not reflect the ""true story"" of the business, since most male employees worked in head office roles rather than in shops. As of last April, 39 of Phase Eight's 44 male employees worked in the corporate head office - where pay tends to be higher - which Mr Barnett said was likely to be the case at other women's fashion retailers.

In the armed forces, there are far fewer women in the lower ranks than men, particularly in combat roles where women have not previously been able to apply. There are proportionally more women in officer ranks. There was some criticism of the way the data was presented, some made the point that men are paid more than women in certain companies because they are in higher-paid positions.

Firms paying women significantly more include mattress retailer Sweet Dreams - which said women were paid 46.4% more - and nursery business Yellow Dot, where women's hourly rate is 35.4% more. Yellow Dot, which runs 12 nurseries in Hampshire, said its team was ""predominantly female"" with the majority of the male team employed in ""the lower skill areas of childcare"". It said 7% of apprentices last year were men, compared with zero in 2016, while 41% of roles involving helping at children's tea time were filled by men - compared with 25% in 2016. The firm said it was ""working hard"" to encourage men to join and it was ""confident"" it could increase the number who stay in the childcare industry. Many financial firms feature in the list, including the Co-op Bank - where mean hourly pay is 30.3% lower for women. Steven Pickering, the bank's chief risk officer, said it was aiming to achieve a ""material increase"" in the number of women in senior roles. Last year,a report published by the BBC,externalfound there was a 10.7% gender pay gap in favour of men when the mean average hourly pay rates were compared. Like many firms, the BBC also measured the gap on a median average basis and found a 9.3% gap in favour of male staff.

"There have been clashes with police at Tehran University since the protests began last month Ninety university students are among more than 1,000 people arrested since anti-government demonstrations began  last month, say reformist MPs in Iran. Mahmoud Sadeghi told the Iranian Students' News Agency that many of them were not involved in protests. Another MP, Farid Mousavi, said it was a preventative measure and they would be released soon. At least 21 people have been killed in the protests, which erupted across the country over the state of the economy. The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards on Wednesday declared the defeat of what he described as ""sedition"" in the country. Six charts that explain Iran protests How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians The 'Rosa Parks' of Iran? Despite this, a number of towns and cities saw fresh protests overnight. However, Reuters, quoting local residents, said they were showing signs of abating after the Revolutionary Guards were sent to several provinces. The unrest - the most widescale of its kind since a disputed presidential election in 2009 - initially began over price rises and corruption but protests have since turned into wider anti-government sentiment. Some reports put the number of people arrested since 28 December as high as 1,700. The vice-president of Tehran University, which has seen clashes in recent days, said a committee had been formed to track the fate of students who had been arrested. ""Our efforts at the university are aimed at co-operating with the relevant authorities to create the conditions for the return of the detained students to the university and their families in the shortest possible time,"" Majid Sarsangi told the Iranian Students' News Agency. A screen grab of the video shows relatives gathered at a prison in central Tehran MP Mahmoud Sadeghi said little was known about at least 10 of the 90 students detained. He told semi-official Ilna news agency that 58 were from universities in Tehran, and the rest from across the country. Many of them, he said, had been arrested at their homes. By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian ""Preventative"" arrests of university students are rather uncommon in Iran. Although some of the students were not involved in the protests, the authorities are fearful of their influence. Historically, universities have been hotbeds of political opposition to the Iranian government. The anti-government protests of 1999 were started by university students in response to the closure of a reformist newspaper. According to the authorities, more than 90% of those arrested in the last 10 days are under the age of 25. With a young, tech-savvy population that wants more freedom and a better economy, the Iranian politicians' fear of youth organisations is not surprising. Video seen by the BBC shows people gathered in front of Evin Prison in central Tehran, in an attempt to find out about their loved ones. Meanwhile, state TV has broadcast images of thousands of pro-government supporters attending fresh rallies on Saturday, with some chanting ""death to America"", ""death to Israel"" and ""death to Britain"". This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people have taken to the streets It comes a day after Iran accused the US of abusing its power as a permanent member of the UN Security Council after it convened an emergency session over the protests. US officials, including President Donald Trump, have voiced their support for the protests since they began. The US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, told the council on Friday that Washington stood ""unapologetically with those in Iran who seek freedom for themselves, prosperity for their families and dignity for their nation"". Many attending pro-government rallies expressed their anger over America's support for the recent protests The move to hold the emergency meeting angered other council members, including Russia, whose envoy described the protests as an ""internal affair"".

"The House of Fraser department store chain has confirmed that it is seeking to reduce rents on some of its stores. The retailer confirmed that it had written to some landlords asking for their ""support"".

House of Fraser, which is due to reveal Christmas trading figures next week, announced closures in Leicester and Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, last year.

It said like-for-like sales in the UK fell 2.6% for the 17 weeks to 30 December amid a ""volatile and competitive"" market. A House of Fraser spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that we have contacted some of our landlords asking for their support as we drive forward with our transformation programme."" The Guardian reported,externalthat the chain wanted to reduce the size of its 59 stores by close to a third over the next decade by getting rid of top floors or basements. House of Fraser was bought by Chinese firm Sanpower for Â£480m in 2014. Last month theMoody's credit agency downgraded its credit rating for the retailer. It pointed to the company's weak results for the first three quarters of 2017, which it said were due to ""both challenging market conditions and company-specific factors"". The disruption from House of Fraser's new web platform and the underperformance of its in-house brands had weighed on the business, Moody's said. ""A recovery in HoF's profitability is dependent upon either an improvement in the company's product offering or in cost-savings initiatives, which each involve execution risks,"" it added.

"Goalless between Fleetwood and Leicester Gestede & Braithwaite with goals for Boro Luke Reddy Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester; Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland So there you have it. Fleetwood will be in the hat for round four, though they'll have to go through Leicester again. On the plus side, Jamie Vardy will now get the chance to face his former club having missed out on injury today. And Middlesbrough fans can kick back and relax this afternoon in the knowledge they are still on their way to Wembley. Thanks for joining me. All the 15:00 GMT games are being covered in a different live text which you canaccess by clicking here. #BBCFACup or 81111 on text Steve, Darlington: Utterly pathetic from Leicester,. The club and the players should both reimburse the travelling fans expenses as they basically conned them out of their money today Dave Bundy:Congratulations Fleetwood Town. Some close chances to win it, but a replay and the revenue it brings will be surely welcome Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland Gary BennettEx-Sunderland footballer on BBC Newcastle Middlesbrough have won at a canter today. Rudy Gestede has led the line well and won the battle with the central defenders but Sunderland have gone down with a whimper. Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester Fleetwood Town manager Uwe Rosler on his team's performance against a Premier League side, and forcing a replay: I would prefer to get it done in 90 minutes. Leicester has a strong
team but we could have won it and we certainly deserved the draw. Our young players showed ability, we took them right to
the wire but unfortunately we didnât win. We are developing young players and every game
against opposition like Leicester will give young players massive experience. On striker Ashley Hunter's display: Ashley is like a lot of young players, a little up and
down, but we know exactly what he can do. Today was a good standard from him. I would highlight the whole team. If we (continue to) go about our business like we did, any team
would have a problem. Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester Fleetwood Town Player of The Match Markus Schwabl speaking to BBC Sport: First of all we played very well today and everyone tried to the maximum. We were digging deep and in the last minute we could have won the
game. On the replay at Leicester: I think if we donât believe we wonât even go to Leicester. We have to go and think we have a chance to win. They will be favourites but
we have to play perfect. There is a bit of disappointment but we played well against a
very strong team and we are happy. Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester Ashley Hunter would have been dreaming about scoring a stoppage winner last night.Watch below how agonisingly close how he came to causing the first upset of the FA Cup third round That's two games down, plus last night's two. Don't worry though, we have 28 more to come. I'll run through some reaction next. #BBCFACup or 81111 on text Robin K D Midgeley:#bbcfacup,externalTony Pulis's management has already had a positive effect on our players. Thanks TP. Boro have got their Mojo back yeah baby yeah. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland And that will be that. Middlesbrough end on the front foot but will not get to take a corner won by Stewart Downing. Middlesbrough can dream of a run to the final again, just like they did in 1997. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland James Vaughan tries to collect a pull-back in the area but Ben Gibson is again on hand to slide in and nudge clear. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland As we go into the last minute we can reflect on how Middlesbrough have been efficient in getting the job done. In Rudy Gestede and Martin Braithwaite they took their clearest chances when they came and aside from one superb Darren Randolph save it has been a cakewalk. A Sunderland cross comes in and is headed down but Ben Gibson smashes clear. Injury time. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland Middlesbrough have a corner to defend and worryingly for Tony Pulis George Friend is in some trouble clutching his knee. I think he clashed knees in making a challenge. Either way it doesn't look good. Sunderland wait to take the corner - Bryan Oviedo will cross - caught by Darren Randolph. Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester What are your FA Cup memories? We want the best ones. Best memorabilia, best win, best family memory of the event, you name it, we want it. Paul Atkinson: Watching '79 final at home. Phoned my Mum when Arsenal were 2-0 up against Man United. Reminding her I said we'd walk it. She phoned back when Utd equalised and was still on the line when Alan Sunderland scored. My phone miraculously survived being thrown at the wall as I went bonkers. Kyle:One of my worst momments supporting Newcastle was when Stevenage beat us 3-1 a few years ago. Embarrassing performance but a great day for them and a wonderful cupset for the neutrals. Reid Warren:Feb 2004 4th round Spurs v Man City. City down to ten men and 3-0 down at half time go on to win 4-3. Jon Macken's header seals it. Where is he now? Jon currently manages Radcliffe Borough, Reid.  Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland Gary BennettEx-Sunderland footballer on BBC Newcastle The quality around the 18-yard box from the Sunderland wide players has been really poor. When they did get it in the box, they went close but generally it's not been good enough. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland Middlesbrough look to add a showpiece finish to their day as defender Daniel Ayala wins the ball and sets off upfield via an interchange of passes. He nearly linked with Adam Clayton and Rudy Gestede but the through ball for him was a tad overhit. We have five minutes to go. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland There are 10 minutes left at the Riverside where Middlesbrough may well get the deckchairs and a few books out as they can pretty much fall over the line here. Fleetwood v Leicester (12:45 GMT) Kevin KilbaneFormer Republic of Ireland winger on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Ashley Hunter late-on nearly won it for them. Uwe Rosler will be very happy
with his team. Fleetwood certainly deserve the draw. Defensively they worked hard and from back to front, full credit to them. They have been excellent. Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester If you're a Fleetwood fan now, how are you feeling? A brilliant display, packed with poise and composure and yet they came within inches of winning it. That late Ashley Hunter effort did everything bar cross the line. Leicester can consider themselves fortunate to be in the hat. Fleetwood will get a shot at them in a replay and will of course profit financially as a result. Fleetwood 0-0 Leicester Oh my goodness. Ashley Hunter thinks he's won it. He shoots from 25 yards and it deflects off Yohan Benalouane... hits the post... hits the keeper in the face and hits the post again. My word. That will surely be it? What a moment. Middlesbrough 2-0 Sunderland Adama Traore fizzes one over the bar from range for Middlesbrough. He's stood out today. Another good run and hit. There are 15 minutes to go at the Riverside.

Coventry 2-1 Stoke Coventry City right-back Jack Grimmer, who scored the winner against Stoke:""The FA Cup is something special. I scored in the 97th minute to win a tie for Shrewsbury (in 2016) so to add to it today was amazing. ""Right at the last minute, I took a touch and decided to shoot. I think if any photographers took a photo a couple of seconds after they would have seen the surprise on my face. I think I need to get better at goal celebrations. ""We made it difficult for them. They wanted to come and play football and the pitch didn't allow them to do it. They worked us hard and that is a sign of what this team can do. ""I was exhausted in the dressing room. We defended for our lives in the last couple of minutes. As you can imagine the music was on and it was a great atmosphere. Everyone soaked it up. It was so well deserved. ""The main thing that we've spoken about is about giving back to the fans. It's not where the fans expect us to be. This one is for them. They came out in numbers today and they were brilliant."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text What do you make of Coutinho's potential Â£142m move? Si Roberts:Sad to see Coutinho go but satisfying to know that by ignoring the advice of half the BBC pundits last summer to accept the first bid, Liverpool secured half a season and an extra Â£60m. Man City 4-1 Burnley Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche:""I thought we were very good until they scored their first - a very contentious goal - and then we looked a bit punch drunk. ""It all changed very quickly and my only gripe is how quickly we switched off after the first goal."" On the first goal:""The first goal was contentious because the referee could use his common sense and stop that from happening. ""The referee said he did not need to blow the whistle. The law and common sense view of refereeing is what is important at that moment. Our player is three or four yards away from the referee gesticulating if he is going to blow the whistle and at that moment Manchester City played it into the slot our player would have been. ""It is a strange one today. You come away from a  result like that and the scoreline doesn't suggest how the game went. There were so many good things from us today."" Newcastle 3-1 Luton Newcastle United Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez:""I said in the news conference we wanted to approach the game with a strong team to make sure we were going through. ""First half we finished really well. We were 3-0 up, maybe itâs harder to keep concentration in the second half. ""They scored and maybe had belief they could then score more.
We had chances to finish the game.
The first half was quite good, a lot of possession, passing and good goals. ""In the second half we needed more experience to manage these games. Keep the ball and then a  fourth goal would have finished it but we couldn't do it."" Aston Villa 1-3 Peterborough Only Harry Kane (24) has
     scored more goals among Englishmen in all competitions in English football
     than Jack Marriott (23) this season. Man City 4-1 Burnley Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola:""Both of Sergio Aguero's goals were amazing, there were clever and quick and I am happy with both of his goals. !It's an honour for me to have Aguero under my command. The quality he has is amazing and we need him to score a lot of goals. Aguero is the kind of player that in a matter of seconds can score two goals. He is an essential player for us."" On David Silva:""David Silva is a legend for the club for what he has done. I am happy for him to have made his statement and it is not easy for him to travel to Spain and England back and forth. But we are happy because everyone is playing well. And for today."" Norwich 0-0 Chelsea Up and running at Carrow Road... Coventry 2-1 Stoke Stoke City Stoke manager Mark Hughes speaking to Match of the Day: ""It's
clearly a difficult time for us. When we make mistakes, they're getting
penalised. We're not giving ourselves the right defensive platform at the
moment and when that happens you're always vulnerable. ""Clearly, the only way to quieten down the noise around the club
is to win games. We need to turn it around and quickly. We're good enough in
this league - we've proved it during my tenure - but we've got to be better in
key moments. ""We're all under pressure. I can take the pressure and the focus.
I'm not naive and I realise people will talk about my position. But we've got
good owners who will make the right decisions for the club. They have done
before and they'll do it again. ""Credit to Coventry. They deserved the win for defending manfully
and putting bodies on the line. I wish them well."" Newcastle 3-1 Luton Luton Town manager Nathan Jones:""We were a little bit naive to be honest. I'm a bit disappointed. ""At times we were excellent in the second half, we looked an attacking threat. ""We gave a wonderful account of ourselves. We had a right go at a  Premier League side. We haven't tried to nick a result, we had a good go. ""Maybe that's naive but we played some great football today and the fans were outstanding."" Man City 4-1 Burnley Allow Twitter content?

want to grab on to something. ""Theyâre lifeblood of the club. Some are staying
away at the moment but we want them back. I can't ask them to come, as it's so expensive.
But we need every penny we can in the transfer market. We're trying to build
something. ""It's an outstanding achievement, against a team full of stars,
some of whom will be playing in internationals and at the World Cup this summer. To
come out and not scrap or hold on, we were deserved winners."" Robins on the pressure on former team-mate and Stoke manager Mark Hughes:""In management you get it all the time. It won't be the first time or last
time he's had this. We've all been through it. You have to stay focused. He's a talented manager and he needs to get a break. Their chairman is notoriously patient and hopefully he'll be
given that time. ""For us it's brilliant, we're in the fourth round draw. Hopefully we'll get a big club away from
home - Manchester United away would be perfect."" Coventry 2-1 Stoke ""When a Premier League side lose to a lower league side, that's news."" If it doesn't go so well this week Mark, there's always a job for you here... Coventry 2-1 Stoke Coventry manager Mark Robins on Match of the Day:""Iâm
proud. Regardless of the current troubles at Stoke, and the pressure on them,
we equipped ourselves really well. We went toe-to-toe with them. We could have
been 3-0 up in the first half. They put pressure on us in the second half were
able to bring on a wealth of experience from their bench. ""But then we got the second on the counter. The boys threw
themselves at everything and we're in the hat for the next round."" Were Coventry hanging on at the end?âThey were desperate for
the win, as we were. There were times where you have to forgive the lads who
are 18 and 19. There were so many things that were pleasing out there
today."" Coventry 2-1 Stoke Mark Hughes says that 'we have disappointed ourselves and our fans."" The Stoke manager is under some heat at the moment. Full reaction to come. #BBCFACup or 81111 on text Alex from Leeds:Stoke and Mark Hughes fan here. This is not the result that should decide whether he stays or goes. If results continue to be poor, he can leave at the end of the season. Now is not the time - I doubt Coates will think so either. Andrew Dunn:Not so long ago we got knocked out by Worcester City but today we have created the upset of the round. Awesome for the Sky Blues. The long-suffering fans deserve this.

"North Korea's possible participation in the Pyeongchang Games could lead to progress A North Korean Olympic official has said that his country is ""likely to participate"" in next month's Winter Olympic Games, reports say. Chang Ung, Pyongyang's representative to the International Olympic Committee, reportedly made the comment at Beijing International Airport on Saturday. Mr Chang is believed to be travelling to Switzerland to discuss the subject, Japanese news agency Kyodo reports. It comes a day after Pyongyang agreed to official talks with South Korea. US President Donald Trump, who has exchanged insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said the talks showed his ""tough stance"" had worked. He said he wanted the talks to go ""beyond the Olympics"". Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism What we know of Koreas' red and green phones During his New Year's Day address, Mr Kim said he hoped that the Pyeongchang Winter Games would be a success, adding that he was considering sending a delegation. In response, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in proposed a meeting with North Korean officials to discuss the subject in detail. Kim Jong-un appeared to extend an olive branch to South Korea on 1 January Mr Moon's proposal and Mr Kim's remarks about the Olympics were the result of two secret meetings between South and North Korean sports officials, which took place in China in late December. In those meetings, the two Koreas agreed to participate in sports exchanges during 2018. North Korea this week accepted an offer to attend a meeting on 9 January that will focus on finding a way for its athletes to attend the Games in South Korea from 9-25 February. It will be the first such meeting in more than two years and is expected to be held at Panmunjom, the so-called peace village in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) where the two sides have historically held talks. It is not yet clear who will be attending. According to an official from South Korea's presidential office, the meeting's priority will be the Pyeongchang Winter Games. However, he told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that he believed there would also ""be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North's participation in the Olympics becomes final"". Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics The tentative moves towards the Olympic appearance come after months of escalating rhetoric from North Korea and the US. The leaders of both countries have previously each threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. Now, as part of efforts to smooth the path to the Olympics, the US has agreed to a request from South Korea to suspend joint military operations, scheduled to take place during the Games. North and South Korea had a brief initial call Earlier this week, North Korea also restored a telephone hotline at their mutual border, to enable the first contact about talks to be made. Mr Kim has said that sending a delegation to the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"". ""We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula,"" he added. While Mr Moon has previously said he sees the Winter Olympics as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations between the Koreas, the two countries still technically at war. Some have expressed uncertainty over the significance of next week's talks and the North's possible participation in the Games. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that it was unclear whether the agreement was ""a real olive branch"" or a ""one-off from [Mr Kim]"". Japan's defence minister said his country would remain vigilant, adding that the North went through ""phases of apparent dialogue and provocation"" and would continue its weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? In his New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim said that Pyongyang had ""achieved the goal of completing our state nuclear force in 2017"", adding: ""We need to mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and accelerate their deployment."" North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles. Mr Moon has said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics?

"Anne Noblett disappeared after getting a bus home from a dance class Police say they are looking into possible new leads in the unsolved killing of a teenage girl 60 years ago. Anne Noblett, 17, was found dead in woodland near Whitwell, Hertfordshire, on 31 January 1958, 32 days after she went missing. Detectives have reviewed the case a number of times but have been unable to identify her killer. Hertfordshire Police said six people had responded to an anniversary appeal with potential information. The 'Deep Freeze' murder: Who killed Anne Noblett? ""Inquiries are ongoing to fully explore the information they have to share,"" a spokesman said. Anne disappeared while returning home to Marshalls Heath Lane in Wheathampstead after attending a dance class in Harpenden. She had taken a bus home and got off at Cherry Tree Corner. This was the last time she was seen alive and it is believed she was murdered within hours of her disappearance. The cause of her death was strangulation and it is thought Anne's body was stored before being moved to dense woodland in Rose Grove Woods, known locally as Young's Wood in Horn Hill. Scotland Yard was involved in the search for Anne's killer Due to the condition of the body when it was found, it was considered she may have been held in cold storage for some time. It led to the press dubbing her killing the Deep Freeze murder. Her family remains desperate to understand what happened to her, police said. The case has been reviewed several times, including as recently as February last year. Mick Flavin, of Hertfordshire Police cold case team, has appealed for witnesses to get in touch Mick Flavin, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire case review team, has admitted there is a good chance Anne's killer might be dead. ""Six decades later, we are appealing for anyone who may have information but may not have felt that they could come to police earlier to please get in touch,"" he said.

"Syria and Russia deny targeting hospitals or other civilian areas At least 10 hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria have suffered direct air or artillery attacks over the past 10 days, aid workers say. An adviser to a coalition of medical charities told the BBC that the attacks had been the most intense for a year. A senior UN official also told the BBC that health facilities in Syria had been hit ""yet again"". Meanwhile, 17 civilians died in air raids in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, on Saturday, a monitor said. The most deadly raid was in Hammuriyeh where 12 people, including two children, died, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Last week, at least 25 civilians were reported killed in air strikes on two towns in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. About 400,000 people there have been under siege by Russian-backed Syrian government forces since 2013. Urgent transfer of sick Syrians ends Why is there a war in Syria? The Syrian government and Russia military have consistently denied targeting civilian areas. Aid agencies said medical centres hit by recent air strikes included a maternity hospital in Maarrat al-Numan, in Idlib province, which was reportedly hit three times in four days. Five people died in the worst attack, on Wednesday, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), and the hospital was temporarily put out of service. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who advises the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), said other attacks in recent days had targeted hospitals predominantly in Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of the capital. ""This has been at a level, again, we haven't seen,"" he said. This video can not be played Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim Mr De Bretton-Gordon said many children in Eastern Ghouta needed medical evacuation. ""There are over 125 children needing live-saving surgery, including three very young children [whose injuries are] too graphic almost to describe,"" he said. ""A six-month old who has lost an eye who will die if he doesn't receive surgery and an eight-year old girl who weighs only 8kg [17lb] who is dying of malnutrition."" The UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Syria, Jan Egeland, also told the BBC that several of the remaining health facilities in the Eastern Ghouta had been hit ""yet again"". ""This war is continuing as bad in 2018 as it ended in 2017,"" he said. Other attacks on medical facilities documented by UOSSM include: An air strike on a health centre in Harasta, Eastern Ghouta, on 31 December that injured two nurses and damaged the building A paramedic was killed when an artillery shell struck a hospital in Harasta on 30 December A barrel bomb attack in Maarrat al-Numan, Idlib, on 28 December killed a woman and injured three children at a primary health care centre UOSSM chairman Dr Ghanem Tayara condemned the attacks,external. ""This fresh wave of attacks on medical facilities is sickening and unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. ""These attacks force facilities to shut down, terrorise staff and result in undue hardship for patients already suffering."" He added: ""Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been hundreds of well-documented attacks on medical facilities in Syria. It's shameful that there has never been a formal prosecution for these war crimes and it severely undermines the UN's credibility."" At least 25 civilians were reported killed in air strikes in Eastern Ghouta last week The Syrian government recently allowed Red Cross teams to evacuate 29 critically-ill patients from the Eastern Ghouta as part of a deal that saw rebels release the same number of prisoners. However, hundreds more patients are in urgent need of evacuation from the enclave. The Eastern Ghouta is designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's other main ally, along with Turkey, which backs the rebels. But hostilities intensified in mid-November when the Syrian military stepped up air and artillery attacks on the enclave in response to a rebel offensive. Race to rescue injured Syrian baby.

He had also taken out payday loans and remortgaged the family home in Sheffield. Mr Bradford, now 61, said that rather than helping gamblers who were trying to stop, casinos sent ""lots of offers to get back on the bandwagon"". He added: ""They only really answer to their shareholders â¦ there is a need for a duty of care."" His son Adam Bradford said gambling should be treated as a mental illness. The 25-year-old added: ""I hope this measure is not simply a threat and if companies do lose their licences for breaches of the code, then it is a step in the right direction."" The commission also said that some staff had little idea of how to spot money laundering - or, in some cases, even what it was.

"In the world of US politics, 2018 has arrived with fire and fury. Donald Trump has split with former top adviser Steve Bannon. The president's detractors are touting the revelations in Michael Wolff's explosive new book as confirmation of every suspicion they had about the man and his fitness for office. Mr Trump is back on Twitter, lashing out at the media, Democrats and critics everywhere. The White House is in full bunker mode, enforcing a workplace ban on personal mobile phones of staff members with new vigour. The president's lawyer is rattling off cease-and-desist letters like he's being paid by the word. As Americans hunker down on a frigid weekend to read the juiciest parts of Fire and Fury, the dust is settling from this latest political storm. Who are the winners and losers? Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House is already topping online best seller charts During a television interview on Friday morning, the author - a man known in media circles but hardly a household name for most Americans - was basking in the glow of the national spotlight. He quipped that he should send the president a box of chocolates for giving him the kind of publicity money can't buy. Thanks to the frenetic response from the White House when excerpts of his book first started hitting the press earlier this week, Fire and Fury has shot to the top of the Amazon bestseller list. Some have groused that the author largely built his work upon prior reporting by major US media outlets like the Washington Post and the New York Times. Others have questioned the accuracy of details in the book. Trump supporter Sebastian Gorka, in an interview with BBC News, pointed to an author's note in which Wolff acknowledges that his work is based on occasionally conflicting accounts, some of which were ""baldly untrue"". Wolff says he sometimes allowed disagreements to remain in the text so reader could judge, while in other passages he ""settled on a version of events I believe to be true"". Wolff says he has tapes and notes to back up his assertions, although he has yet to indicate whether he will release them. It's clear, however, that the author is the currently the brightest star in the media firmament - and for a man who seems to adore being The Man, that's winning and winning big. Who is author of explosive Trump book? Steve Bannon is now ""Sloppy Steve"" to the president. The former White House chief strategist went from mastermind of Mr Trump's presidential victory and Time Magazine cover boy to ""Sloppy Steve"", as the president has now nicknamed him, in less than a year. It has been quite a reversal of fortune. In early 2017, Bannon boasted about how he was going to oversee nothing less than the""deconstruction of the administrative state""and usher in a new conservative populism, joining working-class Americans with evangelical conservatives to cement an enduring governing majority. After he was forced out of the White House in mid-August, he pledged to launch a movement that would try to unseat incumbent Republican senators he viewed as insufficiently loyal to Mr Trump and his nationalist policies. His first candidate was Roy Moore who, after being mired in allegations of sexual misconduct, became the first Republican senator to lose to a Democrat in deeply conservative Alabama in 25 years. That defeat may have been the beginning of the end for Bannon's influence. If there's one thing Mr Trump won't abide, it's a loser - and the president pointed to the Alabama defeat in his scathing letter repudiating Bannon after the Fire and Fury excerpts hit the press this week. Throw in that Bannon directed sharp, personal insults at Mr Trump and his family - calling daughter Ivanka ""dumb as a brick"" and saying Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner may have committed treason by meeting with Russians during the presidential campaign - and his fate was sealed. According to reports, the White House informed its supporters that they would have to choose between the president and Bannon - and, by and large, they have fallen in line behind Mr Trump. Rebekah Mercer, a deep-pocketed benefactor of Bannon's, issued a statement saying she had terminated her support for his political efforts.Reports are swirling,externalthat Bannon may be forced out from atop conservative media empire Breitbart News. While US politics is full of second and third acts, 64-year-old Bannon - with funding disappearing and influence waning - is approaching a career nadir. If this is a Trump-Bannon war, it has been a rout. A political knifefight with consequences Why is this man smiling? Shortly after the president released his scathing statement in which he asserted that Bannon had ""lost his mind"", Mitch McConnell's campaign Twitter account sent out ashort video clip,externalof the Senate majority leader sitting at his desk, smiling broadly. No words were included. None was needed. The Senate majority leader had very publicly feuded with Bannon since the ousted presidential adviser declared it his 2018 goal to see Mr McConnell stripped of his leadership position and his Senate allies ousted. Now that particularly unpleasant thorn is gone from Mr McConnell's side. Senate Republicans running for election in 2018, many of whom had been nervously eyeing their right flank for potential - or actual - challenges from Bannon-backed insurgents, are breathing a sigh of relief. For Republicans, the 2018 congressional mid-term elections are going to be hard enough to manage in a political environment that appears to be trending toward highly motivated Democratic voters. If Republicans have to spend time and effort fending off primary challenges - or if fringe candidates end up winning primaries then flaming out, like Mr Moore, under the general election pressure - a bad year for their party could become much, much worse. For Mr McConnell and his fellow party faithful, that possibility just got less likely. Smiles are more than warranted. This video can not be played President Trump faces questions about his relationship with former top aide Steve Bannon This could have been, perhaps even should have been, a very good week for Mr Trump. The New Year marks the start of his reformed tax system, passed after considerable effort last month. The Dow Jones stock market index broke 25,000 for the first time in history, and unemployment numbers - while not quite as impressive as originally predicted - are still at healthy lows. A string of big corporations have announced at least temporary boosts to employee salaries, crediting the tax reform law. Doom-and-gloom predictions of economic disaster during the Trump presidency have been proven unfounded. If Americans tend to vote on economic concerns, this should be encouraging news for the incumbent party. Instead, the president has been beset by internal divisions. One of his closest allies not only gave credence to a Russia investigation Mr Trump had labelled a ""witch hunt"", he directly implicated the president's closest family members. Fire and Fury paints a portrait of a president wholly unprepared for high office, a man treated by his senior staff as a child, unable to focus on anything but ""immediate gratification"". It makes claims that Mr Trump may be suffering from diminished mental capacity, prone to repeating himself and sometimes unable to recognise even close friends. Debate over the president's mental health It doesn't matter if the allegations are fully substantiated by on-the-ground reporting or not, they will ring true for Trump's critics and feed the perception that he is temperamentally ill-suited for his job. Politics isn't beanbag, as the saying goes, and it certainly isn't always fair. At the very least, this has been a terrible distraction for a White House and a Congress facing some tight legislative deadlines in the weeks ahead. Every day spent on damage control is a day where Republicans are unable to advance their policy priorities on budgeting, immigration, health insurance, infrastructure spending and a host of other issues. This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his 'worst enemies' If Mr Trump was the big winner in 2016, right on his heels was the formerly obscure right-wing website Breitbart News, which became the voice of the nationalist Trump movement. Bannon, their once and future publisher, had a prominent position in the White House and their influence was at an all-time high. Now, however, the media empire is caught in a particularly unpleasant pincer. Their leader is out of favour with the president, and reporters and editors covering the feud have had to walk a fine line between the two parties. It comes as a time when they have been challenged to explain some of the president's departures from economic populist orthodoxy (a tax cut for corporations isn't exactly a working-class rallying cry, after all). The website had gone all-in on Roy Moore in December, sending reporters to investigate and potentially debunk claims made by women alleging misdeeds by the Republican candidate. Like Bannon, they shared in Mr Moore's stinging defeat. Breitbart may recover, but its upward trajectory has been blunted, at least for now. Fox & Friends has become a staple of Donald Trump's morning television viewing If Breitbart is the upstart challenging to become the voice of conservative media, Fox News is the reigning king - and any expansion by the former came at the expense of the latter. And if Breitbart stumbles due to internal discord, Rupert Murdoch's news empire stands to benefit. Speaking of Mr Murdoch, he plays an interesting role in Fire and Fury. Before his latest project, Wolff penned an at-times contentious biography of the media mogul. In numerous passages of Fire and Fury, Mr Trump looks to Mr Murdoch with deference and respect despite run-ins over Fox's coverage of him during the primary campaign. The feeling, according to Wolff, is not always mutual, however, as Murdoch once reportedly remarked that the president is a ""f***ing idiot"". All this aside, Fox News has positioned itself as the president's closest media ally, and the president - a loyal viewer of numerous Fox shows - reciprocates the love, often citing the network's programmes and personalities in his daily tweets. Whether or not Bannon is forced out from Breitbart, he will likely be forever linked to the website in the president's mind. And, given recent events, that's not a good thing.

"It is a question that has dogged Donald Trump - fairly or otherwise - since he was elected president: is he mentally fit for office? The question has been raised again by the release of a new book by New York journalist Michael Wolff, which chronicles the first year of the Trump White House. The book - the accuracy of which has been disputed by the White House and queried by others - paints the president as impatient and unable to focus, prone to rambling and repeating himself. Mr Trump has hit back against Mr Wolff's account, claiming on Twitter to be a ""very stable genius"" whose ""two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart"". But the president's manner and speaking style have led to armchair diagnoses of a host of ailments, from Alzheimer's to narcissistic personality disorder - a controversial practice that has divided the medical profession.

The current flurry of speculation has been triggered by the book Fire and Fury, in which Mr Wolff writes that during the course of his access to the White House preparing the book, he witnessed people around President Trump become aware that ""his mental powers were slipping"". During the marketing campaign for the book, Mr Wolff said Mr Trump, 71, repeated himself often. Repetition can be caused by poor short-term memory, as well as by other factors. It can be a sign of dementia, which affects 5-8% of people aged 60 and over worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. ""Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions,"" wrote Mr Wolff.,external""It used to be inside of 30 minutes he'd repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories - now it was within 10 minutes."" Mr Wolff did not give any other context for the alleged repetitions. Mr Trump has blasted the book, calling it ""phony"" and ""full of lies"" and saying he did not authorise any access to the White House for Mr Wolff. Critics of the book have also questioned its sourcing. They have asked whether Wolff himself witnessed the events he describes, and called some of its content gossip. Allow Twitter content?

Psychologists had previously speculated about symptoms they purported to see in Mr Trump's behaviour. Several books came out on the topic within months of the Trump inauguration: The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump by Bandy X Lee, Twilight of American Sanity by Allen Frances and Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen. Dr Lee, who is a psychiatry professor at Yale, told a group of mostly-Democrat senators last month that Mr Trump was ""going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs"". But it's worth remembering that none of these people have treated Mr Trump, nor do they have close-up information on his state of mind. Anyone who has treated him would be going against ethics standards and, in most cases, federal law if they disclosed any details. In theory it could cost Mr Trump his job. Under the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, if the president is deemed to be ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"", the vice-president takes over. His cabinet and the vice-president together would need to kick-start the process, so it's unlikely to happen, however many voices call for it. This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Yes - presidents have suffered from mental ill health going right back to Abraham Lincoln, whose clinical depression prompted several breakdowns. More recently Ronald Reagan, who was president from 1981 to 1989, suffered confusion and seemed unsure of where he was at times - he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's five years after he left office. The 25th amendment has never been used to depose a sitting president. It is worth reiterating, there is no real evidence as nobody speaking publicly has examined the president. But some have suggested thatMr Trump may have symptoms which would point to Narcissistic Personality Disorder,external(NPD). People with this condition often show some three key characteristics,external, according to Psychology Today: Grandiosity, a lack of empathy for other people and a need for admiration They believe they are superior or may deserve special treatment They seek excessive admiration and attention, and struggle with criticism or defeat But the man who wrote the diagnostic criteria for NPD, Allen Frances, said a lack of obvious distress stopped him from saying Mr Trump had the condition. ""Mr Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy,"" he wrote. Experts debate Trump's mental health Trump like a child, says defiant author Wolff's book has prompted some to ask if Mr Trump might be suffering from cognitive decline. Repetition of stories and the way Mr Trump speaks have been put forward to back up the claims. Whenneurological experts compared clips of Mr Trump in the past with more recent footage,external, they found his manner of speaking had totally changed. In the past he spoke in long and complicated sentences, following thoughts through and using long adjectives while in more recent clips, he used fewer and shorter words, missed words out, rambled, and was more likely to use superlatives like ""the best"". In one instance during a speech in December, Trump lifted a glass awkwardly, with both hands This could be due to a neurological condition like Alzheimer's, some experts said, or it could be a symptom of nothing more sinister than age. Those who say the president is concealing cognitive decline point to a few other incidences where he seemed not to have full control over his own movements. There was one instance in December where he was giving a speech and lifted a glass awkwardly, with both hands. During another speech,he slurred through some of his words,external, which the White House blamed on a dry throat but some said could be a sign of something more serious. This video can not be played Viewers were left amazed at parts of Trump's Jerusalem announcement Motor function is driven by the brain's frontal lobe, which loses volume with age but also gets affected by a specific, relatively rare, type of dementia. According to the UK's National Health Service,external(NHS), frontotemporal dementia has symptoms including ""acting inappropriately or impulsively"", ""appearing selfish or unsympathetic"", ""overeating"", ""getting distracted easily"" and ""struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word"". Next week the president will undergo his first medical examination - a physical - since taking office. Well, there's the question. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press spokeswoman, said: ""It's disgraceful and laughable. ""If he was unfit, he probably wouldn't be sitting there, wouldn't have defeated the most qualified group of candidates the Republican Party has ever seen."" Some Republican lawmakers have dismissed the concerns as a partisan attack. Representatives Duncan Hunter of California and Mike Simpson of Idaho were said to have ""burst out laughing"" in February last year when told by news website The Hill that the Democrats were raising such questions. (Mr Simpson did say it was fair to question the president's ""judgment"",external, however.) But others have been more scathing. Following in the footsteps of Jeb Bush's assertion during the race for the presidency that ""the guy needs therapy"", Tennessee senatorBob Corker said in August that Mr Trump had not demonstrated the ""stability"" he needed,externalfor the role. Dr Frances previously said the debate was unfair - but to people suffering from mental illnesses. ""Bad behaviour is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely,"" he said. ""It is a stigmatising insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr Trump (who is neither)."" Others have echoed this, withone columnist saying the debate would ""make people with mental-health needs more likely to stay closeted,external"". But professionals who have given their opinion on Mr Trump's psychological state say they have done so in order to warn the nation. In speaking out they have in fact broken their industry's own ethics - the decades-old Goldwater Rule prohibits psychiatrists from giving diagnosis about someone they have not personally evaluated. It was instated after a magazine asked thousands of experts in 1964 whether Republican nominee Barry Goldwater was psychologically fit to be president. He successfully sued the magazine's editor for libel after the results were published. The APA warned during the campaign that breaking the rule in trying to analyse the candidates in the presidential election was ""irresponsible, potentially stigmatising, and definitely unethical"". Given the rule against diagnosing from afar, some argue that there should be a system in place for diagnosing Mr Trump up close. ""A president could be actively hallucinating,external,"" writes the Atlantic, ""threatening to launch a nuclear attack based on intelligence he had just obtained from David Bowie, and the medical community could be relegated to speculation from afar."" In fact there is a law in the works for a committee to be required to assess the president's health - the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity (OCPC) Act. And despite the amount of space given to the topic of the president's mental health, many commentators recoil from it.Carlos Lozada writes in the Washington Post that this is reductive,external: ""There is something too simple about dismissing his misdeeds as signs of mental illness; it almost exonerates him, and us."" Former Harvard Law Schoolprofessor Alan Dershowitz says this approach is ""just dangerous"",external, writing: ""If we don't like someone's politics we rail against him, we campaign against him, we don't use the psychiatric system against him,"" He said people who thought the 25th Amendment would end the Trump presidency were putting ""hope over reality"". Only a ""major psychotic break"" would result in that, he said. Who is author of explosive Trump book?

Mr Bradford, now 61, said that rather than helping gamblers who were trying to stop, casinos sent ""lots of offers to get back on the bandwagon"". He added: ""They only really answer to their shareholders â¦ there is a need for a duty of care."" His son Adam Bradford said gambling should be treated as a mental illness. The 25-year-old added: ""I hope this measure is not simply a threat and if companies do lose their licences for breaches of the code, then it is a step in the right direction."" The commission also said that some staff had little idea of how to spot money laundering - or, in some cases, even what it was. All companies should ensure staff are trained in the law, and they should all carry out risk assessments - such as monitoring and risk profiling of customers - it said. The commission's chief executive Sarah Harrison said the organisation was taking action to make the market ""fairer and safer"". She added: ""It is vital that the gambling industry takes its duty to protect consumers and keep crime out of gambling.""

"This video can not be played Cars frozen in floodwaters in Revere, Massachusetts North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking freeze in the wake of a deadly ""bomb cyclone"" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In parts of US and Canada, temperatures were forecast to fall below -20F (-29C), with wind chill making it feel more like -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Canada, high winds have knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia. Thousands of snow ploughs are clearing roads across the US East Coast. The extreme weather has so far been linked to up to 19 deaths in the US and two more in Canada, according to reports. Four deaths were reported in traffic accidents in North and South Carolina. Further fatalities occurred in Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas. Travellers at New York's JFK airport reported chaos at terminals on Friday and Saturday, and hours-long waits in aircraft stranded waiting for a gate. One passenger tweeted to say people were calling the police and threatening to break the doors open after hours waiting aboard a flight from Montreal. Allow Twitter content?

Amid the chaos at JFK, two passenger jets collided early on Saturday, according to officials from the Port Authority, which manages the airport. The right wing of a China Southern plane struck the tail of a Kuwait airliner. Both aircraft were damaged but no injuries were reported. In a separate incident,two planes collided at Toronto's Pearson airport late on Friday night, sparking a fire on one aircraft and requiring passengers to evacuate via emergency slides in the cold. The frozen Hudson River in New York City on America's East Coast Residents of Boston, Massachusetts, clear the streets after heavy snowfall The record-breaking cold comes just days after a phenomenon described as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought heavy snowfall to a wide area along the US East Coast, as well as hurricane-force winds. The National Weather Service (NWS) said on Saturday it expected dangerously low temperatures to last into Monday, as an arctic surge brought freezing air down from the North North Pole. ""An arctic outbreak will keep temperatures 20F to 30F degrees below average across the north-eastern US,"" the NWS said, adding that there was a ""chance for many daily temperature records to be broken"". Watch: What caused the US storm? New Hampshire's Mount Washington, which boasts of having the ""world's worst weather"", experienced record low wind-chill temperatures of -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Massachusetts, residents of Boston, which received over 1ft (30cm) of snowfall, were clearing the streets with shovels. Boston harbour's tide gauge matched its record at 15.1ft - previously set during the great blizzard of 1978. Flooding affected the city's newly renovated seaport district and deluged a downtown subway station, and giant waves saw freezing floodwaters inundate parts of the New England coast. Mayor Marty Walsh blamed climate change. ""If anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,"" he said. Temperatures were forecast to plunge below -20F (-29C) in parts The storm has so far forced hundreds of schools and businesses to close in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Panicked New York City residents rushed to shops before the snow came, clearing shelves of milk, eggs, and kale, the New York Times reported. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida, wherethe cold snap has caused iguanas to lose their grip and fall from trees. Natural gas prices in the US north-east have risen to an all-time high, driven by demand for heating fuel. In Philadelphia, a car was unable to stop at a railway line at the bottom of a steep hill and was hit by a commuter train, killing a passenger in the vehicle. In Virginia, a girl was fatally struck by a car while sledging, and a 75-year-old man was killed after being hit by a snow plough. A 13-year-old girl died and 35 others suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning in an apartment building in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where the temperature averaged 20F (-7C) on Thursday night.

"The House of Fraser department store chain has confirmed that it is seeking to reduce rents on some of its stores. The retailer confirmed that it had written to some landlords asking for their ""support"". The move, first reported by Sky News, suggests that it could be struggling after a tough Christmas for retailers. House of Fraser, which is due to reveal Christmas trading figures next week, announced closures in Leicester and Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, last year. Rival chainDebenhams issued a profit warning this weekafter reporting disappointing Christmas trading. It said like-for-like sales in the UK fell 2.6% for the 17 weeks to 30 December amid a ""volatile and competitive"" market. A House of Fraser spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that we have contacted some of our landlords asking for their support as we drive forward with our transformation programme."" The Guardian reported,externalthat the chain wanted to reduce the size of its 59 stores by close to a third over the next decade by getting rid of top floors or basements. House of Fraser was bought by Chinese firm Sanpower for Â£480m in 2014. Last month theMoody's credit agency downgraded its credit rating for the retailer. It pointed to the company's weak results for the first three quarters of 2017, which it said were due to ""both challenging market conditions and company-specific factors"". The disruption from House of Fraser's new web platform and the underperformance of its in-house brands had weighed on the business, Moody's said. ""A recovery in HoF's profitability is dependent upon either an improvement in the company's product offering or in cost-savings initiatives, which each involve execution risks,"" it added.

"It doesn't matter how many awards Ridley Scott's film about the famous kidnap of the oil tycoon John Paul Getty's grandson picks up, it is destined to be remembered for only one thing: the movie star who didn't appear in it. It is called All The Money In The World, but you can't help feeling you're watching another picture, Kevin Spacey's Ghost. The disgraced actor's presence is palpable even though every shred of visual evidence he ever existed in the film lies crumpled up on the cutting room floor. Kevin Spacey as John Paul Getty, before he was replaced over sexual harassment allegations He played John Paul Getty, the richest man in the world, before the grisly accusations against him of sexual harassment started. Overnight he went from A-list star to box office poison, leaving the expedient Scott with little choice but to re-shoot Spacey's 22 scenes with another actor playing the octogenarian billionaire. Enter 88-year-old Christopher Plummer, who with little notice and only nine filming days, takes the role by the scruff of its neck and delivers a Getty that is detached, malevolent, and - at times - vulnerable. Christopher Plummer recast as John Paul Getty, whose scenes were reshot in nine days He does a good job, a great job even, given the circumstances. But he lacks a ruthless coldness that really drives home the film's message, which is just how shocking the corruption of the human soul can be when overwhelmed by enormous wealth and power. And that is a problem. The Spacey scenes might have been reshot at the last minute, but the whole film wasn't remade. The kidnappers call Gail Harris (played by Michelle Williams) and demand $17 million for her son's freedom It is therefore his original, colder performance that sets the tone for how the other actors - most particularly the excellent Michelle Williams as the kidnapped boy's desperate mother - react to his actions in many of their own scenes. So although Spacey isn't ever physically in shot, his presence is. Which is jarring, because the ensemble are playing against a much nastier Getty than the one we see. So, for instance, the level of aversion and disgust Williams' character has for her former father-in-law, which, over time is shared by his security guy, (a bland Mark Wahlberg), never quite rings true. John Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) argues with his morally conflicted fixer, Fletcher Chace (played by Mark Wahlberg) Plummer's Getty is approachable; you sense he could be prevailed upon. Whereas Scott says Spacey played him harder. And we know from recent performances in Baby Driver and House of Cards the chilly nastiness the actor can summon from within. You would think callousness is a necessary character trait for a kidnapper, but not in the case of Cinquanta (Romain Duris), in this movie. Romain Duris plays kidnapper, Cinquanta, who turns out to have a heart He is the crook with more heart than the man from whom he is trying to extort $17million (who is the real baddie sort of thing). While Getty refuses to pay a penny of his 16-year-old grandson's ransom (Charlie Plummer - no relation to Christopher), Cinquanta experiences a reverse Stockholm syndrome and starts to look tenderly over the cocky teenager, he grabbed from the streets of Rome and imprisoned. He does ok. You warm to him as he warms to the boy, but he plays the part too much like a spaghetti western clichÃ© baddie, cheroot and all. His performance is indicative of the film overall, which is good in parts, but never gets anywhere near the heights of past Ridley Scott classics such as Alien, Blade Runner, or Thelma & Louise. Ridley Scott on the set of All The Money In The World The first half flits around all over the place like a fly looking for somewhere to settle. It starts with the kidnap in 1973 in an Antonioni-like Italian evening scene, nips over to druggy Marrakesh in the 60s, goes back to Saudi Arabia in the 40s where Getty made his oil fortune, and then jumps forward to 1971 San Francisco. Priming the canvas is all well and good, but it pales after an hour of short, superficial establishing vignettes. The second hour is much better. After all, there's been far too much dithering. The gangland leader knows what to do. Charlie Plummer plays John Paul Getty's abducted grandson The young lad is going to have to lose his ear to get things moving. From the moment the creepy Mafiosi doctor enters the fray with his scalpel and chloroform to undertake his dastardly deed the movie ratchets up several notches. Suddenly it's all action. The focus narrows, the tension builds; we have lift off. The final thirty minutes are very good. All The Money In The World is a parable about the shortcomings of great wealth and power.  They can't buy you peace of mind. Nor, as we find out, can they protect you from bad people and the ugly side of life. It is a film about a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre that has become its own cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. It will become as notorious as its protagonist's tight-fistedness. Money and power and an entitled man behaving badly are the uniting theme.

"This video can not be played Michael Wolff told the BBC Mr Trump's mental health ""is a subject of concern"" in the White House US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says he has never doubted President Trump's mental health after a new book claimed staff saw him as a child. Author Michael Wolff said White House employees believed Mr Trump's ""mental powers were slipping"". His book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, went on sale early despite the president's attempts to block its publication. Mr Trump says the book is ""boring and untruthful"" and Wolff a ""total loser"". He said it was being pushed by the media and others to hurt him. He added in a tweet: ""They should try winning an election. Sad!"" More bombshell claims from Trump book The debate over Trump's mental health Who is author Michael Wolff? Mr Tillerson - who is alleged to have called Mr Trump a moron last year - told CNN: ""I have no reason to question his mental fitness."" He saidMr Trump was ""not typical of presidents of the past"",external. ""I think that's well recognised. That's also though why the American people chose him,"" he said. On Saturday, Mr Trump will begin two days of talks with senior Republicans to discuss policy priorities for the coming year. In a television interview on Friday, Wolff said ""100% of the people"" around Mr Trump questioned his fitness for office. His book alleges that Mr Trump failed to recognise close friends, and was prone to repeating comments. Wolff said that White House staff described the president as childlike because ""he has the need for immediate gratification. It's all about him... This man does not read, does not listen. He's like a pinball just shooting off the sides."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president said he had not given Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book. But Wolff responded: ""What was I doing there if he didn't want me to be there? I absolutely spoke to the president... It was not off the record."" He said he had spent a total of three hours with Mr Trump, both during the election campaign and after the inauguration. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Wolff said staff had come to realise ""the emperor has no clothes"". It cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump election campaign officials, including Mr Trump's son Donald Jr, as ""treasonous"". This video can not be played Dozens queued for the midnight release of Fire and Fury Both Mr Trump Jr and his father deny that any collusion with Russians to win the election took place. However Mr Bannon is quoted in the book as saying: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The book makes many other claims, including that: The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" The accuracy of some excerpts has been criticised and questioned in US media. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, says BBC North America editor Jon Sopel. Analysis: BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Donald Trump's supporters have seen many a media storm over the past few years, and somehow their man always emerges (relatively) unscathed. The book may be generating considerable heat among the chattering class, but there's little to indicate that its lasting impact will be much more than confirming long-held suspicions of Trump critics and re-enforcing the bunker mentality in the White House. Outside Washington, in places where people don't devoutly follow every permutation of the presidential Twitter feed, the Trump administration is compiling a boast-worthy economic record. Despite some doom-and-gloom predictions following the 2016 election, the stock market has soared. Unemployment remains low. Major corporations are making high-profile moves to at least temporarily boost their workers' paycheques. And the president can start pointing to his party's tax bill as a tangible reason why the economy is humming along. If the current trajectory continues, Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans will be positioned to make the case to voters in the months and years ahead that despite all the drama - the often self-inflicted fire and fury - their agenda is to help Americans where it counts the most, in their pockets. That's the kind of message that can win. More from Anthony: Who are the winners and losers? This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his ""worst enemies"" Mr Trump said Mr Bannon - who was sacked in August - had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position, adding in a tweet that Mr Bannon had cried when he lost his job.

"This video can not be played President Trump: ""We didn't have an interview"" Donald Trump has rejected doubts over his mental health raised in a bombshell new book, describing the book as ""fiction"" and the author as a ""fraud"". His remarks followed an earlier rebuttal on Twitter, in which the president claimed he was a ""very stable genius"" who was ""like, very smart"". Michael Wolff's new book suggests that even the president's closest advisors question his fitness for office. The row has overshadowed key talks on the Republican party's 2018 agenda.

He disputed Mr Wolff's claim of a three-hour on the record interview between the two. ""It didn't exist, it's in his imagination,"" Mr Trump said, while acknowledging that he had been interviewed by the author at some point. Allow Twitter content?

The book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, paints a picture of the president as impatient, unable to grasp policy, and prone to rambling and repeating himself. The fallout from the book has loomed over the Camp David meeting - a gathering of key Republicans designed to thrash out legislative priorities for 2018. More from the book, including Ivanka's presidential ambitions Who are winners and losers in Trump-Bannon row? Mr Trump gave a press conference at the presidential retreat, flanked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Vice-President Mike Pence and other senior Republicans. The president, who has previously derided Camp David and opted instead to stay at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, told reporters that the retreat was a ""very special place"" with a ""feeling you don't have in many places"". While short on detail, the president said the gathered Republicans had ""a couple of incredible meetings"" and discussed ""security, infrastructure, the military, all types of military situations"". On North Korea, he said he hoped rare talks between North and South Korea will go ""beyond the Olympics,"" with the US joining the process at the ""appropriate time."" He said the country would fight the scourge of drug addiction, and praised the success of countries that have treated the problem ""harshly"" - ""those are the ones that have much less difficulty,"" he added. He has previously praised the leader of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, over his drug policy. Mr Duterte has encouraged the extrajudicial executions of drug offenders by police and vigilantes. On immigration, he said he hoped to work with the Democrats on a resolution to Daca, the so-called Dreamers programme for immigrants who came to the US as undocumented children, and reiterated that Mexico would in some way pay for his border wall. Fire and Fury went on sale early on Friday, days ahead of its scheduled release, amid the president lawyers' attempts to block its publication. It has become an instant bestseller. The book describes a Trump team shocked by their own win on election night, White House staffers saying Mr Trump's ""mental powers were slipping"", and senior administration officials calling Mr Trump an ""idiot"". This video can not be played Michael Wolff tells the BBC that Donald Trump's team came to believe he could not function as president It has also sparked a public rift between Mr Trump and his former aide Steve Bannon, who is quoted as accusing Mr Trump's eldest son Donald Jr of ""treasonous"" behaviour in meeting a group of Russians. Mr Bannon and the author have both been the target of the president's ire over the past few days - the former cried when he lost his job last year, Mr Trump said; the latter had written a book ""full of lies"", he added. On Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told CNN that he had ""no reason to question"" Mr Trump's mental fitness. This video can not be played Dozens queued for the release of Fire and Fury Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington Perceived slights, insults and questions about his intelligence. If Donald Trump's recent Twitter feed is any indication, these are the topics on the president's mind as he settles in for the night and when he rises in the morning. Given the daunting tasks facing the administration and Congress in the coming weeks, some of his allies and aides at Camp David may view the president's concerns as misdirected. That Mr Trump feels compelled to respond to criticism, however, should come as little surprise. This is particularly true when the topic is his intellect, the strength of which he frequently boasts. In Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff recounts tales by White House aides of a president with a short attention span, bouncing from issue to issue like a pinball. In recent interviews, the author has said the president's aggressive reaction to his book proves this point. It seems, however, that Mr Trump's counterattack is just getting started.

"This video can not be played Michael Wolff told the BBC Mr Trump's mental health ""is a subject of concern"" in the White House US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says he has never doubted President Trump's mental health after a new book claimed staff saw him as a child. Author Michael Wolff said White House employees believed Mr Trump's ""mental powers were slipping"". His book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, went on sale early despite the president's attempts to block its publication. Mr Trump says the book is ""boring and untruthful"" and Wolff a ""total loser"". He said it was being pushed by the media and others to hurt him. He added in a tweet: ""They should try winning an election. Sad!"" More bombshell claims from Trump book The debate over Trump's mental health Who is author Michael Wolff? Mr Tillerson - who is alleged to have called Mr Trump a moron last year - told CNN: ""I have no reason to question his mental fitness."" He saidMr Trump was ""not typical of presidents of the past"",external. ""I think that's well recognised. That's also though why the American people chose him,"" he said. On Saturday, Mr Trump will begin two days of talks with senior Republicans to discuss policy priorities for the coming year. In a television interview on Friday, Wolff said ""100% of the people"" around Mr Trump questioned his fitness for office. His book alleges that Mr Trump failed to recognise close friends, and was prone to repeating comments. Wolff said that White House staff described the president as childlike because ""he has the need for immediate gratification. It's all about him... This man does not read, does not listen. He's like a pinball just shooting off the sides."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president said he had not given Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book. But Wolff responded: ""What was I doing there if he didn't want me to be there? I absolutely spoke to the president... It was not off the record."" He said he had spent a total of three hours with Mr Trump, both during the election campaign and after the inauguration. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Wolff said staff had come to realise ""the emperor has no clothes"". It cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump election campaign officials, including Mr Trump's son Donald Jr, as ""treasonous"". This video can not be played Dozens queued for the midnight release of Fire and Fury Both Mr Trump Jr and his father deny that any collusion with Russians to win the election took place. However Mr Bannon is quoted in the book as saying: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The book makes many other claims, including that: The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" The accuracy of some excerpts has been criticised and questioned in US media. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, says BBC North America editor Jon Sopel. Analysis: BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Donald Trump's supporters have seen many a media storm over the past few years, and somehow their man always emerges (relatively) unscathed. The book may be generating considerable heat among the chattering class, but there's little to indicate that its lasting impact will be much more than confirming long-held suspicions of Trump critics and re-enforcing the bunker mentality in the White House. Outside Washington, in places where people don't devoutly follow every permutation of the presidential Twitter feed, the Trump administration is compiling a boast-worthy economic record. Despite some doom-and-gloom predictions following the 2016 election, the stock market has soared. Unemployment remains low. Major corporations are making high-profile moves to at least temporarily boost their workers' paycheques. And the president can start pointing to his party's tax bill as a tangible reason why the economy is humming along. If the current trajectory continues, Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans will be positioned to make the case to voters in the months and years ahead that despite all the drama - the often self-inflicted fire and fury - their agenda is to help Americans where it counts the most, in their pockets. That's the kind of message that can win. More from Anthony: Who are the winners and losers? This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his ""worst enemies"" Mr Trump said Mr Bannon - who was sacked in August - had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position, adding in a tweet that Mr Bannon had cried when he lost his job.

"Will Young says he was subjected to homophobic abuse by a bus driver Transport for London has apologised after Will Young said he was subjected to homophobic abuse by a bus driver. The Pop Idol winner said the driver called him a ""poofter"" and has appealed for help in tracking him down. It is understood to have happened on 12 December when Mr Young was driving his car in Fulham. TfL said it was investigating and any form of hate crime was ""completely unacceptable"" and would ""not be tolerated"". Chief executive Steve Burton said: ""We're very sorry to hear of Will Young's experience, and are looking into it urgently. ""Everyone has the right to travel without fear of abuse or intimidation and if anyone witnesses or is victim to hate crime they should report it immediately. ""We work closely with our police partners to eradicate hate crimes and fully investigate all reported incidents."" Mr Young was driving his car at about 12:25 GMT when he became involved in an altercation with the driver of a bus coming towards him on the opposite side of the road, the BBC understands. The singer, who spoke about what inspired him to come out onBBC Radio 4's Frontrow, tweeted that TfL's response had been ""amazing"" but he was unable to obtain CCTV footage from the area. He called on London Mayor Sadiq Khan to help track down the driver to ""ensure he doesn't abuse others"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The dossier alleged that Donald Trump had links with Russia Two senior US senators have called for an investigation into an ex-MI6 officer over a dossier he wrote about President Trump's alleged Russian links. During a senate judiciary committee, the Republicans found that Christopher Steele had passed details from the dossier to ""multiple US news outlets"". This could mean Mr Steele made ""false statements"" when being interviewed by the FBI. They have now given the communications to the US Department of Justice. The dossier claimed Mr Trump had colluded with Russian officials during his election campaign. It also alleged that Kremlin spies filmed the now-President with prostitutes at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2013. A number of official investigations, including one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are looking into the allegations - denied by both Moscow and Mr Trump. Christopher Steele now runs a company in London Chuck Grassley, who chairs the committee, said the decision to refer the case for criminal investigation had not been taken lightly, but he felt he needed to hand it on for ""appropriate review"". He added: ""After reviewing how Mr Steele conducted himself in distributing information contained in the dossier and how many stop signs the DoJ ignored in its use of the dossier, I believe that a special counsel needs to review this matter. ""The rule of law depends on the government and all who work on its behalf playing by the rules themselves. I hope the Department of Justice will carefully review our letter and take appropriate action."" In a joint statement from Mr Grassley and his colleague, Lindsey Graham, who chairs a number of senate subcommittees, the senators said they were not alleging Mr Steele had committed any crime. Rather. they had passed on the information for ""further investigation only"". How did 'compromising' Trump claims come to light? How and why did we get here? The Steele dossier - which became public in January 2017 - was drawn together after an investigation funded by Republicans trying to block Mr Trump from becoming the party's presidential candidate. Democrats then took over funding the investigation after he was nominated. Mr Steele - who founded and runs Orbis Business Intelligence in London - is said to have passed on his findings to both US and UK intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. He briefly went into hiding after he was revealed as its author, but subsequently returned to work. The UK law firm representing Mr Steele declined to comment.

"The scheme forms part of the government's new social mobility action plan The government is to set up 35 ""English hubs"" across the country in an attempt to improve child literacy. The hubs are among a raft of new measures announced by Education Secretary Justine Greening. A Â£5.7m investment will aim to boost literacy skills in 469 schools, whilst a Â£7.7m hopes to develop high quality teaching resources. The schemes form part ofthe government's social mobility action plan, launched last month. 'In school, but learning nothing' Why reading with dad matters The hubs will be set up by a new Centre of Excellence for Literacy Teaching, with a focus on raising standards in schools, They will be similar to the government's ""Maths Hubs"", launched in 2014, which are led by an outstanding school or college and bring together education professionals to develop and spread good practice. Other measures to improve literacy will include ""phonics roadshows,external"" - to promote and improve reading  - and a fund for trialling language development at home in the north of England. Ms Greening said: ""Our ambition is that no community will be left behind on education. ""Today's literacy investment will help make sure that not just most, but every child arrives at school with the vocabulary levels they need to learn.

"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House is already topping online best seller charts before its release A book released by journalist Michael Wolff has already started grabbing headlines around the world. US President Donald Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has rebuffed Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House as ""trashy tabloid fiction"". But Wolff says he had high levels of access, conducting more than 200 interviews with Mr Trump and his staff across 18 months. The president's lawyers are seeking to stop the book's release on Tuesday. In an interview with NBC's Today show, the author said Mr Trump's staff regard the president as they would an infant. ""I will tell you the one description that everyone gave, everyone has in common. They all say he is like a child. ""And what they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification, it is all about him."" The president ""does not read, does not listen"", he added. ""He's like a pinball just shooting off the sides."" He also rejected White House claims he had not spoken to the president and that the book was full of lies. ""My window into Donald Trump is pretty significant,"" he said, adding that he was comfortable with everything reported. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michael Wolff, 64, has written regular columns for publications including New York magazine and Vanity Fair. His style is typically to give readers glimpses of the inner workings of a subject, often media organisations, and the moguls behind them. Some of his writing has proved controversial, with subjects publicly disputing his reporting. 11 explosive claims in new Trump book Wolff's book says Mr Trump and his campaign did not expect to win the election He was previously best known for his biography of Rupert Murdoch, titled The Man Who Owns the News, which was released in 2008. After winning national awards for his reporting,he was described in a 2004 profile in The New Republic as the ""It Boy of New York media"",external. The writer Michelle Cottle tried to characterise his writing style by speaking to him and other journalists who knew him. ""Even Wolff acknowledges that conventional reporting isn't his bag,"" she wrote in the cover story. ""Rather, he absorbs the atmosphere and gossip swirling around him at cocktail parties, on the street, and especially during those long lunches."" Wolff explained the context of the White House tell-all inexcerpts released to New York magazine,externalon Wednesday, before penninga second piece for the Hollywood Reporter,external, released on Thursday. The author alleges he was able to take up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" after he interviewed Mr Trump in June 2016. He said the president had encouraged the idea himself,writing that ""Trump seemed to say, knock yourself out"",external. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said ""a lot of things"" released so far are ""completely untrue"" He says there were no ground rules placed on his access and that he was not required to make promises on his reporting, making for a ""front row view of Trump's presidency"". But some of the excerpts from the book that have been released have already been criticised and questioned. Wolff has acknowledged the difficulty with the book's sourcing, saying interviewees went on and off the record sporadically or ""would provide accounts in confidence, only to subsequently share their views widely"". In the Hollywood Reporter,Wolff revealed his opinion that Mr Trump's White House was divided by a ""near-violent factional war"",external. He said his ""indelible impression"" was that staff, including Mr Trump's family, ""all - 100 percent - came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job"". Janice Min, strategist at Eldridge Industries and part owner of the Hollywood Reporter, confirmed excerpts about conversations between Roger Ailes and Steve Bannon at a private dinner party in New York City. Ms Min appeared on CNN and MSNBC to discuss details of the party and has called the book's account ""absolutely accurate"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

News website Axios reports thatthe author may have taped dozens of hours of interviews for the book,external, including with former White House strategist Steve Bannon and former deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh. Quotes attributed to Mr Bannon in Wolff's book prompted Mr Trump's lawyers to issue him with a cease-and-desist order, accusing him of violating a non-disclosure agreement and defaming the president. Mr Trump has hit out at Mr Bannon, saying he ""lost his mind"" when he lost his job People have started poking holes in some of the harder-to-believe anecdotes. One passage, released in New York magazine, implies the president did not know who former House speaker John Boehner was when former Fox News head Roger Ailes recommended him for the position of Mr Trump's chief of staff. But as the Washington Post points out, Donald Trump had previously golfed with him,external, and tweeted about Mr Boehner multiple times. Allow Twitter content?

FormerUK Prime Minister Tony Blair has described an allegation about him in the book as ""absurd"" and ""a complete fabrication"".According to The Times newspaper, Wolff says Mr Blair shared a ""juicy rumour"" with Mr Trump's son-in-law that the UK government had his campaign under surveillance. Mr Blair denied to BBC Radio 4 that he had any conversation with Jared Kushner A billionaire friend of Donald Trump,Thomas Barrack Jnr, has also denied a quote attributed to him by Wolff,external, telling a New York Times reporter that he never said Mr Trump was ""not only crazy, he's stupid."" There is also an incorrect claim in the book that CNN last year broadcast salacious contents of the Russian dossier concerning Mr Trump. In fact, CNN was careful to withhold such details at the time. Trump's 'Russian dossier' â what we know and what we don't NBC's political reporter posted an extract from Wolff's introduction,external, which addresses the inherent problem that a lot of stories coming from the White House conflict with one another: ""Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue. Those conflicts, and that looseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of the book. Sometimes I have let the players offer their versions, in turn allowing the reader to judge them. In other instances I have, through a consistency in accounts and through sources I have come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true."" Allow Twitter content?

So the book may make an interesting and compelling read but the stories inside are taken from recollections and opinions of people who spoke to Wolff, rather than being indisputable fact. Whether Melania Trump really was in tears on election night or Ivanka Trump really did mock her father's ""comb-over"" and has presidential ambitions of her own may never be known. Either way, people seem to want to read the book. It has already reached the top of Amazon's best sellers' chart, days before its official release.

"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger Jon Venables, one of the killers of toddler James Bulger nearly 25 years ago, has been charged over indecent images of children. The 35-year-old, who served eight years for the murder of James, aged two, in 1993, was recalled to prison last year. He and Robert Thompson abducted, tortured and killed the toddler in Liverpool when they were both aged 10. They were released on licence in 2001, meaning they can be recalled to jail at any time if they breach the conditions. Both were given new identities and reporting restrictions mean that Venables' current name, or anything else that could lead to his identification, will remain secret when his case is heard. On 12 February 1993, James - just a few weeks short of his third birthday - was reported missing by his mother from outside a butcher's shop in the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle. CCTV images showed him being lured away by Venables and Thompson. His body was found two days later on a railway line. He had been partially stripped and beaten to death with bricks and a metal bar. Thompson and Venables were arrested and charged within days and convicted in November of the same year at Preston Crown Court. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 In 2001, the pair were released on licence from secure children's homes - and granted lifelong anonymity with new identities. In September 2008, Venables was arrested on suspicion of affray after a drunken brawl and was given a formal warning by the probation service for breaching the good behaviour terms of his licence. Later the same year he was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small amount of the Class A drug. And in 2010, Venables was sent back to jail for two years after pleading guilty to charges of downloading and distributing indecent images of children and breaching his parole conditions by visiting Merseyside. He was released again in 2013 with a second new identity. When news of the 35-year-old's latest arrest emerged last year, James's mother Denise Fergus said: ""Venables has now proved beyond any doubt what a vile, perverted psychopath he has always been."" The Attorney General launched an investigation into claims his identity had been revealed on social media. In 2013, two men who posted images they claimed were of Venables and Thompson were given nine-month sentences, suspended for 15 months. Breaking the injunction that bans identifying the pair carries a punishment of up to two years in prison. A CPS spokesman said: ""The man formerly known as Jon Venables has been charged with offences relating to indecent images of children. ""In order that justice can be done, no further details are being released at this stage and the proceedings are subject to reporting restrictions.""

"Anne Noblett disappeared after getting a bus home from a dance class Police say they are looking into possible new leads in the unsolved killing of a teenage girl 60 years ago. Anne Noblett, 17, was found dead in woodland near Whitwell, Hertfordshire, on 31 January 1958, 32 days after she went missing. Detectives have reviewed the case a number of times but have been unable to identify her killer. Hertfordshire Police said six people had responded to an anniversary appeal with potential information. The 'Deep Freeze' murder: Who killed Anne Noblett? ""Inquiries are ongoing to fully explore the information they have to share,"" a spokesman said. Anne disappeared while returning home to Marshalls Heath Lane in Wheathampstead after attending a dance class in Harpenden. She had taken a bus home and got off at Cherry Tree Corner. This was the last time she was seen alive and it is believed she was murdered within hours of her disappearance. The cause of her death was strangulation and it is thought Anne's body was stored before being moved to dense woodland in Rose Grove Woods, known locally as Young's Wood in Horn Hill. Scotland Yard was involved in the search for Anne's killer Due to the condition of the body when it was found, it was considered she may have been held in cold storage for some time. It led to the press dubbing her killing the Deep Freeze murder. Her family remains desperate to understand what happened to her, police said. The case has been reviewed several times, including as recently as February last year. Mick Flavin, of Hertfordshire Police cold case team, has appealed for witnesses to get in touch Mick Flavin, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire case review team, has admitted there is a good chance Anne's killer might be dead. ""Six decades later, we are appealing for anyone who may have information but may not have felt that they could come to police earlier to please get in touch,"" he said.

"It is a question that has dogged Donald Trump - fairly or otherwise - since he was elected president: is he mentally fit for office? The question has been raised again by the release of a new book by New York journalist Michael Wolff, which chronicles the first year of the Trump White House. The book - the accuracy of which has been disputed by the White House and queried by others - paints the president as impatient and unable to focus, prone to rambling and repeating himself. Mr Trump has hit back against Mr Wolff's account, claiming on Twitter to be a ""very stable genius"" whose ""two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart"". But the president's manner and speaking style have led to armchair diagnoses of a host of ailments, from Alzheimer's to narcissistic personality disorder - a controversial practice that has divided the medical profession.

The current flurry of speculation has been triggered by the book Fire and Fury, in which Mr Wolff writes that during the course of his access to the White House preparing the book, he witnessed people around President Trump become aware that ""his mental powers were slipping"". During the marketing campaign for the book, Mr Wolff said Mr Trump, 71, repeated himself often. Repetition can be caused by poor short-term memory, as well as by other factors. It can be a sign of dementia, which affects 5-8% of people aged 60 and over worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. ""Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions,"" wrote Mr Wolff.,external""It used to be inside of 30 minutes he'd repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories - now it was within 10 minutes."" Mr Wolff did not give any other context for the alleged repetitions. Mr Trump has blasted the book, calling it ""phony"" and ""full of lies"" and saying he did not authorise any access to the White House for Mr Wolff. Critics of the book have also questioned its sourcing. They have asked whether Wolff himself witnessed the events he describes, and called some of its content gossip. Allow Twitter content?

Psychologists had previously speculated about symptoms they purported to see in Mr Trump's behaviour. Several books came out on the topic within months of the Trump inauguration: The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump by Bandy X Lee, Twilight of American Sanity by Allen Frances and Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen. Dr Lee, who is a psychiatry professor at Yale, told a group of mostly-Democrat senators last month that Mr Trump was ""going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs"". But it's worth remembering that none of these people have treated Mr Trump, nor do they have close-up information on his state of mind. Anyone who has treated him would be going against ethics standards and, in most cases, federal law if they disclosed any details. In theory it could cost Mr Trump his job. Under the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, if the president is deemed to be ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"", the vice-president takes over. His cabinet and the vice-president together would need to kick-start the process, so it's unlikely to happen, however many voices call for it. This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Yes - presidents have suffered from mental ill health going right back to Abraham Lincoln, whose clinical depression prompted several breakdowns. More recently Ronald Reagan, who was president from 1981 to 1989, suffered confusion and seemed unsure of where he was at times - he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's five years after he left office. The 25th amendment has never been used to depose a sitting president. It is worth reiterating, there is no real evidence as nobody speaking publicly has examined the president. But some have suggested thatMr Trump may have symptoms which would point to Narcissistic Personality Disorder,external(NPD). People with this condition often show some three key characteristics,external, according to Psychology Today: Grandiosity, a lack of empathy for other people and a need for admiration They believe they are superior or may deserve special treatment They seek excessive admiration and attention, and struggle with criticism or defeat But the man who wrote the diagnostic criteria for NPD, Allen Frances, said a lack of obvious distress stopped him from saying Mr Trump had the condition. ""Mr Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy,"" he wrote. Experts debate Trump's mental health Trump like a child, says defiant author Wolff's book has prompted some to ask if Mr Trump might be suffering from cognitive decline. Repetition of stories and the way Mr Trump speaks have been put forward to back up the claims. Whenneurological experts compared clips of Mr Trump in the past with more recent footage,external, they found his manner of speaking had totally changed. In the past he spoke in long and complicated sentences, following thoughts through and using long adjectives while in more recent clips, he used fewer and shorter words, missed words out, rambled, and was more likely to use superlatives like ""the best"". In one instance during a speech in December, Trump lifted a glass awkwardly, with both hands This could be due to a neurological condition like Alzheimer's, some experts said, or it could be a symptom of nothing more sinister than age. Those who say the president is concealing cognitive decline point to a few other incidences where he seemed not to have full control over his own movements. There was one instance in December where he was giving a speech and lifted a glass awkwardly, with both hands. During another speech,he slurred through some of his words,external, which the White House blamed on a dry throat but some said could be a sign of something more serious. This video can not be played Viewers were left amazed at parts of Trump's Jerusalem announcement Motor function is driven by the brain's frontal lobe, which loses volume with age but also gets affected by a specific, relatively rare, type of dementia. According to the UK's National Health Service,external(NHS), frontotemporal dementia has symptoms including ""acting inappropriately or impulsively"", ""appearing selfish or unsympathetic"", ""overeating"", ""getting distracted easily"" and ""struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word"". Next week the president will undergo his first medical examination - a physical - since taking office. Well, there's the question. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press spokeswoman, said: ""It's disgraceful and laughable. ""If he was unfit, he probably wouldn't be sitting there, wouldn't have defeated the most qualified group of candidates the Republican Party has ever seen."" Some Republican lawmakers have dismissed the concerns as a partisan attack. Representatives Duncan Hunter of California and Mike Simpson of Idaho were said to have ""burst out laughing"" in February last year when told by news website The Hill that the Democrats were raising such questions. (Mr Simpson did say it was fair to question the president's ""judgment"",external, however.) But others have been more scathing. Following in the footsteps of Jeb Bush's assertion during the race for the presidency that ""the guy needs therapy"", Tennessee senatorBob Corker said in August that Mr Trump had not demonstrated the ""stability"" he needed,externalfor the role. Dr Frances previously said the debate was unfair - but to people suffering from mental illnesses. ""Bad behaviour is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely,"" he said. ""It is a stigmatising insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr Trump (who is neither)."" Others have echoed this, withone columnist saying the debate would ""make people with mental-health needs more likely to stay closeted,external"". But professionals who have given their opinion on Mr Trump's psychological state say they have done so in order to warn the nation. In speaking out they have in fact broken their industry's own ethics - the decades-old Goldwater Rule prohibits psychiatrists from giving diagnosis about someone they have not personally evaluated. It was instated after a magazine asked thousands of experts in 1964 whether Republican nominee Barry Goldwater was psychologically fit to be president. He successfully sued the magazine's editor for libel after the results were published. The APA warned during the campaign that breaking the rule in trying to analyse the candidates in the presidential election was ""irresponsible, potentially stigmatising, and definitely unethical"". Given the rule against diagnosing from afar, some argue that there should be a system in place for diagnosing Mr Trump up close. ""A president could be actively hallucinating,external,"" writes the Atlantic, ""threatening to launch a nuclear attack based on intelligence he had just obtained from David Bowie, and the medical community could be relegated to speculation from afar."" In fact there is a law in the works for a committee to be required to assess the president's health - the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity (OCPC) Act. And despite the amount of space given to the topic of the president's mental health, many commentators recoil from it.Carlos Lozada writes in the Washington Post that this is reductive,external: ""There is something too simple about dismissing his misdeeds as signs of mental illness; it almost exonerates him, and us."" Former Harvard Law Schoolprofessor Alan Dershowitz says this approach is ""just dangerous"",external, writing: ""If we don't like someone's politics we rail against him, we campaign against him, we don't use the psychiatric system against him,"" He said people who thought the 25th Amendment would end the Trump presidency were putting ""hope over reality"". Only a ""major psychotic break"" would result in that, he said. Who is author of explosive Trump book?

"Mr Trump sits at the White House Resolute Desk in the Oval Office Donald Trump was ""befuddled"" by his election win, did not enjoy his inauguration and was scared of the White House, according to a new book. Journalist Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House also purports to lift the lid on Ivanka Trump's secret presidential ambitions. The book details Mr Trump's regard for media titan Rupert Murdoch, though the admiration was apparently not mutual. The White House said the book was full of ""false and misleading accounts"". Michael Wolff says his work is based on more than 200 interviews and that he took up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" following the president's inauguration for a close-up insight into the fledgling administration. Here are 11 of the book's revelations, with commentary from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. According to the book, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon thought a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a group of Russians was ""treasonous"". The Russians had offered Donald Trump Jr damaging information on Hillary Clinton at the June 2016 meeting. This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon Wolff writes that Bannon told him of the meeting: ""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."" Bannon reportedly said the Justice Department investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow would focus on money laundering, adding: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Anthony Zurcher:In just a few sentences, Bannon manages to detonate a bomb under the White House's efforts to downplay the significance of that fateful June meeting in Trump Tower and their attempt to dismiss Robert Mueller's inquiry as a partisan witchhunt. It's bad, Bannon is saying, and even more unforgivably it was stupid. Taking aim at Mr Trump's own family in the most personal terms makes it all the more biting. In an article for NYMag,externaladapted from his book, Wolff describes the amazement - and dismay - in the Trump camp at his November 2016 election win. ""Shortly after 8pm on Election Night, when the unexpected trend - Trump might actually win - seemed confirmed, Don Jr told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy. There was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon's not unamused observation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a horrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: Suddenly, Donald Trump became a man who believed that he deserved to be, and was wholly capable of being, the president of the United States."" AZ:This is decidedly different from what has been recited by the Trump circle since election night. While campaign hands - at least the less-than-dedicated ones - may have been positioning themselves for a soft landing after a defeat, Mr Trump and his close allies believed in their success. A ""horrified Trump"" was never part of the script. The president and first lady Wolff writes: ""Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He was angry that A-level stars had snubbed the event, disgruntled with the accommodations at Blair House, and visibly fighting with his wife, who seemed on the verge of tears. Throughout the day, he wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and pissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed."" But the first lady's office rejected the claims. Communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Mrs Trump supported her husband's decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did."" AZ:These words tell the same story as the viral video clip of a stone-faced Melania forcing a smile when the president looks her way. It also explains why Mr Trump was so insistent about the success of his inauguration and the size of his crowds. He felt slighted and aggrieved and was acting accordingly. According to another excerpt from the book, obtained by US media, Mr Trump used to boast that sleeping with his friends' wives made ""life worth living"". ""In pursuing a friend's wife, he would try to persuade the wife that her husband was perhaps not what she thought,""Wolff quotes a Trump friend as saying. He would invite the wife to secretly listen on speakerphone to a conversation that Mr Trump would have in his office with her husband, according to the book. Mr Trump would allegedly engage in sexual banter with the husband in the hope that he might say something indiscreet, asking questions such as:""Do you still like having sex with your wife? How often?"" Wolff writes: ""Trump, in fact, found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary. He retreated to his own bedroom - the first time since the Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms. In the first days, he ordered two television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door, precipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the room."" AZ:For much of his adult life, Mr Trump has lived according to his own rules, as a real-estate tycoon whose wealth allowed his every whim or idiosyncrasy to be accommodated. Adjusting to the White House - which Bill Clinton once referred to as the ""crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system"" and Harry Truman called ""the great white jail"" - must have been quite a shock. Mr Trump's daughter and her husband Jared Kushner allegedly struck a deal that she might run for president in future, according to Wolff: Mr Trump pats his pregnant daughter Ivanka during his 2016 campaign ""Balancing risk against reward, both Jared and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she'd be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump. Bannon, who had coined the term 'Jarvanka' that was now in ever greater use in the White House, was horrified when the couple's deal was reported to him."" AZ:The feud between Bannon and ""Jarvanka"" was no secret, and it certainly wasn't surprising. In a way, the couple represented to Bannon everything he's fighting against - East Coast elitism and entitlement. Yet, thanks to familial ties, they had the president's ear and - this new book claims - harboured dynastic hopes. The US first daughter poked fun at her father's alleged ""scalp-reduction surgery"", according to the book. ""She treated her father with a degree of detachment, even irony, going so far as to make fun of his comb-over to others. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate - a contained island after scalp-reduction -surgery - surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men - the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color."" AZ:It wouldn't be particularly surprising if this is one of the anecdotes that Mr Trump finds most irksome. The president is proud of his hair, and once notably let late-night host Jimmy Fallon ruffle it to establish its authenticity. On windy days, Mr Trump usually wears a hat - the origin of the Make America Great Again ball cap - to ensure there are no coiffing malfunctions. The hair is as much a part of the Trump brand as big hotels and gold-plated escalators. Katie Walsh, the White House deputy chief of staff, asked Mr Kushner, the president's senior adviser, what the administration wanted to achieve. But according to the book, Mr Kushner did not have an answer. ""'Just give me the three things the president wants to focus on,' she [Katie Walsh] demanded. 'What are the three priorities of this White House?' It was the most basic question imaginable - one that any qualified presidential candidate would have answered long before he took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six weeks into Trump's presidency, Kushner was wholly without an answer. 'Yes,' he said to Walsh. 'We should probably have that conversation.'"" AZ:It often takes a new administration a bit of time to find its footing. In Mr Trump's case, the situation was particularly acute. Having campaigned on some clear policy items - strengthened borders, renegotiated trade deals, a sweeping tax cut and Obamacare repeal - prioritising was clearly a challenge. Once in the White House, he allowed Congress to kick off with healthcare reform, and the difficulties achieving that goal haunted the Trump presidency for nearly a year. Wolff, who previously wrote a biography of Rupert Murdoch, describes Mr Trump's high regard for the News Corp media titan. ""Rupert Murdoch, who had promised to pay a call on the president-elect, was running late. When some of the guests made a move to leave, an increasingly agitated Trump assured them that Rupert was on his way. 'He's one of the greats, the last of the greats,' Trump said. 'You have to stay to see him.' Not grasping that he was now the most powerful man in the world, Trump was still trying mightily to curry favor with a media mogul who had long disdained him as a charlatan and fool."" AZ:During the campaign, Mr Trump had at times feuded with Murdoch's Fox News - fighting with presenter Megyn Kelly, boycotting the network and skipping a Fox-broadcast primary debate. The president, however, is one of Fox News' biggest fans - and the network has become his greatest advocate since his inauguration. Mr Trump is said to regularly speak with Mr Murdoch on the phone But the admiration was not mutual, according to Wolff's account of a call between Mr Murdoch and Mr Trump about the president's meeting with Silicon Valley executives. Mr Trump is said to have told Mr Murdoch: ""'These guys really need my help. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an opportunity for me to help them.' 'Donald,' said Murdoch, 'for eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They practically ran the administration. They don't need your help.' 'Take this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.'Murdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas, which open America's doors to select immigrants, might be hard to square with his promises to build a wall and close the borders. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring Murdoch, 'We'll figure it out.' 'What a f****** idiot,' said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone."" AZ:There's sometimes been a disconnect between Mr Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and his action as a businessman, where his companies often relied on immigrant labour. Perhaps the president-elect was reflecting his business sensibilities. Or maybe, in this case, he was simply echoing the opinion of the last group of people who had met with him - a criticism that has been lobbed his way on more than one occasion. Michael Flynn emerges from a plea hearing in a Washington DC courtroom Former US National Security Adviser Mike Flynn knew that accepting money from Moscow for a speech could come back to haunt him, according to the book. Wolff writes that before the election Mr Flynn ""had been told by friends that it had not been a good idea to take $45,000 from the Russians for a speech. 'Well it would only be a problem if we won,' he assured them."" Mr Flynn has been indicted in the Justice Department special counsel's inquiry. AZ:Like Paul Manafort, Flynn was one of the members of the Trump campaign's inner circle whose prior affairs were not ordered in a way that would, shall we say, stand up to close legal scrutiny. If Mr Trump had been defeated, that probably wouldn't have mattered. Like the protagonists in the film The Producers, however, their success was their undoing. Russia-Trump: Who's who?

"Will Young says he was subjected to homophobic abuse by a bus driver Transport for London has apologised after Will Young said he was subjected to homophobic abuse by a bus driver. The Pop Idol winner said the driver called him a ""poofter"" and has appealed for help in tracking him down. It is understood to have happened on 12 December when Mr Young was driving his car in Fulham. TfL said it was investigating and any form of hate crime was ""completely unacceptable"" and would ""not be tolerated"". Chief executive Steve Burton said: ""We're very sorry to hear of Will Young's experience, and are looking into it urgently. ""Everyone has the right to travel without fear of abuse or intimidation and if anyone witnesses or is victim to hate crime they should report it immediately. ""We work closely with our police partners to eradicate hate crimes and fully investigate all reported incidents."" Mr Young was driving his car at about 12:25 GMT when he became involved in an altercation with the driver of a bus coming towards him on the opposite side of the road, the BBC understands. The singer, who spoke about what inspired him to come out onBBC Radio 4's Frontrow, tweeted that TfL's response had been ""amazing"" but he was unable to obtain CCTV footage from the area.

"It doesn't matter how many awards Ridley Scott's film about the famous kidnap of the oil tycoon John Paul Getty's grandson picks up, it is destined to be remembered for only one thing: the movie star who didn't appear in it. It is called All The Money In The World, but you can't help feeling you're watching another picture, Kevin Spacey's Ghost. The disgraced actor's presence is palpable even though every shred of visual evidence he ever existed in the film lies crumpled up on the cutting room floor. Kevin Spacey as John Paul Getty, before he was replaced over sexual harassment allegations He played John Paul Getty, the richest man in the world, before the grisly accusations against him of sexual harassment started. Overnight he went from A-list star to box office poison, leaving the expedient Scott with little choice but to re-shoot Spacey's 22 scenes with another actor playing the octogenarian billionaire. Enter 88-year-old Christopher Plummer, who with little notice and only nine filming days, takes the role by the scruff of its neck and delivers a Getty that is detached, malevolent, and - at times - vulnerable. Christopher Plummer recast as John Paul Getty, whose scenes were reshot in nine days He does a good job, a great job even, given the circumstances. But he lacks a ruthless coldness that really drives home the film's message, which is just how shocking the corruption of the human soul can be when overwhelmed by enormous wealth and power. And that is a problem. The Spacey scenes might have been reshot at the last minute, but the whole film wasn't remade. The kidnappers call Gail Harris (played by Michelle Williams) and demand $17 million for her son's freedom It is therefore his original, colder performance that sets the tone for how the other actors - most particularly the excellent Michelle Williams as the kidnapped boy's desperate mother - react to his actions in many of their own scenes. So although Spacey isn't ever physically in shot, his presence is. Which is jarring, because the ensemble are playing against a much nastier Getty than the one we see. So, for instance, the level of aversion and disgust Williams' character has for her former father-in-law, which, over time is shared by his security guy, (a bland Mark Wahlberg), never quite rings true. John Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) argues with his morally conflicted fixer, Fletcher Chace (played by Mark Wahlberg) Plummer's Getty is approachable; you sense he could be prevailed upon. Whereas Scott says Spacey played him harder. And we know from recent performances in Baby Driver and House of Cards the chilly nastiness the actor can summon from within. You would think callousness is a necessary character trait for a kidnapper, but not in the case of Cinquanta (Romain Duris), in this movie. Romain Duris plays kidnapper, Cinquanta, who turns out to have a heart He is the crook with more heart than the man from whom he is trying to extort $17million (who is the real baddie sort of thing). While Getty refuses to pay a penny of his 16-year-old grandson's ransom (Charlie Plummer - no relation to Christopher), Cinquanta experiences a reverse Stockholm syndrome and starts to look tenderly over the cocky teenager, he grabbed from the streets of Rome and imprisoned. He does ok. You warm to him as he warms to the boy, but he plays the part too much like a spaghetti western clichÃ© baddie, cheroot and all. His performance is indicative of the film overall, which is good in parts, but never gets anywhere near the heights of past Ridley Scott classics such as Alien, Blade Runner, or Thelma & Louise. Ridley Scott on the set of All The Money In The World The first half flits around all over the place like a fly looking for somewhere to settle. It starts with the kidnap in 1973 in an Antonioni-like Italian evening scene, nips over to druggy Marrakesh in the 60s, goes back to Saudi Arabia in the 40s where Getty made his oil fortune, and then jumps forward to 1971 San Francisco. Priming the canvas is all well and good, but it pales after an hour of short, superficial establishing vignettes. The second hour is much better. After all, there's been far too much dithering. The gangland leader knows what to do. Charlie Plummer plays John Paul Getty's abducted grandson The young lad is going to have to lose his ear to get things moving. From the moment the creepy Mafiosi doctor enters the fray with his scalpel and chloroform to undertake his dastardly deed the movie ratchets up several notches. Suddenly it's all action. The focus narrows, the tension builds; we have lift off. The final thirty minutes are very good. All The Money In The World is a parable about the shortcomings of great wealth and power.  They can't buy you peace of mind. Nor, as we find out, can they protect you from bad people and the ugly side of life. It is a film about a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre that has become its own cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. It will become as notorious as its protagonist's tight-fistedness. Money and power and an entitled man behaving badly are the uniting theme.

"Will Young says he was subjected to homophobic abuse by a bus driver Transport for London has apologised after Will Young said he was subjected to homophobic abuse by a bus driver. The Pop Idol winner said the driver called him a ""poofter"" and has appealed for help in tracking him down. It is understood to have happened on 12 December when Mr Young was driving his car in Fulham. TfL said it was investigating and any form of hate crime was ""completely unacceptable"" and would ""not be tolerated"". Chief executive Steve Burton said: ""We're very sorry to hear of Will Young's experience, and are looking into it urgently. ""Everyone has the right to travel without fear of abuse or intimidation and if anyone witnesses or is victim to hate crime they should report it immediately. ""We work closely with our police partners to eradicate hate crimes and fully investigate all reported incidents."" Mr Young was driving his car at about 12:25 GMT when he became involved in an altercation with the driver of a bus coming towards him on the opposite side of the road, the BBC understands. The singer, who spoke about what inspired him to come out onBBC Radio 4's Frontrow, tweeted that TfL's response had been ""amazing"" but he was unable to obtain CCTV footage from the area. He called on London Mayor Sadiq Khan to help track down the driver to ""ensure he doesn't abuse others"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The biggest anti-government protests in Iran for nearly a decade have been fuelled by rising discontent, in particular over the cost of living. Here are six charts that help explain the hardships faced by ordinary Iranians. Iran's economy was badly affected for several years by sanctions imposed by the international community over the country's nuclear programme. Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 1.4% in 2015 - the year President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, agreed with world powers to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities. In 2016, after the deal was implemented and most sanctions were lifted, the economy bounced back sharply and GDP grew 12.3%, according to the Central Bank of Iran.Much of that growth was attributed to the oil and gas industry,external. Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said growth had begun to spread to the non-oil sector,external, and predicted that GDP would expand by 4.2% in the 2017/18 fiscal year. The recovery has nevertheless not been as significant as many Iranians hoped. Analysts point to the fact that US sanctions on financial transactions with Iran have remained in place, which has deterred foreign companies from doing business there.And in October, US President Donald Trump refused to recertify the nuclear dealand called on Congress to consider restoring sanctions. Inflation has fluctuated greatly in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979. In 2013, the rate hit 31% as the economic sanctions reduced Iran's oil revenue and led to its currency, the rial, being devalued by more than 450%. Inflation has steadily decreased under Mr Rouhani. In 2016 it was 11%, according to the Central Bank of Iran. The World Bank expects inflation to remain below 12% over the next three years. Mr Rouhani has proposed a budget for the fiscal year starting in March 2018 that would see expenditure rise about 6% to $104bn. However, that would represent a cut in real terms at the current inflation rate. The official unemployment rate is 12.4%, but in some parts of the country it is more than 60%, according to Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli. Young people - more than half of the population of 79.9 million is under 30 - are among the worst affected. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that 26.7% of 15-24 year olds are unemployed. Underemployment is also high - 12.4% - among 15-24 year olds, according to the ILO. The IMF has warned that despite the high economic growth rate, not enough jobs are being created to absorb the large number of people entering the labour market. Analysts say that is because most of the recovery can be attributed to the oil industry, which is not labour-intensive. Smartphones have played an important role in the current protests. People used the messaging app Telegram, which has millions of users in Iran, to organise protests and share videos and photographs taken with their phone cameras. When Telegram refused to suspend popular channels, the Iranian authorities blocked access to the app. In 2009, when millions of people took to the streets of Tehran to demand the re-run of a disputed presidential election, there were some 55m mobile subscriptions in Iran. However, only about 2% are believed to have been for smartphones. Today, there are more than 80m mobile subscriptions and 41% of households are estimated to have access to at least one smartphone. A recent investigation by BBC Persian found that on average,Iranians have become 15% poorer in real terms over the past decade. The World Bank says that poverty in Iran fell between 2009 and 2013 to about 8%,external, although it increased to 10.5% in 2014 - President Rouhani's first year in office. It estimates that 8.2 million people were living on less than $5.50 per day in 2014. About 2%, or 196,000 people, were living on less than $1.90. Low-income families are dependent on a monthly cash transfer from the government worth about $13 that some 77 million Iranians receive.Mr Rouhani's draft budget would cut the payments by $5.3bn in total,external, which would reportedly affect 30 million people on higher incomes. He also proposed raising the price of petrol by 50%, from $0.30 per litre to $0.45. The consumption of bread, milk and red meat in Iranian households had decreased by between 30% and 50% over the past 10 years, according to BBC Persian. With Iranians becoming poorer in real terms and the prices of many basic foodstuffs increasing by about 40% in the past year, many people simply cannot afford to buy as much food. A 50% rise in the price of eggs - the result of a nationwide hen shortage caused by an outbreak of bird flu - was reportedly a trigger for the protest in Mashhad, the first in the latest unrest which quickly spread across the country. BBC Persian service's Behrang Tajdin contributed to this story. An unpredictable challenge for Iran New protests as Iran plays down unrest Clashes erupt in western Iran town.

"This video can not be played Cars frozen in floodwaters in Revere, Massachusetts North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking freeze in the wake of a deadly ""bomb cyclone"" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In parts of US and Canada, temperatures were forecast to fall below -20F (-29C), with wind chill making it feel more like -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Canada, high winds have knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia. Thousands of snow ploughs are clearing roads across the US East Coast. The extreme weather has so far been linked to up to 19 deaths in the US and two more in Canada, according to reports. Four deaths were reported in traffic accidents in North and South Carolina. Further fatalities occurred in Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas. Travellers at New York's JFK airport reported chaos at terminals on Friday and Saturday, and hours-long waits in aircraft stranded waiting for a gate. One passenger tweeted to say people were calling the police and threatening to break the doors open after hours waiting aboard a flight from Montreal. Allow Twitter content?

Amid the chaos at JFK, two passenger jets collided early on Saturday, according to officials from the Port Authority, which manages the airport. The right wing of a China Southern plane struck the tail of a Kuwait airliner. Both aircraft were damaged but no injuries were reported. In a separate incident,two planes collided at Toronto's Pearson airport late on Friday night, sparking a fire on one aircraft and requiring passengers to evacuate via emergency slides in the cold. The frozen Hudson River in New York City on America's East Coast Residents of Boston, Massachusetts, clear the streets after heavy snowfall The record-breaking cold comes just days after a phenomenon described as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought heavy snowfall to a wide area along the US East Coast, as well as hurricane-force winds. The National Weather Service (NWS) said on Saturday it expected dangerously low temperatures to last into Monday, as an arctic surge brought freezing air down from the North North Pole. ""An arctic outbreak will keep temperatures 20F to 30F degrees below average across the north-eastern US,"" the NWS said, adding that there was a ""chance for many daily temperature records to be broken"". Watch: What caused the US storm? New Hampshire's Mount Washington, which boasts of having the ""world's worst weather"", experienced record low wind-chill temperatures of -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Massachusetts, residents of Boston, which received over 1ft (30cm) of snowfall, were clearing the streets with shovels. Boston harbour's tide gauge matched its record at 15.1ft - previously set during the great blizzard of 1978. Flooding affected the city's newly renovated seaport district and deluged a downtown subway station, and giant waves saw freezing floodwaters inundate parts of the New England coast. Mayor Marty Walsh blamed climate change. ""If anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,"" he said. Temperatures were forecast to plunge below -20F (-29C) in parts The storm has so far forced hundreds of schools and businesses to close in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Panicked New York City residents rushed to shops before the snow came, clearing shelves of milk, eggs, and kale, the New York Times reported. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida, wherethe cold snap has caused iguanas to lose their grip and fall from trees. Natural gas prices in the US north-east have risen to an all-time high, driven by demand for heating fuel. In Philadelphia, a car was unable to stop at a railway line at the bottom of a steep hill and was hit by a commuter train, killing a passenger in the vehicle. In Virginia, a girl was fatally struck by a car while sledging, and a 75-year-old man was killed after being hit by a snow plough. A 13-year-old girl died and 35 others suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning in an apartment building in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where the temperature averaged 20F (-7C) on Thursday night. Seven of those treated were first responders.

"The dossier alleged that Donald Trump had links with Russia Two senior US senators have called for an investigation into an ex-MI6 officer over a dossier he wrote about President Trump's alleged Russian links. During a senate judiciary committee, the Republicans found that Christopher Steele had passed details from the dossier to ""multiple US news outlets"". This could mean Mr Steele made ""false statements"" when being interviewed by the FBI. They have now given the communications to the US Department of Justice. The dossier claimed Mr Trump had colluded with Russian officials during his election campaign. It also alleged that Kremlin spies filmed the now-President with prostitutes at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2013. A number of official investigations, including one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are looking into the allegations - denied by both Moscow and Mr Trump. Christopher Steele now runs a company in London Chuck Grassley, who chairs the committee, said the decision to refer the case for criminal investigation had not been taken lightly, but he felt he needed to hand it on for ""appropriate review"". He added: ""After reviewing how Mr Steele conducted himself in distributing information contained in the dossier and how many stop signs the DoJ ignored in its use of the dossier, I believe that a special counsel needs to review this matter. ""The rule of law depends on the government and all who work on its behalf playing by the rules themselves. I hope the Department of Justice will carefully review our letter and take appropriate action."" In a joint statement from Mr Grassley and his colleague, Lindsey Graham, who chairs a number of senate subcommittees, the senators said they were not alleging Mr Steele had committed any crime. Rather. they had passed on the information for ""further investigation only"". How did 'compromising' Trump claims come to light? How and why did we get here? The Steele dossier - which became public in January 2017 - was drawn together after an investigation funded by Republicans trying to block Mr Trump from becoming the party's presidential candidate. Democrats then took over funding the investigation after he was nominated. Mr Steele - who founded and runs Orbis Business Intelligence in London - is said to have passed on his findings to both US and UK intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. He briefly went into hiding after he was revealed as its author, but subsequently returned to work. The UK law firm representing Mr Steele declined to comment.

"The Freemasons have been accused of proving an obstacle to reform at the Police Federation The leader of the Freemasons in England has rejected claims the organisation is blocking reform in the police service. David Staples, chief executive of the United Grand Lodge of England, said it was ""laughable"" to suggest Freemasons were interfering with its culture. Earlier this week, former leader of the Police Federation Steve White accused Freemasons of preventing women and minority groups from progressing. Dr Staples insisted Freemasons had a history of treating people ""as equals"". He wrote toThe Times,externalandGuardian,externalto deny allegations the organisation was blocking reforms intended to encourage women, black people and those from ethnic minority groups to become national representatives in the federation, which represents rank-and-file officers in England and Wales. He said Freemasons themselves were ""quite openly discriminated against"" and insisted it was for that reason alone that many Freemasons kept their membership a secret. In his letter Dr Staples, who is an NHS clinical director, said Freemasons were ""quietly proud"" of welcoming people ""as equals"". Secret ceremonies and rituals of female Freemasons Would you want to be a Freemason? He said: ""The idea that reform within the Police Federation or anywhere else is being actively thwarted by an organised body of Freemasons is laughable"". He said there was ""absolutely no reason"" police officers, or people from other walks of life, should not belong to the Freemasons. Earlier Mr White, who served as chairman from 2014 to 2017, remarked to the BBC andGuardian,externalthat a ""small pocket of people"" had been opposed to the reforms. Steve White said the perception Freemasons were obstructing reform was ""damaging"" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Whether it was coincidence or not, I don't know, but certainly a fairly high proportion - that isn't reflective of policing - seem to be Freemasons."" He added: ""Even if it wasn't the case, the perception was damaging."" In 2014, Theresa May hadtold the federation to ""turn itself around""when she was home secretary, amid accusations of bullying and a lack of transparency in its accounts.

"This video can not be played Dozens queued for the midnight release of Fire and Fury The author of a controversial book on Donald Trump says that all his White House aides see him as a ""child"" who needs ""immediate gratification"". Michael Wolff said his book was based on about 200 interviews, and rejected Mr Trump's claims that it was ""phony"". But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has dismissed suggestions made by Wolff that the president's mental health is failing. The book has now gone on sale early despite Mr Trump's attempts to stop it. Mr Trump's lawyers had tried to block publication of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, alleging it contained many falsehoods and saying they were considering pursuing libel charges.

The president has said it is ""full of lies"" and was being pushed by the media and others to hurt him. He added: ""They should try winning an election. Sad!"" 11 explosive claims from new Trump book The debate over Trump's mental health Who is author Michael Wolff? On Friday, he refused to answer questions about the book as he departed for Camp David from the White House. Mr Trump will spend two days meeting top Republicans at the retreat to discuss his legislative priorities for the year ahead. Wolff said that White House staff described the president as childlike because ""he has the need for immediate gratification. It's all about him... This man does not read, does not listen. He's like a pinball just shooting off the sides."" Despite the storm over the book, the Trump administration has been pressing ahead with its agenda. On Thursday it: Unveiled a plan to expand offshore drilling Opened the door to a crackdown on state-legal marijuana sales Cut off security assistance to Pakistan Took credit for economic growthas the Dow Jones index crossed the 25,000 mark for the first time The president said he had not given Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book. But Wolff responded: ""What was I doing there if he didn't want me to be there? I absolutely spoke to the president... It was not off the record."" He said he had spent three hours with Mr Trump in total, both during the election campaign and after the inauguration. Hitting back in a television interview at the White House attacks, he said the president had no credibility and that ""100% of the people around him"" question his fitness for office.

Wolff said it was ""extraordinary"" that the president of the US would try to stop publication of his book, a move that ""the CEO of a mid-sized company"" would not attempt. The book cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting at Trump Tower in New York between a Russian lawyer and Trump election campaign officials, including Mr Trump's son Donald Jr, as ""treasonous"". Both Mr Trump Jr and his father deny that any collusion with Russians to win the election took place. However Mr Bannon is quoted in the book as saying: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" The meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russians. The book makes many other claims, including that: The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night Mr Trump was angry that A-list stars had snubbed his inauguration The new president ""found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary"" His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka Trump mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" However, the accuracy of some excerpts has been criticised and questioned in the US media. This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his ""worst enemies"" Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, BBC North America editor Jon Sopel says. Analysis: BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Donald Trump's supporters have seen many a media storm over the past few years, and somehow their man always emerges (relatively) unscathed. The book may be generating considerable heat among the chattering class, but there's little to indicate that its lasting impact will be much more than confirming long-held suspicions of Trump critics and re-enforcing the bunker mentality in the White House. Outside Washington, in places where people don't devoutly follow every permutation of the presidential Twitter feed, the Trump administration is compiling a boast-worthy economic record. Despite some doom-and-gloom predictions following the 2016 election, the stock market has soared. Unemployment remains low. Major corporations are making high-profile moves to at least temporarily boost their workers' paycheques. And the president can start pointing to his party's tax bill as a tangible reason why the economy is humming along. If the current trajectory continues, Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans will be positioned to make the case to voters in the months and years ahead that despite all the drama - the often self-inflicted fire and fury - their agenda is to help Americans where it counts the most, in their pockets. That's the kind of message that can win. Mr Trump said Mr Bannon - who was sacked in August - had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position. Reports suggest that more conservative factions in the Republican party have backed Mr Trump amid the fallout from the book. 'I'm not that Steve Bannon' Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? How Trump cooled on Bannon Billionaire conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, who had backed Mr Bannon financially and invested in the right-wing Breitbart news website that he heads, cut ties with the former strategist, saying: ""I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected.""

"Prices in Iran are on average 22 times what they were 20 years ago The protests which have swept Iran in the past week reflect, in part, the impact on ordinary people of years of international sanctions. The sanctions, lifted in 2016 as part of a deal with world powers that limits Iran's nuclear activities, resulted in a sharp decrease in spending power and forced people to cut back on buying even essential foodstuffs. Analysis by BBC Persian of figures from the Central Bank of Iran shows that household budgets (the value of all the goods and services used by a household) have fallen in real terms from $14,800 in 2007-08 to $12,515 in 2016-17. The analysis also shows Iran's middle class has been hit the hardest. While the average household budget has fallen 15%, the figure is 20% for middle-class families. Six charts that explain the Iran protests Economists say the situation has been exacerbated by domestic factors such as high unemployment and high inflation, which have added to the strain on Iranian families' finances. The Iranian economy has been struggling with eye-watering levels of inflation over the past three decades. In 2016-17, prices were on average 22 times what they were 20 years earlier. While wages kept up with inflation in the 1990s and early 2000s, over the past 10 years they have lagged far behind. On top of this, since 2009 the Iranian economy has suffered sluggish, or even negative, growth, leading to stagnating wages and soaring unemployment. This coincided with the withdrawal of government subsidies on food and energy, and their replacement with monthly cash handouts. The economic downturn since 2009 was partly due to sanctions targeting Iran's crude oil exports, which had a critical impact on government revenues and the wider economy. Although the sanctions have now been lifted, their impact is still being felt - as evidenced by the widespread street protests that started a week ago. The most obvious impact of the sanctions was on the dining tables of ordinary people. The average consumption of many food staples such as bread, milk and red meat has decreased between 30% and 50% over the past 10 years. Back in 2006, Iranian households consumed an average 1.2kg (2.6lbs) of red meat, over 4 litres (7 pints) of milk and 9kg of bread every week. By last year that had dropped to 800g - just over 2 litres and 6kg respectively. The most obvious cause of this is inflation. While incomes rose by 370% over the past decade, the cost of red meat went up 590%, milk by 650% and bread by 1380%. In real terms, it is now three times more expensive to buy a loaf of bread. On top of this, housing costs have soared over the past two decades. While 20 years ago Iranian households would spend a third of their budget on food, and just a quarter of it on housing, last year those proportions were essentially reversed. Housing now takes up more than a third of a family's budget, and less than a quarter is spent on the dining table. Housing in Tehran now takes up an average of half the household budget This has happened because Iran is suffering a serious housing affordability crisis. Over the past two decades, the average price of a home has risen at more than double the general rate of inflation. This has led to falling rates of home ownership. Over the past 20 years the number of families living in rented accommodation went from one-in-five to one-in-three. As with so many countries, the situation is worst in the capital. Fewer than half of families in Tehran now own their home. On top of that, housing in the city now takes up an average of half the household budget. Why are there protests in Iran?

"The council sits in the United Nations' headquarters in New York The United Nations rose from the ashes of World War II as an organisation of ""peace-loving"" states. It aimed to spare succeeding generations from the scourge of armed conflict, and its Security Council - which met for the first time in 1946 - was specifically tasked with ensuring global peace and security. Once widely criticised as a talking-shop, the council has had a more active role on the world stage in recent years, introducing sanctions regimes and authorising the use of force in conflicts. Five nations are permanently represented on the Security Council. They reflect the post-war power structure that held sway when the council was formed. Members of this privileged group work alongside 10 non-permanent member countries. Each member - permanent or otherwise - holds the presidency of the council for a one-month period, on a rotating basis. The non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms by members of the UN General Assembly, the body that represents all UN members. The aim is to achieve a regional balance, with five Asian or African members, two Latin American members, one east European, and two members from western Europe or other regions making up the mix of non-permanent members. Nations compete keenly for council membership, maybe because of the prestige attached, or the chance to raise an issue that is in the national interest. Some countries announce their candidacy many years in advance and actively canvass votes. Draft resolutions are drawn up by one or more members of the council and circulated privately to the others. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is a former prime minister of Portugal The drafts can be negotiated or changed in a process called ""consultations"". If agreed to by all members, the resolution is formally proposed to the council. Each member has one vote. Decisions on what the council calls ""substantive"" issues need a majority of nine votes before they can be passed, including either votes or abstentions from all five permanent members. Not surprisingly, the question of whether an issue is substantive or not is itself the subject of lively debate. Thus, each of the permanent members has the right of veto; if one of them votes against a resolution, it cannot be passed. But a resolution can be passed if a permanent member abstains from the vote. A general decline in the use of the veto, which followed the end of the Cold War, helped the council to become a more effective decision-maker. The Security Council attaches great importance to preventing armed conflict in the first place, but once a dispute has flared, its first aim is to seek a diplomatic solution. If a conflict persists, the Security Council may work towards a ceasefire and deploy peacekeepers. It can order UN nations to impose sanctions and, as a last resort, it may authorise military action against an aggressor. The status quo of the permanent members had not changed since the council's first meeting in 1946, and the make-up of the Security Council has climbed up the UN agenda. Change faces numerous hurdles, but the likelihood of reform was seen as having been boosted by an announcement by President Barack Obama that the US has backed India's ambition to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. India, Germany, Japan and Brazil - known as the G4 - and the African Union are among those who have long lobbied for coveted permanent-member status. A working group on reform set up under the UN General Assembly in 1993 had made little progress on the matter, with a lack of consensus over potential candidates. The then Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned the lack of reform could weaken the council's standing in the world. The Security Council came under strong pressure from US President George W Bush in the run-up to the 2003 US-led Iraq campaign. Mr Bush cited Baghdad's ""decade of defiance"" of Security Council resolutions. ""Will the UN serve the purpose of its founding... or will it be irrelevant,"" he asked in a speech to the General Assembly in September 2002. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan The Iraqi crisis tested the Security Council's credibility and authority to the limit. Resolution 1441, passed by the council, demanded that Iraq disarm and cooperate with weapons inspectors. But some permanent members, including France and Russia, disagreed with the US-UK assertion that 1441 allowed military action. With France proposing to veto a second resolution authorising action, the decision to go to war was made without Security Council approval. The failure of diplomacy was seen as a bad portent for the Security Council's future prospects. More generally, the Security Council has been criticised for not taking forceful action until a catastrophe or conflict unfolds, even when this might have been predicted, as in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Mindful of this, and the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which was undertaken without council approval, leaders of all 15 member states met in 2000 to adopt measures that would give the organisation more teeth, including a review of peacekeeping operations. More recently the Security Council has acted with greater decisiveness. It has imposed sanctions on North Korea and Iran over their nuclear programmes, and authorised a no-fly zone over Libya that helped indirectly to bring down the Gaddafi government. Cold War fault lines endure, however, as became evident when Russia and China in 2012 vetoed a series of Security Council resolutions aimed at putting pressure on the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. 1946- First Security Council meeting in London 1950- Members urged to help South Korea repel invasion from north 1963- Adopts voluntary arms embargo against South Africa 1964- Sends peacekeepers to Cyprus 1977- Adopts mandatory arms embargo against South Africa 1990- Authorises force to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait 1992- Applies sanctions on Libya after Lockerbie bombing 1993- Sets up war crimes tribunal in The Hague to deal with Balkan war crimes 1999- Authorises East Timor peacekeeping force 1999- Kosovo crisis: US-led alliance launches military action without UNSC approval 2001- Adopts resolution 1373 on anti-terror strategies, after September 11 attacks on US 2002- Adopts resolution 1441, a mandate to verify Iraq's compliance with WMD obligations 2005- Applies sanctions on those guilty of atrocities in Sudan's Darfur 2006- Applies sanctions on North Korea following Pyongyang's nuclear test 2008- Applies sanctions to Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba group after Mumbai attacks 2009- Applies tougher sanctions on North Korea after Pyongyang carries out another nuclear test 2010- Imposes sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme 2011- Authorises no-fly-zone over Libya 2011-2- Russia, China veto resolutions demanding Syria government end human rights violations 2016- Negotiates Iranian nuclear deal and easing of sanctions Obama backs India's UN seat bid UN Security Council At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?
