"This video can not be played Cher Little was left to live in just a single room in her home. A woman who lost both her legs to a deadly blood poisoning infection said she could not believe how a band of builders had changed her life. Cher Little thought she had Covid when she fell ill in October last year. But she was soon fighting for life with meningococcal septicaemia - and was only given a one-in-five chance of pulling through. Over 70 people stepped in to rebuild her home in Flintshire, after being left living in just a single room. ""It's just unbelievable. It doesn't even look like my house,"" said 46-year-old Cher, as she saw the completed work for the first time on Sunday. ""It's fabulous, just fabulous. It's more than what I expected. I couldn't imagine how it was going to be - but this is just amazing."" Construction under way at Cher's Connah's Quay home Charity Band of Builders says it is the largest project they have ever undertaken It has taken volunteers, who were working for charity Band of Builders, 31 days to transform her home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, where she lives with partner Mark, who is a plasterer by trade. ""She was in a coma for 30-odd days, and then she was in hospital for three months after that,"" explained Cher's sister Sian Lloyd. She said doctors were ""fighting and fighting"" to save her hand and feet from the ravages of the septicaemia poisoning - but in the end, could only save her hands. ""So she lost both her legs beneath the knee in February this year."" Cher's sister Sian was determined to help - and Band of Builders made their dreams come true It was at the point Sian started fundraising to help improve home life for her sister. ""When she came out of hospital she couldn't get anywhere, she was trapped in her living room,"" she said. ""There was no privacy - it was a nightmare."" 'It'll be ok': The amputees helping each other Snowdon summit crawl for amputee 'The best decision I made' says cheerleading amputee As work began to make some simple modifications to help Cher in her daily life, the builder's charity stepped in to super-charge those plans. Sian said her sister could ""finally get around the house easily, and focus on herself from now on in"". The volunteers have given the home a new enlarged kitchen, a new ground floor extension with a wet room, and a new bedroom for the couple to share - all of which are wheelchair accessible. Cher with daughter Georgia: She says the new home means she can now focus on her ongoing recovery The Band of Builders charity was established to help those in the construction industry and their close family when they were in dire need of help on projects such as this. They said it had been the biggest challenge they had taken on so far, with every single person involved donating their time - and most importantly skills - for free. ""When I originally came and met Cher earlier this year, it was literally: 'What are we getting ourselves into on this one?',"" said the charity's operations director Tony Steel. ""We needed 70 volunteers to pull this off, and I have got to say, without them, we just wouldn't have made it - they've been absolutely magnificent."" The emotional moment Cher is shown her knew kitchen by project leader Kevin Cox He also praised the community, who helped every step of the way. ""In Connah's Quay they have been exceptional,"" he added. It included one local pub putting up building volunteers, while there were daily donations of food and drink from friends, neighbours and businesses in the area. ""It just shows you what a community is like when they pull together,"" added Mr Steel. Cher has learned to use prosthetic legs - and was determined to walk back into her renovated home For Cher, it means much more than just bricks and mortar. ""It's been very difficult - a horrible time - and now you get to look forward,"" she said. ""The way it was before, with the restrictions around the house, it was physically and mentally difficult - so this is going to be a whole lot better.""

"This video can not be played Highlights: Australia beat New Zealand to win their first T20 World Cup Men's T20 World Cup, Dubai New Zealand 172-4 (20 overs):Williamson 85 (48), Hazlewood 3-16 Australia 173-2 (18.5 overs):Marsh 77* (50), Warner 53 (38) Australia won by eight wickets Scorecard Australia powered to an eight-wicket victory over New Zealand to win the Men's T20 World Cup for the first time. Mitchell Marsh plundered a ferocious 77 not out from 50 balls as Australia overhauled what appeared to be a challenging 173 with seven deliveries to spare in Dubai. The all-rounder shared a dominant stand of 92 with opener David Warner and continued to attack after the opener was bowled for 53 from 38 balls. Marsh was dropped on 68 but at that stage only 15 runs were needed from 19 balls, the highest chase in a Men's T20 World Cup final a near certainty. After Glenn Maxwell hit the winning runs, Marsh was mobbed by his team-mates and dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion having produced his finest Twenty20 innings on the biggest stage. New Zealand, now beaten in three consecutive white-ball finals, were arguably favourites at the halfway stage after Kane Williamson's 85 from 48 balls in a total of 172-4 on a slow pitch. But it was Australia - unfancied before the tournament - who cantered home to join Australia women as T20 world champions. 'This group of boys - we actually love each other' TMS podcast: Australia claim first World T20 trophy This video can not be played Watch best shots of Marsh's unbeaten 77 as Australia win T20 World Cup The Australia celebrations began even before the ball had reached the boundary for the final time, the players rushing on to the field to celebrate with Marsh. His innings will be remembered as one of the best in a World Cup final, the brutal hitting beginning with an emphatic front-foot pull for six off the first ball he faced. Player of the tournament Warner, dropped by his Indian Premier League franchise before this tournament, was key too, while Josh Hazlewood earlier took an immaculate 3-16. This video can not be played Watch best shots of Warner's half-century Together they helped sealed a win that few expected three weeks ago. Australia lost their five T20 series leading up to the World Cup - during which they were bowled out for 62 by Bangladesh - and their struggles continued in the group stage when they werethrashed by England. Marsh was dropped for that eight-wicket defeat but ended the tournament as an unlikely hero in a side that completed a perfectly timed rise. Having won five 50-over World cups, Australia have now completed the white-ball set and will have home advantage when they defend the title next year. Worryingly for England supporters, this triumph comes only 24 days before the first Ashes Test. New Zealand were also chasing their first T20 World Cup. Having won the World Test Championship in June, they were aiming to become world champions in the longest and shortest formats. They were hampered by being asked to bat first and critics of the tournament will point to this being another game won by the side winning the toss. It gave Australia an advantage but New Zealand's bowling - their stronger suit and usually so dependable - was not at its best. Too often was Warner given width outside off stump, while Marsh was able to profit from short bowling with pulls. The Black Caps struggled early in their innings, their top order conservative on a pitch on which batters took time to get going. This video can not be played NZ captain Williamson hits 85 against Australia in T20 World Cup final Williamson had 21 from 22 balls when he was put down by Hazlewood above his head at fine leg, and needed all his class to accelerate in stunning fashion. Mixing blows over mid-wicket with delicate glances, he scored 64 from his last 27 deliveries, including 22 from one Mitchell Starc over, whose four wicketless overs cost 60 runs. Had New Zealand won, the final may have been remembered for Williamson's innings, but instead Marsh will take the headlines. Given their Test Championship success, 2021 remains a historic year for New Zealand. Ultimately, however, this is another loss to add to those in the 50-over World Cup finals of 2015 and 2019.

What an amazing six weeks with this group of men. I love them to death and now we're world champs. ""I just wanted to get out there and have a presence. I can't believe it. It's unbelievable."" Australia captain Aaron Finch:""It is a huge honour to be able to lead this Australia team. I'm so proud of the way the guys went about it from the start - they were brilliant. I'm so proud. ""We knew our backs were against the wall going into the Bangladesh game but if you keep putting peoples backs against the wall enough they are going to fight. We certainly did that."" Australia opener David Warner:""I am always pumped. We just wanted to put on a great spectacle. There were some nerves with a good total on the board but it was great that the guys were able to deliver."" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson:""We were trying to get a bit of a platform. We got what we thought at the halfway stage was a good total, but it was chased superbly by Australia. They did not give us an inch. Today they really turned it on. ""I'm really proud of our team's efforts throughout the tournament. We came here and gave it our best shot, but it wasn't good enough tonight."" West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite on Test Match Special:""The brave team won and the team that were a bit tepid came second.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'We cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do' The Glasgow climate deal is a ""game-changing agreement"" which sounds ""the death knell for coal power"", Boris Johnson says. Although countries only agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, the prime minister said this was a fantastic achievement. The wording change was made after a late intervention by China and India. But it remains the first time plans to reduce coal have been mentioned in such a climate deal. The agreement was reached after the two-week Glasgow COP26 summit went into overtime on Saturday. Critics have said the deal does not go far enough and will not meet the key summit goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century. Scientists say this would limit the worst impacts of climate change. During a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said: ""We can lobby, we can cajole, we can encourage, but we cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"" ""For all our disagreements, the world is undeniably heading in the right direction"" The ""tipping point has been reached in people's attitudes"" - with leaders ""galvanised and propelled by their electorates"" But ""the fatal mistake now would be to think that we in any way cracked this thing"" Mr Johnson said that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction was ""tinged with disappointment"". He said there had been a high level of ambition - especially from countries where climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"". And ""while many of us were willing to go there, that wasn't true of everybody"", he admitted. But he added the UK could not compel nations to act. ""It's ultimately their decision to make and they must stand by it."" New global climate deal struck in Glasgow What's been agreed at COP26? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Mr Johnson also said he thought the watered-down language on coal did not ""make that much of a difference"", adding that the direction of travel was ""pretty much the same"". He said most of Western Europe and North America had been persuaded to pull the plug on financial support for overseas fossil fuel projects by this time next year. ""And when you add all that together, it is beyond question, Glasgow has sounded the death knell for coal power,"" he said. Speaking alongside the PM, COP26 president Alok Sharma revealed that at one point during the final negotiations, he had feared the agreement was in jeopardy. ""There was an hour where really we weren't going to get a deal,"" he said. Mr Sharma, who fought back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, said: ""I can tell you there was one really tense hour where I did feel the weight of the world on my shoulders... this deal was absolutely in jeopardy. We got it over the line."" Earlier he saidthat ""China and India will have to explain themselves""to climate-vulnerable nations. One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure global warming does not go above 1.5C by 2100 - but a report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C warming by that date. As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Under the Glasgow climate pact: Countries were asked to republish their climate action plans by the end of next year, with more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 There is an emphasis on the need for developed countries to increase the money they give to those already suffering the effects of climate change - beyond the current $100bn annual target The language about coal has been included for the first time ever in a global climate deal A pledge in a previous draft to ""phase out"" coal was instead watered down to a commitment to ""phase down"" coal The UN's climate change chief Patricia Espinosa described the mention of fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"" but added there was a need to ""balance out the social consequences"" for people of cutting coal power - particularly in poor countries. She said that the 1.5C target was ""definitely alive"" but, earlier, Labour's shadow business and energy secretary Ed Miliband said the goal was ""in intensive care"".

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"Pictures of a burning car outside the hospital have been widely shared on social media Three men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act after a man was killed in a car explosion outside Liverpool Women's Hospital. A taxi carrying one passenger pulled up just before 11:00 GMT on Remembrance Sunday, as a national two minutes' silence was due to begin, and exploded. The passenger was declared dead at the scene and is yet to be formally identified. The male driver was injured and is in hospital in a stable condition. Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Detectives from Counter Terrorism Police North West said three men - aged 29, 26 and 21 - were detained in the Kensington area of the city. They said they were continuing to keep an open mind about the cause of the blast and were working with Merseyside Police as the investigation continued ""at pace"". The security service, MI5, is also assisting. Armed officers have carried out raids on properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, and around Sutcliffe Street and Boaler Street in Kensington. Specialist officers remain outside a house on Rutland Avenue, in an operation police say is linked to the explosion. Police negotiators are on the scene, a fire crew is on standby, and a number of residents have been evacuated. A large cordon, guarded by uniformed officers, remains in place. Police officers at an address in Rutland Avenue Specialist officers were seen on the street Carl Bessant, whose partner had just had a baby, was inside the hospital at the time of the blast. ""My partner is really shook up to be honest,"" he said. ""We were so close and she was feeding the baby when it happened. We heard a loud bang and looked out of the window. ""We saw the car on fire and someone jump out... screaming, and there was someone inside the car. ""The hospital shut down, no-one in or out, so they said, but people were using the back entrance."" Police, fire and bomb disposal crews were at the scene of the blast which remains cordoned off Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid on Twitter,external: ""My thoughts are with all those affected by the awful incident in Liverpool today. ""I want to thank the emergency services for their quick response and professionalism, and the police for their ongoing work on the investigation."" Home Secretary Priti Patelalso tweeted,externalshe was ""being kept regularly updated on the awful incident"". By Jim Clarke, BBC North West Tonight deputy editor The first raid happened at about 13:00 GMT on Rutland Avenue in the Sefton Park area of the city. It's about 0.75 miles from the hospital. It's an area of the city with large Victorian houses. The house that was raided had been split up into flats. Local residents said they had not seen anybody coming or going from the property for some weeks - they thought it was unoccupied. The street remains cordoned off and some residents have been evacuated. Police were also seen at Boaler Street in the Kensington area of the city. It's about a mile away from the hospital. Eyewitnesses on the street said armed police arrived at about 14:00 and raided a house. They said they saw men being arrested and handcuffed. They were led by armed officers into a car. That street also remains cordoned off. Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, of Merseyside Police, sought to reassure the public, saying events of this nature were very rare and that there would be an increased and visible police presence on the streets in the coming days. A bomb disposal unit and fire engines attended the scene earlier, which remains cordoned off. Road closures are also in place. Raids have been carried out by armed police near Sefton Park, and also in the Kensington area of the city Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said the police response would be ongoing ""for some time"" Police were called at 10:59 to reports of a car explosion. Phil Garrigan, chief fire officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said the car fire had been ""fully developed"" when crews arrived shortly after 11:00. ""The operational crews extinguished the fire rapidly but... there was one fatality,"" he said. ""Another individual had left the vehicle prior to the fire developing to the extent that it did. Our thoughts are with them and the families of those involved."" Nick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be looking to ascertain what happened inside the vehicle. ""They'll be looking at what sort of damage has been caused, trying to get an assessment of what might have caused that blast,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme. ""From what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. ""So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary."" Mr Aldworth explained it was common for investigations to be linked to terrorism quickly as it provides investigators with more resources from an earlier stage. He added that it was entirely appropriate to involve MI5 to understand if it holds relevant information. Liverpool Women's Hospital said visiting access had been restricted until further notice and patients had been diverted to other hospitals where possible. ""We are reviewing our patient activity for the next 24-48 hours and patients should wait to be contacted for updates about any planned appointments or other attendance at the hospital,"" chief executive Kathryn Thomson said.

"This video can not be played Alok Sharma fights back tears as Glasgow Climate Pact reached A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they ""have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication"". In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. Evasive words, but deal shows progress He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"". ""There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it wasalways unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"", but that the ""starting pistol"" had been fired. How the final day unfolded Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was ""hanging by a thread"". ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero."" As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,external Main achievements of the deal: Re-visiting emissions-cutting plans next year to try to keep 1.5C target reachable The first ever inclusion of a commitment to limit coal use Increased financial help for developing countries ""We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,"" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it."" Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century. ""They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,"" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned. ""This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,"" he said. Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was ""nothing less than a scandal"". ""Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,"" she said. Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (Â£75bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed. It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped."" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'We cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do' The Glasgow climate deal is a ""game-changing agreement"" which sounds ""the death knell for coal power"", Boris Johnson says. Although countries only agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, the prime minister said this was a fantastic achievement. The wording change was made after a late intervention by China and India. But it remains the first time plans to reduce coal have been mentioned in such a climate deal. The agreement was reached after the two-week Glasgow COP26 summit went into overtime on Saturday. Critics have said the deal does not go far enough and will not meet the key summit goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century. Scientists say this would limit the worst impacts of climate change. During a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said: ""We can lobby, we can cajole, we can encourage, but we cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"" ""For all our disagreements, the world is undeniably heading in the right direction"" The ""tipping point has been reached in people's attitudes"" - with leaders ""galvanised and propelled by their electorates"" But ""the fatal mistake now would be to think that we in any way cracked this thing"" Mr Johnson said that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction was ""tinged with disappointment"". He said there had been a high level of ambition - especially from countries where climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"". And ""while many of us were willing to go there, that wasn't true of everybody"", he admitted. But he added the UK could not compel nations to act. ""It's ultimately their decision to make and they must stand by it."" New global climate deal struck in Glasgow What's been agreed at COP26? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Mr Johnson also said he thought the watered-down language on coal did not ""make that much of a difference"", adding that the direction of travel was ""pretty much the same"". He said most of Western Europe and North America had been persuaded to pull the plug on financial support for overseas fossil fuel projects by this time next year. ""And when you add all that together, it is beyond question, Glasgow has sounded the death knell for coal power,"" he said. Speaking alongside the PM, COP26 president Alok Sharma revealed that at one point during the final negotiations, he had feared the agreement was in jeopardy. ""There was an hour where really we weren't going to get a deal,"" he said. Mr Sharma, who fought back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, said: ""I can tell you there was one really tense hour where I did feel the weight of the world on my shoulders... this deal was absolutely in jeopardy. We got it over the line."" Earlier he saidthat ""China and India will have to explain themselves""to climate-vulnerable nations. One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure global warming does not go above 1.5C by 2100 - but a report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C warming by that date. As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Under the Glasgow climate pact: Countries were asked to republish their climate action plans by the end of next year, with more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 There is an emphasis on the need for developed countries to increase the money they give to those already suffering the effects of climate change - beyond the current $100bn annual target The language about coal has been included for the first time ever in a global climate deal A pledge in a previous draft to ""phase out"" coal was instead watered down to a commitment to ""phase down"" coal The UN's climate change chief Patricia Espinosa described the mention of fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"" but added there was a need to ""balance out the social consequences"" for people of cutting coal power - particularly in poor countries. She said that the 1.5C target was ""definitely alive"" but, earlier, Labour's shadow business and energy secretary Ed Miliband said the goal was ""in intensive care"".

"This video can not be played Sharma: China and India will have to explain actions to climate-vulnerable countries China and India will have to explain themselves to climate-vulnerable nations, COP26 President Alok Sharma has said as the summit ends. It comes after the two nations pushed for the language on coal to change from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"" in the deal agreed in Glasgow. But Mr Sharma insisted the ""historic"" deal ""keeps 1.5C within reach"". It is the first ever climate deal that plans explicitly to reduce coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The summit, which was initially due to end on Friday, had to go into overtime before a deal was agreed late on Saturday - following the late intervention from India to water down the language on coal. Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will join Mr Sharma to give a Downing Street news conference on the outcome of the climate summit. Live: Coal pledge in COP a huge step forward - UN climate boss New global climate deal struck in Glasgow What's been agreed at COP26? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Mr Sharma said the deal struck in the Glasgow climate pact was a ""fragile win"" and urged China and India to ""justify"" their actions to nations that are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I am going to be calling on everyone to do more. ""But as I said, in relation to what happened yesterday, China and India will have to explain themselves and what they did to the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world."" Mr Sharma, who had to hold back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, added: ""I wouldn't describe what we did yesterday as a failure - it is a historic achievement."" China teaming up with India to water down the language will have come as something of a blow to those who wanted a much more ambitious outcome at the conference. However - perhaps they should not be too pessimistic about the final agreement. For example, here in Beijing the Communist Party's media mouthpiece Xinhua wire service is already stressing in its commentaries that coal is ""the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation"". It may sound like that is just stating the obvious - but such wording from Xinhua represents a transmission of the party line across the country: coal is the biggest part of the problem! Beijing knows that ultimately the writing is on the wall for coal, but it's the speed of its phase out which matters to the Chinese government. It believes that the most developed countries got the world into this problem in the first place - enriching themselves along the way - so now argues that countries like China need to be cut more slack to catch up. What's also being stressed here from the Chinese delegation has been the perceived shortfall from advanced countries to deliver on their promises to provide finance and technological support for developing countries to help them move to cleaner energy. Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin, who headed China's team in Glasgow, said he hoped developed countries could ""make further efforts to honour their commitments, enhancing support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions"". One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure we do not go above 1.5C by 2100 - which scientists have said would limit the worst impacts of climate change. As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Extreme weather events such as flooding and wild fires are already experienced by millions around the world Scientists have warned if global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,externalThe world is currently 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century. Under the Glasgow climate pact: Countries were asked to republish their climate action plans by the end of next year, with more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 There is an emphasis on the need for developed countries to increase the money they give to those already suffering the effects of climate change - beyond the current $100bn annual target The language about coal has been included for the first time ever in a global climate deal A pledge in a previous draft to ""phase out"" coal was instead watered down to a commitment to ""phase down"" coal The final deal agreed on has been met with some criticism. Ed Miliband, shadow business and energy secretary, told the Sky News' Trevor Phillips programme that ""keeping 1.5 degrees alive is frankly in intensive care"". He said the world's task was to halve global emissions by 2030 and said that despite some progress in Glasgow ""the world is only probably about 20% or 25% of the way to that goal"".

The UN's climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, described the mention of coal and fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"". But she added that ""we need to also balance out the social consequences for so many people around the world, especially in the poor countries"". Lord Deben, the chairman of the Climate Change Committee, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the UK should negotiate future trade deals with ""some congruence with the world battle on climate change"" - pointing to Australia as an example. ""I hope our government will also recognise that you really cannot sign trade deals on the basis that Australia can do nothing to insist on their farmers meeting the challenge of climate change and then export their goods to Britain,"" he said. He added that India's push to change the language on coal was a ""misuse"" of the process. A report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C of warming by 2100. If no action was taken, scientists believe global warming could exceed 4C in the future. This could lead to devastating heatwaves, droughts, extreme rainfall and floods. As a result, millions of people could lose their homes to rising sea levels. In addition to this, the change in climate could lead to irreversible damage to our ecosystem - with the mass extinction of animal and plant species.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'We cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do' The Glasgow climate deal is a ""game-changing agreement"" which sounds ""the death knell for coal power"", Boris Johnson says. Although countries only agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, the prime minister said this was a fantastic achievement. The wording change was made after a late intervention by China and India. But it remains the first time plans to reduce coal have been mentioned in such a climate deal. The agreement was reached after the two-week Glasgow COP26 summit went into overtime on Saturday. Critics have said the deal does not go far enough and will not meet the key summit goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century. Scientists say this would limit the worst impacts of climate change. During a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said: ""We can lobby, we can cajole, we can encourage, but we cannot force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"" ""For all our disagreements, the world is undeniably heading in the right direction"" The ""tipping point has been reached in people's attitudes"" - with leaders ""galvanised and propelled by their electorates"" But ""the fatal mistake now would be to think that we in any way cracked this thing"" Mr Johnson said that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction was ""tinged with disappointment"". He said there had been a high level of ambition - especially from countries where climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"". And ""while many of us were willing to go there, that wasn't true of everybody"", he admitted. But he added the UK could not compel nations to act. ""It's ultimately their decision to make and they must stand by it."" New global climate deal struck in Glasgow What's been agreed at COP26? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Mr Johnson also said he thought the watered-down language on coal did not ""make that much of a difference"", adding that the direction of travel was ""pretty much the same"". He said most of Western Europe and North America had been persuaded to pull the plug on financial support for overseas fossil fuel projects by this time next year. ""And when you add all that together, it is beyond question, Glasgow has sounded the death knell for coal power,"" he said. Speaking alongside the PM, COP26 president Alok Sharma revealed that at one point during the final negotiations, he had feared the agreement was in jeopardy. ""There was an hour where really we weren't going to get a deal,"" he said. Mr Sharma, who fought back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, said: ""I can tell you there was one really tense hour where I did feel the weight of the world on my shoulders... this deal was absolutely in jeopardy. We got it over the line."" Earlier he saidthat ""China and India will have to explain themselves""to climate-vulnerable nations. One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure global warming does not go above 1.5C by 2100 - but a report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C warming by that date. As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Under the Glasgow climate pact: Countries were asked to republish their climate action plans by the end of next year, with more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 There is an emphasis on the need for developed countries to increase the money they give to those already suffering the effects of climate change - beyond the current $100bn annual target The language about coal has been included for the first time ever in a global climate deal A pledge in a previous draft to ""phase out"" coal was instead watered down to a commitment to ""phase down"" coal The UN's climate change chief Patricia Espinosa described the mention of fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"" but added there was a need to ""balance out the social consequences"" for people of cutting coal power - particularly in poor countries. She said that the 1.5C target was ""definitely alive"" but, earlier, Labour's shadow business and energy secretary Ed Miliband said the goal was ""in intensive care"".

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells a news conference the COP26 deal sounds the ""death knell for coal power"" Speaking at Downing Street, he says his delight at the progress made is tinged with disappointment India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase down"" not the ""phase out"" of coal power COP26 president Alok Sharma denies the change of language represents a failure - and says there was a chance a deal would not be made at all The Glasgow agreement is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change But UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa says the agreement reached at the climate summit is a huge step forward Edited by Lauren Turner Boris Johnson and Alok Sharma lauded the outcome of the summit at a press conference on Sunday We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main COP26 headlines:  Today's live page coverage has been written by Jo Couzens, Alice Cuddy, Adam Durbin, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Becky Morton and Paul Seddon. It was edited by George Bowden and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst In several ways, Boris Johnson's government will be congratulating
itself on the successes of the conference. The UK won praise for its diplomacy. One British innovation was particularly effective. The COP process under UN rules is always the lowest common
denominator for consensus decisions. The UKâs response was to launch a series of incentivesoutsidethe conference hall, then bolt them on to the COP. They forged coalitions of the willing â not just other
progressive governments but also business and civil society. Initiatives included action on cars, finance, forests,
methane - and one on coal that was much more aggressive than the weaker
language adopted by the whole COP. These bolt-ons will make a real difference. But what about the COP itself? The avowed intent was
to keep alive the prospect of holding global average temp rise at 1.5C above pre-industrial times. The UK said it just achieved that goal. Believing in this requires faith that governments will deliver
on all their promises, and produce tougher carbon-cutting strategies for next
year. Environmentalists doubt it, given that the government is
planning more oil drilling, and Chancellor Rishi Sunakâs budget made it cheaper
to drive and fly in the UK â and didn't mention climate change at all. In the US, the American president is struggling to get his green laws
passed through Congress - and his trillion-dollar infrastructure bill will
stimulate more emissions by investing in roads, bridges and airports. It will also produce millions of tonnes of carbon emissions by making the necessary steel and cement. So, in reality, a more realistic temperature rise is likely to
be much higher than 1.5C - maybe well over the 2C mark that is accepted as
being catastrophic. Even the 1.1C rise we have experienced already is
producing dangerous extremes of weather. At the moment, the climate is changing faster than the
politics. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson told this afternoon's news conference: ""Greenpeace, and I donât want Greenpeace now to repudiate
this, Greenpeace said that as a result of COP26 the era of coal is
ending."" He was reacting to disappointment over the watering down of
language around coal in the COP26 agreement - changing the phrase 
""phase-out"" of ""unabated"" coal merely to ""phase down"". Reacting to the agreement, the international executive
director of GreenpeaceJennifer Morgan said,external:
âItâs meek, itâs weak, and the 1.5C goal is only just alive, but a signal has
been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters.â She went on to say that ""if youâre a coal company
executive this COP saw a bad outcome"". Read more on what's
been agreedhere. Weâve just been hearing from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and COP26 President Alok Sharma. Hereâs a recap of some of the key points:  You can read more in our main storyhere.   Just a bit more on the government and transport. When he was asked how he got back from Glasgow so quickly, COP26 President Alok Sharma was quick to assure everyone he took the train. In response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson joked Sharma was ""showing off"" his green credentials. On the more serious question of emissions linked to air travel, Sharma emphasised it is a ""personal choice"". ""What you need to do is incentivise people, I've always believed in carrot rather than stick."" He added the government is investing in developing sustainable aviation fuels. The panel are asked what they will do ""personally"" to help curb climate change. The PM says he ""used to go everywhere by bike"", which ""made some small contribution"". Alok Sharma had been asked how he got to London so quickly - he says he travelled by train and electric car. Boris Johnson also sends his best wishes to the Queen, who did not attend this morning's Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph after a back sprain. He says he just wants to ""reassure everybody"" by saying she was ""very well"" when he saw her for his weekly official audience with her in Windsor on Wednesday. That marks the end of the conference. COP26 President Alok Sharma echoes the prime minister's praise for India's work on climate change. He emphasises the Indian government had committed ""really quite ambitious"" targets on reducing emissions, with plans for 50% of their power to come from renewables by 2030. ""And I think we should commend them for that,"" he adds. Asked if he would make more stringent climate change targets part of any trade deal with India, Boris Johnson says he doesn't see a reason to introduce them into any negotiations. The PM adds the UK has a ""great relationship"" with India. India, alongside China, were the main voice behind the concession on the language around coal introduced late on yesterday. Johnson says India came up with ""some really impressive"" commitments on decarbonising. Alok Sharma is asked whether he thinks he failed in not pushing for more on coal in the final deal - and if he is now eyeing up a new cabinet post after chairing the COP26 summit. He replies that he would have ""preferred stronger language"" on coal, but is glad a commitment was included at all. He dodges the question on his job, saying he will ""leave that to the prime minister"". Boris Johnson doesn't give any clues on where Sharma could go next - pointing out he still has another year to go in his role. He does not address a question on whether the row over lobbying and MPs' behaviour at Westminster held back the summit, adding that leaders have now ""given ourselves the tools"" to tackle climate warming. And asked to rate the final deal out of 10, the prime minister replies: ""the outcome is over six out of 10"". Addressing the concession over the language on coal in the agreement, COP26 President Alok Sharma says ""you phase down before you phase out"". He reiterates this is the first agreement to mention ambitions to reduce the use of the fossil fuel at all. ""It means at future COPs we can push further on the issue,"" he says. Asked about his emotional reaction to the deal, when he was visibly seen holding back tears, Sharma says it was ""just relief"" that the deal had come off - and admitted he'd had ""about six hours' sleep in three days"". Asked about the UN Secretary General's AntÃ³nio Guterres comments saying the deal would fail to keep global warming bellow 1.5C, Boris Johnson says Glasgow has provided ""hope"". He emphasises the agreement has led to many countries focusing on ""very specific deliverables"" of how to reduce their emissions. Johnson adds the conference has created a roadmap to ""plot the way ahead"" and he was optimistic it could be done. Boris Johnson is asked about his comments prior to the summit that the world was at ""one minute to midnight"" on climate change. The PM replies that it would be a ""fatal mistake"" to ""think we've in any way cracked this thing"" - but he is much more optimistic now about the pace of change. Alok Sharma is asked whether China and India have ""let down"" the world by pushing for the commitment on coal to be watered down - saying it would be phased down, rather than phased out. He replies that they will ""have to explain themselves"" to developing countries affected by climate change. But he says getting a commitment on phasing down coal was nevertheless a success - noting it's the first time this has been made in the final text of a COP agreement. If no deal had been agreed, then vulnerable and developing countries would have been left without support, Alok Sharma says. He adds the key passages on financial support, called ""loss and damage"" in the agreement, were critical for nations already suffering from the effects of climate change. ""I can tell you there was that one hour where I really felt there was a chance there we were not going to get this deal over the line,"" he says. COP26 President Alok Sharma emphasises that the agreement should be considered ""historic"". He explains that a matter of a few weeks ago, nobody would have believed they would be able to even get a mention of coal in the climate agreement - but they managed it in just two weeks. The PM says that success in combatting climate change is ""totally contingent"" on governments around the world sticking to their commitments on reducing emissions. He adds that he believes in a matter of a few years it will soon become ""totally unacceptable"" to build a new coal fired power station. In response to a question on whether the conference could be considered a success, Boris Johnson says the conference was ""never going to be able to halt climate change"" alone. However he adds the conference means we were able to ""equip ourselves with the tools""  to do so.  Wrapping up his opening comments, Boris Johnson says the COP summit has succeeded in slowing the rate of global warming - but this will still remain ""far too much"". But he says that after the conference, humanity is ""heading in the right direction"". Boris Johnson notes, however, that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction to the conference is âtinged with disappointment"". He says ultimately, it is up to countries to make their own commitments on climate change. He says that whilst the host country can ""cajole"", it cannot ""force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"". âSadly thatâs the nature of diplomacy,"" adds the PM. There's been a lot of talk about the agreement on coal - after COP countries only committed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But the prime minister says this is nevertheless a ""fantastic achievement"" - and the conference has ""sounded the death knell for coal power"". UK PM Boris Johnson gets the press conference under way by saying the COP26 agreement was ""truly historic"". He says the agreement was the ""kind of game-changing agreement that world needed to see"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Sharma: China and India will have to explain actions to climate-vulnerable countries China and India will have to explain themselves to climate-vulnerable nations, COP26 President Alok Sharma has said as the summit ends. It comes after the two nations pushed for the language on coal to change from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"" in the deal agreed in Glasgow. But Mr Sharma insisted the ""historic"" deal ""keeps 1.5C within reach"". It is the first ever climate deal that plans explicitly to reduce coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The summit, which was initially due to end on Friday, had to go into overtime before a deal was agreed late on Saturday - following the late intervention from India to water down the language on coal. Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will join Mr Sharma to give a Downing Street news conference on the outcome of the climate summit. Live: Coal pledge in COP a huge step forward - UN climate boss New global climate deal struck in Glasgow What's been agreed at COP26? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Mr Sharma said the deal struck in the Glasgow climate pact was a ""fragile win"" and urged China and India to ""justify"" their actions to nations that are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I am going to be calling on everyone to do more. ""But as I said, in relation to what happened yesterday, China and India will have to explain themselves and what they did to the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world."" Mr Sharma, who had to hold back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, added: ""I wouldn't describe what we did yesterday as a failure - it is a historic achievement."" China teaming up with India to water down the language will have come as something of a blow to those who wanted a much more ambitious outcome at the conference. However - perhaps they should not be too pessimistic about the final agreement. For example, here in Beijing the Communist Party's media mouthpiece Xinhua wire service is already stressing in its commentaries that coal is ""the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation"". It may sound like that is just stating the obvious - but such wording from Xinhua represents a transmission of the party line across the country: coal is the biggest part of the problem! Beijing knows that ultimately the writing is on the wall for coal, but it's the speed of its phase out which matters to the Chinese government. It believes that the most developed countries got the world into this problem in the first place - enriching themselves along the way - so now argues that countries like China need to be cut more slack to catch up. What's also being stressed here from the Chinese delegation has been the perceived shortfall from advanced countries to deliver on their promises to provide finance and technological support for developing countries to help them move to cleaner energy. Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin, who headed China's team in Glasgow, said he hoped developed countries could ""make further efforts to honour their commitments, enhancing support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions"". One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure we do not go above 1.5C by 2100 - which scientists have said would limit the worst impacts of climate change. As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Extreme weather events such as flooding and wild fires are already experienced by millions around the world Scientists have warned if global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,externalThe world is currently 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century. Under the Glasgow climate pact: Countries were asked to republish their climate action plans by the end of next year, with more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 There is an emphasis on the need for developed countries to increase the money they give to those already suffering the effects of climate change - beyond the current $100bn annual target The language about coal has been included for the first time ever in a global climate deal A pledge in a previous draft to ""phase out"" coal was instead watered down to a commitment to ""phase down"" coal The final deal agreed on has been met with some criticism. Ed Miliband, shadow business and energy secretary, told the Sky News' Trevor Phillips programme that ""keeping 1.5 degrees alive is frankly in intensive care"". He said the world's task was to halve global emissions by 2030 and said that despite some progress in Glasgow ""the world is only probably about 20% or 25% of the way to that goal"". But Mr Miliband commended Mr Sharma on his efforts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UN's climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, described the mention of coal and fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"". But she added that ""we need to also balance out the social consequences for so many people around the world, especially in the poor countries"". Lord Deben, the chairman of the Climate Change Committee, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the UK should negotiate future trade deals with ""some congruence with the world battle on climate change"" - pointing to Australia as an example. ""I hope our government will also recognise that you really cannot sign trade deals on the basis that Australia can do nothing to insist on their farmers meeting the challenge of climate change and then export their goods to Britain,"" he said. He added that India's push to change the language on coal was a ""misuse"" of the process. A report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C of warming by 2100. If no action was taken, scientists believe global warming could exceed 4C in the future. This could lead to devastating heatwaves, droughts, extreme rainfall and floods. As a result, millions of people could lose their homes to rising sea levels. In addition to this, the change in climate could lead to irreversible damage to our ecosystem - with the mass extinction of animal and plant species.

He explains that a matter of a few weeks ago, nobody would have believed they would be able to even get a mention of coal in the climate agreement - but they managed it in just two weeks. The PM says that success in combatting climate change is ""totally contingent"" on governments around the world sticking to their commitments on reducing emissions. He adds that he believes in a matter of a few years it will soon become ""totally unacceptable"" to build a new coal fired power station. In response to a question on whether the conference could be considered a success, Boris Johnson says the conference was ""never going to be able to halt climate change"" alone. However he adds the conference means we were able to ""equip ourselves with the tools""  to do so.  Wrapping up his opening comments, Boris Johnson says the COP summit has succeeded in slowing the rate of global warming - but this will still remain ""far too much"". But he says that after the conference, humanity is ""heading in the right direction"". Boris Johnson notes, however, that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction to the conference is âtinged with disappointment"". He says ultimately, it is up to countries to make their own commitments on climate change. He says that whilst the host country can ""cajole"", it cannot ""force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"". âSadly thatâs the nature of diplomacy,"" adds the PM. There's been a lot of talk about the agreement on coal - after COP countries only committed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But the prime minister says this is nevertheless a ""fantastic achievement"" - and the conference has ""sounded the death knell for coal power"". UK PM Boris Johnson gets the press conference under way by saying the COP26 agreement was ""truly historic"". He says the agreement was the ""kind of game-changing agreement that world needed to see"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"There have been warnings from doctors and the UK's Health Security Agency that waning immunity is leading to deaths even of people who have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. So how much protection are we left with? Let's nail some basics. The immune system has two big roles - to stop us getting infected, and if that fails, to clear our bodies of an infection. I want you to stretch your imagination and picture your immune system as a medieval castle. Surrounding the castle is a hostile and ruthless army of coronaviruses desperate to break in. Your first defence is an outer wall patrolled by a legion of archers. These are your body's neutralising antibodies. If they can hold the viral army off, then you won't get infected. But if the walls crumble and the antibody-archers wander off, then the virus is in. It has stormed the castle and you now have an infection. Think of your body's defences like Bamburgh Castle - with the walls offering different types of protection Yet all is not lost. There are still troops inside the fortified keep at the heart of the castle. These are your memory B and memory T cells. Like knights on horseback they can rally the troops, lead the immunological charge and send the hostile invaders packing. The Covid vaccines have been training your body's troops - this includes both antibodies and those memory cells that react to an infection - to take on coronavirus. At least one of those defenders is waning and this is not a surprise. This happens after every vaccine or infection. ""There is good evidence that antibodies are waning with time, and that has left us with obvious defects,"" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh. The desertion of these antibody-archers from their posts, has been made worse by the emergence of the Delta variant. It is just better at spreading and getting into our body - it's like a new army rocking up outside the walls, but this one's brought a cave troll and siege weapons. Imagine your antibodies are a legion of archers along your body's defensive outer wall You may have noticed the consequences of this yourself - people you know who have been double vaccinated, but have still caught Covid. Research,which has not been formally published,external, estimates that the AstraZeneca vaccine reduced any form of Covid symptom by 66% shortly afer the second dose. Five months later that figure had fallen to 47%. For Pfizer, the numbers fell from 90% to 70%. This is obviously an issue for governments trying to contain the spread of the virus. Whether the viral invasion will cause severe damage as it tries to burn and pillage its way through your body now depends on your second line of defence. However, the vaccines are now keeping fewer people out of hospital. Prof Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol and a government vaccine adviser, says: ""We are seeing significant numbers of unvaccinated and vaccinated people coming into hospital. ""The protection you have against relatively mild infection wanes more quickly, but protection from getting into hospital or killing you wanes more slowly."" The greater risk of needing hospital care or even of dying is concentrated in the elderly. The overwhelming majority of deaths in people who have been double vaccinated have been among those over 70. People in that age group are still far better off than someone who they share a birthday with, but turned down the jab. And as you can see, the risks in younger age groups who have been double vaccinated are small. The constant onslaught of time ages every cell in our body - including those that make up the immune system. Getting older makes it harder to train the immune system with vaccines, and it is slower to respond when an infection arrives. It may be that now antibodies have waned far enough, this frailty in the immune system is being exposed. ""It's possible older people initially had protection, but now those antibodies have weakened, they may not have the second line of defence,"" says Prof Eleanor Riley. ""That may be why we're seeing elderly, fragile people dying despite two doses."" All of this is layered on top of the fact that with age tends to come ill health. Since the start of the pandemic, age has been one of the biggest factors in how likely you are to die of it. The oldest people were also the first to be vaccinated, so their immunity has had more time to wane. People who start with a weakened immune system, including cancer and organ transplant patients, have a subtly different problem as their bodies do not respond as well to vaccines. ""Their antibodies are waning at a similar rate to healthy people, but they obviously start off at a lower point,"" says Dr Helen Parry, from the University of Birmingham It is worth noting there are important differences between the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that have donemost of the work protecting people in the UK,external. ""They seem to be good at different parts of the immune system,"" says Dr Parry. ""The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer) are really potent at antibody formation, the AstraZeneca vaccine is really good at generating T-cell responses."" To go back to the castle, Pfizer may be better at manning the outer walls with archers to keep Covid out, while AstraZeneca is good for the inner keep. The good news is that even with waning, these are still exceptionally good vaccines. At the start of the pandemic, people were dreaming of a vaccine that could cut deaths by 50%. Even with waning and in the most at-risk age groups, that protection is still in the region of 80-90%. ""Even the worst cases, six months later, are better than what we hoped for when we designed these vaccines,"" says Prof Finn. ""They're still really good."" The even better news is that there is already evidence that the booster campaign - which has reached more than 11 million people in the UK - is making a difference. Data from theOffice for National Statistics shows antibody levels,external- those first defenders against infection - have gone up again in the oldest age groups. ""Giving a booster to the most elderly is a slam dunk,"" says Prof Finn. Everyone is now closely monitoring the figures to see if this brings down the number of cases and deaths.

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells a news conference the COP26 deal sounds the ""death knell for coal power"" Speaking at Downing Street, he says his delight at the progress made is tinged with disappointment India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase down"" not the ""phase out"" of coal power COP26 president Alok Sharma denies the change of language represents a failure - and says there was a chance a deal would not be made at all The Glasgow agreement is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change But UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa says the agreement reached at the climate summit is a huge step forward Edited by Lauren Turner Boris Johnson and Alok Sharma lauded the outcome of the summit at a press conference on Sunday We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main COP26 headlines:  Today's live page coverage has been written by Jo Couzens, Alice Cuddy, Adam Durbin, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Becky Morton and Paul Seddon. It was edited by George Bowden and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst In several ways, Boris Johnson's government will be congratulating
itself on the successes of the conference. The UK won praise for its diplomacy. One British innovation was particularly effective. The COP process under UN rules is always the lowest common
denominator for consensus decisions. The UKâs response was to launch a series of incentivesoutsidethe conference hall, then bolt them on to the COP. They forged coalitions of the willing â not just other
progressive governments but also business and civil society. Initiatives included action on cars, finance, forests,
methane - and one on coal that was much more aggressive than the weaker
language adopted by the whole COP. These bolt-ons will make a real difference. But what about the COP itself? The avowed intent was
to keep alive the prospect of holding global average temp rise at 1.5C above pre-industrial times. The UK said it just achieved that goal. Believing in this requires faith that governments will deliver
on all their promises, and produce tougher carbon-cutting strategies for next
year. Environmentalists doubt it, given that the government is
planning more oil drilling, and Chancellor Rishi Sunakâs budget made it cheaper
to drive and fly in the UK â and didn't mention climate change at all. In the US, the American president is struggling to get his green laws
passed through Congress - and his trillion-dollar infrastructure bill will
stimulate more emissions by investing in roads, bridges and airports. It will also produce millions of tonnes of carbon emissions by making the necessary steel and cement. So, in reality, a more realistic temperature rise is likely to
be much higher than 1.5C - maybe well over the 2C mark that is accepted as
being catastrophic. Even the 1.1C rise we have experienced already is
producing dangerous extremes of weather. At the moment, the climate is changing faster than the
politics. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson told this afternoon's news conference: ""Greenpeace, and I donât want Greenpeace now to repudiate
this, Greenpeace said that as a result of COP26 the era of coal is
ending."" He was reacting to disappointment over the watering down of
language around coal in the COP26 agreement - changing the phrase 
""phase-out"" of ""unabated"" coal merely to ""phase down"". Reacting to the agreement, the international executive
director of GreenpeaceJennifer Morgan said,external:
âItâs meek, itâs weak, and the 1.5C goal is only just alive, but a signal has
been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters.â She went on to say that ""if youâre a coal company
executive this COP saw a bad outcome"". Read more on what's
been agreedhere. Weâve just been hearing from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and COP26 President Alok Sharma. Hereâs a recap of some of the key points:  You can read more in our main storyhere.   Just a bit more on the government and transport. When he was asked how he got back from Glasgow so quickly, COP26 President Alok Sharma was quick to assure everyone he took the train. In response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson joked Sharma was ""showing off"" his green credentials. On the more serious question of emissions linked to air travel, Sharma emphasised it is a ""personal choice"". ""What you need to do is incentivise people, I've always believed in carrot rather than stick."" He added the government is investing in developing sustainable aviation fuels. The panel are asked what they will do ""personally"" to help curb climate change. The PM says he ""used to go everywhere by bike"", which ""made some small contribution"". Alok Sharma had been asked how he got to London so quickly - he says he travelled by train and electric car. Boris Johnson also sends his best wishes to the Queen, who did not attend this morning's Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph after a back sprain. He says he just wants to ""reassure everybody"" by saying she was ""very well"" when he saw her for his weekly official audience with her in Windsor on Wednesday. That marks the end of the conference. COP26 President Alok Sharma echoes the prime minister's praise for India's work on climate change. He emphasises the Indian government had committed ""really quite ambitious"" targets on reducing emissions, with plans for 50% of their power to come from renewables by 2030. ""And I think we should commend them for that,"" he adds. Asked if he would make more stringent climate change targets part of any trade deal with India, Boris Johnson says he doesn't see a reason to introduce them into any negotiations. The PM adds the UK has a ""great relationship"" with India. India, alongside China, were the main voice behind the concession on the language around coal introduced late on yesterday. Johnson says India came up with ""some really impressive"" commitments on decarbonising. Alok Sharma is asked whether he thinks he failed in not pushing for more on coal in the final deal - and if he is now eyeing up a new cabinet post after chairing the COP26 summit. He replies that he would have ""preferred stronger language"" on coal, but is glad a commitment was included at all. He dodges the question on his job, saying he will ""leave that to the prime minister"". Boris Johnson doesn't give any clues on where Sharma could go next - pointing out he still has another year to go in his role. He does not address a question on whether the row over lobbying and MPs' behaviour at Westminster held back the summit, adding that leaders have now ""given ourselves the tools"" to tackle climate warming. And asked to rate the final deal out of 10, the prime minister replies: ""the outcome is over six out of 10"". Addressing the concession over the language on coal in the agreement, COP26 President Alok Sharma says ""you phase down before you phase out"". He reiterates this is the first agreement to mention ambitions to reduce the use of the fossil fuel at all. ""It means at future COPs we can push further on the issue,"" he says. Asked about his emotional reaction to the deal, when he was visibly seen holding back tears, Sharma says it was ""just relief"" that the deal had come off - and admitted he'd had ""about six hours' sleep in three days"". Asked about the UN Secretary General's AntÃ³nio Guterres comments saying the deal would fail to keep global warming bellow 1.5C, Boris Johnson says Glasgow has provided ""hope"". He emphasises the agreement has led to many countries focusing on ""very specific deliverables"" of how to reduce their emissions. Johnson adds the conference has created a roadmap to ""plot the way ahead"" and he was optimistic it could be done. Boris Johnson is asked about his comments prior to the summit that the world was at ""one minute to midnight"" on climate change. The PM replies that it would be a ""fatal mistake"" to ""think we've in any way cracked this thing"" - but he is much more optimistic now about the pace of change. Alok Sharma is asked whether China and India have ""let down"" the world by pushing for the commitment on coal to be watered down - saying it would be phased down, rather than phased out. He replies that they will ""have to explain themselves"" to developing countries affected by climate change. But he says getting a commitment on phasing down coal was nevertheless a success - noting it's the first time this has been made in the final text of a COP agreement. If no deal had been agreed, then vulnerable and developing countries would have been left without support, Alok Sharma says. He adds the key passages on financial support, called ""loss and damage"" in the agreement, were critical for nations already suffering from the effects of climate change. ""I can tell you there was that one hour where I really felt there was a chance there we were not going to get this deal over the line,"" he says. COP26 President Alok Sharma emphasises that the agreement should be considered ""historic"". He explains that a matter of a few weeks ago, nobody would have believed they would be able to even get a mention of coal in the climate agreement - but they managed it in just two weeks. The PM says that success in combatting climate change is ""totally contingent"" on governments around the world sticking to their commitments on reducing emissions. He adds that he believes in a matter of a few years it will soon become ""totally unacceptable"" to build a new coal fired power station. In response to a question on whether the conference could be considered a success, Boris Johnson says the conference was ""never going to be able to halt climate change"" alone. However he adds the conference means we were able to ""equip ourselves with the tools""  to do so.

"This video can not be played Sharma: China and India will have to explain actions to climate-vulnerable countries China and India will have to explain themselves to climate-vulnerable nations, COP26 President Alok Sharma has said as the summit ends. It comes after the two nations pushed for the language on coal to change from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"" in the deal agreed in Glasgow. But Mr Sharma insisted the ""historic"" deal ""keeps 1.5C within reach"". It is the first ever climate deal that plans explicitly to reduce coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The summit, which was initially due to end on Friday, had to go into overtime before a deal was agreed late on Saturday - following the late intervention from India to water down the language on coal. Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will join Mr Sharma to give a Downing Street news conference on the outcome of the climate summit. Live: Coal pledge in COP a huge step forward - UN climate boss New global climate deal struck in Glasgow What's been agreed at COP26? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Mr Sharma said the deal struck in the Glasgow climate pact was a ""fragile win"" and urged China and India to ""justify"" their actions to nations that are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""I am going to be calling on everyone to do more. ""But as I said, in relation to what happened yesterday, China and India will have to explain themselves and what they did to the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world."" Mr Sharma, who had to hold back tears as he closed the summit following the late intervention, added: ""I wouldn't describe what we did yesterday as a failure - it is a historic achievement."" China teaming up with India to water down the language will have come as something of a blow to those who wanted a much more ambitious outcome at the conference. However - perhaps they should not be too pessimistic about the final agreement. For example, here in Beijing the Communist Party's media mouthpiece Xinhua wire service is already stressing in its commentaries that coal is ""the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation"". It may sound like that is just stating the obvious - but such wording from Xinhua represents a transmission of the party line across the country: coal is the biggest part of the problem! Beijing knows that ultimately the writing is on the wall for coal, but it's the speed of its phase out which matters to the Chinese government. It believes that the most developed countries got the world into this problem in the first place - enriching themselves along the way - so now argues that countries like China need to be cut more slack to catch up. What's also being stressed here from the Chinese delegation has been the perceived shortfall from advanced countries to deliver on their promises to provide finance and technological support for developing countries to help them move to cleaner energy. Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin, who headed China's team in Glasgow, said he hoped developed countries could ""make further efforts to honour their commitments, enhancing support for developing countries, instead of merely urging other parties to raise their ambitions"". One of the main goals set out by COP26 was to ensure we do not go above 1.5C by 2100 - which scientists have said would limit the worst impacts of climate change. As part of the agreement struck in Glasgow, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Extreme weather events such as flooding and wild fires are already experienced by millions around the world Scientists have warned if global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,externalThe world is currently 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century. Under the Glasgow climate pact: Countries were asked to republish their climate action plans by the end of next year, with more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 There is an emphasis on the need for developed countries to increase the money they give to those already suffering the effects of climate change - beyond the current $100bn annual target The language about coal has been included for the first time ever in a global climate deal A pledge in a previous draft to ""phase out"" coal was instead watered down to a commitment to ""phase down"" coal The final deal agreed on has been met with some criticism. Ed Miliband, shadow business and energy secretary, told the Sky News' Trevor Phillips programme that ""keeping 1.5 degrees alive is frankly in intensive care"". He said the world's task was to halve global emissions by 2030 and said that despite some progress in Glasgow ""the world is only probably about 20% or 25% of the way to that goal"". But Mr Miliband commended Mr Sharma on his efforts. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UN's climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, described the mention of coal and fossil fuels as a ""huge step forward"". But she added that ""we need to also balance out the social consequences for so many people around the world, especially in the poor countries"". Lord Deben, the chairman of the Climate Change Committee, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the UK should negotiate future trade deals with ""some congruence with the world battle on climate change"" - pointing to Australia as an example. ""I hope our government will also recognise that you really cannot sign trade deals on the basis that Australia can do nothing to insist on their farmers meeting the challenge of climate change and then export their goods to Britain,"" he said. He added that India's push to change the language on coal was a ""misuse"" of the process. A report by the Climate Action Tracker group has calculated that at the current rate, the world is heading for 2.4C of warming by 2100. If no action was taken, scientists believe global warming could exceed 4C in the future. This could lead to devastating heatwaves, droughts, extreme rainfall and floods. As a result, millions of people could lose their homes to rising sea levels. In addition to this, the change in climate could lead to irreversible damage to our ecosystem - with the mass extinction of animal and plant species.

Alok Sharma is asked whether he thinks he failed in not pushing for more on coal in the final deal - and if he is now eyeing up a new cabinet post after chairing the COP26 summit. He replies that he would have ""preferred stronger language"" on coal, but is glad a commitment was included at all. He dodges the question on his job, saying he will ""leave that to the prime minister"". Boris Johnson doesn't give any clues on where Sharma could go next - pointing out he still has another year to go in his role. He does not address a question on whether the row over lobbying and MPs' behaviour at Westminster held back the summit, adding that leaders have now ""given ourselves the tools"" to tackle climate warming. And asked to rate the final deal out of 10, the prime minister replies: ""the outcome is over six out of 10"". Addressing the concession over the language on coal in the agreement, COP26 President Alok Sharma says ""you phase down before you phase out"". He reiterates this is the first agreement to mention ambitions to reduce the use of the fossil fuel at all. ""It means at future COPs we can push further on the issue,"" he says. Asked about his emotional reaction to the deal, when he was visibly seen holding back tears, Sharma says it was ""just relief"" that the deal had come off - and admitted he'd had ""about six hours' sleep in three days"". Asked about the UN Secretary General's AntÃ³nio Guterres comments saying the deal would fail to keep global warming bellow 1.5C, Boris Johnson says Glasgow has provided ""hope"". He emphasises the agreement has led to many countries focusing on ""very specific deliverables"" of how to reduce their emissions. Johnson adds the conference has created a roadmap to ""plot the way ahead"" and he was optimistic it could be done. Boris Johnson is asked about his comments prior to the summit that the world was at ""one minute to midnight"" on climate change. The PM replies that it would be a ""fatal mistake"" to ""think we've in any way cracked this thing"" - but he is much more optimistic now about the pace of change. Alok Sharma is asked whether China and India have ""let down"" the world by pushing for the commitment on coal to be watered down - saying it would be phased down, rather than phased out. He replies that they will ""have to explain themselves"" to developing countries affected by climate change. But he says getting a commitment on phasing down coal was nevertheless a success - noting it's the first time this has been made in the final text of a COP agreement. If no deal had been agreed, then vulnerable and developing countries would have been left without support, Alok Sharma says. He adds the key passages on financial support, called ""loss and damage"" in the agreement, were critical for nations already suffering from the effects of climate change. ""I can tell you there was that one hour where I really felt there was a chance there we were not going to get this deal over the line,"" he says. COP26 President Alok Sharma emphasises that the agreement should be considered ""historic"". He explains that a matter of a few weeks ago, nobody would have believed they would be able to even get a mention of coal in the climate agreement - but they managed it in just two weeks. The PM says that success in combatting climate change is ""totally contingent"" on governments around the world sticking to their commitments on reducing emissions. He adds that he believes in a matter of a few years it will soon become ""totally unacceptable"" to build a new coal fired power station. In response to a question on whether the conference could be considered a success, Boris Johnson says the conference was ""never going to be able to halt climate change"" alone. However he adds the conference means we were able to ""equip ourselves with the tools""  to do so.  Wrapping up his opening comments, Boris Johnson says the COP summit has succeeded in slowing the rate of global warming - but this will still remain ""far too much"". But he says that after the conference, humanity is ""heading in the right direction"". Boris Johnson notes, however, that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction to the conference is âtinged with disappointment"". He says ultimately, it is up to countries to make their own commitments on climate change. He says that whilst the host country can ""cajole"", it cannot ""force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"". âSadly thatâs the nature of diplomacy,"" adds the PM. There's been a lot of talk about the agreement on coal - after COP countries only committed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But the prime minister says this is nevertheless a ""fantastic achievement"" - and the conference has ""sounded the death knell for coal power"". UK PM Boris Johnson gets the press conference under way by saying the COP26 agreement was ""truly historic"". He says the agreement was the ""kind of game-changing agreement that world needed to see"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The boss of the world's second biggest airline has said that tackling climate change will make flying more expensive. ""Over time, it's going to cost us all more, but it's the right approach that we must take,"" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian told the BBC. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of the carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to the International Energy Agency. Critics argue the best way to reduce them is by flying less. Atlanta-based Delta says that after spending $30m (Â£22.4m) a year on carbon-offsetting it has been carbon neutral since March 2020. It has also pledged to spend $1bn over the next decade to cancel out all the emissions it creates. More fuel-efficient planes, sustainable aviation fuels and removing carbon from the atmosphere are some of the ways it hopes to achieve this. Reducing carbon emissions is crucial if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as agreed in Paris in 2015, and has been the focus of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. Andreas Schafer, professor of energy and transport at University College London, says it will ""cost trillions rather than billions of dollars"" to move the global aviation sector to net zero carbon emissions. What is the Paris climate agreement? Seven ways to curb climate change How adjusting flight plans can help the climate Preliminary results from his team's research suggest airfares would need to increase by 10%-20% to cover the costs. ""In the short-term, government support will be needed with those costs as decarbonising aviation will be extremely challenging, and current efforts will need to be scaled up dramatically"", says Prof Schafer. Moving aviation to net zero carbon emissions is the right approach, says Ed Bastian Mr Bastian concedes it is an ambitious goal that his airline won't be able to achieve alone. ""It's the biggest long-term challenge this industry faces,"" he said. ""We're in an industry that's classified as hard to decarbonise because we don't have the bio-fuels or the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) en masse yet that we're going to need."" Jet fuel from thin air: Aviation's hope or hype? Climate change: Jet fuel from waste 'dramatically lowers' emissions Delta aims to be using 10% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030. Many airlines and fuel companies are investing in SAFs. Other technologies being developed involve turning food waste into jet fuel and using carbon dioxide pulled out of the air. However, these still cost more than traditional jet fuels and the quantities needed are also seen as problematic. According to the US government, global demand for jet fuel is set tomore than double,externalby 2050 . The number of passenger flights is set to jump from a pre-pandemic 4.5 billion to 10 billion by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA director general Willie Walsh told the BBC that while creating the levels of SAF production needed was a big challenge, ""it is perfectly possible if industry and governments work together"". ""Production increases will bring the cost down to competitive levels. We've seen similar increases in the development of solar and wind power in recent decades."" Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global carbon emissions but demand is set to grow At the UN climate change summit in Glasgow,23 countries have pledged,externalto work together to get the aviation industry to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  More efficient energy use, sustainable aviation fuels and electric aeroplanes are all part of their ambitions. However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace says the agreement is ""brazen greenwashing"". ""This announcement is full of scams like offsetting, and excessive optimism on so-called 'sustainable aviation fuels' and future aircraft designs,"" says Greenpeace's Klara Maria Schenk. ""But it lacks the one thing that's needed to deliver the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C which is tangible action to prioritise green travel and reduce flights."" This video can not be played World's largest all-electric plane takes flight Whilst many businesses and individuals have used the pandemic as a chance to re-evaluate their carbon footprints, Mr Bastian thinks the number of flights will return to pre-pandemic levels. ""All forms of travel are on the way back. Families are the part of the travelling public that we're most happy to see, because there's been some really difficult stories over time of families not being able to connect for long [periods]"". Coronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024 Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' Pandemic fills up Australian airline storage Business travel is also returning because video meetings can't replace everything, says Mr Bastian. ""There's a real unity and sense of purpose that we have when people get back together in person"". That desire to travel helped Delta to report a $194m profit in the three months to the end of September, its first profit since the pandemic began. Demand for domestic air travel has helped Delta Air Lines return to profitability Before the pandemic Delta was the world's second biggest airline, flying 200 million passengers in 2019. As of September it was operating at 71% of its pre-pandemic capacity. The recovery in its domestic US market has been fastest, with long-haul routes to Asia the slowest. That echoes the pattern seen in arecent forecast from planemaker Boeing, which forecast a full recovery of global aviation would take until 2024. Like other airlines,Delta has received billions in government supportto get through the pandemic, but is hopeful of a brighter future now theUS has reopened its bordersto international travellers. This video can not be played Watch: Emotional families reunite as US lifts travel ban Mr Bastian says this may take some adjusting to and there may be long queues at airports as Covid vaccines and paperwork are checked. However, he is confident in the airline's outlook and says the pandemic was ""an opportunity to invest in our future"".

"This video can not be played Alok Sharma fights back tears as Glasgow Climate Pact reached A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they ""have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication"". In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. Evasive words, but deal shows progress He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"". ""There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it wasalways unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"", but that the ""starting pistol"" had been fired. How the final day unfolded Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was ""hanging by a thread"". ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero."" As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,external Main achievements of the deal: Re-visiting emissions-cutting plans next year to try to keep 1.5C target reachable The first ever inclusion of a commitment to limit coal use Increased financial help for developing countries ""We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,"" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it."" Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century. ""They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,"" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned. ""This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,"" he said. Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was ""nothing less than a scandal"". ""Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,"" she said. Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (Â£75bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed. It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped."" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

"Layla Moran insisted ""it will not happen again"" Two MPs have admitted using their Commons offices for non-parliamentary paid meetings. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran and Conservative Crispin Blunt appeared via video link on a panel discussing political prisoners in Saudi Arabia. The event last November was organised by law firm Bindmans LLP. According to the register of financial interests for MPs, Ms Moran was paid Â£3,000 by the firm and Mr Blunt received Â£6,000. Bindmans described the meeting as an ""evidence session"", which heard from human rights organisations and family members of detained Saudi Arabian activists. Under House of Commons rules, MPs must not use the parliamentary facilities for non-parliamentary work. Which MPs have second jobs? MPs under scrutiny over their second jobs Ms Moran, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, has apologised and said she ""deeply regretted"" it. In a statement, Ms Moran said: ""With MPs from other parties, I worked on the detention of political prisoners in Saudi Arabia with Bindmans. ""I deeply regret that I 'zoomed' in for one meeting from my office in Parliament when Covid restrictions were in place. ""I take full responsibility for this and it will not happen again."" Crispin Blunt said MPs were being subjected to an ""absurd feeding frenzy"" Mr Blunt, who represents Reigate, told the BBC it did not occur to him that there would be an issue using a room in Parliament at no cost to the taxpayer. He said the MPs on the panel were discussing a matter of ""serious public concern"" and emphasised he would accept the findings of any investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner if a complaint was made. He told the BBC: ""It was a parliamentary panel, although one not formed as either an all-party-parliamentary group or a select committee. He added: ""I have chaired three of these detention review panels over recent years and as the panel members were all parliamentarians, each panel cross party, advised by legal counsel, examining matters of serious public and human rights concern - that on any reasonable interpretation the work would meet a definition of being 'parliamentary'."" Mr Blunt continued that while the panel members had been paid a fee for their time and expertise devoted to the work, it had been declared in the usual way, and the process was open to public scrutiny throughout. He said he thought MPs were being subjected to an ""absurd feeding frenzy"" by the media in relation to their additional work that was now ""doing wider damage to the institution of Parliament by creating a wholly inaccurate image in the mind of the wider public"". Politicians are allowed to have second jobs outside Westminster but the work they do has come under the spotlight sinceTory MP Owen Paterson, who has since stood down, broke lobbying ruleswhen working as a consultant. And questions have been raised about Conservative MP andformer attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, who earned about Â£900,000last year through his work outside Parliament. He notched up the wage bill in his work as a lawyer, including travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry.

"There have been warnings from doctors and the UK's Health Security Agency that waning immunity is leading to deaths even of people who have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. So how much protection are we left with? Let's nail some basics. The immune system has two big roles - to stop us getting infected, and if that fails, to clear our bodies of an infection. I want you to stretch your imagination and picture your immune system as a medieval castle. Surrounding the castle is a hostile and ruthless army of coronaviruses desperate to break in. Your first defence is an outer wall patrolled by a legion of archers. These are your body's neutralising antibodies. If they can hold the viral army off, then you won't get infected. But if the walls crumble and the antibody-archers wander off, then the virus is in. It has stormed the castle and you now have an infection. Think of your body's defences like Bamburgh Castle - with the walls offering different types of protection Yet all is not lost. There are still troops inside the fortified keep at the heart of the castle. These are your memory B and memory T cells. Like knights on horseback they can rally the troops, lead the immunological charge and send the hostile invaders packing. The Covid vaccines have been training your body's troops - this includes both antibodies and those memory cells that react to an infection - to take on coronavirus. At least one of those defenders is waning and this is not a surprise. This happens after every vaccine or infection. ""There is good evidence that antibodies are waning with time, and that has left us with obvious defects,"" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh. The desertion of these antibody-archers from their posts, has been made worse by the emergence of the Delta variant. It is just better at spreading and getting into our body - it's like a new army rocking up outside the walls, but this one's brought a cave troll and siege weapons. Imagine your antibodies are a legion of archers along your body's defensive outer wall You may have noticed the consequences of this yourself - people you know who have been double vaccinated, but have still caught Covid. Research,which has not been formally published,external, estimates that the AstraZeneca vaccine reduced any form of Covid symptom by 66% shortly afer the second dose. Five months later that figure had fallen to 47%. For Pfizer, the numbers fell from 90% to 70%. This is obviously an issue for governments trying to contain the spread of the virus. Whether the viral invasion will cause severe damage as it tries to burn and pillage its way through your body now depends on your second line of defence. However, the vaccines are now keeping fewer people out of hospital. Prof Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol and a government vaccine adviser, says: ""We are seeing significant numbers of unvaccinated and vaccinated people coming into hospital. ""The protection you have against relatively mild infection wanes more quickly, but protection from getting into hospital or killing you wanes more slowly."" The greater risk of needing hospital care or even of dying is concentrated in the elderly. The overwhelming majority of deaths in people who have been double vaccinated have been among those over 70. People in that age group are still far better off than someone who they share a birthday with, but turned down the jab. And as you can see, the risks in younger age groups who have been double vaccinated are small. The constant onslaught of time ages every cell in our body - including those that make up the immune system. Getting older makes it harder to train the immune system with vaccines, and it is slower to respond when an infection arrives. It may be that now antibodies have waned far enough, this frailty in the immune system is being exposed. ""It's possible older people initially had protection, but now those antibodies have weakened, they may not have the second line of defence,"" says Prof Eleanor Riley. ""That may be why we're seeing elderly, fragile people dying despite two doses."" All of this is layered on top of the fact that with age tends to come ill health. Since the start of the pandemic, age has been one of the biggest factors in how likely you are to die of it. The oldest people were also the first to be vaccinated, so their immunity has had more time to wane. People who start with a weakened immune system, including cancer and organ transplant patients, have a subtly different problem as their bodies do not respond as well to vaccines. ""Their antibodies are waning at a similar rate to healthy people, but they obviously start off at a lower point,"" says Dr Helen Parry, from the University of Birmingham It is worth noting there are important differences between the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that have donemost of the work protecting people in the UK,external. ""They seem to be good at different parts of the immune system,"" says Dr Parry. ""The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer) are really potent at antibody formation, the AstraZeneca vaccine is really good at generating T-cell responses."" To go back to the castle, Pfizer may be better at manning the outer walls with archers to keep Covid out, while AstraZeneca is good for the inner keep. The good news is that even with waning, these are still exceptionally good vaccines. At the start of the pandemic, people were dreaming of a vaccine that could cut deaths by 50%. Even with waning and in the most at-risk age groups, that protection is still in the region of 80-90%. ""Even the worst cases, six months later, are better than what we hoped for when we designed these vaccines,"" says Prof Finn. ""They're still really good."" The even better news is that there is already evidence that the booster campaign - which has reached more than 11 million people in the UK - is making a difference. Data from theOffice for National Statistics shows antibody levels,external- those first defenders against infection - have gone up again in the oldest age groups. ""Giving a booster to the most elderly is a slam dunk,"" says Prof Finn. Everyone is now closely monitoring the figures to see if this brings down the number of cases and deaths.

"This video can not be played Alok Sharma fights back tears as Glasgow Climate Pact reached A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they ""have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication"". In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. Evasive words, but deal shows progress He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"". ""There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it wasalways unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"", but that the ""starting pistol"" had been fired. How the final day unfolded Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was ""hanging by a thread"". ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero."" As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,external Main achievements of the deal: Re-visiting emissions-cutting plans next year to try to keep 1.5C target reachable The first ever inclusion of a commitment to limit coal use Increased financial help for developing countries ""We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,"" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it."" Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century. ""They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,"" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned. ""This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,"" he said. Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was ""nothing less than a scandal"". ""Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,"" she said. Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (Â£75bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed. It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped."" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells a news conference the COP26 deal sounds the ""death knell for coal power"" Speaking at Downing Street, he says his delight at the progress made is tinged with disappointment India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase down"" not the ""phase out"" of coal power COP26 president Alok Sharma denies the change of language represents a failure - and says there was a chance a deal would not be made at all The Glasgow agreement is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change But UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa says the agreement reached at the climate summit is a huge step forward Edited by Lauren Turner Boris Johnson and Alok Sharma lauded the outcome of the summit at a press conference on Sunday We're ending our live coverage for today. Before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main COP26 headlines:  Today's live page coverage has been written by Jo Couzens, Alice Cuddy, Adam Durbin, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Becky Morton and Paul Seddon. It was edited by George Bowden and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst In several ways, Boris Johnson's government will be congratulating
itself on the successes of the conference. The UK won praise for its diplomacy. One British innovation was particularly effective. The COP process under UN rules is always the lowest common
denominator for consensus decisions. The UKâs response was to launch a series of incentivesoutsidethe conference hall, then bolt them on to the COP. They forged coalitions of the willing â not just other
progressive governments but also business and civil society. Initiatives included action on cars, finance, forests,
methane - and one on coal that was much more aggressive than the weaker
language adopted by the whole COP. These bolt-ons will make a real difference. But what about the COP itself? The avowed intent was
to keep alive the prospect of holding global average temp rise at 1.5C above pre-industrial times. The UK said it just achieved that goal. Believing in this requires faith that governments will deliver
on all their promises, and produce tougher carbon-cutting strategies for next
year. Environmentalists doubt it, given that the government is
planning more oil drilling, and Chancellor Rishi Sunakâs budget made it cheaper
to drive and fly in the UK â and didn't mention climate change at all. In the US, the American president is struggling to get his green laws
passed through Congress - and his trillion-dollar infrastructure bill will
stimulate more emissions by investing in roads, bridges and airports. It will also produce millions of tonnes of carbon emissions by making the necessary steel and cement. So, in reality, a more realistic temperature rise is likely to
be much higher than 1.5C - maybe well over the 2C mark that is accepted as
being catastrophic. Even the 1.1C rise we have experienced already is
producing dangerous extremes of weather. At the moment, the climate is changing faster than the
politics. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson told this afternoon's news conference: ""Greenpeace, and I donât want Greenpeace now to repudiate
this, Greenpeace said that as a result of COP26 the era of coal is
ending."" He was reacting to disappointment over the watering down of
language around coal in the COP26 agreement - changing the phrase 
""phase-out"" of ""unabated"" coal merely to ""phase down"". Reacting to the agreement, the international executive
director of GreenpeaceJennifer Morgan said,external:
âItâs meek, itâs weak, and the 1.5C goal is only just alive, but a signal has
been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters.â She went on to say that ""if youâre a coal company
executive this COP saw a bad outcome"". Read more on what's
been agreedhere. Weâve just been hearing from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and COP26 President Alok Sharma. Hereâs a recap of some of the key points:  You can read more in our main storyhere.   Just a bit more on the government and transport. When he was asked how he got back from Glasgow so quickly, COP26 President Alok Sharma was quick to assure everyone he took the train. In response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson joked Sharma was ""showing off"" his green credentials. On the more serious question of emissions linked to air travel, Sharma emphasised it is a ""personal choice"". ""What you need to do is incentivise people, I've always believed in carrot rather than stick."" He added the government is investing in developing sustainable aviation fuels. The panel are asked what they will do ""personally"" to help curb climate change. The PM says he ""used to go everywhere by bike"", which ""made some small contribution"". Alok Sharma had been asked how he got to London so quickly - he says he travelled by train and electric car. Boris Johnson also sends his best wishes to the Queen, who did not attend this morning's Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph after a back sprain. He says he just wants to ""reassure everybody"" by saying she was ""very well"" when he saw her for his weekly official audience with her in Windsor on Wednesday. That marks the end of the conference. COP26 President Alok Sharma echoes the prime minister's praise for India's work on climate change. He emphasises the Indian government had committed ""really quite ambitious"" targets on reducing emissions, with plans for 50% of their power to come from renewables by 2030. ""And I think we should commend them for that,"" he adds. Asked if he would make more stringent climate change targets part of any trade deal with India, Boris Johnson says he doesn't see a reason to introduce them into any negotiations. The PM adds the UK has a ""great relationship"" with India. India, alongside China, were the main voice behind the concession on the language around coal introduced late on yesterday. Johnson says India came up with ""some really impressive"" commitments on decarbonising. Alok Sharma is asked whether he thinks he failed in not pushing for more on coal in the final deal - and if he is now eyeing up a new cabinet post after chairing the COP26 summit. He replies that he would have ""preferred stronger language"" on coal, but is glad a commitment was included at all. He dodges the question on his job, saying he will ""leave that to the prime minister"". Boris Johnson doesn't give any clues on where Sharma could go next - pointing out he still has another year to go in his role. He does not address a question on whether the row over lobbying and MPs' behaviour at Westminster held back the summit, adding that leaders have now ""given ourselves the tools"" to tackle climate warming. And asked to rate the final deal out of 10, the prime minister replies: ""the outcome is over six out of 10"". Addressing the concession over the language on coal in the agreement, COP26 President Alok Sharma says ""you phase down before you phase out"". He reiterates this is the first agreement to mention ambitions to reduce the use of the fossil fuel at all. ""It means at future COPs we can push further on the issue,"" he says. Asked about his emotional reaction to the deal, when he was visibly seen holding back tears, Sharma says it was ""just relief"" that the deal had come off - and admitted he'd had ""about six hours' sleep in three days"". Asked about the UN Secretary General's AntÃ³nio Guterres comments saying the deal would fail to keep global warming bellow 1.5C, Boris Johnson says Glasgow has provided ""hope"". He emphasises the agreement has led to many countries focusing on ""very specific deliverables"" of how to reduce their emissions. Johnson adds the conference has created a roadmap to ""plot the way ahead"" and he was optimistic it could be done. Boris Johnson is asked about his comments prior to the summit that the world was at ""one minute to midnight"" on climate change. The PM replies that it would be a ""fatal mistake"" to ""think we've in any way cracked this thing"" - but he is much more optimistic now about the pace of change. Alok Sharma is asked whether China and India have ""let down"" the world by pushing for the commitment on coal to be watered down - saying it would be phased down, rather than phased out. He replies that they will ""have to explain themselves"" to developing countries affected by climate change. But he says getting a commitment on phasing down coal was nevertheless a success - noting it's the first time this has been made in the final text of a COP agreement. If no deal had been agreed, then vulnerable and developing countries would have been left without support, Alok Sharma says. He adds the key passages on financial support, called ""loss and damage"" in the agreement, were critical for nations already suffering from the effects of climate change. ""I can tell you there was that one hour where I really felt there was a chance there we were not going to get this deal over the line,"" he says. COP26 President Alok Sharma emphasises that the agreement should be considered ""historic"". He explains that a matter of a few weeks ago, nobody would have believed they would be able to even get a mention of coal in the climate agreement - but they managed it in just two weeks. The PM says that success in combatting climate change is ""totally contingent"" on governments around the world sticking to their commitments on reducing emissions. He adds that he believes in a matter of a few years it will soon become ""totally unacceptable"" to build a new coal fired power station. In response to a question on whether the conference could be considered a success, Boris Johnson says the conference was ""never going to be able to halt climate change"" alone. However he adds the conference means we were able to ""equip ourselves with the tools""  to do so.  Wrapping up his opening comments, Boris Johnson says the COP summit has succeeded in slowing the rate of global warming - but this will still remain ""far too much"". But he says that after the conference, humanity is ""heading in the right direction"". Boris Johnson notes, however, that despite the achievements of the summit, his reaction to the conference is âtinged with disappointment"". He says ultimately, it is up to countries to make their own commitments on climate change. He says that whilst the host country can ""cajole"", it cannot ""force sovereign nations to do what they do not wish to do"". âSadly thatâs the nature of diplomacy,"" adds the PM. There's been a lot of talk about the agreement on coal - after COP countries only committed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But the prime minister says this is nevertheless a ""fantastic achievement"" - and the conference has ""sounded the death knell for coal power"". UK PM Boris Johnson gets the press conference under way by saying the COP26 agreement was ""truly historic"". He says the agreement was the ""kind of game-changing agreement that world needed to see"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pacific Island Tonga faces being wiped out by rising sea levels The climate deal struck in Glasgow plans to reduce the world's reliance on coal and promises more money to help poorer countries cope with the impacts of a warming planet. Campaigners on the frontline of climate change have been speaking to the BBC what that means for them. Largely pessimistic about the outcome of the summit, they passionately explained their fears that political agreements aren't enough to save their homes and cultures. New global climate deal struck in Glasgow How the final day unfolded Elizabeth KitÃ© is an youth leader in Nuku'alofa, Tonga. The deal doesn't do enough to save her home in the Pacific islands from drowning, she says. The survival of their island is at stake. She calls the summit a stage for big countries to ""flex how much they can pay small nations"". She wanted to hear rich countries acknowledge responsibility for historic greenhouse gas emissions. ""But they talk like promising money is a favour for us -  it is not,"" she says. She became emotional when she was describing how proud she was to watch Pacific Island negotiators fight hard at the summit. Last week Foreign Minister Simon Kofe of Tuvalu gave a press conference standing in the sea, to highlight rising sea levels. Elizabeth KitÃ© doesn't think the deal goes far enough to help countries like hers ""We are friendly people and usually very peaceful. It's unnatural for us to come out so strong - and I'm sad the deal doesn't reflect how hard we tried,"" she explains. She is frustrated by what she feels is a lack of urgency and immediate actions: ""It's like rich countries are saying, 'Yes we'll let the islands die off and we'll try to figure something out along the way.'"" How might decisions at COP26 change our lives? Seven ways to curb climate change Simple guide to climate change But she sees signs of progress. It's the first time fossil fuel and coal have been included in the texts. And she says the agreement to discuss separate funding for loss and damage - money to help countries pay for the damage caused by climate change they can't adapt to - is another positive step. Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladesh's Friday for Future movement. He leads young people as they grow up in a low-lying country that is extremely vulnerable to climate change and feeling the dire effects now. As the agreement was gavelled, he said he felt that youth were recognised for the first time at COP. But he concluded ""the end result is nothing"". He was in Glasgow for two weeks and hoped to take back good news to the most affected communities. But he's leaving with feelings of helplessness and betrayal. ""These empty pledges will not protect our people from crisis,"" he explains. He welcomes the news on loss and damage, but he says the voices of the most affected people were silenced. He blamesthe fossil fuel industry representatives at the summit. What climate summit means for one woman in Bangladesh Children in Bangladesh will still be forced out of education and communities will be displaced by rising sea levels, he fears. Edwin Mumbere in Uganda lives in the shadow of the Rwenzori mountains where glacial melt and flooding is putting rural communities at huge risk. Now 29, he became an activist when he saw the snow disappearing from the high ground. He works with communities to bring solar power to the area and educates them about their rights as a pipeline is built nearby. The people under threat from a melting glacier He calls the Glasgow deal disappointing for Uganda and thinks it makes no real difference to the 100,000 people in his communities. ""Real solutions have not been put in place despite us proving to them that climate change is real,"" he says. His main concern is the lack of urgency in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He sees new oil and gas exploration being established in Uganda and other parts of Africa and says that the Glasgow agreement won't stop that. ""Pledges to give money are being made and the same countries are also investing in projects that are seriously increasing the carbon emissions - it's truly a double standard,"" he says. Jon Bonifacio, 23, studied biology before he became an activist in Metro Manila, Philippines. ""It's a lot of 'one step forward, two steps backwards'"", he said about the deal. With 197 parties to the UN summit, compromise between countries with vastly different priorities is the route to agreement. But he says this compromise is ""completely unjust"" for countries on the climate frontline. ""We will continue to experience the climate crisis acutely and in the long term,"" he says. He is distrustful of the language used in the text about coal and fossil fuels because he thinks it provides get-out clauses to the biggest polluters. Like many activists who have long campaigned for better support for developing nations, he says the promise to increase the money given to poorer countries represents good progress. He'll go back to Manila and keep fighting for change: ""Even if it was a perfect agreement, it's still up to citizens and activists to pressure their governments into action,"" he says.

In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped."" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

"Scotland's health service could face an exodus of consultants, a leading doctor has warned. Dr Graeme Eunson, chairman of the British Medical Association Scotland's consultant committee, also said he cannot recall a time in his career ""when things have been this tough"". The consultant paediatrician said ""rock bottom morale"" as well as concerns over pension tax charges was to blame. Ministers have warned the NHS is facing its toughest ever winter. The Scottish government hasput in a Â£300m funding packageto help the health services get through what it described as the ""extremely challenging"" months ahead. Hospitals secure military aid extension 'Nursing shifts left me inconsolable' Â£300m fund to help Scots NHS through 'challenging' winter Butwriting in a blog,external, Dr Eunson warned the NHS in Scotland ""is in full blown crisis"". He said: ""What I hear consistently is that consultants are prepared to stick at it for this winter and while we remain in pandemic. ""And that's backed up by evidence from our recent survey of doctors following this year's pay award. ""When you analyse those figures, and filter out those too young to take voluntary early retirement (VER), some 70% of consultants asked said they were planning to take VER - either prompted (19.2%), or confirmed (30%) by the pay award, or were going to do it regardless of pay (21%). ""If this is in any way representative - and we fear it is - and we don't act urgently, then the NHS faces an exodus of consultants from NHS Scotland in the near future."" In August, doctors and dental staff in Scotland wereawarded a 3% pay rise backdated to 1 April. Armed forces personnel have been helping some of Scotland's health boards, with tasks such as rolling out the Covid vaccination programme. in recent months Dr Eunson cited an ongoingcomplex row over tax bills for consultants' pensionswhich he said has left some colleagues facing the prospect of retiring or working less to ensure they are not out of pocket. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has previously said the health service was experiencing ""significant pressure"" because of Covid admissions and a backlog in care built up over the course of the pandemic. Military assistance is in place at a number of health boards across the country and waiting times for A&E remain at record levels. Dr Eunson added that ""stop-gap solutions may just help us get through this winter - although that remains to be seen - but even beyond that the picture looks bleak."" A Scottish government spokesperson said the health secretary meets regularly with the BMA where issues related to the workforce are discussed. ""We recognise the challenges health and social care services are experiencing,"" they added. ""That is why we have announced a record Â£300m of new investment in measures to help services deal with system pressures over winter. ""To ensure our health and social care staff can continue to be able to best care for us, we need to make sure we continue to care for them by looking after their wellbeing this winter. This is why we are investing an additional Â£4m in staff wellbeing measures, in addition to the Â£8m made available through the NHS Recovery Plan. ""As well as direct workforce investment, we are introducing measures to maximise capacity in our hospitals, reduce delayed discharges and improve social care pay. These measures will ensure patients are cared for in the right setting within their community and alleviate pressures on frontline health services."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?
