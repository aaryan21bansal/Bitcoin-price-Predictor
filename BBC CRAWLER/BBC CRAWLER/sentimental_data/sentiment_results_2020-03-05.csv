"This video can not be played Warren drops out: ""Little girls will have to wait four more years for a woman president."" Senator Elizabeth Warren has ended her presidential campaign following disappointing Super Tuesday results. A favourite of the liberal left, the Massachusetts senator, 70, was once a front-runner in the Democratic field. Ms Warren said she needed some time to decide on another candidate to support. The Democratic contest to take on President Donald Trump in November is now seen as a two-horse race between former Vice-President Joe Biden, 77, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 78. Who are the Democrats vying to take on Trump? Where did it go wrong for Elizabeth Warren? Listen to Americast: Warren is out! Despite early momentum for her campaign, she failed to win a single state in the first primary contests of 2020, even her own. With Ms Warren's exit, Mr Biden and Mr Sanders are left in a two-way horse race With Ms Warren's departure, a Democratic race that began with a record high of female candidates is now effectively left to two male front-runners, who both swiftly praised her and her campaign. ""One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years,"" she said alongside her husband outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Thursday. ""That's going to be hard."" Now that she has dropped out, post-mortems on Elizabeth Warren's campaign have begun. Many point to her shifting message on universal government-run healthcare, a topic that was never a top priority for her. It caused liberals to stick with Bernie Sanders and centrists to have their doubts about her. Others suggest she was harmed by hesitant performances in the debates that mattered - before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. Her strongest effort came with her vivisection of Michael Bloomberg in Las Vegas, which was buried by Sanders' win in the Nevada caucuses - and too late to influence the outcome. Then there's the issue of sexism. Four years after Democrats chose Hillary Clinton to be their nominee, voters may have been reluctant to opt for another woman atop the ticket. This reluctance was seldom explicit, instead being raised in concerns about ""likability"" or ""electability"" and what other, hypothetical, swing-state voters might think of her. It also sometimes reared its head in Warren's media coverage, where her healthcare backtracking received considerably more criticism than similar pirouettes and hedging by Pete Buttigieg and other male candidates. The US will elect its first woman president someday, but it will not be in 2020. Read Anthony's full analysis This video can not be played Ms Warren said Mr Sanders had told her in 2018 that a woman could not win the US presidency Ms Warren was the first major Democratic candidate to announce her plans for a presidential bid. Early in the race, her policy-centric approach - ""I've got a plan for that"" was a favourite refrain - seemed effective. Can't buy me love: Where did Bloomberg's money go? Are voters biased against women candidates? Super Tuesday results in full In October last year, she peaked in most national polls until a difficult TV debate. She was unable to say on stage whether she would raise taxes to pay for her proposal to expand government-run healthcare insurance for Americans. Throughout her candidacy, President Trump nicknamed her ""Pocahontas"" after she claimed to have had Native-American ancestry. This video can not be played The US president makes a joke about Senator Elizabeth Warren in front of Native Americans. In an effort to prove her heritage, she took a DNA test, but only ended up angering tribal leaders, who argued that genetics do not determine cultural identity. On Thursday, Mr Trump again tweeted his nickname for her, adding that by dividing her party's liberal vote, she had ""probably cost [Bernie Sanders] the nomination"". Ms Warren's exit follows closely behind ex-mayors Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, and Senator Amy Klobuchar. Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is the sole remaining female Democratic presidential candidate, though she polls at barely one per cent.

"The report analysed areas of bias such as politics, education, reproductive rights and integrity A new UN report has found almost 90% of men and women hold some sort of bias against females. The ""Gender Social Norms"" index analysed biases in areas such as politics and education in 75 countries. Globally, close to 50% of men said they had more right to a job than women. Almost a third of respondents thought it was acceptable for men to hit their partners. There are no countries in the world with gender equality,external, the study found. Zimbabwe had the highest amount of bias with only 0.27% of people reporting no gender bias at all. At the other end of the scale was Andorra where 72% of people reported no bias. In Zimbabwe, 96% of people expressed a bias against women's physical integrity - a measure covering support for violence against women and opposition to reproductive rights. In the Philippines, 91% of people held views that were detrimental to women's physical integrity. Reform and repression go hand in hand in Saudi Arabia The women who dream of power-sharing According to the report, about half of the world's men and women feel that men make better political leaders. In China, 55% of people thought men were better suited to be political leaders. Around 39% of people in the US, which is yet to have a female president, thought men made better leaders. However in New Zealand, a country that currently has a female leader, only 27% of people thought that. In New Zealand, a country which has a female leader, 27% of people think men would be better leaders than women The number of female heads of government is lower today than five years ago with only 10 women in such positions in 193 countries, down from 15 in 2014. However when it comes to seats in parliament, there is a slightly higher percentage of women in these roles. Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest share of seats in parliament held by women with 31%. South Asian countries had the lowest percentage at just 17%. Pedro ConceiÃ§Ã£o, head of UNDP's Human Development Report Office said: ""We have come a long way in recent decades to ensure that women have the same access to life's basic needs as men. ""But gender gaps are still all too obvious in other areas, particularly those that challenge power relations and are most influential in actually achieving true equality. Today. the fight about gender equality is a story of bias and prejudices."" Women are paid less than men and are much less likely to be in senior positions. Globally, 40% of people thought men made better business executives. In the UK, 25% of people thought men should have more right to a job than women and said men made better business executives than women did. In India that figure was 69%. Raquel Lagunas, UNDP gender team acting director said: ""We must act now to break through the barrier of bias and prejudices if we want to see progress at the speed and scale needed to achieve gender equality.""

"A Virgin Media database containing the personal details of 900,000 people was left unsecured and accessible online for 10 months, the company has admitted. The information was accessed ""on at least one occasion"" by an unknown user. The database, which was for marketing purposes, contained phone numbers, home and email addresses. It did not include passwords or financial details. The breach was not due to a hack or a criminal attack, but because the database had been ""incorrectly configured"" by a member of staff not following the correct procedures, Virgin Media said. The firm was alerted to the problem on Friday after it was spotted by a security researcher at TurgenSec. The company said almost all of those affected were Virgin customers with television or fixed-line telephone accounts, although the database also included some Virgin Mobile customers as well as potential customers referred by friends as part of a promotion. Virgin Media, which is owned by US cable group, Liberty Global, has informed the Information Commissioner's Office as required, and launched a forensic investigation. Four times more data breaches logged in UK Rail station wi-fi provider exposed traveller data Thousands lose broadband after workers break cable Lutz SchÃ¼ler, chief executive of Virgin Media said: ""We recently became aware that one of our marketing databases was incorrectly configured which allowed unauthorised access. We immediately solved the issue by shutting down access."" ""Protecting our customers' data is a top priority and we sincerely apologise,"" he said. ""Based upon our investigation, Virgin Media does believe that the database was accessed on at least one occasion but we do not know the extent of the access or if any information was actually used,"" Mr Schuler said. Virgin Media said it would be emailing those affected on Thursday, in order to warn them about the risks of phishing, nuisance calls and identity theft. The message will include a reminder not to click on unknown links in emails and not to provide personal details to unverified callers. Further advice was available on its website, it said. The fact that Virgin Media's database hasn't been actively hacked is reassuring for customers, but while the details are light, it sounds like human error is to blame and that is rather embarrassing for a tech firm. Ten months is a long time for all that data to have just been sitting there, waiting to be found. And while no passwords or bank details were among it, there's an awful lot of contact information for a cyber-criminal to work with. Phishing expeditions - when someone tries to get financial information out of a victim by pretending to be a company with a legitimate reason for contact - are not particularly sophisticated, but they are effective for those caught off-guard, and can be a lucrative source of income. It's unclear whether this was yet another case of unsecured data being stored on a cloud service that's easily searchable if you know how. There have been dozens of examples of this lately, including just this week a database of the personal details of people using train station wi-fi around the UK. Virgin Media has apologised and really, there's very little practical advice to offer in the light of this kind of breach, beyond the usual protocol of staying alert to any messages requesting personal information or access to any kind of finance.

"Police remained at the scene on Shore Road in Hythe on Friday morning A baby boy has been found dead in an area of woodland in Hampshire. Police are trying to trace the mother of the newborn, who was discovered close to Shore Road in Hythe, near Southampton, just after 14:00 GMT. The death is being treated as unexplained and anyone with dash-cam footage of the area at the time is asked to contact officers. Det Ch Insp Ross Toms said their priority now was to find the mother of the child. ""I have no doubt this will have been a very distressing experience for the mother of this baby,"" he said. ""Our priority right now is to ensure she receives the care and assistance she requires. ""I want to make a direct appeal to her. ""You may be very frightened right now and it is vitally important that you make contact with us or someone else."" Three police vehicles and a van are parked next to the woods being searched on Shore Road. A small generator is running by the road, powering floodlights that have been used to assist police as they combed the area overnight. Officers are very concerned for the mother's wellbeing and have asked for anyone who may have recently seen a heavily-pregnant woman in the area to get in touch.

"The long-awaited National Infrastructure Strategy is to be further delayed, and not released next week as expected, the BBC understands. The detailed 30-year plan was to be published ""alongside"" the Budget, the government said at the Queen's Speech in December. Three weeks ago, then chancellor Sajid Javid confirmed the timetable. The strategy is seen as crucial to the government's plan to ""level up"" regional disparities. The delay will allow the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to refocus the strategy, to reflect potentially larger resources available, and to incorporate the challenge of achieving ""net zero"" carbon emissions over the same 30-year timescale. Treasury sources say the overall ambition to make investments to ""level up"" the regions that also help meet commitments on climate change, remains and will be reflected in next week's Budget. The strategy, which foresees spending of Â£100bn over this parliament, will contain vital funding projections for transport, local growth and digital infrastructure. After the recent High Court ruling over Heathrow, which found expansion plans had failed to adequately account for policies on climate change, some experts say the government needs to look again at the impact of environmental policy within the provision of infrastructure. There has also been a debate about whether housing should be part of the plan. Shock resignation means test for new chancellor New roads face Heathrow-style court action threat Can the Treasury computer say 'Yes' to the north? The strategy is also the government's formal response to a now two-year-old National Infrastructure Assessment, which was the product of an impartial commission set up when David Cameron was prime minister. It should have been published last autumn. Publication of the National Infrastructure Strategy should now be expected before May, sources have suggested to the BBC. The Budget is still expected to include some green lights for high profile infrastructure projects, but the main move in this area will be to set the overall big numbers on capital spending. It is the infrastructure strategy and the Comprehensive Spending Review later this year that will determine the detailed policy. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the delay to the strategy suggested there was ""absolute chaos"" in the government. With the threat of climate change and ""an economy at risk of recession"" the UK needed large scale infrastructure spending to start immediately, he said.

"Serial rapist, pictured during his crime spree last year, Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims Probation staff were warned serial rapist Joseph McCann posed a risk of sexual offending and could have recalled him to jail, a report says. McCann wasgiven 33 life sentences after being convicted of a series of offencesagainst 11 women and children. There were eight opportunities to recall McCann to jail before he went on a spree of sex offences last year, the Serious Further Offences report found. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland promised an independent review. A summary of the report said McCann should have been kept in jail at least until the Parole Board was satisfied it was safe to let him out. It says there were eight occasions when this process - called ""recall"" - was considered. ""The most significant practice failure was the repeated failure to recall Joseph McCann or to reflect critically on earlier decisions not to recall him, in the face of both court and prison staff communicating their concerns,"" the report said. One of McCann's victims, a 39-year-old mum, said her family ""has been torn apart"". ""If he had been in prison none of this would have happened,"" she said. ""I lost my family home. I could not go back to the house. It was awful it has just been really bad emotionally."" Her 17-year-old daughter, who was also one of McCann's victims, said she ""thought the law was meant to protect the public"". ""I used to be an independent person but now I can't do anything on my own. ""I can't even sleep in my own bed . It's absolutely awful."" This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase The report disclosed that in 2011, when McCann was in prison for burglary, police shared information dating back to 2003 and suggesting McCann ""might pose a risk of sexual harm and exploitation to teenage girls"". The report added: ""It appears that the pressure on the staff throughout 2018 and the chaotic transfer of the case between numerous offender managers also significantly impacted their ability to comprehensively review McCann's historical record, and therefore to identify the previous references to sexual violence. ""Had offender managers reviewed the historical records, including the police intelligence, they might have instigated one to one work with McCann to address sexual violence. ""However, aside from this historical intelligence from 2003 and the letters intercepted by the prison in 2009, there were no more recent indicators of concerning sexual behaviour, and this failure should be viewed in this context."" When an offender under probation supervision is charged with a serious crime an internal inquiry is conducted, known as a Serious Further Offence review. These reports are usually kept under wraps, but the repercussions of the probation failings in this case were so appalling the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland recognised the clear public interest in making the document available for all to see. What is shocking, from reading the report, is that the same mistake was repeated over and over and over again. That mistake was not to activate the ""recall"" process so that Joseph McCann would have stayed in prison after being sentenced in January 2018 until the Parole Board decided he could safely be let out. Various reasons are cited for this persistent error - the threat of a legal challenge, concern about the impact of recall, communication problems - but I wonder whether fear of McCann, his bullying nature and violent temper, drove some staff to make the wrong decision. The prison holding McCann had also intercepted two sets of letters from McCann with ""disturbing contents"" which ""indicated he posed a risk of sexual harm"". McCann was released in March 2017 under strict bail conditions, but jailed again later that year. He was released at the halfway point of his sentence in February 2019, two months before he went on a sex offending spree in Watford, London, Greater Manchester and Cheshire. His victims were aged between 11 and 71 and included three women who were abducted off the street at knifepoint and repeatedly raped. The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I saw net close in on serial rapist' Alan Collins, a lawyer for some of McCann's victims, said the report made for ""hard and distressing reading"". ""It is unforgivable that the probation service, for unfathomable reasons, put McCann's perceived interests before the safety of the general public,"" he said. ""McCann posed a real risk to the public and the systems in place to manage the risk he posed were corrupted through ineffectual management and poor judgment. ""As a direct consequence, he was let loose on an unsuspecting public with terrible consequences. ""Lives have been damaged, if not ruined, as a result of what happened and the Ministry of Justice must accept full responsibility and... accept that it has to be accountable for McCann and the crimes that he committed when he should have been in prison."" This video can not be played Elderly victim of serial rapist Joseph McCann tells of her ordeal Another legal representative of some victims, Jonathan Bridge of Farleys Solicitors, said: ""The report highlights poor staff behaviour, limited productivity, poor quality of work, a high staff turnover and officers having to work with double the capacity they should have had. ""This report makes it clear that this was not a one-off mistake by the Probation Service, but a catalogue of errors spanning a number of years. ""It is absolutely clear that had the Probation Service done their job properly McCann would have been in prison and his victims would not have suffered horrific abuse and life changing psychiatric injury."" The Ministry of Justice, which carried out the review, said the chief inspector of probation Justin Russell will be asked to carry out an independent review of the National Probation Service's management of McCann and how the process of recalling offenders to prison is working. The Attorney General also said he has referred McCann's sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. A hearing will take place on 25 March. In December,describing McCann as a ""classic psychopath"",externalthe sentencing judge said his campaign of abduction and sexual abuse was unprecedented. The judge called for an investigation into failings in the probation system which had left McCann on the streets. McCann was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in jail having been convicted of: Ten counts of false imprisonment Seven counts of rape One count of rape of a child Two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent Seven counts of kidnap One count of attempted kidnap Three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity Three counts of assault by penetration One count of sexual assault Two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison Serial rapist McCann given 33 life sentences Man guilty of sex attacks on 11 women and children HM Courts Service The mosquito that rides the tube: Zapping as you zazz your zip card Record number of 999 calls for serious injuries in London in December Safety is vital for mayor's 'swimmable rivers' plan, City Hall warned Croydon has been named in the top 50 places to live in England Tough test as Town resume chase for title Which parts of Southwark saw the most crime in 2024?

"Households in the wealthiest area of England and Wales have an average disposable income four times that of the poorest, according toOffice for National Statistics estimates.,external The average figure in Mickleover North, in Derby, in 2017-18 was almost Â£40,000 more than in St Matthews and Highfields North, Leicester, estimates suggest. Derby also had the widest income gap between its richest and poorest areas. London and south-east England had the highest proportion of wealthy areas. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A quarter of London's local areas and a fifth of those in the South East were ranked in the top 10% of wealthiest areas. In contrast, in north-west England, a fifth of its local areas were in the bottom 10% for household incomes. Highgate East, Haringey and Queen's Gate, Kensington and Chelsea, were the only other local areas - apart from Mickleover North - with average household incomes over Â£50,000. In Wales, the area with the highest income was Sketty, in Swansea, where the average is estimated to be Â£39,600. This relatively high income led Swansea to have the highest divide between the most and least affluent areas in Wales. The latest ONS figures look at net household income, which is income after certain taxes have been removed and includes welfare payments. In order better to reflect living standards, they have been adjusted to take into account the size of each household and are based on a variety of data types, including surveys. In a separate publication, ONS figures show that the household income inequality across the UK has increased slightly over the two years to March 2019. Income for the poorest fifth of households fell by 4.3% a year, following four years of growth. The wealthiest fifth had a smaller decline in average income and their incomes still haven't returned to their pre-2008 crisis levels. Across all incomes, the average rate is still increasing but more slowly than before. The figures highlight the size of the challenge the government faces in its bid to ""level up"" the country as new Chancellor Rishi Sunak prepares to unveil plans in his 11 March Budget for further investment to reach the people ministers have described as ""left behind"". The latest figures estimate average income across the UK - before housing costs - is Â£29,600. Adam Corlett, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""Today's ONS data lays bare the incredibly weak living-standards growth the UK has experienced in recent years, contributing to a lost decade of income growth. ""The income squeeze, which abated in the mid-2010s, has returned in recent years. The new stagnation has affected households of all kinds, but the recent squeeze has been much worse for poorer households, who have seen big living-standards falls."" Inequality still remains lower than in the four years running up to the economic crisis in the 2008. Then, the income share of the top 1% was around 8.8%, compared with 7.6% now.

"Dozens of routes serving the UK's regions could be left without services after the collapse of Flybe. Scotland's Loganair has committed to maintaining 16 routes, but many smaller airports still face gaping holes in their schedules. The carrier, Europe's largest regional operator, went into administration early on Thursday, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. He told staff one of the firm's shareholders had pulled out at the start of this week, and he had spoken ""frantically to the government"" asking for rescue aid, but that they had run out of time on Wednesday night.

"Dozens of routes serving the UK's regions could be left without services after the collapse of Flybe. Scotland's Loganair has committed to maintaining 16 routes, but many smaller airports still face gaping holes in their schedules.

Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. He told staff one of the firm's shareholders had pulled out at the start of this week, and he had spoken ""frantically to the government"" asking for rescue aid, but that they had run out of time on Wednesday night.

"The long-awaited National Infrastructure Strategy is to be further delayed, and not released next week as expected, the BBC understands. The detailed 30-year plan was to be published ""alongside"" the Budget, the government said at the Queen's Speech in December. Three weeks ago, then chancellor Sajid Javid confirmed the timetable. The strategy is seen as crucial to the government's plan to ""level up"" regional disparities. The delay will allow the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to refocus the strategy, to reflect potentially larger resources available, and to incorporate the challenge of achieving ""net zero"" carbon emissions over the same 30-year timescale. Treasury sources say the overall ambition to make investments to ""level up"" the regions that also help meet commitments on climate change, remains and will be reflected in next week's Budget. The strategy, which foresees spending of Â£100bn over this parliament, will contain vital funding projections for transport, local growth and digital infrastructure. After the recent High Court ruling over Heathrow, which found expansion plans had failed to adequately account for policies on climate change, some experts say the government needs to look again at the impact of environmental policy within the provision of infrastructure. There has also been a debate about whether housing should be part of the plan. Shock resignation means test for new chancellor New roads face Heathrow-style court action threat Can the Treasury computer say 'Yes' to the north? The strategy is also the government's formal response to a now two-year-old National Infrastructure Assessment, which was the product of an impartial commission set up when David Cameron was prime minister. It should have been published last autumn. Publication of the National Infrastructure Strategy should now be expected before May, sources have suggested to the BBC. The Budget is still expected to include some green lights for high profile infrastructure projects, but the main move in this area will be to set the overall big numbers on capital spending. It is the infrastructure strategy and the Comprehensive Spending Review later this year that will determine the detailed policy. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the delay to the strategy suggested there was ""absolute chaos"" in the government. With the threat of climate change and ""an economy at risk of recession"" the UK needed large scale infrastructure spending to start immediately, he said.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, putting 2,000 jobs at risk, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Its website now advises customers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged an alternative flight. Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. In a letter to the airline's staff, chief executive Mark Anderson said: ""Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading."" In response to the collapse, the UK government said it was ready to help Flybe's workers find new jobs and would work with other airlines to replace services: ""We are working closely with industry to minimise any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry. "" Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I thought we would be saved but not this time' Flybe collapse: Your rights explained Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said everyone was ""gutted"" about the news but added: ""We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year. ""Unfortunately, with the situation that has developed with [coronavirus], an already weak company, I'm afraid, just hasn't been able to survive."" David Manners arrived at Exeter Airport this morning to find his Flybe flight to Paris had been cancelled. The trip had been planned as a surprise Christmas present for his wife and he said they were ""absolutely gutted"". David Manners said he was ""absolutely gutted"" over the airline's collapse Mr Manners, who lives in Lyme Regis, said Flybe's collapse would also be bad for the area. ""We use this airport quite a lot because it's so convenient,"" he said. ""We know some of the staff very wellâ¦ I feel for them."" Jessica, Abby and Robyn arrived in Exeter Airport to find their flight had been cancelled after Flybe's collapse Jessica, Abby and Robyn work for a recruitment agency and were due to return to Jersey via Exeter Airport after a business trip. They described the airport as a ""ghost town"" on arrival. Abby said: ""I use Flybe maybe once a month, and not having it now will be such a nightmare."" The group said that other airlines such as EasyJet or British Airways did operate flights from Jersey, but they typically only flew into larger airports such as London Gatwick. Ryanair has launched ""rescue"" fares for March and April on five routes following Flybe's collapse. They include flights between Bournemouth and Dublin, Belfast and Stansted and Belfast and Manchester. Train operators across Britain are also providing free travel to customers and Flybe staff who are unable to travel over the next week, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company will not be protected by Atol,the travel industry insurance fund However, if you bought through a travel agent or other third party you might be covered. Some people might be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card or with some debit cards. Thousands of jobs are at risk following the regional airline's collapse.

She has worked for the airline for 13 years after joining the firm straight from college. This video can not be played 'We're not sure what we're going to do now' She told the BBC that staff were feeling ""really sad"" and that she was not sure what to do next. Balpa, the pilots' union, said that pilots, cabin crew and ground staff ""have done their jobs brilliantly"" throughout its struggle. The union questioned how staff ""are going to find new jobs in the current climate"", although companies such as South Western Railway have already been calling out for job applications from Flybe staff on social media. Flybe ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic. But its troubles persisted, and it narrowly avoided going bust in January this year. The new owners said they would pump Â£30m into the business to keep it afloat, but appealed to the government for additional support. Flybe, which served destinations from the Channel Islands to Aberdeen, had also been hoping for a Â£100m lifeline from the government and changes to Air Passenger Duty taxes. But the news that it may benefit from government help sparked a backlash from its rivals. British Airways-owner IAG filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breached state aid rules. Virgin Atlantic said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Flybe had gone bust, adding that the consortium had invested more than Â£135m in keeping the airline flying for an extra year. While its financial problems were already apparent, a Flybe insider told the BBC the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry had ""made a bad situation much worse"". Air transport expert John Strickland added that the regional market was extremely challenging for any airline, but that Flybe had made matters worse some years ago through over-ambitious expansion. ""It's really too big for what it's trying to do,"" he said. Although Flybe is small compared to the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as ""disastrous"" for UK regions. Mr Strickland said Flybe is ""small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices... so a number of regional groups will risk not being served"". Following last December's general election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to ""level up"" the UK's regions, after the Conservatives won seats in previous Labour strongholds. He appeared ready to intervene to prop up the airline, considered a key transport link to many parts of the country. Flybe collapse affects Isle of Man hospital patients Cardiff Flybe passengers warned not to go to airport Shadow transport secretary Andy Macdonald said the airline had provided ""critical connectivity for many locations"" and its collapse would be ""disastrous news for passengers and employees alike."" ""The government has to answer how those vital links will be maintained following Flybe's collapse. Communities will be concerned about what this will mean for their local economies and the Secretary of State has to come up with answers to these questions as a matter of urgency,"" he said. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that he ""very much hoped"" that other airlines would take up the routes. He said discussions with other airlines would ""begin in earnest"" soon and he hoped to reinstate services ""on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than months"". For the past 15 years Flybe has been trying to join the big boys of aviation, and failing. The serious push came 10 years ago when it raised money with a stock market float, and set out a plan to become Europe's biggest regional airline, flying mid-sized planes between secondary cities. The model works brilliantly in America, where regional airlines, often flying as franchises of the larger network carriers, are a large and thriving business. It did not work - or at least Flybe did not make it work - in Europe. It retrenched, and was left in the farcical situation of paying for a fleet of Embraer aircraft that it could not fly. The remaining network was still too big, and cash resources dwindled. The airline came close to going under at the start of last year, but was bought by consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart, and a financial investor Cyrus Capital. They had conflicting objectives. Virgin was eager to preserve feed to its long-haul flights at Heathrow, and perhaps snaffle along the way some of Flybe's valuable Heathrow slots. Stobart was eager to keep flights at its main asset, Southend Airport. And Cyrus thought it might make money if the business was resuscitated. The trio were slow to act - a rebranding to Virgin Connect never happened, and losses continued to rise. A cold shoulder from the government and a rapid drop in bookings thanks to the coronavirus sealed the airline's fate. For the airports most affected -  Southampton, Exeter and Belfast City - this will be a worrying moment. There is not a queue of airlines wanting to pick up UK regional routes - and particularly not when the coronavirus has plunged the entire industry into uncertainty.

Opponents of the badger cull have said it is inhumane and ineffective, but the government backed the policy. The first cull zones were created in 2013 in Somerset and Gloucestershire. In September,badger culling was extended to 40 areasincluding Bristol, Cheshire, Devon, Cornwall, Staffordshire, Dorset, Herefordshire and Wiltshire. Farmers said it was necessary to control the disease that devastates the beef and dairy industries, while the government claimed it had led to reductions in the incidence of TB. Now Defra plans to gradually phase out ""intensive culling"" following a breakthrough by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). Previously it was not possible to vaccinate cattle as tests for the disease could not differentiate between vaccinated animals and those infected by bovine TB, but Apha has developed an ""effective"" test which can be trialled alongside the BCG vaccine. Defra is selling the shift to vaccination as the next phase in its policy to eradicate cattle TB. Opponents of the cull are calling it a U-turn. Animal welfare campaigners believe culling to be cruel and many scientists suspect it may be ineffective and actually increase the spread of the infection in cattle. On the day Defra unveiled its culling policy in 2012 one of its most senior scientific advisors described it as a""crazy scheme"". The department's own independent expert group's review of the first year of the culls concluded that they wereineffective and inhumaneand a member of that group told BBC News he believed that the government was""wilfully ignoring the science"".Another senior researcher said ministers were using""fake science""to justify the culling policy. Defra's response was to disband the independent expert group andrelax the strict scientific rulesthat were in place to minimise the spread of infection to cattle from badger movement. They weremodified in subsequent cullsin order to ensure more badgers were killed. Ministers justified their perseverance with the policy as wanting to use ""every tool in the box"". But there has beenno clear cut dropin cattle TB since the culls began so Defra has decided to begin to put one of its tools away. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Apha's ""ground-breaking research"" meant it could now start on the ""field trials required to license the cattle vaccine and test it"". ""Whilst there is no single way to combat this damaging and complex disease, cattle vaccination will be a new tool for our multi-pronged approach to tackle it,"" she said. Environment Secretary George Eustice claimed: ""The badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease as demonstrated by recent academic research and past studies. ""But no-one wants to continue the cull of this protected species indefinitely so, once the weight of disease in wildlife has been addressed, we will accelerate other elements of our strategy, including improved diagnostics and cattle vaccination.""

"Loganair said the two routes, to Aberdeen and Inverness, will be launched later this month Scottish airline Loganair has announced it will take up two routes formerly flown by Flybe out of Belfast City Airport. Flybe went into administration earlier on Thursday, putting 2,000 jobs at risk across the UK. All Flybe flights were cancelled and its passengers have been advised not to go to the airport. Flybe operated 14 routes from Belfast City Airport - about 80% of its scheduled flights. This video can not be played Flybe: 'I booked flights hours before collapse' Loganair said the two routes - between Aberdeen and Belfast and Inverness and Belfast - will commence on 16 March and 23 March respectively. The airline will be taking up 16 formerly Flybe routes across the UK and has opened a special recruitment line for former Flybe employees. Belfast City Airport said ""a number of airlines"" have expressed interest in taking over its routes affected bythe collapse. Belfast City Airport's chief executive said it was a challenging time for both staff and customers. but he was confident of rebuilding its network. ""In the last 24 hours, we've had an interest in all of our network,"" Brian Ambrose told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""For some of the larger routes, we've had multiple interest from a number of airlines. Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters Flybe collapse: Your rights explained ""So I'm confident that within the next days and weeks we will be announcing backfill on a number of those routes and it's a matter of how quickly airlines can get aircraft available. ""The airline was a significant economic driver for the region, carrying 1.6 million passengers to and from Belfast in 2019,"" he explained. The departures board at Belfast City Airport on Thursday morning Analysis by Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Northern Ireland is particularly reliant on air links, simply because of its geography. To get to any other part of the UK from here, you have only two options - go by sea, or by air. Local MPs stressed those circumstances in their questions in parliament. Stephen Farry from the Alliance Party said Northern Ireland had in effect lost 25% of its air travel capacity ""overnight"". The DUP's Gavin Robinson - whose constituency takes in Belfast City Airport - said the government had been ""large in ambition"" for regional connectivity but ""light on detail"". Gavin Robinson said the government had been ""large in ambition"" for regional connectivity but ""light on detail"" Transport Minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons she ""absolutely recognised"" Northern Ireland had specific concerns. She pointed out that the Conservative Party manifesto contained a commitment to consider devolving short-haul air passenger duty (APD). A report drawn up for Stormont last yearsuggested cutting APD would probably enhance Northern Ireland's aviation connections, but would be unlikely to deliver value for money. Mr Ambrose said that Flybe had operated ""a strong and profitable base"" from Belfast which would prove attractive to other carriers. He also said he was also hopeful that some of the airlines might consider hiring Flybe staff. ""We were talking to a number of staff last night when they came off shift and they're going home to let their families know they've lost their jobs,"" said Mr Ambrose. ""As we secure these routes, we will be certainly telling the incoming airlines - if they need staff, if they need engineers and pilots and crew  - they have quality staff who have been working here for many years and hopefully some of them will pick up jobs in the process."" The economy minister said she deeply regrets the closure of Flybe In a statement, Flybe said it had been unable to overcome significant funding challenges. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Flybe CEO Mark Anderson said the UK had lost one of its ""greatest regional assets"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she deeply regrets the closure of Flybe. ""Maintaining air connectivity is absolutely vital to Northern Ireland - to enable access to the economic market in Great Britain and for tourists arriving to our airports from Great Britain and beyond,"" she said. She added: ""My department will work closely with [the Department for Transport] to assist, as required, with the repatriation of Northern Ireland passengers."" Flybe carried 1.6 million passengers to and from Belfast City Airport in 2019 The collapse of Flybe has also caused concerns for staff and students at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB), many of whom relied on the routes for academic collaboration with other UK universities. ""This is very challenging for us,"" said QUB Faculty Pro Vice-Chancellor, Prof Stuart Elborn. ""We've students and staff who commute using the Flybe airline very frequently for research, for education. ""We've a number of joint post-graduate programmes - for example one with Aberdeen which is very important to us and the only flight to Aberdeen to Belfast and back is Flybe. ""So this will have an impact for sure and we will have to seek ways to mitigate that."" Have you been affected by the collapse of Flybe?

"UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, putting 2,000 jobs at risk, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Its website now advises customers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged an alternative flight. Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. In a letter to the airline's staff, chief executive Mark Anderson said: ""Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading."" In response to the collapse, the UK government said it was ready to help Flybe's workers find new jobs and would work with other airlines to replace services: ""We are working closely with industry to minimise any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry. "" Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I thought we would be saved but not this time' Flybe collapse: Your rights explained Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said everyone was ""gutted"" about the news but added: ""We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year. ""Unfortunately, with the situation that has developed with [coronavirus], an already weak company, I'm afraid, just hasn't been able to survive."" David Manners arrived at Exeter Airport this morning to find his Flybe flight to Paris had been cancelled. The trip had been planned as a surprise Christmas present for his wife and he said they were ""absolutely gutted"". David Manners said he was ""absolutely gutted"" over the airline's collapse Mr Manners, who lives in Lyme Regis, said Flybe's collapse would also be bad for the area. ""We use this airport quite a lot because it's so convenient,"" he said. ""We know some of the staff very wellâ¦ I feel for them."" Jessica, Abby and Robyn arrived in Exeter Airport to find their flight had been cancelled after Flybe's collapse Jessica, Abby and Robyn work for a recruitment agency and were due to return to Jersey via Exeter Airport after a business trip. They described the airport as a ""ghost town"" on arrival. Abby said: ""I use Flybe maybe once a month, and not having it now will be such a nightmare."" The group said that other airlines such as EasyJet or British Airways did operate flights from Jersey, but they typically only flew into larger airports such as London Gatwick. Ryanair has launched ""rescue"" fares for March and April on five routes following Flybe's collapse. They include flights between Bournemouth and Dublin, Belfast and Stansted and Belfast and Manchester. Train operators across Britain are also providing free travel to customers and Flybe staff who are unable to travel over the next week, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company will not be protected by Atol,the travel industry insurance fund However, if you bought through a travel agent or other third party you might be covered. Some people might be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card or with some debit cards. Thousands of jobs are at risk following the regional airline's collapse. Katherine Densham, a Flybe cabin crew member, had been due to fly to London City Airport from Exeter on Thursday. She has worked for the airline for 13 years after joining the firm straight from college. This video can not be played 'We're not sure what we're going to do now' She told the BBC that staff were feeling ""really sad"" and that she was not sure what to do next. Balpa, the pilots' union, said that pilots, cabin crew and ground staff ""have done their jobs brilliantly"" throughout its struggle. The union questioned how staff ""are going to find new jobs in the current climate"", although companies such as South Western Railway have already been calling out for job applications from Flybe staff on social media. Flybe ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic. But its troubles persisted, and it narrowly avoided going bust in January this year. The new owners said they would pump Â£30m into the business to keep it afloat, but appealed to the government for additional support. Flybe, which served destinations from the Channel Islands to Aberdeen, had also been hoping for a Â£100m lifeline from the government and changes to Air Passenger Duty taxes. But the news that it may benefit from government help sparked a backlash from its rivals. British Airways-owner IAG filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breached state aid rules. Virgin Atlantic said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Flybe had gone bust, adding that the consortium had invested more than Â£135m in keeping the airline flying for an extra year. While its financial problems were already apparent, a Flybe insider told the BBC the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry had ""made a bad situation much worse"". Air transport expert John Strickland added that the regional market was extremely challenging for any airline, but that Flybe had made matters worse some years ago through over-ambitious expansion. ""It's really too big for what it's trying to do,"" he said. Although Flybe is small compared to the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as ""disastrous"" for UK regions. Mr Strickland said Flybe is ""small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices... so a number of regional groups will risk not being served"". Following last December's general election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to ""level up"" the UK's regions, after the Conservatives won seats in previous Labour strongholds. He appeared ready to intervene to prop up the airline, considered a key transport link to many parts of the country. Flybe collapse affects Isle of Man hospital patients Cardiff Flybe passengers warned not to go to airport Shadow transport secretary Andy Macdonald said the airline had provided ""critical connectivity for many locations"" and its collapse would be ""disastrous news for passengers and employees alike."" ""The government has to answer how those vital links will be maintained following Flybe's collapse. Communities will be concerned about what this will mean for their local economies and the Secretary of State has to come up with answers to these questions as a matter of urgency,"" he said. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that he ""very much hoped"" that other airlines would take up the routes. He said discussions with other airlines would ""begin in earnest"" soon and he hoped to reinstate services ""on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than months"". For the past 15 years Flybe has been trying to join the big boys of aviation, and failing. The serious push came 10 years ago when it raised money with a stock market float, and set out a plan to become Europe's biggest regional airline, flying mid-sized planes between secondary cities. The model works brilliantly in America, where regional airlines, often flying as franchises of the larger network carriers, are a large and thriving business. It did not work - or at least Flybe did not make it work - in Europe. It retrenched, and was left in the farcical situation of paying for a fleet of Embraer aircraft that it could not fly. The remaining network was still too big, and cash resources dwindled. The airline came close to going under at the start of last year, but was bought by consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart, and a financial investor Cyrus Capital. They had conflicting objectives. Virgin was eager to preserve feed to its long-haul flights at Heathrow, and perhaps snaffle along the way some of Flybe's valuable Heathrow slots. Stobart was eager to keep flights at its main asset, Southend Airport. And Cyrus thought it might make money if the business was resuscitated. The trio were slow to act - a rebranding to Virgin Connect never happened, and losses continued to rise. A cold shoulder from the government and a rapid drop in bookings thanks to the coronavirus sealed the airline's fate. For the airports most affected -  Southampton, Exeter and Belfast City - this will be a worrying moment. There is not a queue of airlines wanting to pick up UK regional routes - and particularly not when the coronavirus has plunged the entire industry into uncertainty.

"John Lewis has warned it could close shops as a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. The retailer, which also owns Waitrose, has launched a review of the business which it said would involve ""right sizing"" its stores across both brands. The review would involve store closures ""where necessary"" as well as space reduction in existing stores, it said. The conclusions of the review are expected to be announced in September. New chairwoman Sharon White - who took over last month - said the changes would kick-start a ""vital new phase"" for the partnership, and said she had ""no doubt"" the business would be stronger as a result. ""We need to reverse our profit decline and return to growth so that we can invest more in our customers and in our partners. ""This will require a transformation in how we operate as a partnership and could take three to five years to show results."" The group announced that three Waitrose stores would close later this year at Helensburgh, Four Oaks and Waterlooville as part of the overhaul. John Lewis also said as fears about coronavirus continued to spread, it had see increased demand ""particularly this week"" for some food items as well as things such as hand sanitiser, soap and loo roll. John Lewis's finance director, Patrick Lewis, said it was working ""very hard with suppliers on an hourly basis"" to keep up with demand. Sharon White took the helm at John Lewis last month The John Lewis Partnership is owned by its staff - known as partners - who usually receive a bonus each year. This year, staff bonuses have been set at 2%, the lowest since 1953 when it paid no bonus. Profits at the partnership dived by 23% last year,externalto Â£123m - the third year in a row that profits have fallen - as it continued to struggle with the slowdown in consumer spending. The John Lewis department stores saw ""significantly reduced profitability"" following weaker sales of home and electrical goods, although profits rose at Waitrose after a ""solid performance"", the company said. John Lewis axes third of top jobs in restructuring 'Worst year for retail in 25 years' Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the fall from grace for John Lewis had been ""spectacular"", and warned that if Ms White could not turn around the business ""the fallout could be much worse"". ""Once the envy of the retail industry, the company has suffered dismal trading performances over the past few years, demonstrating that the retail race is so fast that even those seemingly on an unstoppable march one year can be vulnerable the next. ""This goes to show that no retailer is safe."" Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of retail analysts Savvy, said store closures appeared inevitable. ""I think the business is going to have to be slimmed down,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very difficult to close some of the department stores down because they're on really long leases, but certainly I think where there are opportunities to close stores that aren't performing they will look at that."" She added that Ms White did not have much time to turn the business around. ""She's talking about changes taking three-to-five years, I don't think there are three-to-five years in retail at the minute where there isn't going to be an enormous amount of change. She hasn't got that much time on her side. John Lewis have been 'strategically reviewing' things for quite a while - we need some action."" Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC the firm's staff bonus scheme was an ""absolutely fundamental"" part of its ethos. ""The key competitive edge John Lewis has is customer service, that is delivered by its staff. If you take away part of their remuneration then your customer service levels are likely to be impacted. ""And I think that over the past few years as that bonus has gone down we've been seeing a bit of that. It's a really difficult dilemma they have.""

"Serial rapist, pictured during his crime spree last year, Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims Probation staff were warned serial rapist Joseph McCann posed a risk of sexual offending and could have recalled him to jail, a report says. McCann wasgiven 33 life sentences after being convicted of a series of offencesagainst 11 women and children. There were eight opportunities to recall McCann to jail before he went on a spree of sex offences last year, the Serious Further Offences report found. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland promised an independent review. A summary of the report said McCann should have been kept in jail at least until the Parole Board was satisfied it was safe to let him out. It says there were eight occasions when this process - called ""recall"" - was considered. ""The most significant practice failure was the repeated failure to recall Joseph McCann or to reflect critically on earlier decisions not to recall him, in the face of both court and prison staff communicating their concerns,"" the report said. One of McCann's victims, a 39-year-old mum, said her family ""has been torn apart"". ""If he had been in prison none of this would have happened,"" she said. ""I lost my family home. I could not go back to the house. It was awful it has just been really bad emotionally."" Her 17-year-old daughter, who was also one of McCann's victims, said she ""thought the law was meant to protect the public"". ""I used to be an independent person but now I can't do anything on my own. ""I can't even sleep in my own bed . It's absolutely awful."" This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase The report disclosed that in 2011, when McCann was in prison for burglary, police shared information dating back to 2003 and suggesting McCann ""might pose a risk of sexual harm and exploitation to teenage girls"". The report added: ""It appears that the pressure on the staff throughout 2018 and the chaotic transfer of the case between numerous offender managers also significantly impacted their ability to comprehensively review McCann's historical record, and therefore to identify the previous references to sexual violence. ""Had offender managers reviewed the historical records, including the police intelligence, they might have instigated one to one work with McCann to address sexual violence. ""However, aside from this historical intelligence from 2003 and the letters intercepted by the prison in 2009, there were no more recent indicators of concerning sexual behaviour, and this failure should be viewed in this context."" When an offender under probation supervision is charged with a serious crime an internal inquiry is conducted, known as a Serious Further Offence review. These reports are usually kept under wraps, but the repercussions of the probation failings in this case were so appalling the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland recognised the clear public interest in making the document available for all to see. What is shocking, from reading the report, is that the same mistake was repeated over and over and over again. That mistake was not to activate the ""recall"" process so that Joseph McCann would have stayed in prison after being sentenced in January 2018 until the Parole Board decided he could safely be let out. Various reasons are cited for this persistent error - the threat of a legal challenge, concern about the impact of recall, communication problems - but I wonder whether fear of McCann, his bullying nature and violent temper, drove some staff to make the wrong decision. The prison holding McCann had also intercepted two sets of letters from McCann with ""disturbing contents"" which ""indicated he posed a risk of sexual harm"". McCann was released in March 2017 under strict bail conditions, but jailed again later that year. He was released at the halfway point of his sentence in February 2019, two months before he went on a sex offending spree in Watford, London, Greater Manchester and Cheshire. His victims were aged between 11 and 71 and included three women who were abducted off the street at knifepoint and repeatedly raped. The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I saw net close in on serial rapist' Alan Collins, a lawyer for some of McCann's victims, said the report made for ""hard and distressing reading"". ""It is unforgivable that the probation service, for unfathomable reasons, put McCann's perceived interests before the safety of the general public,"" he said. ""McCann posed a real risk to the public and the systems in place to manage the risk he posed were corrupted through ineffectual management and poor judgment. ""As a direct consequence, he was let loose on an unsuspecting public with terrible consequences. ""Lives have been damaged, if not ruined, as a result of what happened and the Ministry of Justice must accept full responsibility and... accept that it has to be accountable for McCann and the crimes that he committed when he should have been in prison."" This video can not be played Elderly victim of serial rapist Joseph McCann tells of her ordeal Another legal representative of some victims, Jonathan Bridge of Farleys Solicitors, said: ""The report highlights poor staff behaviour, limited productivity, poor quality of work, a high staff turnover and officers having to work with double the capacity they should have had. ""This report makes it clear that this was not a one-off mistake by the Probation Service, but a catalogue of errors spanning a number of years. ""It is absolutely clear that had the Probation Service done their job properly McCann would have been in prison and his victims would not have suffered horrific abuse and life changing psychiatric injury."" The Ministry of Justice, which carried out the review, said the chief inspector of probation Justin Russell will be asked to carry out an independent review of the National Probation Service's management of McCann and how the process of recalling offenders to prison is working. The Attorney General also said he has referred McCann's sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. A hearing will take place on 25 March. In December,describing McCann as a ""classic psychopath"",externalthe sentencing judge said his campaign of abduction and sexual abuse was unprecedented. The judge called for an investigation into failings in the probation system which had left McCann on the streets. McCann was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in jail having been convicted of: Ten counts of false imprisonment Seven counts of rape One count of rape of a child Two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent Seven counts of kidnap One count of attempted kidnap Three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity Three counts of assault by penetration One count of sexual assault Two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison Serial rapist McCann given 33 life sentences Man guilty of sex attacks on 11 women and children HM Courts Service The mosquito that rides the tube: Zapping as you zazz your zip card Record number of 999 calls for serious injuries in London in December Safety is vital for mayor's 'swimmable rivers' plan, City Hall warned Croydon has been named in the top 50 places to live in England Tough test as Town resume chase for title Which parts of Southwark saw the most crime in 2024?

"This video can not be played Warren drops out: ""Little girls will have to wait four more years for a woman president."" Senator Elizabeth Warren has ended her presidential campaign following disappointing Super Tuesday results. A favourite of the liberal left, the Massachusetts senator, 70, was once a front-runner in the Democratic field. Ms Warren said she needed some time to decide on another candidate to support. The Democratic contest to take on President Donald Trump in November is now seen as a two-horse race between former Vice-President Joe Biden, 77, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 78. Who are the Democrats vying to take on Trump? Where did it go wrong for Elizabeth Warren? Listen to Americast: Warren is out! Despite early momentum for her campaign, she failed to win a single state in the first primary contests of 2020, even her own. With Ms Warren's exit, Mr Biden and Mr Sanders are left in a two-way horse race With Ms Warren's departure, a Democratic race that began with a record high of female candidates is now effectively left to two male front-runners, who both swiftly praised her and her campaign. ""One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years,"" she said alongside her husband outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Thursday. ""That's going to be hard."" Now that she has dropped out, post-mortems on Elizabeth Warren's campaign have begun. Many point to her shifting message on universal government-run healthcare, a topic that was never a top priority for her. It caused liberals to stick with Bernie Sanders and centrists to have their doubts about her. Others suggest she was harmed by hesitant performances in the debates that mattered - before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. Her strongest effort came with her vivisection of Michael Bloomberg in Las Vegas, which was buried by Sanders' win in the Nevada caucuses - and too late to influence the outcome. Then there's the issue of sexism. Four years after Democrats chose Hillary Clinton to be their nominee, voters may have been reluctant to opt for another woman atop the ticket. This reluctance was seldom explicit, instead being raised in concerns about ""likability"" or ""electability"" and what other, hypothetical, swing-state voters might think of her. It also sometimes reared its head in Warren's media coverage, where her healthcare backtracking received considerably more criticism than similar pirouettes and hedging by Pete Buttigieg and other male candidates. The US will elect its first woman president someday, but it will not be in 2020. Read Anthony's full analysis This video can not be played Ms Warren said Mr Sanders had told her in 2018 that a woman could not win the US presidency Ms Warren was the first major Democratic candidate to announce her plans for a presidential bid. Early in the race, her policy-centric approach - ""I've got a plan for that"" was a favourite refrain - seemed effective. Can't buy me love: Where did Bloomberg's money go? Are voters biased against women candidates? Super Tuesday results in full In October last year, she peaked in most national polls until a difficult TV debate. She was unable to say on stage whether she would raise taxes to pay for her proposal to expand government-run healthcare insurance for Americans. Throughout her candidacy, President Trump nicknamed her ""Pocahontas"" after she claimed to have had Native-American ancestry. This video can not be played The US president makes a joke about Senator Elizabeth Warren in front of Native Americans. In an effort to prove her heritage, she took a DNA test, but only ended up angering tribal leaders, who argued that genetics do not determine cultural identity. On Thursday, Mr Trump again tweeted his nickname for her, adding that by dividing her party's liberal vote, she had ""probably cost [Bernie Sanders] the nomination"". Ms Warren's exit follows closely behind ex-mayors Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, and Senator Amy Klobuchar. Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is the sole remaining female Democratic presidential candidate, though she polls at barely one per cent.

"Sir Paul McCartney was due to headline Saturday night at Glastonbury this year The government has advised against mass gatherings in the UK for the foreseeable future - effectively cancelling all large-scale events, such as concerts, sports fixtures and theatre productions. The 2020 Glastonbury Festival is the latest in a long list of eventsthat have been cancelled because of coronavirus. Professional football in England and Scotland has already been suspended and all horse racing in Great Britain will stop from Wednesday. Many events around the world, including the Euro 2020 finals, have also been postponed or cancelled. So, what are your rights if you have a ticket to something that gets called off? The Euro 2020 football finals were due to take place in 12 cities around Europe, including London and Glasgow Generally, if you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an official seller, you should be entitled to a refund, often automatically. However, additional costs, such as postage and booking fees, are unlikely to be reimbursed. For anyone who purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site's terms and conditions. Some sites, like Viagogo, have already said customers will get a full refund in the event of a cancellation. If an event is moved and you cannot make the rearranged date, you should be entitled to your money back. For example, European football's governing body, Uefa, says it will refund all Euro 2020 ticket holders who can't make any rearranged dates in 2021. The football leagues in England and Scotland have not yet announced what will happen about tickets for cancelled matches. Season ticket holders should check their individual club's terms and conditions. Organisers of the Glastonbury Festival say that anyone that has paid a Â£50 deposit can roll it over to next year in order to buy a ticket for the 2021 event. Otherwise, people can ask for their Â£50 to be refunded. If you are taking part in something, the same refund rules may apply to entry fees if it is cancelled. But you need to check the event organiser's terms and conditions. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:What is the UK's 'delay' stage? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts If you have heard nothing about a refund after a couple of weeks, follow it up, says consumer rights journalist Helen Dewdney. She advises: ""Where possible, do everything in writing so you have a record."" If you're not getting anywhere you can approach your credit card company, says Ms Dewdney. Using a credit card to buy something costing between Â£100 and Â£30,000 means you are legally entitled to a refund if you do not get what you were promised. Even if the ticket is worth less than Â£100, or a debit card was used instead, there is still the chance of getting a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is used to reverse the transaction. Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? Timeline: Which sport events have been affected? Many events are put on to raise money for good causes. Many art, music and theatre groups are charities and rely heavily on ticket sales for income. They say there could be serious financial implications if they have to refund all tickets. Some, including the BFI (British Film Institute), have asked ticket holders to consider not asking for a refund so that the money can be used as a charitable donation instead. If you are unable to attend an event because facilities such as hotels or travel are unavailable, the situation is not so clear-cut. ""You've got to hope for a goodwill gesture,"" says Ms Dewdney. ""From the organisers' point of view, they'll say the event is still going ahead."" If you've booked a package (with hotel, flight and event entry all included), you may be able to claim under your travel insurance - depending on the small print. It depends, according to Adam French, from consumer group Which?. ""If you've bought a ticket for a Taylor Swift gig to headline, but she didn't perform, you should get your money back"", he says. ""But if it's a festival with multiple acts, that means you have a ticket for the festival and not the individual performer. In that instance, you can't expect a refund."" If you decide against going to a music event or sports match because you're worried about coronavirus, there's little chance of getting your money back. The only possible exception is if you have some form of insurance with your ticket. How can I tell if I've got Covid? Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases?

"UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, putting 2,000 jobs at risk, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Its website now advises customers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged an alternative flight. Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. In a letter to the airline's staff, chief executive Mark Anderson said: ""Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading."" In response to the collapse, the UK government said it was ready to help Flybe's workers find new jobs and would work with other airlines to replace services: ""We are working closely with industry to minimise any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry. "" Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I thought we would be saved but not this time' Flybe collapse: Your rights explained Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said everyone was ""gutted"" about the news but added: ""We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year. ""Unfortunately, with the situation that has developed with [coronavirus], an already weak company, I'm afraid, just hasn't been able to survive."" David Manners arrived at Exeter Airport this morning to find his Flybe flight to Paris had been cancelled. The trip had been planned as a surprise Christmas present for his wife and he said they were ""absolutely gutted"". David Manners said he was ""absolutely gutted"" over the airline's collapse Mr Manners, who lives in Lyme Regis, said Flybe's collapse would also be bad for the area. ""We use this airport quite a lot because it's so convenient,"" he said. ""We know some of the staff very wellâ¦ I feel for them."" Jessica, Abby and Robyn arrived in Exeter Airport to find their flight had been cancelled after Flybe's collapse Jessica, Abby and Robyn work for a recruitment agency and were due to return to Jersey via Exeter Airport after a business trip. They described the airport as a ""ghost town"" on arrival. Abby said: ""I use Flybe maybe once a month, and not having it now will be such a nightmare."" The group said that other airlines such as EasyJet or British Airways did operate flights from Jersey, but they typically only flew into larger airports such as London Gatwick. Ryanair has launched ""rescue"" fares for March and April on five routes following Flybe's collapse. They include flights between Bournemouth and Dublin, Belfast and Stansted and Belfast and Manchester. Train operators across Britain are also providing free travel to customers and Flybe staff who are unable to travel over the next week, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company will not be protected by Atol,the travel industry insurance fund However, if you bought through a travel agent or other third party you might be covered. Some people might be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card or with some debit cards. Thousands of jobs are at risk following the regional airline's collapse. Katherine Densham, a Flybe cabin crew member, had been due to fly to London City Airport from Exeter on Thursday. She has worked for the airline for 13 years after joining the firm straight from college. This video can not be played 'We're not sure what we're going to do now' She told the BBC that staff were feeling ""really sad"" and that she was not sure what to do next. Balpa, the pilots' union, said that pilots, cabin crew and ground staff ""have done their jobs brilliantly"" throughout its struggle. The union questioned how staff ""are going to find new jobs in the current climate"", although companies such as South Western Railway have already been calling out for job applications from Flybe staff on social media. Flybe ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic. But its troubles persisted, and it narrowly avoided going bust in January this year. The new owners said they would pump Â£30m into the business to keep it afloat, but appealed to the government for additional support. Flybe, which served destinations from the Channel Islands to Aberdeen, had also been hoping for a Â£100m lifeline from the government and changes to Air Passenger Duty taxes. But the news that it may benefit from government help sparked a backlash from its rivals. British Airways-owner IAG filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breached state aid rules. Virgin Atlantic said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Flybe had gone bust, adding that the consortium had invested more than Â£135m in keeping the airline flying for an extra year. While its financial problems were already apparent, a Flybe insider told the BBC the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry had ""made a bad situation much worse"". Air transport expert John Strickland added that the regional market was extremely challenging for any airline, but that Flybe had made matters worse some years ago through over-ambitious expansion. ""It's really too big for what it's trying to do,"" he said. Although Flybe is small compared to the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as ""disastrous"" for UK regions. Mr Strickland said Flybe is ""small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices... so a number of regional groups will risk not being served"". Following last December's general election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to ""level up"" the UK's regions, after the Conservatives won seats in previous Labour strongholds. He appeared ready to intervene to prop up the airline, considered a key transport link to many parts of the country. Flybe collapse affects Isle of Man hospital patients Cardiff Flybe passengers warned not to go to airport Shadow transport secretary Andy Macdonald said the airline had provided ""critical connectivity for many locations"" and its collapse would be ""disastrous news for passengers and employees alike."" ""The government has to answer how those vital links will be maintained following Flybe's collapse. Communities will be concerned about what this will mean for their local economies and the Secretary of State has to come up with answers to these questions as a matter of urgency,"" he said. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that he ""very much hoped"" that other airlines would take up the routes. He said discussions with other airlines would ""begin in earnest"" soon and he hoped to reinstate services ""on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than months"". For the past 15 years Flybe has been trying to join the big boys of aviation, and failing. The serious push came 10 years ago when it raised money with a stock market float, and set out a plan to become Europe's biggest regional airline, flying mid-sized planes between secondary cities. The model works brilliantly in America, where regional airlines, often flying as franchises of the larger network carriers, are a large and thriving business. It did not work - or at least Flybe did not make it work - in Europe. It retrenched, and was left in the farcical situation of paying for a fleet of Embraer aircraft that it could not fly. The remaining network was still too big, and cash resources dwindled. The airline came close to going under at the start of last year, but was bought by consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart, and a financial investor Cyrus Capital. They had conflicting objectives. Virgin was eager to preserve feed to its long-haul flights at Heathrow, and perhaps snaffle along the way some of Flybe's valuable Heathrow slots. Stobart was eager to keep flights at its main asset, Southend Airport. And Cyrus thought it might make money if the business was resuscitated. The trio were slow to act - a rebranding to Virgin Connect never happened, and losses continued to rise. A cold shoulder from the government and a rapid drop in bookings thanks to the coronavirus sealed the airline's fate. For the airports most affected -  Southampton, Exeter and Belfast City - this will be a worrying moment. There is not a queue of airlines wanting to pick up UK regional routes - and particularly not when the coronavirus has plunged the entire industry into uncertainty.

"All rail operators have been urged to sign up Women fleeing an abusive relationship are to be given free train travel under a new scheme. Victims across the south of England, West Midlands and south Wales are the first to benefit from the ""Rail to Refuge"" initiative, after Southeastern and Great Western Railway signed up. Domestic abuse victim Amanda, whose name has been changed, said it was a ""lifeline"" for women in need. ""It's empowering, and I hope other rail operators get on board,"" she said. The scheme was the brainchild of Southeastern station manager Darren O'Brien, who said even though ""it is a only a small thing"", it could ""make an enormous difference"" to women in dire circumstances. Abuse victims can contact the charity Women's Aid, or a domestic abuse helpline or local outreach service, and if necessary a refuge space will be found and the train ticket obtained on the woman's behalf. Representatives from Women's Aid, GWR and Southeastern gathered for the launch on Wednesday Amanda, whose partner emotionally and financially abused her for two years, left after he hit her. She had no money, as she had stopped working to look after their child. ""That is the point when you are most vulnerable,"" she said. ""You have no money, you may have been forced to cut off friends and family during your relationship, you can't see any future, and your abuser is at their most aggressive."" Of all the women killed by their ex in 2017, 55% died in the first month after separation and 87% within 12 months, Women's Aid says She added: ""Often all women have is the shirt on their back, and with nowhere to go - it's really scary. ""Knowing you can put some distance between you and your abuser is reassuring and empowering."" Adina Claire, acting co-chief executive of Women's Aid, said: ""Access to cash is a major barrier for women escaping an abusive partner, and free train travel will be one less thing for these women to worry about at a time of acute crisis."" A director at GWR, Joe Graham, said: ""The railway is much more than trains and rail track; it is about supporting the communities that it serves.""

"The competition watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by jacking up the price of protective goods like hand gels. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had been monitoring sales and pricing practices and would take action against those who break the law. It follows reports of steep price rises for items such as face masks and ""misleading"" advertising claims. CMA boss Andrea Coscelli urged retailers to ""behave responsibly"". ""We also remind members of the public that these obligations may apply to them too if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces,"" she said. Face mask ads banned for 'misleading' virus claims Amazon culls one million fake coronavirus products Last week, Amazon said it had banned more than one million products which claimed to protect against the coronavirus - or even cure it. The online retailer said it had also removed ""tens of thousands"" of overpriced health products from unscrupulous sellers. In one example, a 50-piece stack of surgical masks from one seller cost more than Â£170, while a popular alternative of the same product is on sale for approximately Â£36. Even that cheaper product had still risen dramatically in price since early January, when it cost less than Â£10. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

The Advertising Standards Authorityruled the ads were ""misleading, irresponsible and likely to cause fear without justifiable reason"". Face masks do not provide effective protection against coronavirus, according to medical experts. The CMA said it would consider any evidence that companies may have broken competition or consumer protection law, for example by charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about the efficacy of protective equipment. It added that it would take ""direct enforcement action"" if necessary. It also said it would consider asking the government to introduce price controls for some goods if needed.

"Households in the wealthiest area of England and Wales have an average disposable income four times that of the poorest, according toOffice for National Statistics estimates.,external The average figure in Mickleover North, in Derby, in 2017-18 was almost Â£40,000 more than in St Matthews and Highfields North, Leicester, estimates suggest. Derby also had the widest income gap between its richest and poorest areas. London and south-east England had the highest proportion of wealthy areas. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A quarter of London's local areas and a fifth of those in the South East were ranked in the top 10% of wealthiest areas. In contrast, in north-west England, a fifth of its local areas were in the bottom 10% for household incomes. Highgate East, Haringey and Queen's Gate, Kensington and Chelsea, were the only other local areas - apart from Mickleover North - with average household incomes over Â£50,000. In Wales, the area with the highest income was Sketty, in Swansea, where the average is estimated to be Â£39,600. This relatively high income led Swansea to have the highest divide between the most and least affluent areas in Wales. The latest ONS figures look at net household income, which is income after certain taxes have been removed and includes welfare payments. In order better to reflect living standards, they have been adjusted to take into account the size of each household and are based on a variety of data types, including surveys. In a separate publication, ONS figures show that the household income inequality across the UK has increased slightly over the two years to March 2019. Income for the poorest fifth of households fell by 4.3% a year, following four years of growth. The wealthiest fifth had a smaller decline in average income and their incomes still haven't returned to their pre-2008 crisis levels. Across all incomes, the average rate is still increasing but more slowly than before. The figures highlight the size of the challenge the government faces in its bid to ""level up"" the country as new Chancellor Rishi Sunak prepares to unveil plans in his 11 March Budget for further investment to reach the people ministers have described as ""left behind"". The latest figures estimate average income across the UK - before housing costs - is Â£29,600. Adam Corlett, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""Today's ONS data lays bare the incredibly weak living-standards growth the UK has experienced in recent years, contributing to a lost decade of income growth. ""The income squeeze, which abated in the mid-2010s, has returned in recent years. The new stagnation has affected households of all kinds, but the recent squeeze has been much worse for poorer households, who have seen big living-standards falls."" Inequality still remains lower than in the four years running up to the economic crisis in the 2008. Then, the income share of the top 1% was around 8.8%, compared with 7.6% now.

"Households in the wealthiest area of England and Wales have an average disposable income four times that of the poorest, according toOffice for National Statistics estimates.,external The average figure in Mickleover North, in Derby, in 2017-18 was almost Â£40,000 more than in St Matthews and Highfields North, Leicester, estimates suggest. Derby also had the widest income gap between its richest and poorest areas. London and south-east England had the highest proportion of wealthy areas. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A quarter of London's local areas and a fifth of those in the South East were ranked in the top 10% of wealthiest areas. In contrast, in north-west England, a fifth of its local areas were in the bottom 10% for household incomes. Highgate East, Haringey and Queen's Gate, Kensington and Chelsea, were the only other local areas - apart from Mickleover North - with average household incomes over Â£50,000. In Wales, the area with the highest income was Sketty, in Swansea, where the average is estimated to be Â£39,600. This relatively high income led Swansea to have the highest divide between the most and least affluent areas in Wales. The latest ONS figures look at net household income, which is income after certain taxes have been removed and includes welfare payments. In order better to reflect living standards, they have been adjusted to take into account the size of each household and are based on a variety of data types, including surveys. In a separate publication, ONS figures show that the household income inequality across the UK has increased slightly over the two years to March 2019. Income for the poorest fifth of households fell by 4.3% a year, following four years of growth. The wealthiest fifth had a smaller decline in average income and their incomes still haven't returned to their pre-2008 crisis levels. Across all incomes, the average rate is still increasing but more slowly than before. The figures highlight the size of the challenge the government faces in its bid to ""level up"" the country as new Chancellor Rishi Sunak prepares to unveil plans in his 11 March Budget for further investment to reach the people ministers have described as ""left behind"". The latest figures estimate average income across the UK - before housing costs - is Â£29,600. Adam Corlett, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""Today's ONS data lays bare the incredibly weak living-standards growth the UK has experienced in recent years, contributing to a lost decade of income growth. ""The income squeeze, which abated in the mid-2010s, has returned in recent years. The new stagnation has affected households of all kinds, but the recent squeeze has been much worse for poorer households, who have seen big living-standards falls."" Inequality still remains lower than in the four years running up to the economic crisis in the 2008. Then, the income share of the top 1% was around 8.8%, compared with 7.6% now.

"Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond has become the first major film to fall foul of the coronavirus outbreak,with the release of No Time To Die delayed by seven months until November. With growing health concerns around the world, what could it mean for the film industry? The new Bond theme, performed by Billie Eilish, has already been released Bond producers didn't directly mention coronavirus in their statement announcing the delay. Instead, MGM said it took the decision after ""careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace"". Is that code for coronavirus? ""Yes,"" says BBC arts correspondent David Sillito. ""Just look at what's happening in the world. ""This was going to be the first big global blockbuster of the season, and this is a film that makes two thirds of its money outside of the US, it's a huge worldwide business."" Film critic Siobhan Synott tells BBC Breakfast: ""This is definitely a question of economics. The promotional work was well under way, we already had the title song released in February, but now it's all on hold."" Unlike some of the other major film studios, who stagger releases throughout the year, MGM is heavily reliant on James Bond, and depends on its financial success. The studio would have had less to fall back on if it had underperformed. Vin Diesel is set to star in F9 - the ninth Fast & Furious film ""At this very minute in major studio distribution huddles across town, there's war-room talk of what major event pictures could potentially move in the next three months as executives try to assess coronavirus' impact at the global box office,""writes Deadline's Anthony D'Alessandro.,external Two of the next scheduled blockbusters are Disney and Marvel'sBlack Widowand Universal's ninth film in the Fast & Furious franchise,F9- both set for release in May. Both Disney and Universal currently plan to release the films as scheduled. ""I should think the distributors and the studios are monitoring the situation every hour, so everything might change again,"" Screen International's deputy editor Louise Tutt tells BBC News. Major releases scheduled for June include the computer-animated Scooby Doo adventureScoob!as well asWonder Woman 1984- both from Warner Brothers. One further difficulty is that film schedules are organised months in advance, with studios picking release dates deliberately to avoid competition. If one film is delayed, that creates a backlog of major releases, which would squash them much closer together. A number of releases have already been delayed in China, where the outbreak began. All 70,000 cinemas have been closed in the country since January, and other nations including Japan, South Korea and parts of Italy have also seen some temporary closures in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. ""In China, there's a particular problem for all those movies that are lining up,"" Synott says. ""Little Women, 1917 and Jojo Rabbit have still to be released in China, but there are very few slots available."" Liu Yifei will star as Mulan in the live-action remake For films which are already in the process of being shipped to cinemas, with advertising campaigns that run into the multi-millions, it's simply too late and too expensive to pull them. But it's not a dead-cert that such films will be affected at the box office beyond China, because analysts don't yet know how much the public are likely to avoid cinemas. The official advice remains carrying on as normal in many countries, including the UK and US. ""The month of March will be the true test if there's any global box office fallout from the virus, with Disney'sOnwardopening this weekend, Paramount'sA Quiet Place Part IIon 20 March, and Disney'sMulanon 27 March,"" notes D'Alessandro. ""Despite these movies delaying some of their foreign territory openings, the studios are unable to pull them from the calendar now as their P&A [print and advertising] is locked and loaded. Should this trio underperform greatly, rivals predict that's when Black Widow and F9 would move out of May."" Lashana Lynch is to star in No Time To Die, now due for release in November Many were disappointed, but also understanding, after the announcement of No Time To Die's delay. ""Bond fans have been shaken by this, maybe even a little bit stirred,"" Ajay Chowdhury, editor of the James Bond International Fan Club, tells the BBC. ""We're disappointed, but obviously there's a much bigger picture at stake here than just the release of a James Bond film. ""I guess now it's become the even-more-anticipated movie of 2020, the publicity just ratchets it up."" Plus, he jokes: ""Absence does make the heart grow Bonder."" Louise Tutt points out: ""The last two Bond films have been released in November, so it's being pushed back to a familiar slot for the franchise."" The promotional machine has already swung into motion, though, withDaniel Craig currently due to go ahead with his hosting slot on Saturday Night Live,externalthis weekend. Latest:Live coverage of developments Easy steps:What can I do? A simple guide:What are the symptoms? Maps and charts:Visual guide to the outbreak Video:The 20-second hand wash Several tourists and locals in Milan, Italy have been wearing facemasks in public ""It could be hugely damaging,"" says Tutt, noting the $2bn (Â£1.53bn) fall in box office takings in China alone in the first two months of the year. ""China's a huge market for these US studios, and coronavirus fears are really cranking up in the States, so I think they are anticipating cinema closures - or people being discouraged from going to public places like that at some point. Which is probably what will happen here as well at some point."" But The Hollywood Reporter's Pamela McClintock notes,external: ""For now, No Time to Die, which carries a budget of around $250m before marketing, appears to be a lone wolf. ""That's reassuring news for cinema owners, who are already under assault from the rise of streaming services."" If we're all in self-isolation, then perhaps we'll be watching the streaming and on-demand platforms instead. And films about global pandemics could be especially popular.According to Deadline,external, 2011 drama Contagion, starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, and Jude Law, has shot up to become the second-most watched movie in the Warner Bros catalogue, only behind the Harry Potter franchise.

"Ronaldinho retired after seven games for Fluminese in 2015 Former Brazil forward Ronaldinho is being held by police in Paraguay for allegedly using a fake passport to enter the country, authorities say.

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"This video can not be played Chief medical adviser Professor Chris Whitty: ""Community transmission highly likely"" UK health officials are moving towards the second phase of their response to the coronavirus outbreak. It comes as the number of UK people diagnosed with the virus reached 115, a rise of 30 since Wednesday. The latest government figures released on Thursday,externalshowed that of the total number of cases, 25 are in London. Earlier, the country's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said the next phase - ""delay"" - will see more action to slow the spread of the virus. He told MPs it was ""highly likely"" some people now being infected in the UK have no connection to overseas cases. The PM's official spokesman also said it is ""now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way"" and officials were ramping up work to prepare for the next ""delay"" phase. According to the latest figures, Prof Chris Whitty, said 25 of the newly diagnosed patients are from England. Officials do not know how eight of the new cases contracted the virus - taking the number of cases like this, where patients had not recently been abroad, to 13. Of the total patients in England, there are: 25 in London 17 in the north-west 17 in the south-east 15 in the south-west 10 in the north-east and Yorkshire Nine in the Midlands Eight in the east of England Four yet to be determined On Thursday,three new cases were confirmed in Scotlandas well asone in Wales.Northern Ireland has three cases. Speaking to MPs on the health and social care committee, Prof Whitty said the country was now ""mainly"" in the delay phase ofthe government's four-part plan,externalto tackle the virus, but was still following aspects of the first phase. Downing Street said it would formally announce when it switches from the contain to delay stage of taking on the virus - and that this has not yet happened. Some people are wearing masks, although it is not official government advice At a medical centre in London, patients can be tested at a drive-through The government is still deciding what measures will be taken in the delay phase, but has previously said they could include banning big events, closing schools, encouraging people to work from home and discouraging the use of public transport. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) had told him that closing schools and stopping big gatherings ""don't work as well perhaps as people think in stopping the spread"". He told ITV's This Morning programme: ""One of the theories is perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance."" Mr Johnson said it would be ""business as usual"" for the ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the UK. How is the UK planning to stop coronavirus? Hand sanitiser rationed at chemists as sales surge Why are people stockpiling toilet paper? Prof Whitty also said there was ""no need"" for members of the public to stockpile food or medicine, adding that the outbreak would be a ""marathon not a sprint"". ""There is nothing in the current environment that would rationally lead someone to want to go out and stock up on stuff,"" he added. The government has said it has a stockpile of important medicines and protective equipment, to counter any impact to global supply chains. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Prof Whitty said benefits of the delay phase included: Pushing the peak of cases ""further away from the winter pressures on the NHS"" so that there was ""more capacity to respond"" Buying time to allow the UK to improve its response or develop counter measures such as drugs, vaccines and diagnostics There may be a seasonal element of the virus - so if the peak was delayed to spring or summer, the ""natural rate"" of transmission could be lower Prof Whitty said the early stages of the delay phase were similar to the contain phase, and involved identifying cases of the virus, isolating patients, and tracing anyone who had been in contact with them. ""As time moves by, we then may start to move into the more socially determined actions... the kind of measures we can do to delay things which involve changes to society,"" he said. He said it was likely that later in the response, elderly people and those with pre-existing health conditions would be advised to ""have some degree of isolation from more public environments"" and may be told, for example, to ""avoid crowded areas"". On Wednesday the highest day-on-day rise in cases in the UK was reported,when the number of cases jumped from 51 to 87.

Three days more sick pay for self-isolating workers The UK's early response to the virus, which causes Covid-19, was based on the spread being controlled in China, with some minor outbreaks in other countries, Prof Whitty said. But he added: ""The chances of that happening are now very slim. Slim to zero."" Prof Whitty said in the worst case scenario of an epidemic in the UK, critical care beds would be ""under pressure at quite an early stage"".

"Loganair said the two routes, to Aberdeen and Inverness, will be launched later this month Scottish airline Loganair has announced it will take up two routes formerly flown by Flybe out of Belfast City Airport. Flybe went into administration earlier on Thursday, putting 2,000 jobs at risk across the UK. All Flybe flights were cancelled and its passengers have been advised not to go to the airport. Flybe operated 14 routes from Belfast City Airport - about 80% of its scheduled flights. This video can not be played Flybe: 'I booked flights hours before collapse' Loganair said the two routes - between Aberdeen and Belfast and Inverness and Belfast - will commence on 16 March and 23 March respectively. The airline will be taking up 16 formerly Flybe routes across the UK and has opened a special recruitment line for former Flybe employees. Belfast City Airport said ""a number of airlines"" have expressed interest in taking over its routes affected bythe collapse. Belfast City Airport's chief executive said it was a challenging time for both staff and customers. but he was confident of rebuilding its network. ""In the last 24 hours, we've had an interest in all of our network,"" Brian Ambrose told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""For some of the larger routes, we've had multiple interest from a number of airlines. Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters Flybe collapse: Your rights explained ""So I'm confident that within the next days and weeks we will be announcing backfill on a number of those routes and it's a matter of how quickly airlines can get aircraft available. ""The airline was a significant economic driver for the region, carrying 1.6 million passengers to and from Belfast in 2019,"" he explained. The departures board at Belfast City Airport on Thursday morning Analysis by Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Northern Ireland is particularly reliant on air links, simply because of its geography. To get to any other part of the UK from here, you have only two options - go by sea, or by air. Local MPs stressed those circumstances in their questions in parliament. Stephen Farry from the Alliance Party said Northern Ireland had in effect lost 25% of its air travel capacity ""overnight"". The DUP's Gavin Robinson - whose constituency takes in Belfast City Airport - said the government had been ""large in ambition"" for regional connectivity but ""light on detail"". Gavin Robinson said the government had been ""large in ambition"" for regional connectivity but ""light on detail"" Transport Minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons she ""absolutely recognised"" Northern Ireland had specific concerns. She pointed out that the Conservative Party manifesto contained a commitment to consider devolving short-haul air passenger duty (APD). A report drawn up for Stormont last yearsuggested cutting APD would probably enhance Northern Ireland's aviation connections, but would be unlikely to deliver value for money. Mr Ambrose said that Flybe had operated ""a strong and profitable base"" from Belfast which would prove attractive to other carriers. He also said he was also hopeful that some of the airlines might consider hiring Flybe staff. ""We were talking to a number of staff last night when they came off shift and they're going home to let their families know they've lost their jobs,"" said Mr Ambrose. ""As we secure these routes, we will be certainly telling the incoming airlines - if they need staff, if they need engineers and pilots and crew  - they have quality staff who have been working here for many years and hopefully some of them will pick up jobs in the process."" The economy minister said she deeply regrets the closure of Flybe In a statement, Flybe said it had been unable to overcome significant funding challenges. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Flybe CEO Mark Anderson said the UK had lost one of its ""greatest regional assets"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she deeply regrets the closure of Flybe. ""Maintaining air connectivity is absolutely vital to Northern Ireland - to enable access to the economic market in Great Britain and for tourists arriving to our airports from Great Britain and beyond,"" she said. She added: ""My department will work closely with [the Department for Transport] to assist, as required, with the repatriation of Northern Ireland passengers."" Flybe carried 1.6 million passengers to and from Belfast City Airport in 2019 The collapse of Flybe has also caused concerns for staff and students at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB), many of whom relied on the routes for academic collaboration with other UK universities. ""This is very challenging for us,"" said QUB Faculty Pro Vice-Chancellor, Prof Stuart Elborn. ""We've students and staff who commute using the Flybe airline very frequently for research, for education. ""We've a number of joint post-graduate programmes - for example one with Aberdeen which is very important to us and the only flight to Aberdeen to Belfast and back is Flybe. ""So this will have an impact for sure and we will have to seek ways to mitigate that."" Have you been affected by the collapse of Flybe?

"UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, placing some of the blame on the coronavirus outbreak. But there have long been problems at the firm, which was rescued from collapse just a year ago. What went wrong at Flybe, which was Europe's largest regional airline? Flybe operated about 40% of regional UK flights, so it was particularly exposed to anything that went wrong in the domestic market. This meant a recent fall in demand prompted by the coronavirus outbreak just added to its list of woes at home. It already had to contend withstorms disrupting travel, and the effects of Brexit including sluggish UK consumer spending. The weak pound following the referendum also worsened the impact of increased fuel and aircraft leasing costs. There was also a constant pressure on the airline to be competitive with rail and road travel. Aviation is a notoriously competitive industry at the best of times. ""It is saddled with high-cost assets, namely planes, and key costs that fluctuate uncontrollably, mainly fuel, which accounts for around a third of total airline costs,"" Prof Loizos Heracleous, a Warwick Business School aviation expert recently told the BBC. ""On top of that, they face high regulation, often aggressive unions, low barriers to entry that increase competition, and high bargaining power of buyers."" The UK is particularly competitive, with Flybe squeezed between major airlines such as British Airways and the big low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet. At the same time, average fares have fallen, squeezing margins and leaving no room for mistakes. When the carrier was taken over by a consortium last February, it was posting losses of around Â£20m a year. Why Flybe matters Flybe collapse: Your rights explained Many Flybe routes were domestic, placing it at a tax disadvantage. Airlines have to pay Air Passenger Duty (APD), a tax per passenger on flights taking off in the UK. For international flights, Air Passenger Duty only has to be paid on the route out of the country. But for journeys within the UK, APD is paid both on departure and arrival. The levy is thought to have cost Flybe more than Â£100m a year, something it had long complained about. The government wasconsidering a cut in APD on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operated more than half of UK internal flights outside London. But this was unlikely to come into effect until next year, as the UK is wary of contravening EU state aid rules while still in the Brexit transition period. A decade ago, Flybe was listed on the stock market as part of an ambitious pan-European expansion plan. The listing raised money to buy more planes, including an Â£850m order for 35 Embraer 175 jets to ""underpin"" its expansion into Western Europe. But for years after that it struggled with overcapacity. ""They ended up putting planes on routes to use up the aeroplanes, rather than buying a fleet to fly routes effectively and successive managements battled with that burden,"" Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC aviation research, told the Today Programme. Over the past decade, Flybe has been rebranded twice, gone through four chief executives and neared collapse three times. It has also undergone several restructurings. A year ago, the carrier wasbought for Â£2.2mby a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital. But the owners ""were strange bedfellows"" who wanted different things from the acquisition, says John Strickland, an aviation analyst at JLS Consulting. ""We had two airlines with very different business models. Virgin was interested in Flybe to feed more passengers into its long haul flights into its airports at Heathrow and Manchester, while Stobart flies regional routes itself. ""Cyrus Capital were venture capitalists looking to make a return on their investments. None of these were compatible with each other, and I'm sure they had different opinions over time,"" he told the BBC's Wake Up To Money.

"This video can not be played 'We thought we'd come and get some fresh air' The Duke of Cambridge has called on the UK and Ireland to maintain the bonds of friendship after Brexit, on the second day of his visit to the country. The duke said relationships between people were ""more essential"" than legal treaties between states. He urged the UK and Ireland not to be ""bound by the wrongs of the past"". This is the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first official visit to the Irish Republic and they spent much of Wednesday talking to young people. In tone and content, the duke's address at the Museum of Literature in Dublin was reflective of the Queen's comments on her historic visit to the Irish Republic in 2011. He quoted his grandmother in saying the islands had ""experienced more than their fair share of heartache and turbulence"". The royal couple visited the Museum of Literature in Dublin Prince William pictured with TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Simon Coveney ""Of course, the changing relationship between the UK and the EU will require us to work together, to ensure that the relationship between Ireland and the UK remains just as strong,"" he said. ""I am confident that friendship, understanding and a shared vision for a peaceful and prosperous future will ensure that the unique and precious bond between our people is not broken. ""My family is determined to continue playing our part in protecting, preserving and strengthening that bond."" In pictures: William and Kate in Ireland - day two William and Kate end first day of visit with pint Why are William and Kate in Ireland? Wednesday's engagements began with a visit to Jigsaw, the National Centre for Youth Mental Health, where they spoke to staff about their work at the charity's premises in Dublin's Temple Bar. Their work is particularly close to Prince William's heart, having spoken in the past about his own struggles following the death of his mother. Children and young people at the centre presented them with gifts. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during a visit to mental health charity Jigsaw in Dublin Kate views artwork on Love Lane in Dublin's Temple Bar Josh and Alba told BBC News NI it was a ""surreal experience"". ""We had a good discussion around the stigma of mental health,"" said Alba. ""They were so interested in what is done here and so lovely - I think they could have listened all day long,"" said Josh. ""They had to be ushered away."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent This visit doesn't have the historic weight of the Queen's tour in 2011. Nor is there the celebrity frenzy that sometimes surrounded Harry and Meghan when they came after their engagement was announced in 2018. But solemnity there certainly was on Tuesday when the duke and duchess followed in the Queen's footsteps and paid their respects to the heroes of Irish independence at the Garden of Remembrance in central Dublin. And at the less grandiose events on Wednesday, at organisations whose activities align with William and Kate's interests, the welcome has been warm. On Wednesday night, the duke echoed his grandmother's words in 2011 when he addressed Britain and Ireland's shared history, its ups and many downs. All small steps that build the relationship between Britain and Ireland. James Barry, service manager at Jigsaw, said the couple were ""warm and kind"". ""They really wanted to hear about the experience of young people who've used the service,"" he said. ""I was fortunate enough to speak to Kate and she was really interested in young people's experiences from an early age and the importance of a parent role."" The royal couple visited a residential facility run by charity Extern Table tennis was also served up during a visit to Savannah House Fans held flags to express support for the couple Earlier in the day, the duke and duchess visited Savannah House in County Kildare, a residential facility run by the charity Extern which supports young people with a range of issues from being homeless to dealing with drug and alcohol problems. The villagers of Prosperous, County Kildare, are not very good at keeping secrets While there, they visited a nearby village shop to buy ingredients to make vegetable soup - with â¬20 (Â£17) to spend. The trip to the store was supposed to be a secret but word got out and about 200 villagers had gathered to see them. Store owner Philip Stynes admitted he had told a few customers about the impending visit and word soon spread. ""It just snowballed from there,"" he said. ""But even if we hadn't told them, there would have been a big crowd. People live out on the streets here."" While visiting Howth Marine Institute to learn about marine sustainability, the couple took the opportunity to stretch their legs at Howth Cliff, a popular walking path beside the Irish Sea. Wednesday's itinerary also included a visit to the Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority, known as Teagasc. The pair are following in the footsteps of Queen Elizabeth, who visited the Irish Republic in 2011 The duchess had a diplomatic sip at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin on Tuesday night The royal couple's first day in the country began with a warm welcome from Irish President Michael D Higgins and his wife at their official residence, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in. As is traditional during visits of important guests, the duke and duchess rang the peace bell within the grounds of the estate. They also met the caretaker taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar and his partner, Matthew Barrett, at government buildings in the city centre.

"John Lewis has warned it could close shops as a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. The retailer, which also owns Waitrose, has launched a review of the business which it said would involve ""right sizing"" its stores across both brands. The review would involve store closures ""where necessary"" as well as space reduction in existing stores, it said. The conclusions of the review are expected to be announced in September. New chairwoman Sharon White - who took over last month - said the changes would kick-start a ""vital new phase"" for the partnership, and said she had ""no doubt"" the business would be stronger as a result. ""We need to reverse our profit decline and return to growth so that we can invest more in our customers and in our partners. ""This will require a transformation in how we operate as a partnership and could take three to five years to show results."" The group announced that three Waitrose stores would close later this year at Helensburgh, Four Oaks and Waterlooville as part of the overhaul. John Lewis also said as fears about coronavirus continued to spread, it had see increased demand ""particularly this week"" for some food items as well as things such as hand sanitiser, soap and loo roll. John Lewis's finance director, Patrick Lewis, said it was working ""very hard with suppliers on an hourly basis"" to keep up with demand. Sharon White took the helm at John Lewis last month The John Lewis Partnership is owned by its staff - known as partners - who usually receive a bonus each year. This year, staff bonuses have been set at 2%, the lowest since 1953 when it paid no bonus. Profits at the partnership dived by 23% last year,externalto Â£123m - the third year in a row that profits have fallen - as it continued to struggle with the slowdown in consumer spending. The John Lewis department stores saw ""significantly reduced profitability"" following weaker sales of home and electrical goods, although profits rose at Waitrose after a ""solid performance"", the company said. John Lewis axes third of top jobs in restructuring 'Worst year for retail in 25 years' Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the fall from grace for John Lewis had been ""spectacular"", and warned that if Ms White could not turn around the business ""the fallout could be much worse"". ""Once the envy of the retail industry, the company has suffered dismal trading performances over the past few years, demonstrating that the retail race is so fast that even those seemingly on an unstoppable march one year can be vulnerable the next. ""This goes to show that no retailer is safe."" Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of retail analysts Savvy, said store closures appeared inevitable. ""I think the business is going to have to be slimmed down,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very difficult to close some of the department stores down because they're on really long leases, but certainly I think where there are opportunities to close stores that aren't performing they will look at that."" She added that Ms White did not have much time to turn the business around. ""She's talking about changes taking three-to-five years, I don't think there are three-to-five years in retail at the minute where there isn't going to be an enormous amount of change. She hasn't got that much time on her side. John Lewis have been 'strategically reviewing' things for quite a while - we need some action."" Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC the firm's staff bonus scheme was an ""absolutely fundamental"" part of its ethos. ""The key competitive edge John Lewis has is customer service, that is delivered by its staff. If you take away part of their remuneration then your customer service levels are likely to be impacted. ""And I think that over the past few years as that bonus has gone down we've been seeing a bit of that. It's a really difficult dilemma they have.""

"Twitter is testing a feature that will allow some tweets to disappear after 24 hours, it announced on Wednesday. The new feature called ""fleets"" is similar to vanishing posts on Snapchat and Instagram Stories. The changes prompted the hashtag #RIPTwitter to trend as users complained the new feature would make the micro-blogging site too similar to other social media platforms. So far Twitter is only testing the function in Brazil. Kayvon Beykpour, the company's product lead, said the new feature would allow people to post thoughts they might have felt uncomfortable sharing publicly. He said posting on Twitter can feel ""permanent and performative"" which can intimidate some users. ""We're hoping that Fleets can help people share the fleeting thoughts that they would have been unlikely to Tweet,"" hewrote,externalin a seven-part post on Twitter. The vanishing messages will appear when a user's profile picture is clicked. Users will not be able to reply, like, or publicly comment on any of the disappearing messages. Some Twitter users made plain their reservations. Mr Beykpour acknowledged that Fleets did sound a lot like the Stories features from Facebook and Instagram. He said Twitter was making a ""few intentional differences"" to its version. The company did not say when Fleets would be rolled out globally.

"The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like. Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"". Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China.It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021. That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively. Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent,external- an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak, Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores.Accountancy giant EY,externalsays 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping. This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021.

"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Airline Flybe has gone into administration Some 2,000 jobs are now at risk Collapse came after bid for fresh financial support failed Flybe said coronavirus outbreak played a part Airline now advises customers not to travel to airport Bill Wilson and Tom Espiner Due to unexpected circumstances we're shutting early today, thanks for tuning in. We'll be back at 6am tomorrow. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Ireland is particularly reliant on air links simply
because of its geography. To get to any other part of the UK from here, you have only
two options - go by sea, or by air. Local MPs stressed those circumstances in their questions in
Parliament. Stephen Farry from the Alliance Party said Northern Ireland
had in effect lost 25% of its air travel capacity âovernightâ. The DUPâs Gavin Robinson - whose constituency has Belfast
City Airport - said the government had been âlarge in ambitionâ for regional
connectivity but âlight on detailâ. The Transport Minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons she
âabsolutely recognisedâ Northern Ireland had specific concerns. She pointed out that the Conservative Party manifesto
contained a commitment to consider devolving short-haul Air Passenger Duty. A report drawn up for Stormont last yearsaid cutting APD
would probably enhance Northern Irelandâs aviation connections - but would be
unlikely to deliver value for money. This video can not be played Flybe: Cardiff Airport boss tells customers 'don't turn up' Passengers have been urged to keep an eye on the Civil Aviation Authority website. Stephen and Zarathe Jenkins were among just a handful of passengers passing through Southampton earlier, thankful that their flight was booked through Aurigny and not Flybe. Mrs Jenkins said: ""I just think it's awful. It's not just the impact it has for all the employees at Flybe but it's the knock-on effect for all the regional airports across the country. ""We've flown Flybe to Jersey a good few times and you feel for everybody involved. ""I was made redundant last year and my husband was made redundant the year before and it's a really scary prospect but thankfully we both came out of it OK. ""We both found other jobs but I guess jobs within the airline industry are going to be more specific and it's not as easy to pick up another airline to go and work for. I wish them luck."" Flybe passengers have been told to be alert for scams when trying to get refunds, as other airlines such as Easyjet and railway companies such as LNER offer help. But other offers of help may not be all they seem. Citizens Advice's senior consumer expert Jan Carton said: ""Unfortunately we've found that, in these situations, scammers quickly jump on the bandwagon. ""If you're a Flybe customer and you're contacted by someone offering to act for you to recover your money it's more than likely to be a scam. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company won't be protected by the Atol scheme. ""However, if you went through a travel agent or other third party you may be covered. Some people may be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card. ""If people have accommodation booked, they should check the terms and conditions to see if they can get a refund. If they can afford to pay for another flight, it's also worth checking if they can alter the dates."" We've had a number of questions to the Business Live page from concerned readers who booked flights through airlines who partner with Flybe. Will those airlines still honour the tickets? We asked our personal finance reporters. They said if you booked the tickets through the partner airlines, they must get you from the starting airport of your trip to your destination airport. The
Aviation Minister Kelly Tolhurst has said the government âstands readyâ to
support the aviation sector following Flybeâs collapse. In
a Commons statement, she said she was âacutely awareâ of the impact the the
collapse would have on regional airports throughout the country. âUnfortunately
in a competitive market, companies do failâ she said. And
it is ânot the role of government to prop them up.â But
she said the government had been âabsolutely working hardâ to secure the
airlineâs future, and had been âworking tirelesslyâ to find a solution. She added: âThis
is not where I as the aviation minister wanted to be with Flybe.â And
she stressed that the government was âdeterminedâ to deliver on its promises to
the country on âlevelling upâ and âmaking sure regional connectivity and those
airports remain viable.â She
said the government would be working to ensure the routes were backfilled,
noting that Loganair had already committed to keeping 16 Flybe routes going. Andy

Simon GompertzBBC personal finance correspondent More than a thousand pensioners and pension savers are
waiting anxiously to find out if their pensions are affected by the Flybe
collapse. About 1,350 are thought to be members of the British Regional
Airlines Group pension scheme, which pays a pension based on final salary. Because the pension scheme is based in the Isle of Man, it
is not backed by the Pension Protection Fund which takes over stricken schemes
in the UK. The vast majority of Flybe staff were not in the final
salary scheme, which had been closed to new contributions. Many of the members are former employees of British Midland
and BA regional services, though Flybe was supporting the scheme up to its
collapse. It has been reported that the BRAL scheme had a deficit of
Â£11m and liabilities to pensioners of Â£170m. The
trustee board of the scheme is meeting today to review the prospects for
members. Great Western Railway has offered passengers who were supposed to be travelling with Flybe free train travel on Thursday. The train company said people would be required to provide ""reasonable evidence"" of their booking to their staff. Flybe employees who produce their staff identification would also be given free travel, the company said. Apart from the people directly employed by Flybe, what happens to people whose jobs may indirectly rely on the collapsed airline? The GMB union is concerned that firms such as Swissport may also suffer. Robert Deavy, who leads the Scottish division of the union, said: ""We
are deeply concerned about the knock-on effect from Flybe going bust to the
supply chain and companies like Swissport. ""Hundreds of jobs are at risk in
ground handling companies like Swissport and we need concrete action as what is
a developing crisis in aviation unfolds."" The final Flybe planes to fly to the Isle of Man are grounded at Ronaldsway Airport Passengers needing to fly from the Isle of Man to hospital appointments in England have been left unable to attend following the collapse of Flybe.

In a statement, the government said it was now ""talking with other airlines"" about taking over the routes. Read more here. Whether UK Flybe passengers will be able to make insurance claims for cancelled flights after the collapse of the airline will depend on their policy. Figures from data analysis firm Defaqto suggest that nearly half of travel insurance policies - 49% - cover the collapse of an airline. Another 19% of policies have that cover as an optional extra - you would have had to tick a box, and would probably had to pay extra, to get that cover on your policy. That leaves about a third - 32% - of policies without that kind of cover - those people would not be able to make a claim.

We'll be back at 6am tomorrow. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Ireland is particularly reliant on air links simply
because of its geography. To get to any other part of the UK from here, you have only
two options - go by sea, or by air. Local MPs stressed those circumstances in their questions in
Parliament. Stephen Farry from the Alliance Party said Northern Ireland
had in effect lost 25% of its air travel capacity âovernightâ. The DUPâs Gavin Robinson - whose constituency has Belfast
City Airport - said the government had been âlarge in ambitionâ for regional
connectivity but âlight on detailâ. The Transport Minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons she
âabsolutely recognisedâ Northern Ireland had specific concerns. She pointed out that the Conservative Party manifesto
contained a commitment to consider devolving short-haul Air Passenger Duty. A report drawn up for Stormont last yearsaid cutting APD
would probably enhance Northern Irelandâs aviation connections - but would be
unlikely to deliver value for money. This video can not be played Flybe: Cardiff Airport boss tells customers 'don't turn up' Passengers have been urged to keep an eye on the Civil Aviation Authority website. Stephen and Zarathe Jenkins were among just a handful of passengers passing through Southampton earlier, thankful that their flight was booked through Aurigny and not Flybe. Mrs Jenkins said: ""I just think it's awful. It's not just the impact it has for all the employees at Flybe but it's the knock-on effect for all the regional airports across the country. ""We've flown Flybe to Jersey a good few times and you feel for everybody involved. ""I was made redundant last year and my husband was made redundant the year before and it's a really scary prospect but thankfully we both came out of it OK. ""We both found other jobs but I guess jobs within the airline industry are going to be more specific and it's not as easy to pick up another airline to go and work for. I wish them luck."" Flybe passengers have been told to be alert for scams when trying to get refunds, as other airlines such as Easyjet and railway companies such as LNER offer help. But other offers of help may not be all they seem. Citizens Advice's senior consumer expert Jan Carton said: ""Unfortunately we've found that, in these situations, scammers quickly jump on the bandwagon. ""If you're a Flybe customer and you're contacted by someone offering to act for you to recover your money it's more than likely to be a scam. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company won't be protected by the Atol scheme. ""However, if you went through a travel agent or other third party you may be covered. Some people may be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card. ""If people have accommodation booked, they should check the terms and conditions to see if they can get a refund. If they can afford to pay for another flight, it's also worth checking if they can alter the dates."" We've had a number of questions to the Business Live page from concerned readers who booked flights through airlines who partner with Flybe. Will those airlines still honour the tickets? We asked our personal finance reporters. They said if you booked the tickets through the partner airlines, they must get you from the starting airport of your trip to your destination airport. The
Aviation Minister Kelly Tolhurst has said the government âstands readyâ to
support the aviation sector following Flybeâs collapse. In
a Commons statement, she said she was âacutely awareâ of the impact the the
collapse would have on regional airports throughout the country. âUnfortunately
in a competitive market, companies do failâ she said. And
it is ânot the role of government to prop them up.â But
she said the government had been âabsolutely working hardâ to secure the
airlineâs future, and had been âworking tirelesslyâ to find a solution. She added: âThis
is not where I as the aviation minister wanted to be with Flybe.â And
she stressed that the government was âdeterminedâ to deliver on its promises to
the country on âlevelling upâ and âmaking sure regional connectivity and those
airports remain viable.â She
said the government would be working to ensure the routes were backfilled,
noting that Loganair had already committed to keeping 16 Flybe routes going. Andy

""I have the pleasure of spending the day with these women today along with @AliceMarieFree [Alice Johnson] who helped to pick these women."" The women's names were suggested by Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who wasgranted clemency in a high-profile decision by Mr Trump in 2018. Kardashian West had lobbied the White House for her release. Ms Johnson was given a life sentence for a non-violent drugs conviction in 1996, and became a symbol for many of harsh sentencing in the US. It was Kardashian West who called Ms Johnson to say she was free, her lawyers said. US presidents have the power to cut short sentences of criminals or even pardon them. In February Mr Trump granted clemency to eleven people in total, includingformer Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. The women had also appealed to President Barack Obama for their sentences to be commuted before he left office, but the requests were denied.

"IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva The International Monetary Fund has announced $50bn (Â£39bn) of support for countries hit by the coronavirus. The organisation also warned that the outbreak had already pushed this year's global economic growth below last year's levels. The emergency measure came after the virus has spread rapidly outside China to more than 70 countries. This week governments and central banks around the world have taken action to ease the impact of the virus. The IMF said it is making the money available to help poor and middle-income countries with weak health systems respond to the epidemic. At the same time the fund said the spread of the coronavirus has erased expectations of stronger economic growth this year, and will push 2020 global output gains to their slowest rate since the financial crisis in 2008. But IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned that it is hard to forecast just how big the effect will be: ""Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year's levels, but how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict"". She also declined to say whether the escalating health crisis could push the world economy into a recession. Coronavirus cases in UK jump to 87 US makes emergency rate cut as coronavirus spreads World Bank pledges $12bn coronavirus aid package It is the latest move by global financial bodies, world governments and central banks to protect economies from the impact of the outbreak. On Tuesday the US central bank slashed interest rates in response to mounting concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus. In its first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis the US Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1% to 1.25%. Earlier the same day, both Australia and Malaysia cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. At the same time finance ministers from the G7 nations pledged to use ""all appropriate policy tools"" to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus. Also this week the World Bank committed $12bn (Â£9.4bn) in aid for developing countries grappling with the spread of the coronavirus. The emergency package included low-cost loans, grants and technical assistance. ""What we're trying to do is limit the transmission of the disease,"" World Bank Group President David Malpass told the BBC. In the UK, expectations are growing that the Bank of England could soon follow the Fed by announcing a rate cut, while new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may use next week's budget to announce financial support for British businesses as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

" Start again? By Rebecca Henschke and Abraham Utama Winda’s house in the Indonesian city of Jakarta is sinking 20cm (8 inches) every year. She has paid for four truckloads of rocks, gravel and cement to build up the foundations. That keeps the rising sea levels from her door, but there is an unfortunate side effect. “The ceiling is getting closer and closer with each layer we put on,” she exclaims. It is now within touching distance - just 50cm (20 inches) above her head. Jakarta’s story is a cautionary tale for city planners. Vulnerable to climate change - the Java Sea is rising - but also sinking, literally, under the weight ofbad governance and a host of poor decisions. An abandoned mosque in Jakarta For Winda this means continuing to raise her foundations. “Where else can we go? We don’t have the option of moving,” she says. But the Indonesian government does have that option - and is taking it. It has announced it is moving its administration about 2,000km (1242 miles)  to a site in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The US$34bn design is for a compact coastal city with five satellite towns, built on restored oil palm plantations and surrounded by wetlands and tropical forests. The aim is to complete the initial phase of construction by 2025. The choice of location makes sense politically and economically - Borneo is much closer to the centre of Indonesia’s sprawling archipelago. But the island is also home to some of the world’s most important forests, and isteeming with wildlife.It is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. The Indonesian leadership promises it will be a sustainable city the like of which Indonesia, and arguably the world, has never seen. Environmentalists fear however thatthis ambitious plan could have disastrous implications. The architectural team which won the government-run competition to design the capital - Urban+ architects, based in Jakarta -  say its aim is to work with nature, not against it. “We do have this incredible opportunity to start again – to build from nothing,” says Sofian Sibarani, the head of Urban+. “We have a chance to design something much closer to an ideal city than anything we have now.” He says the plan is that 70% of the 2500 sq km (965 sq mile) area allotted for the new city will be green space, and that the built areas will include an institute which will specialise in reforestation, and a botanical garden. He adds that the idea is to make it a compact walkable city, with areas that are pedestrian-only, and that the additional transport that is needed will be electric. The five satellite towns which surround the city will be separated by green belts so they don’t leach into each other, he says, explaining that they want to learn lessons from Jakarta, whose own satellite towns have merged, resulting in out-of-control urban sprawl. Jakarta’s other major planning issue is the fact that due to a lack of access to piped tap water, most people rely on pumping out groundwater, which is causing the land surface to sink. The crisis is compounded by rising sea levels as a result of climate change. If nothing is done, it is predicted that by 2050 95% of Jakarta’s coastal area will be under the sea. Sibarani says the issue with Jakarta, and other cities like it, is that they are no longer in balance with nature. So his team has chosen what is known asa biomimcry approach- learning from our surroundings. In the case of Urban+’s design, it means taking inspiration from the four distinct layers of the rainforest. Rita Padawangi, an Indonesian urban planning expert at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, says that as an exercise in urban design, it “hits all the right buttons”. “If you think what a new city should have, it taps into the digital revolution with all the high-tech elements and it’s trying to be sustainable,” she says. But she is deeply worried about the impact of the plan to move the capital to Borneo. “When you look at it from a social and environmental perspective I still have lots of questions. Like it or not, if you are going to build a city there will be a footprint - conversion of land that is greenery, or unbuilt land into built land - and that will have an impact.” An environmental impact assessment of the project has yet to be carried out. Padawangi’s other key concern is whether the design will be faithfully implemented. “It looks good on paper but as we all know Indonesia doesn’t have a very good track record in this regard,” she says. Despite government promises that it will be a green city, the state electricity company says the promised renewable energy will be primarily hydropower. Three hydroelectric power plants are planned for East Kalimantan.  They come with their own environmental problems and fall well short of the energy needed for the new capital. That has left activists worried that the bulk will have to come from coal-fired power plants.  At least three coal plants are already planned for construction in the province. The government has issued at least1,434 mining permitsin East Kalimantan, spanning more than 50,000 sq km (19,305 sq miles) - an area larger than Belgium. Kardi moved his family to East Kalimantan in the 1970s - as part of a major government-sponsored transmigration programme to get people off the overcrowded island of Java and into more sparsely populated areas of Indonesia. “Lots of people didn’t last,” he laughs. “It was too tough so they went home. There were lots of wild pigs and monkeys - they stole our food.” He has witnessed incredible change here but has also paid a high personal cost for the development that East Kalimantan has already seen. According to Jatam, an Indonesian mining advocacy network, East Kalimantan has 1,735 inactive open pit mines that belong to 1,404 companies which have failed to honour their legal obligation to fill in exhausted pits and restore the land. It is just one example of how the area has already been exploited at the expense of the local community. Kardi’s 10-year-old granddaughter Natasya Aprilia Dewi was playing near one such abandoned coal mining pit  - now full of rainwater - last May, when she fell in and drowned. “She couldn’t swim and the sharp sides of the pit meant she didn’t have a chance of climbing out.” Natasya's mother, Purwanti, says she could only believe her daughter died when she saw her body. “I was so shocked… she was such a good girl. I hoped that she could have grown up and fulfilled her dreams. She would have made us proud. She wanted to become a doctor.” Natasya in a photo held up by her mother Natasya is one of 36 people who have died in abandoned mining pits in East Kalimantan in the last eight years - most of them children. Kardi hopes that if the central government is closer – not hundreds of miles away on another island – their concerns will be listened to rather than ignored. And he is also excited about the financial potential of the capital moving to Borneo. “It’s growth, it’s the future, and as a result this area will become busier and it will improve the economic situation here, so there will be more jobs.” Dahlia, from the Paser tribe, says she is worried the move could destroy her community’s unique culture. “We are disappointed and scared. We are worried that our land will be filled with tall buildings and we will lose our way of life,” says the 23-year-old. Dahlia  leads a dance troupe in Sepaku village, close to where the capital will be She is also worried about the further migration it will bring. “We have to prepare ourselves to protect our culture, our language, and hope people will not steal our land,” she says. She has never been to the current capital, but she has seen it on television and is not impressed. “I don’t want to live under bridges like the poor do in Jakarta.” Indigenous people like Dahlia have already had to witness other changes on Borneo. In the last 50 years, tens of millions of hectares of forest has been cleared - one of the fastest deforestation rates in the world - to make way for the coal mines, but also to accommodate pulp and paper and oil palm plantations. Indonesia is now the world’s largest producer of palm oil - a product used in everything from shampoo to chocolate. Syukran Amin, also from the Paser tribe, says that the community is already in conflict with the concessions running the palm oil and pulp and paper plantations, and believes the plan to move the capital will just mean they have to fight the government as well. “We know their ‘forest city’ plans but we don’t want them to plant trees - we want them to protect the forest that is left here,"" he says. For those who will move here from Jakarta, however, the prospect appears to be an exciting one - at least for the younger people on an official tour to the area. Diaz Diandra, one of the one million civil servants who will have to relocate, is enthusiastic, despite the long gruelling journey on speedboat and bone-jangling buses to get here from Jakarta. “I am thrilled and excited about living in a city that has been planned and has good public transport,” the 30-something says while visiting the area on an official tour. “I can leave behind all the long hours stuck in traffic getting to work.” Leading the tour is Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro who was at the helm of this project at its outset. He stands on a tower overlooking the site - a seemingly endless stretch of oil palm trees. He reiterates that the government will honour its promise to look after forest that falls within the 2500 sq km (965 sq miles) designated for the new capital. “We know conservation forest in this area has been degraded and used for other illegal purposes but now we will protect it.” He also pledges that the government will restore the dangerous abandoned coal mines and will start a process of granting land certificates to the indigenous community in order to guard against land grabs. But there is little trust among environmentalists here. Dedi Irawan, a local environmentalist who works with mining advocacy group Jatam, takes us into Bukit Suharto – 619 sq km (239 sq miles) of thick jungle which is one of the last big areas of virgin forest left in East Kalimantan and which sits within the area earmarked for the new capital. “They say they will protect this… but we have had promises before. We have seen mining companies come in with promises that they would restore the land and that didn’t happen,” he says. A collaboration of rights and environmental groups releaseda report earlier this yearwhich found that a number of the concessions granted previously in the area are linked to some of the country’s wealthiest and most powerful business figures and politicians. With the permits for some of these concessions not set to expire for another 20 years, there are concerns over how and at what cost the government can force the holders to relinquish them. The government insists there is no legal requirement to compensate concession holders for relinquishing the land. Dedi does not trust the government's promises There is also disquiet over the make-up of the advisory board for the capital - it is chaired by Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates and includes such figures as Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Japanese holding company SoftBank, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Planning specialist Rita Padawangi says this deepens her fears about who the new capital is really being built for. “Why can’t the indigenous people be the advisors? They are the ones who are going to be most affected by this. “Is it just going to be a gated community of elite civil servants coming from Jakarta?” she asks. Davi heads off to forest school at 09:00. He is one of the orphaned orangutans at a sanctuary and rehabilitation centre run by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation that falls within the outer ring of the new capital area. Orangutans are a protected species in Indonesia, but the rapid deforestation means they are now critically endangered. For those that have been orphaned, staff at the foundation try to fulfil the role that their mothers would have played and teach them survival skills. “We feed them, teach them how to find food and when they are old enough we show them how to climb trees,” says Isna, an employee at the centre, as she carries Davi on her back. Today they are learning how to make a nest up a tree. Davi, as the youngest, needs a little help climbing the tree. And then everyone works together to make a safe place to sleep. But it is getting harder to find suitable forest to return them to as a result of deforestation - often the forests are burned to make way for the plantations. In 2015, out-of-control fires burned approximately 26,000 sq km (10,039 sq miles) across Indonesia - an area roughly the size of Rwanda. They destroyed 3 sq km (1.2 sq miles) of the precious forest at the orangutan sanctuary. Researchers from Harvard and Columbia Universitieslinked the toxic haze that year to more than 100,000 premature deaths. And the amount of carbon emissions released in a few months was equal to the emissions in the US over a year. Despite promises from the government that the disaster would not happen again, last year fires once again blanketed the region in haze. A firefighter walks through last year's Borneo smog Jamartin Sihite, the CEO of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, hopes that if the country’s leadership are in Borneo, things might change. “When the politicians come close to nature and develop great feelings for the natural landscape then it will be easier,” he says. “They will know that there is no forest for the orangutans. They will see it and have to face it directly. I don’t have to go to Jakarta to try and explain.” But he warns that without meticulous planning and public participation, the new capital city could suffer from the same fate as Jakarta. “If they repeat the mistakes made in Jakarta it will just move the problem. They’re coming to Borneo, they have to use the forest as a key part of the development, or not come to Borneo at all.”  It’s a sentiment Sofian Sibarani, the winning designer, strongly agrees with. Over the coming months his team will be working on making the urban design guidelines for the new capital. “Hopefully this time they will be enforced because this time the world will be watching,” he says.

"The UK has seen its biggest day-on-day increase in coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 87. Almost all of the 36 new patients had recently travelled to affected countries or been infected by others who had done so, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. But it is not clear how three new patients in England caught the virus. Meanwhile, it has emerged that two patients at King's College Hospital have been diagnosed with the virus. A family member of an elderly patient at the south London hospital told the BBC one of those who was infected had been staying in the same room as his relative prior to being diagnosed. The hospital said it had restricted access for staff and visitors to the affected ward, and was tracing those who may have come into contact with the infected patients. As of Wednesday afternoon, 87 cases have been confirmed in the UK. There are 80 in England, three in Scotland, one in Wales andthree in Northern Ireland. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Health minister Edward Argar toldBBC Breakfastthe UK was ""still very much"" in the first ""contain"" phase of the government'sfour-part response to the virus,external. He said the government would not move on to the second phase - known as the ""delay"" phase - unless Prof Whitty advised it ""on the basis of specific changes in circumstances"". The contain phase involves trying to prevent the virus from becoming widespread - in part by tracing contacts of anyone who is infected. The delay phase aims to slow the spread of the virus so that it does not reach its peak during the winter. This would ease the impact on the NHS. Two of the latest patients are Scottish, with one living in the Grampian area and the other in Ayrshire. One had recently travelled to northern Italy while the other had contact with a known positive case. New cases of the virus in England have been confirmed in Liverpool, York, Carlisle, Newcastle, Torquay and Manchester, as well as in Lancashire and Derbyshire. In Northern Ireland, a Queen's University postgraduate student, who recently returned from northern Italy and has been mixing with fellow students, tested positive. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Face mask ads banned for 'misleading' virus claims Meanwhile, students at Goldsmiths in south London have been told a visitor to one of the university's halls of residences has coronavirus. In an email, the university said the person was ""being looked after"" and that the student they visited was ""self-isolating as a precautionary measure"". Buckingham University and the University of London have put back their graduation ceremonies to minimise the spread of the disease. Prof Whitty -who earlier said an epidemic in the UK was ""likely""- said people who had been in contact with the new patients are being traced. In ""the worst case scenario"", up to 80% of the UK population could be infected with coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, he said. But he said a move to lock down entire towns and cities across the UK would be ""very unlikely"".

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said washing hands regularly was the ""single most important thing that an individual can do"". Public Health England says to use a hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available, advising that hand washing is particularly important after using public transport. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 It's the biggest daily rise we have had. But this is not unexpected - health officials have been warning we should be braced for an increase. This could last for two or three months until a peak is reached. Of the new cases, three are worrying from the perspective that the government has been unable to establish how they were infected. They have no links to people who have been abroad to places where there are significant outbreaks. That brings the total number of cases like this to five - and could be a sign that the virus is circulating in the community. Some of the other new cases are not people who had been abroad, but were infected in this country by people who had been. That in itself is a sign there are clusters developing that the health authorities will be working hard to contain. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced emergency legislation allowingworkers to get statutory sick pay from the first day they are off work, not the fourth, to help contain the virus. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons that people who self-isolate should not be ""penalised for doing the right thing"". The sick pay announcement means those receiving statutory sick pay would get an extra Â£40 a week, paid for by their employers. The government has saidup to a fifth of the workforce may be off sickduring the peak of a coronavirus epidemic in the UK. About 90,000 people have been infected globally since the outbreak of coronavirus in Hubei province, China, in December, with cases in more than 50 countries and more than 3,000 deaths. Last week, a British man who was infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan became thefirst UK citizen to die from the virus.

"IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva The International Monetary Fund has announced $50bn (Â£39bn) of support for countries hit by the coronavirus. The organisation also warned that the outbreak had already pushed this year's global economic growth below last year's levels. The emergency measure came after the virus has spread rapidly outside China to more than 70 countries. This week governments and central banks around the world have taken action to ease the impact of the virus. The IMF said it is making the money available to help poor and middle-income countries with weak health systems respond to the epidemic. At the same time the fund said the spread of the coronavirus has erased expectations of stronger economic growth this year, and will push 2020 global output gains to their slowest rate since the financial crisis in 2008. But IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned that it is hard to forecast just how big the effect will be: ""Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year's levels, but how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict"". She also declined to say whether the escalating health crisis could push the world economy into a recession. Coronavirus cases in UK jump to 87 US makes emergency rate cut as coronavirus spreads World Bank pledges $12bn coronavirus aid package It is the latest move by global financial bodies, world governments and central banks to protect economies from the impact of the outbreak. On Tuesday the US central bank slashed interest rates in response to mounting concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus. In its first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis the US Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1% to 1.25%. Earlier the same day, both Australia and Malaysia cut interest rates in response to the outbreak. At the same time finance ministers from the G7 nations pledged to use ""all appropriate policy tools"" to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus. Also this week the World Bank committed $12bn (Â£9.4bn) in aid for developing countries grappling with the spread of the coronavirus. The emergency package included low-cost loans, grants and technical assistance. ""What we're trying to do is limit the transmission of the disease,"" World Bank Group President David Malpass told the BBC. In the UK, expectations are growing that the Bank of England could soon follow the Fed by announcing a rate cut, while new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may use next week's budget to announce financial support for British businesses as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

"The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is at risk from over-exploitation A study has called into question the effectiveness of measures to clamp down on the illegal wildlife trade. Critically endangered eels have been sold recently in Hong Kong stores, despite bans on their international trade, according to DNA evidence. The discovery raises concerns about the scale at which illegal wildlife products are entering the supply chain, say scientists in Hong Kong. There are growing calls for global action to end wildlife trafficking. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, China has moved to ban the wildlife trade and consumption, while governments across Southeast Asia have vowed to strengthen co-operation to curb illegal wildlife trade. Dr Mark Jones of the Born Free Foundation is among international experts calling for a new global agreement on wildlife crime. Exploitation in all its forms has been identified as a key driver of wildlife and biodiversity decline, he said, which could see the extinction of a million species over the coming decades, unless we transform the way we interact with the natural world. ""While there has typically been a focus on trade in and trafficking of wildlife between Africa and Asia, this is a problem affecting all corners of the world, and the dire plight of the European eel, the illegal trade in which is threatening the future existence of this species, is a very good example,"" he said. The European eel was once common in rivers but is now in rapid decline. The creature's epic migration extends from its Caribbean breeding grounds in the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Europe, North Africa and parts of Asia. But its status as a delicacy has attracted the attention of organised crime gangs. International trade in the eel is banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), except where a permit is issued. Yet, according to the new study, the eel was available in Hong Kong stores in 2017 and 2018, despite the fact that no imports were declared. Looks virtually identical to similar eels, making it easy to launder with legal products As the Japanese eel has declined, European eels are being sourced to meet demand Commercial harvesting has added to other threats, including habitat loss, barriers to migration, pollution, parasites, and changing ocean conditions. DNA testing of eel products available at 49 retail outlets in Hong Kong identified 45% as European eel.  Of 13 brands tested, nine were found to contain the critically endangered species. They were labelled as ""eel"". University of Hong Kong scientists say their research, published in the journalScience Advances,external, raises urgent concerns about the enforcement of international Cites trade regulations. Lead researcher Dr David Baker said Cites must be supported by strong enforcement efforts of illegal smuggling. ""Today there is a greater demand for transparency in labelling food products so that consumers can make informed decisions regarding food safety and wildlife conservation - this is especially true for fisheries. In the case of Hong Kong, even environmentally conscious consumers are being duped into consuming an endangered species."" Commenting on the study, Dr Jones said ""remarkably"", there is currently no global legal agreement on wildlife crime, and the degree to which countries prioritise and criminalise the illegal exploitation of wildlife ""varies enormously"". ""We are calling for the development of an international agreement under the United Nations' Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, in order to ensure all countries recognise the scale and serious nature of wildlife crime and the devastating impact it is having on so many species, and prioritise it through their law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial mechanisms,"" he said. Speaking in London on Tuesday to mark UN World Wildlife Day, John Scanlon, former Cites Secretary General, said that while some significant gains have been made in the past decade in tackling wildlife crime, ""serious environment-related crimes are slipping through the net"". He said recent evidence of the scale of the impacts on ecosystems, economies and public health, reflect the need for a comprehensive legally-binding regime to tackle wildlife crime, embedded within the framework of international criminal law.

"Italy has the most serious outbreak in Europe Italy has confirmed that it will shut all schools from Thursday for 10 days as it battles to contain the coronavirus outbreak. And all professional sport, including Serie A football matches, will be played behind closed doorsfor a month. A total of 107 people have now been killed by the coronavirus in Italy, which has the most serious outbreak in Europe. PM Giuseppe Conte said the health service risked being overwhelmed. Most of the more than 3,000 cases are in the north but others have been confirmed in 19 of Italy's 20 regions. As it happened: Updates from across the globe Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Face mask ads banned for 'misleading' virus claims Globally about 3,200 people have died and more than 90,000 have been infected, the vast majority in China, where the virus emerged late last year.

Another town north of Milan could be placed in quarantine as cases there grow. But the containment measures so far have failed to halt the spread - there's now been the first death south of Rome.

"Boots has suspended payments using loyalty points in shops and online after attempts to break into customers' accounts using stolen passwords. Customers will not be able to use Boots Advantage Card points to pay for products while the issue is dealt with. Boots said none of its own systems were compromised, but attackers had tried to access accounts using reused passwords from other sites. It comes days after a similar issue hit 600,000 Tesco Clubcard holders. A spokeswoman for Boots told the BBC the issue affected less than 1% of the company's 14.4 million active Advantage Cards - fewer than 150,000 people. But it could not give an exact number as the company was still dealing with the problem. No credit card information had been accessed, they said. Suspending payments using points removed the risk of hackers stealing the points to spend themselves, the spokeswoman said. Customers can still earn points when making purchases, and Boots hopes to have point payments back up as soon as possible. Boots launched its Advantage Card in 1997 ""We are writing to customers if we believe that their account has been affected, and if their Boots Advantage Card points have been used fraudulently we will, of course, replace them,"" the company said in a statement. ""We would like to reassure our customers that these details were not obtained from Boots,"" it added. The Boots Advantage card lets shoppers collect four points for every Â£1 spent, and each point is worth a penny. For example, a card with 200 points could be used to pay for an item worth Â£2. But the points can also be used when purchasing items online. Tesco issues warning to 600,000 Clubcard holders How do companies use my reward card data? So-called ""password stuffing"" happens when an attacker uses a list of compromised usernames and passwords from a previous data breach. They then try to log in to a different website, hoping for a match. Because many people use the same email and password combination for several websites, some of the combinations on the compromised list might work. In Tesco's case, the supermarket giant told customers it believed that a compromised list of usernames and passwords had been used to try to gain access to its customers' accounts - and it may have worked in some cases. It said no financial information was accessed, and it had restricted access to the accounts to prevent fraudulent use. Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at internet security firm Eset, said that Boots reminding their customers about the risk was a good move - but that password reuse is a ""gigantic problem"" in cyber-security. ""These lists of passwords can be easily found on the dark web for very little, or even free,"" he said. ""It would be a good idea for people to check they have implemented two factor authentication on each of their accounts as this makes the password stuffing attack that much harder."" ""My further advice is to use a password manager to store your uniquely different passwords robustly online so you don't have to remember them all."" Boots said customers could reset their passwords online, and should choose a unique password not used on other sites.

"UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, putting 2,000 jobs at risk, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Its website now advises customers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged an alternative flight. Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. In a letter to the airline's staff, chief executive Mark Anderson said: ""Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading."" In response to the collapse, the UK government said it was ready to help Flybe's workers find new jobs and would work with other airlines to replace services: ""We are working closely with industry to minimise any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry. "" Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I thought we would be saved but not this time' Flybe collapse: Your rights explained Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said everyone was ""gutted"" about the news but added: ""We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year. ""Unfortunately, with the situation that has developed with [coronavirus], an already weak company, I'm afraid, just hasn't been able to survive."" David Manners arrived at Exeter Airport this morning to find his Flybe flight to Paris had been cancelled. The trip had been planned as a surprise Christmas present for his wife and he said they were ""absolutely gutted"". David Manners said he was ""absolutely gutted"" over the airline's collapse Mr Manners, who lives in Lyme Regis, said Flybe's collapse would also be bad for the area. ""We use this airport quite a lot because it's so convenient,"" he said. ""We know some of the staff very wellâ¦ I feel for them."" Jessica, Abby and Robyn arrived in Exeter Airport to find their flight had been cancelled after Flybe's collapse Jessica, Abby and Robyn work for a recruitment agency and were due to return to Jersey via Exeter Airport after a business trip. They described the airport as a ""ghost town"" on arrival. Abby said: ""I use Flybe maybe once a month, and not having it now will be such a nightmare."" The group said that other airlines such as EasyJet or British Airways did operate flights from Jersey, but they typically only flew into larger airports such as London Gatwick. Ryanair has launched ""rescue"" fares for March and April on five routes following Flybe's collapse. They include flights between Bournemouth and Dublin, Belfast and Stansted and Belfast and Manchester. Train operators across Britain are also providing free travel to customers and Flybe staff who are unable to travel over the next week, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company will not be protected by Atol,the travel industry insurance fund However, if you bought through a travel agent or other third party you might be covered. Some people might be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card or with some debit cards. Thousands of jobs are at risk following the regional airline's collapse. Katherine Densham, a Flybe cabin crew member, had been due to fly to London City Airport from Exeter on Thursday. She has worked for the airline for 13 years after joining the firm straight from college. This video can not be played 'We're not sure what we're going to do now' She told the BBC that staff were feeling ""really sad"" and that she was not sure what to do next. Balpa, the pilots' union, said that pilots, cabin crew and ground staff ""have done their jobs brilliantly"" throughout its struggle. The union questioned how staff ""are going to find new jobs in the current climate"", although companies such as South Western Railway have already been calling out for job applications from Flybe staff on social media. Flybe ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic. But its troubles persisted, and it narrowly avoided going bust in January this year. The new owners said they would pump Â£30m into the business to keep it afloat, but appealed to the government for additional support. Flybe, which served destinations from the Channel Islands to Aberdeen, had also been hoping for a Â£100m lifeline from the government and changes to Air Passenger Duty taxes. But the news that it may benefit from government help sparked a backlash from its rivals. British Airways-owner IAG filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breached state aid rules. Virgin Atlantic said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Flybe had gone bust, adding that the consortium had invested more than Â£135m in keeping the airline flying for an extra year. While its financial problems were already apparent, a Flybe insider told the BBC the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry had ""made a bad situation much worse"". Air transport expert John Strickland added that the regional market was extremely challenging for any airline, but that Flybe had made matters worse some years ago through over-ambitious expansion. ""It's really too big for what it's trying to do,"" he said. Although Flybe is small compared to the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as ""disastrous"" for UK regions. Mr Strickland said Flybe is ""small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices... so a number of regional groups will risk not being served"". Following last December's general election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to ""level up"" the UK's regions, after the Conservatives won seats in previous Labour strongholds. He appeared ready to intervene to prop up the airline, considered a key transport link to many parts of the country. Flybe collapse affects Isle of Man hospital patients Cardiff Flybe passengers warned not to go to airport Shadow transport secretary Andy Macdonald said the airline had provided ""critical connectivity for many locations"" and its collapse would be ""disastrous news for passengers and employees alike."" ""The government has to answer how those vital links will be maintained following Flybe's collapse. Communities will be concerned about what this will mean for their local economies and the Secretary of State has to come up with answers to these questions as a matter of urgency,"" he said. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that he ""very much hoped"" that other airlines would take up the routes. He said discussions with other airlines would ""begin in earnest"" soon and he hoped to reinstate services ""on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than months"". For the past 15 years Flybe has been trying to join the big boys of aviation, and failing. The serious push came 10 years ago when it raised money with a stock market float, and set out a plan to become Europe's biggest regional airline, flying mid-sized planes between secondary cities. The model works brilliantly in America, where regional airlines, often flying as franchises of the larger network carriers, are a large and thriving business. It did not work - or at least Flybe did not make it work - in Europe. It retrenched, and was left in the farcical situation of paying for a fleet of Embraer aircraft that it could not fly. The remaining network was still too big, and cash resources dwindled. The airline came close to going under at the start of last year, but was bought by consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart, and a financial investor Cyrus Capital. They had conflicting objectives. Virgin was eager to preserve feed to its long-haul flights at Heathrow, and perhaps snaffle along the way some of Flybe's valuable Heathrow slots. Stobart was eager to keep flights at its main asset, Southend Airport. And Cyrus thought it might make money if the business was resuscitated. The trio were slow to act - a rebranding to Virgin Connect never happened, and losses continued to rise. A cold shoulder from the government and a rapid drop in bookings thanks to the coronavirus sealed the airline's fate. For the airports most affected -  Southampton, Exeter and Belfast City - this will be a worrying moment. There is not a queue of airlines wanting to pick up UK regional routes - and particularly not when the coronavirus has plunged the entire industry into uncertainty.

Relative to other countries dealing with coronavirus, the US has done only a handful of tests. On 6 March, the president signed an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) emergency funding bill to develop a vaccine and help states combat the virus. The UK, for instance,has allocated $38bn (Â£30bn)to deal with its impacts. This video can not be played Coronavirus 'risk to the American people remains very low' Concerns have deepened amid the sharp rise in the number of cases reported in the first week of March. More than half of US states have now reported cases of the sickness. High medical costs make the virus particularly problematic - many Americans avoid doctor's visits because of unaffordable charges. On 10 March, Vice-President Mike Pence - who is leading the US response - announced that a group of major health insurance companies covering almost 240 million Americans have agreed not to charge patients for coronavirus testing. They have also vowed to extend coverage for Covid-19 treatment in all benefit plans - but it's unclear what this extended coverage will entail, and it could still leave insured Americans with thousands of dollars in medical bills. Taking sick leave is another concern. Not all employers offer paid leave and workplace culture often pushes employees to go to work ill. President Trump's claim that coronavirus patients may get better ""by sitting around and even going to work"" drew widespread criticism from health experts. This could contribute to the virus spreading, as infected people may not show significant symptoms for up to 14 days. Why Americans don't take sick days Reality Check: Does UK spend half as much on health as US? Mr Pence has said one million tests are available in all state labs. So far fewer than 10,000 people have been tested - compared to 20,000 per day in South Korea. The administration has also granted labs permission todevelop and use their own diagnostic tests,externaleven as they are being reviewed by the national drug agency. Critics say the shortage of test and facilities has contributed to the community spread of the virus and some have raised doubts that health officials can meet the demand for more tests. The tests themselves have also had problems. Last month, some health centres noted difficulties using CDC tests.Kits developed at the CDC's lab in Atlanta were contaminated, Axios reported,external. Officials say the manufacturing issues have since been resolved. You will need a doctor to refer you to either the CDC or a state health department for testing. Your doctor can take a sample - a nose or throat swab - but it must be processed at a proper facility. You should call your doctor's office first - officials advise against going to an emergency room for testing. At least four states - California, Washington New York and Nevada - have mandated some insurers to cover tests. Even if the test is covered, however, patients may still have to pay fees for office or emergency room visits and any other tests, as well as hospital stays. And those who work at self-insured companies and uninsured Americans do not have these protections. You should wash your hands regularly - using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, avoid contact with people who have respiratory illness symptoms and stay away from animals. The CDC does not recommend wearing a face mask if you are not sick or taking care of someone who is ill. How worried should we be? A visual guide to the outbreak It may be useful to ensure you have enough supplies - like extra water, non-perishable food and medicines - in case you need to self-quarantine. You might want to discuss work-from-home options with your employer and plan for child care if schools need to close. If you self-isolate for 14 days, that means not going to work, school, or other public places and avoiding any public transit, including ride-shares and taxis. Friends and family can drop off supplies, but you shouldn't have any visitors. If you share a home with others, the key is to limit contact as much as possible. Try to avoid using the kitchen when others are there and make sure you clean all surfaces daily. While the CDC has encouraged businesses to not punish workers who self-quarantine, in the US, the decision is still ultimately left to the employers. Many states do not have laws regarding whether an employer can fire an employee who is in quarantine,Forbes reported,external. A February survey by the Business Group on Health, published bythe New York Times,external, found 68% of employers would pay employees for a quarantine, even if they were unable to work from home, while 12% would pay only for a set amount of time.

"The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is at risk from over-exploitation A study has called into question the effectiveness of measures to clamp down on the illegal wildlife trade. Critically endangered eels have been sold recently in Hong Kong stores, despite bans on their international trade, according to DNA evidence. The discovery raises concerns about the scale at which illegal wildlife products are entering the supply chain, say scientists in Hong Kong. There are growing calls for global action to end wildlife trafficking. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, China has moved to ban the wildlife trade and consumption, while governments across Southeast Asia have vowed to strengthen co-operation to curb illegal wildlife trade. Dr Mark Jones of the Born Free Foundation is among international experts calling for a new global agreement on wildlife crime. Exploitation in all its forms has been identified as a key driver of wildlife and biodiversity decline, he said, which could see the extinction of a million species over the coming decades, unless we transform the way we interact with the natural world. ""While there has typically been a focus on trade in and trafficking of wildlife between Africa and Asia, this is a problem affecting all corners of the world, and the dire plight of the European eel, the illegal trade in which is threatening the future existence of this species, is a very good example,"" he said. The European eel was once common in rivers but is now in rapid decline. The creature's epic migration extends from its Caribbean breeding grounds in the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Europe, North Africa and parts of Asia. But its status as a delicacy has attracted the attention of organised crime gangs. International trade in the eel is banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), except where a permit is issued. Yet, according to the new study, the eel was available in Hong Kong stores in 2017 and 2018, despite the fact that no imports were declared. Looks virtually identical to similar eels, making it easy to launder with legal products As the Japanese eel has declined, European eels are being sourced to meet demand Commercial harvesting has added to other threats, including habitat loss, barriers to migration, pollution, parasites, and changing ocean conditions. DNA testing of eel products available at 49 retail outlets in Hong Kong identified 45% as European eel.  Of 13 brands tested, nine were found to contain the critically endangered species. They were labelled as ""eel"". University of Hong Kong scientists say their research, published in the journalScience Advances,external, raises urgent concerns about the enforcement of international Cites trade regulations. Lead researcher Dr David Baker said Cites must be supported by strong enforcement efforts of illegal smuggling. ""Today there is a greater demand for transparency in labelling food products so that consumers can make informed decisions regarding food safety and wildlife conservation - this is especially true for fisheries. In the case of Hong Kong, even environmentally conscious consumers are being duped into consuming an endangered species."" Commenting on the study, Dr Jones said ""remarkably"", there is currently no global legal agreement on wildlife crime, and the degree to which countries prioritise and criminalise the illegal exploitation of wildlife ""varies enormously"". ""We are calling for the development of an international agreement under the United Nations' Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, in order to ensure all countries recognise the scale and serious nature of wildlife crime and the devastating impact it is having on so many species, and prioritise it through their law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial mechanisms,"" he said. Speaking in London on Tuesday to mark UN World Wildlife Day, John Scanlon, former Cites Secretary General, said that while some significant gains have been made in the past decade in tackling wildlife crime, ""serious environment-related crimes are slipping through the net"". He said recent evidence of the scale of the impacts on ecosystems, economies and public health, reflect the need for a comprehensive legally-binding regime to tackle wildlife crime, embedded within the framework of international criminal law.

"UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, putting 2,000 jobs at risk, after a bid for fresh financial support failed. The Exeter-based carrier said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand for air travel was partly to blame for its collapse. Its website now advises customers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged an alternative flight. Flybe boss Mark Anderson said he was ""very sorry"" for the firm's collapse. In a letter to the airline's staff, chief executive Mark Anderson said: ""Despite every effort, we now have no alternative - having failed to find a feasible solution to allow us to keep trading."" In response to the collapse, the UK government said it was ready to help Flybe's workers find new jobs and would work with other airlines to replace services: ""We are working closely with industry to minimise any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry. "" Five things that went wrong for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I thought we would be saved but not this time' Flybe collapse: Your rights explained Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said everyone was ""gutted"" about the news but added: ""We really tried to do everything we could back at the turn of the year. ""Unfortunately, with the situation that has developed with [coronavirus], an already weak company, I'm afraid, just hasn't been able to survive."" David Manners arrived at Exeter Airport this morning to find his Flybe flight to Paris had been cancelled. The trip had been planned as a surprise Christmas present for his wife and he said they were ""absolutely gutted"". David Manners said he was ""absolutely gutted"" over the airline's collapse Mr Manners, who lives in Lyme Regis, said Flybe's collapse would also be bad for the area. ""We use this airport quite a lot because it's so convenient,"" he said. ""We know some of the staff very wellâ¦ I feel for them."" Jessica, Abby and Robyn arrived in Exeter Airport to find their flight had been cancelled after Flybe's collapse Jessica, Abby and Robyn work for a recruitment agency and were due to return to Jersey via Exeter Airport after a business trip. They described the airport as a ""ghost town"" on arrival. Abby said: ""I use Flybe maybe once a month, and not having it now will be such a nightmare."" The group said that other airlines such as EasyJet or British Airways did operate flights from Jersey, but they typically only flew into larger airports such as London Gatwick. Ryanair has launched ""rescue"" fares for March and April on five routes following Flybe's collapse. They include flights between Bournemouth and Dublin, Belfast and Stansted and Belfast and Manchester. Train operators across Britain are also providing free travel to customers and Flybe staff who are unable to travel over the next week, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Flybe customers who bought tickets directly from the company will not be protected by Atol,the travel industry insurance fund However, if you bought through a travel agent or other third party you might be covered. Some people might be able to get their money back if they paid by credit card or with some debit cards. Thousands of jobs are at risk following the regional airline's collapse. Katherine Densham, a Flybe cabin crew member, had been due to fly to London City Airport from Exeter on Thursday. She has worked for the airline for 13 years after joining the firm straight from college. This video can not be played 'We're not sure what we're going to do now' She told the BBC that staff were feeling ""really sad"" and that she was not sure what to do next. Balpa, the pilots' union, said that pilots, cabin crew and ground staff ""have done their jobs brilliantly"" throughout its struggle. The union questioned how staff ""are going to find new jobs in the current climate"", although companies such as South Western Railway have already been calling out for job applications from Flybe staff on social media. Flybe ran into difficulties last year and was bought by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic. But its troubles persisted, and it narrowly avoided going bust in January this year. The new owners said they would pump Â£30m into the business to keep it afloat, but appealed to the government for additional support. Flybe, which served destinations from the Channel Islands to Aberdeen, had also been hoping for a Â£100m lifeline from the government and changes to Air Passenger Duty taxes. But the news that it may benefit from government help sparked a backlash from its rivals. British Airways-owner IAG filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breached state aid rules. Virgin Atlantic said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Flybe had gone bust, adding that the consortium had invested more than Â£135m in keeping the airline flying for an extra year. While its financial problems were already apparent, a Flybe insider told the BBC the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry had ""made a bad situation much worse"". Air transport expert John Strickland added that the regional market was extremely challenging for any airline, but that Flybe had made matters worse some years ago through over-ambitious expansion. ""It's really too big for what it's trying to do,"" he said. Although Flybe is small compared to the likes of British Airways, Ryanair or EasyJet, the loss of the operator has been described as ""disastrous"" for UK regions. Mr Strickland said Flybe is ""small in the scale of the UK market as a whole, but if you're flying out of Exeter, Newquay or specifically Southampton it really is one of the only airline choices... so a number of regional groups will risk not being served"". Following last December's general election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to ""level up"" the UK's regions, after the Conservatives won seats in previous Labour strongholds. He appeared ready to intervene to prop up the airline, considered a key transport link to many parts of the country. Flybe collapse affects Isle of Man hospital patients Cardiff Flybe passengers warned not to go to airport Shadow transport secretary Andy Macdonald said the airline had provided ""critical connectivity for many locations"" and its collapse would be ""disastrous news for passengers and employees alike."" ""The government has to answer how those vital links will be maintained following Flybe's collapse. Communities will be concerned about what this will mean for their local economies and the Secretary of State has to come up with answers to these questions as a matter of urgency,"" he said. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said that he ""very much hoped"" that other airlines would take up the routes. He said discussions with other airlines would ""begin in earnest"" soon and he hoped to reinstate services ""on those routes hopefully within weeks rather than months"". For the past 15 years Flybe has been trying to join the big boys of aviation, and failing. The serious push came 10 years ago when it raised money with a stock market float, and set out a plan to become Europe's biggest regional airline, flying mid-sized planes between secondary cities. The model works brilliantly in America, where regional airlines, often flying as franchises of the larger network carriers, are a large and thriving business. It did not work - or at least Flybe did not make it work - in Europe. It retrenched, and was left in the farcical situation of paying for a fleet of Embraer aircraft that it could not fly. The remaining network was still too big, and cash resources dwindled. The airline came close to going under at the start of last year, but was bought by consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart, and a financial investor Cyrus Capital. They had conflicting objectives. Virgin was eager to preserve feed to its long-haul flights at Heathrow, and perhaps snaffle along the way some of Flybe's valuable Heathrow slots. Stobart was eager to keep flights at its main asset, Southend Airport. And Cyrus thought it might make money if the business was resuscitated. The trio were slow to act - a rebranding to Virgin Connect never happened, and losses continued to rise. A cold shoulder from the government and a rapid drop in bookings thanks to the coronavirus sealed the airline's fate. For the airports most affected -  Southampton, Exeter and Belfast City - this will be a worrying moment. There is not a queue of airlines wanting to pick up UK regional routes - and particularly not when the coronavirus has plunged the entire industry into uncertainty.
