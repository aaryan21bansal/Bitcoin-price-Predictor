"Staff at Royal Albert Edward Infirmary contacted police with concerns about a 69-year-old woman's death A 75-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after his partner who was a patient in a hospital was found dead. The 69-year-old woman was being treated at Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan, Greater Manchester, when she died at about 21:30 GMT on Friday. Staff from hospital contacted police with concerns about her death. The woman's partner, from Ormskirk, Lancashire, remains in custody. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out and her next of kin has been contacted. A police spokesman said: ""Late on Friday, staff from Wigan Royal Albert Edward Infirmary contacted police with concerns in respect of one of their patients who had passed away. ""Given the circumstances presented to us, we have arrested the woman's partner, who is a 75-year-old man, on suspicion of murder.

"Talks in Madrid have gone into extra time as delegates try to agree on measures The Chilean official leading UN climate talks in Madrid has called on delegates to show flexibility, as they struggle to reach agreement on crucial measures needed to tackle climate change. The negotiations, which were scheduled to end on Friday, continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning. Carolina Schmidt said a deal was almost there but the outcome needed to be ambitious. The goal is a commitment to new carbon emissions cuts by the end of 2020. The European Union and small island states vulnerable to climate change are pushing for stronger commitments to cut those emissions. Some of the biggest polluters, including the United States, Brazil and India, say they see no need to change their current plans. Ms Schmidt, Chile's environment minister who is the conference's president, said early on Sunday: ""I request all the flexibility, all your strength to find this agreement to have an ambitious result."" She added: ""It's hard, it's difficult but it's worth it. I specially need you. But people in our countries need us."" Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Stalemate at climate talks as splits re-appear Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands On Saturday, a new draft text from the meeting was released, designed to chart a way forward for the parties to the Paris agreement, which came into being in 2015. The pact's intention is to keep the global average temperature rise to well below 2C. This was regarded at the time as the threshold for dangerous global warming, though scientists subsequently shifted the definition of the ""safe"" limit to a rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The situation was unprecedented since talks began in 1991, said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. He commented: ""The latest version of the Paris Agreement decision text put forward by the Chilean presidency is totally unacceptable. It has no call for countries to enhance the ambition of their emissions reduction commitments. ""If world leaders fail to increase ambition in the lead up to next year's climate summit in Glasgow, they will make the task of meeting the Paris agreement's 'well below 2C' temperature limitation goal - much less the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal - almost impossible.""

His view was echoed by David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute (WRI). ""If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day,"" he said. The conference in the Spanish capital has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures. Responding to the messages from science and from climate strikers, the countries running this 26th conference of the parties (COP) meeting are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Madrid climate talks will set the tone for Glasgow According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. But earlier in the meeting, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. Protests led by young delegates have seen up to 200 protestors ejected from the talks They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. At a ""stock-taking"" session on Saturday morning, Tina Stege, a negotiator with the Marshall Islands delegation, said: ""I need to go home and look my kids in the eye and tell them we came out with an outcome that will ensure their future."" She added: ""The text must address the need for new and more ambitious NDCs and long-term goals. We can't leave with anything else."" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, has been taking a hard line on promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015. The deal saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions. This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. Some visitors have other things to do at the COP But India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises. For many delegates, the deadlock is intensely frustrating in light of the urgent need to tackle emissions. ""I've been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we've seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action,"" said Alden Meyer. ""The planet is on fire and our window of escape is getting harder and harder to reach the longer we wait to act. Ministers here in Madrid must strengthen the final decision text, to respond to the mounting impacts of climate change that are devastating both communities and ecosystems all over the world."" Jake Schmidt, from the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ""In Madrid, the key polluting countries responsible for 80% of the world's climate-wrecking emissions stood mute, while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year. ""The mute majority must step up, and ramp up, their commitments to tackle the growing climate crisis well ahead of the COP26 gathering."" Also on Saturday, activists staged a protest outside the summit venue to express their frustration at what they see as the failure of world leaders in taking meaningful action on climate change.

"Ozil, a former Germany international, has been at Arsenal since 2013 Arsenal have distanced the club from midfielder Mesut Ozil's comments on the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. Rights groups say about a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial in high-security prison camps. China says they are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" to combat violent religious extremism. ""Arsenal is always apolitical as an organisation,"" the London club said. ""Following social media messages from Mesut Ozil on Friday, Arsenal Football Club must make it clear that these are Mesut's personal views."" The Gunners' statement was published on Chinese social media site Weibo. In his post Ozil, who is a Muslim, called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticised both China and the silence of Muslims in response. China has consistently denied mistreating Uighur Muslims in the country. Arsenal's statement received thousands of comments, many were critical or suggested it was not good enough. One commenter wrote ""that's it?"", while another responded with a picture of an Ozil shirt they had cut up. Some users also wrote posts with the hashtags ""#Protesting against Ozil"" and ""#Ozil made inappropriate comments about China"". In October, the US National Basketball Association suffered financial losses after an online comment from a team executive prompteda crisis in its relations with China. Houston Rockets' manager Daryl Morey had tweeted support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As a result Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are not the masters, we are the servants now"" Boris Johnson has thanked voters in the north of England for ""breaking the voting habits of generations"" to back the Conservatives. Speaking in Tony Blair's old seat of Sedgefield, the PM said he knew ""how difficult"" that decision can be. Mr Johnson won a Commons majority of 80, his party's biggest election win for 30 years, by sweeping aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. In contrast, Labour suffered its worst election result since the 1930s. Activists chanted ""Boris"" as Mr Johnson arrived in the County Durham constituency, which returned a Conservative MP on Thursday for the first time in 84 years. The prime minister said he wanted to thank voters in the ""incredible"" constituencies in north-east England for placing their trust in the Conservatives. They had ""changed the political landscape"" and ""changed the Conservative Party for the better"", he said. ""Everything that we do, everything that I do as your prime minister, will be devoted to repaying that trust,"" Mr Johnson added. ""We are the servants now and our job is to serve the people of this country and deliver on our priorities. And our priorities and their priorities are the same."" Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had done ""everything I could"" to get Labour into power but expected to stand down ""early next year"", after a successor has been chosen by the party. He said the general election had been ""taken over by Brexit"", the issue on which Mr Johnson campaigned most vociferously - but other figures in the party have disagreed over the reason. Shadow chancellor John McDonnellpromised to ""learn lessons and we'll listen to people""during the debate over the future of the party and its next leader. ""My fear is that we're in for the long haul now, possibly five years,"" he added. Latest updates after Tory election win What the Conservatives' win means for your money Corbyn: 'I did everything I could' Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? Labour's Helen Goodman, who lost the seat of Bishop Auckland to the Conservatives, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""the biggest factor"" in Labour's defeat ""was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader"". However, the Labour MP for York Central, Rachel Maskell, said: ""We've all got to take responsibility... I don't think apportioning blame to a complex situation in a simplistic way is really the way to approach this."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There is no such thing as Corbynism"" Mr Johnson is expected to announce a minor government re-shuffle as early as Monday. Asked whether his promise to be a one nation government meant bringing back Tory politicians like Penny Mordaunt and Jeremy Hunt - who left cabinet in July after Mr Johnson took over - the PM said he was ""not going to speculate about personalities"". MPs will then return to Westminster on Tuesday and begin the process of swearing in, before the Queen formally opens Parliament on Thursday with ""reduced ceremonial elements"". This video can not be played Phil Wilson had been the MP for Sedgefield since 2007 The prime minister has also vowed to reintroduce his Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament before Christmas, which could happen by the end of next week. It would see MPs begin the process of considering legislation that would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Talks about a future trade and security relationship will begin almost immediately. Former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, who opposes Brexit and backed the Liberal Democrats in the election, told Today: ""We've lost. Brexit is going to happen and we have to live with it."" Asked whether he would support any future campaign to rejoin the EU, he said it would be ""20 years or something before the issue is once again raised"". Protests took place at Westminster on Friday following Mr Johnson's election victory. This video can not be played Cheryl Tompsett: ""I've never been on a protest before"" Demonstrators in Westminster carried signs that read ""Defy Tory Rule"" and ""No to Boris Johnson"".

IN PICTURES:Binface, a baby and Boris Johnson Following the Conservatives' election win, Mr Johnson spoke to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon on Friday evening and reiterated his opposition to a second independence referendum in Scotland. The conversation came after the first minister said the PM had ""no right"" to stand in the way of a second vote following her party's ""overwhelming"" election performance. The SNP won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats. Speaking on Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, cabinet minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey insisted there would be no referendum on Scottish independence during the Conservatives' five-year term. After speaking to Ms Sturgeon, the PM also took phone calls from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to discuss the next steps on Brexit. The Conservatives won a total of 365 seats in the election, while Labour finished on 203, the SNP on 48, Liberal Democrats on 11 and the DUP on eight. Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and Northern Ireland's SDLP two. The Green Party and NI's Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. The Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England and picked up seats across Wales, while holding off the Lib Dem challenge in many seats in the south of England. Voter turnout overall, on a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%, which is down by 1.5% on the 2017 total. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are looking for a new leader after Jo Swinsonlost her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes. While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will be acting co-leaders for the party now that Ms Swinson is no longer an MP.

"The 2019 election is over, and the Conservatives have won a majority of 80 seats. Here, we answer a selection of readers' questions about the results. About32 million votes were cast in this election.The turnout was 67.3% of registered voters, which represents a 1.5% drop on the 2017 general election. The Conservatives won the most seats - 365 - and also the biggest share of votes, 45%, or about 13.9 million. Labour, who are in second place, have won 203 seats and a 32.2% share, or about 10.3 million votes. The UK's first-past-the-post voting system means the parties with the most votes may not win the most seats. That's because the candidate who gets the most votes in their local constituency wins a seat in the House of Commons. Coming a good second, for example, makes no difference to a party's success nationally. There have been attempts to move the UK to other electoral systems. They include the alternative vote - in which voters rank candidates by order of preference instead of just voting for one. This wasrejected by referendum in 2011. After the UK leaves the European Union (EU), European citizens living in the UK might be asked to prove their right to work or study here, or use the NHS. They'll need to do this by showing they have ""pre-settled status"" or ""settled status"" under the EU settlement scheme, or British citizenship. If you've lived in the UK for less than five years, you'll usually get pre-settled status. You must have started living in the UK by 31 December 2020 (or by the date the UK leaves the EU without a deal). You can ask to change this to settled status once you've got five years' ""continuous residence"". Both mean you can work in the UK, travel in and out of the country and access things like benefits if you're eligible for them. In October, the Home Office said that1.8 million people had applied to the scheme.Currently, EU nationals - and their families,external- are able to apply to the settlement scheme only if they are already living in the UK before it leaves the EU. A total of21 MPs were expelled from the Conservative Partyin early September after rebelling against the prime minister in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Shortly before the general election was agreed at the end of October,10 of them were readmitted. Six of these stepped down or retired. The other four stood in the election, and all retained their seats. Greg Clark was successful in Tunbridge Wells with a majority of 14,645; Stephen Hammond gained a majority of 628 to win in Wimbledon; Caroline Nokes had a majority of 10,872 as she was re-elected in Romsey and Southampton North; and Steve Brine retained Winchester by 985 votes. Of the 11 who were not readmitted, six stepped down, three stood as independents and two stood for the Lib Dems, but none of them won their seats. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says the timescale for an independent Scotland joining the EU would be ârelatively quick"". As things stand, Scotland is part of the UK, which is due to leave the EU on 31 January. Scotland can't prevent that happening, so it will have to leave, along with Wales, Northern Ireland and England. If Scotland were to hold a second independence referendum in the future - and it chose to leave the union - then the newly independent country could apply to join the EU. However, while it would not be given a place automatically, any application would be ""very seriously"" considered, according to former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy. He told the BBC that Brexit had altered European attitudesto Scottish independence. He said: ""I think there is a change, yes, because for a lot of people they are looking at what Scottish people are in favour of. They want to stay in the European Union and at the same time they are prevented to stay in the European Union."" Last month, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she believed it could be ""relatively quick"" for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU, although she knew there would be conditions to meet. After several elections where the polls as a whole were not a good guide to the election result, this time they got it right. The final figures in the BBC poll tracker were 43% for the Conservatives, 33% for Labour, 12% for the Lib Dems, 4% for the SNP and 3% each for the Greens and Brexit Party. The actual result across the UK was 44% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour, 12% for the Lib Dems, 4% for the SNP, 3% for the Greens and 2% for the Brexit Party. That's a very good performance - just a small underestimate of the Conservative share and a slight overestimate of the Labour and Brexit Party shares, with the other parties on the nose. Many of the polling companies had individual polls that were close to the result. But probably first prize goes jointly to Opinium and Ipsos Mori, whose final published polls were almost exactly correct. Furthermore, the polls were also consistently right to point to Conservative strength with Leave-supporting voters.

It repeats Mr Johnson's previous announcement that he would invest ""over Â£14bn in primary and secondary education between now and 2022-23"". However, this figure has been described as ""misleading"", given that it adds up several years of spending increases, and doesn't account for inflation, the change in how much costs increase over time. By 2022-23, spending on schools in England will be Â£7.1bn higher than 2019-20.  This largely reverses the 8% real-terms cuts in spending per pupil that have happened since 2010. The Conservative Party also pledged to create 250,000 extra childcare places in the holidays for primary-school-age children by 2023-24. Those places would cover about 5% of that age group. For those in further and higher education, the manifesto promises to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding. The detailed breakdown of how people voted won't be available until the British Election Study publishes the results of its face-to-face survey in a few months' time.

"With a substantial majority in Parliament, Boris Johnson can push ahead with his plans, confident that MPs will back them. So, what's in the prime minister's in-tray as he returns to work in Downing Street? The PM has a series of promises to keep. Firstly, to leave the EU on 31 January. He now has the majority in Parliament to push the necessary legislation through, so there's no reason to think that won't happen on schedule. But Mr Johnson then has to negotiatean ""ambitious"" trade agreement with the EUextremely quickly. Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The PM has to get it ratified before the end of the post-Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. This is the time between the UK leaving the EU with a deal and finally quitting it altogether under the terms of a new relationship. He has guaranteed that the transition period will not be extended - creating a potential crunch point, in just over a year's time. This will be far more difficult to achieve, especially if Mr Johnson wants to diverge from the EU rules and regulations that the UK currently follows. Finally, Mr Johnson has promised that after the transition period there will be no checks on goods moving within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The problem is that's exactly what his own withdrawal agreement creates. Anyone hoping to hear no more about Brexit after the end of January is likely to be disappointed. In their manifesto, the Conservatives - like all the main parties - promised extra funding for the NHS. Among other things, this would mean tens of thousands of extra nurses and about 50 million more GP surgery appointments a year. But many health leaders felt these pledges did not go nearly far enough to address a fundamental problem - demand for patient care is rising relentlessly, but NHS resources and staff levels just haven't kept up. Closing that gap will need time and money, but to actually bring down waiting lists and modernise services will require still more. Training enough new staff and getting them into clinical roles could take several years.  So there is a lot for the PM to face up to. Big decisions on funding and workforce planning will have to be made quickly to ensure adequate care is available in future years. Then there is the immediate challenge of the next few months and a potentially very difficult winter for the NHS, with increased pressures because of flu and other winter ailments. Finding a solution tothe crisis facing the care systemthat supports older and disabled people should be near the top of Boris Johnson's to-do list. He's promised cross-party talks within 100 days, but it is worth noting that it is more than 1,000 days since the Conservatives first promised to fix this overstretched, underfunded, yet vital system. This is after more than 20 years during which successive governments have failed to reform adult social care. The ""clear plan"" the prime minister promised in July has not materialised, but his guiding principle is that no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care. There will bean extra Â£1bn a year for the next five yearsto prop up the current system. However, it will be shared with equally stretched children's social care. Experts warn it won't be enough to tackle the pressures families face right now. Boris Johnson faces formidable environmental challenges - and needs to make quick decisions. Headache number one is climate change. In December 2020, the UK hosts a massively important global climate gathering in Glasgow -the UN COP26 meeting. Campaign group Friends of the Earth says the UK will be ""humiliated"",externalif it hosts the summit without setting out how it will meet its own carbon targets in advance. Climate change: Big lifestyle changes are the only answer The UK's advisory committee on climate change, made up of politicians, climate scientists and others, warns thattens of millions of homes must be insulated soon,external. Other experts say large-scale road and airport building,externalare not compatible with cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists say is the major cause of global heating. They say this is also the caseeven if cars are fully electric. And they recommend thatpeople should be helped to walk and cycle,external. The Conservative manifesto had comparatively little to say on these issues. The USA has said it won't have climate change even mentioned in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be very hard to please both. Last, but not least, is the state of nature. In October 2019, the Conservative governmentpublished a radical environment bill,setting firm targets for conservation - against the wish of the Treasury. The bill failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the election was called. Will it survive and be reintroduced into Parliament in the new term? There are three big questions hanging over the easy-to-repeat sloganof an ""Australian-style points-based system"".This ranks migrant workers according to their skills and abilities. First, can it really be introduced by the deadline the Conservatives have set of January 2021? The scale of the policy, legal aspects and staffing challenges ahead to make this happen are enormous - and government is a graveyard of failed IT projects. Secondly, can anyone be sure the final scheme will look like the one being promised? How significant is immigration to the UK? Nations the UK hopes to strike trade deals with may demand preferential access for their citizens. Specific sectors of the economy - such as social care - may be allowed to bring in as many workers as they can find to ease chronic staffing crises. Finally, what will be its impact on net migration? Boris Johnson says it will fall- but it's hard to see how he can deliver that. This is especially so as he's also promising no cap on skilled workers, or in other sectors, like hotels and construction. In other words - we simply don't know what the government will deliver, what the system's impact will be - and whether leaving the EU and implementing it will make a jot of difference to the overall numbers.

"Just three candidates remain in the race to become Labour's next leader, with party members due to start voting on 24 February. There is a big task ahead for the successor to Jeremy Corbyn, as they will need to bring the party back from its worst electoral defeat, in terms of House of Commons seats, since 1935. We'll find out who gets the top job on 4 April. But for now, here are the hopefuls: The 57-year-old shadow Brexit spokesman was the first to qualify for the members' ballot, doing so with the support of unions and affiliate groups. To qualify, candidates needed support from three such groups representing 5% of the membership, or 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). In total, he received nominations from 15 groups and 370 CLPs - more than any other candidate in both categories. He qualified for the first round of the contest with nominations from 88 MPs and MEPs, also more than his rivals. Among his notable backers are transport union the TSSA, and Unison, the UK's largest trade union. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: What you need to know about the new Labour leader A supporter of remaining in the EU, Sir Keir was director of public prosecutions before becoming MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. But critics have accused him of pushing Labour into its ""renegotiate then referendum"" Brexit position ahead of the 2019 election. Read a full profile of Sir Keir here The 40-year-old MP for Wigan became the second candidate to qualify for the members' ballot with nominations from four unions and affiliate groups. Among her backers are the GMB union, the National Union of Mineworkers and theJewish Labour Movement. She also secured support from 70 local Labour party branches. She was nominated by 31 Labour MPs and MEPs in the first round. Ms Nandy worked in the charitable sector before entering politics in 2010, and became one of a clutch of shadow ministers who resigned from Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench after the Brexit referendum. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: What you need to know about the Labour leadership candidate She has become known for her support of smaller towns, saying the party needed to appeal to voters outside big cities if it wanted to win at the next election. Ms Nandy declared her bid for leader ina letter to the Wigan Post,external, saying the loss to Boris Johnson's Conservatives had been ""a long time coming"" and she had a ""deeper understanding of what has gone awry"" than her rivals. Read a full profile of Ms Nandy here The 40-year-old shadow business secretary was the last of the remaining three candidates to secure her place on the members' ballot. She garnered support from seven affiliates and unions, as well as 160 constituency Labour parties. During the initial stage of the contest, she received the second highest number of nominations from her colleagues, with the backing of 33 MPs and MEPs. As well as backing from the Communication Workers Union, she is being supported by trade union Unite, Labour's biggest donor at the 2019 election. This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey: What you need to know about the Labour leadership candidate One of a new generation of MPs on the left of the party, she formed part of Mr Corbyn's inner circle and represented Labour in an election TV debate. She is widely regarded as the preferred candidate of Mr Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. But critics of the current leadership have accused her of representing ""continuity Corbyn"". Read a full profile of Mrs Long-Bailey here Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry was eliminated from the race in mid-February after failing to secure enough nominations from groups or local branches. She had managed to receive support from 31 CLPs - just two short of the required 33. Jess Phillips pulled out of the race in January Birmingham Yardley MP and outspoken Corbyn critic of Jess Phillipswithdrew from the race in January, having failed to secure any union, affiliate or constituency endorsements. Earlier in the contest, shadow Treasury secretary Clive Lewis withdrew from the race less than an hour before nominations closed, with only five MPs backing him. The post has been vacant since the election, when former Labour MP Tom Watson said he was stepping down, both from the role and as an MP. This means it is now up for grabs, with the winner chosen in a separate contest. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP Ian Murray and Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan are in the running. All five contenders have made the final ballot, after first getting the required support from MPs and MEPs and then the backing of the required number of local branches or union and affiliate groups. Ms Rayner - who was a care worker and Unison official before becoming an MP - received the endorsement of her flatmate and friend Mrs Long-Bailey. She has also received backing from seven unions and affiliate groups including Unison, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) and GMB. Mr Burgon - a supporter of Mr Corbyn who has pledged to continue the current leader's policy agenda - has the backing of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and Unite. Ms Butler has only one affiliate nomination - Chinese for Labour - but she has met the threshold by gaining the backing of at least 33 local branches. Mr Murray also has one affiliate nomination - Labour Movement for Europe - and he made the final ballot by gaining support from the required number of local branches. Dr Allin-Khan has gained the required support from local branches. Candidates for leader and deputy leader have to be MPs, and they required nominations from 10% of Labour MPs and MEPs to get onto the ballot. In a new rule, candidates also need nominations from 5% of Labour's constituency parties. Alternatively, they need nominations from three affiliated bodies, two of which must be trades unions, adding up to 5% of affiliated members. Does Labour need a new direction after Corbyn? Members of the Labour Party, affiliated trades unions (if they opt in), and socialist societies such as the Fabians, all get one vote each. Those who joined the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote. Registered supporters - who are not full party members - had 48 hours from 14-16 January to secure a vote by paying Â£25. They are cast on a one-member, one-vote basis. Voters fill in a preferential ballot, meaning they rank the candidates in order of preference. If any candidate gets more than half the first preference votes, they win. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their second preference votes are redistributed. If that results in any candidate with more than half the votes, they win. If not, the remaining candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes redistributed, until the contest produces a winner. Labour'sNational Executive Committee,externalhas 39 members, representing the trades unions, the shadow cabinet, Labour's elected representatives at local, national and European level, and constituency parties. Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and the grassroots campaign group Momentum are strongly represented on the NEC, and they are likely to use their influence to promote a left-wing candidate in the coming election.

"Videos about the NHS were the most viral posts on social media during the 2019 general election campaign. Four of the most viewed and shared videos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were about concerns regarding funding and staff levels in the NHS. Political parties, particularly Labour and the Conservatives, focused their digital campaigns on the production of controversial and humorous videos, using elements of pop culture in order to rack up shares. We checked video views and shares on Facebook and Instagram using CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool that tracks and records public data from Facebook, Instagram and Reddit. We also used Khoros to track data from Twitter. We looked at videos posted between 29 October - the day the election was called - and 11 December, the last day of campaigning. We've only tracked the number of views up until the 11th. Here are some of the most viewed and shared videos of the campaign. The Joe website, which hasa history of producing viral political videos, approached members of the public on the streets of London with questions about the average cost of calling an ambulance, buying an inhaler or giving birth in the US. Its video captured the shock on people's faces when they were told the actual costs. It was immediately picked up and shared by US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who both want to see an overhaul of the US healthcare system into asingle-payer system known as Medicare for All.

"This video can not be played ""We are going to unite and level up"" - Boris Johnson speaks outside Downing Street Boris Johnson has told Nicola Sturgeon that he remains opposed to a second independence referendum, despite the SNP's general election success. The PM spoke to the first minister by phone on Friday evening, with Downing Street saying he had ""reiterated his unwavering commitment"" to the union. Mr Johnson insisted the result of the 2014 referendum ""should be respected"". However, Ms Sturgeon made clear it was not ""credible"" to deny Scotland the right to choose its future. She indicated during the phone call that she would be publishing a paper next week putting the case for a second independence referendum. The two leaders have agreed to have a more detailed discussion in the near future over issues raised by an election result which saw the Conservatives take power at Westminster with an 80 seat majority and the SNP winning 48 of Scotland's 59 constituencies. The nationalists won a landslide north of the border taking 13 more seats than in the last election in 2017 and seeing its share of the vote increase by 8.1 percentage points, to 45%.

""The prime minister made clear how he remained opposed to a second independence referendum, standing with the majority of people in Scotland who do not want to return to division and uncertainty. ""He added how the result of the 2014 referendum was decisive and should be respected.""

She added that Ms Sturgeon had ""made clear that it was not credible for the [prime minister] to deny Scotland the right to choose its future"".

She told Mr Johnson: ""You, as the leader of a defeated party in Scotland, have no right to stand in the way. The people of Scotland have spoken. It is time now to decide our own future."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would be publishing a ""detailed, democratic case"" for letting Holyrood decide on whether there should be a second independence referendum. She is expected to ask the UK government to transfer the legal powers to hold a referendum to the Scottish Parliament through what is known as a ""Section 30 order"" - as happened in 2014.

"Talks in Madrid have gone into extra time as delegates try to agree on measures The Chilean official leading UN climate talks in Madrid has called on delegates to show flexibility, as they struggle to reach agreement on crucial measures needed to tackle climate change. The negotiations, which were scheduled to end on Friday, continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning. Carolina Schmidt said a deal was almost there but the outcome needed to be ambitious. The goal is a commitment to new carbon emissions cuts by the end of 2020. The European Union and small island states vulnerable to climate change are pushing for stronger commitments to cut those emissions. Some of the biggest polluters, including the United States, Brazil and India, say they see no need to change their current plans. Ms Schmidt, Chile's environment minister who is the conference's president, said early on Sunday: ""I request all the flexibility, all your strength to find this agreement to have an ambitious result."" She added: ""It's hard, it's difficult but it's worth it. I specially need you. But people in our countries need us."" Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Stalemate at climate talks as splits re-appear Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands On Saturday, a new draft text from the meeting was released, designed to chart a way forward for the parties to the Paris agreement, which came into being in 2015. The pact's intention is to keep the global average temperature rise to well below 2C. This was regarded at the time as the threshold for dangerous global warming, though scientists subsequently shifted the definition of the ""safe"" limit to a rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The situation was unprecedented since talks began in 1991, said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. He commented: ""The latest version of the Paris Agreement decision text put forward by the Chilean presidency is totally unacceptable. It has no call for countries to enhance the ambition of their emissions reduction commitments. ""If world leaders fail to increase ambition in the lead up to next year's climate summit in Glasgow, they will make the task of meeting the Paris agreement's 'well below 2C' temperature limitation goal - much less the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal - almost impossible.""

His view was echoed by David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute (WRI). ""If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day,"" he said. The conference in the Spanish capital has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures. Responding to the messages from science and from climate strikers, the countries running this 26th conference of the parties (COP) meeting are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Madrid climate talks will set the tone for Glasgow According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. But earlier in the meeting, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. Protests led by young delegates have seen up to 200 protestors ejected from the talks They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. At a ""stock-taking"" session on Saturday morning, Tina Stege, a negotiator with the Marshall Islands delegation, said: ""I need to go home and look my kids in the eye and tell them we came out with an outcome that will ensure their future."" She added: ""The text must address the need for new and more ambitious NDCs and long-term goals. We can't leave with anything else."" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, has been taking a hard line on promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015. The deal saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions. This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. Some visitors have other things to do at the COP But India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises. For many delegates, the deadlock is intensely frustrating in light of the urgent need to tackle emissions. ""I've been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we've seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action,"" said Alden Meyer. ""The planet is on fire and our window of escape is getting harder and harder to reach the longer we wait to act. Ministers here in Madrid must strengthen the final decision text, to respond to the mounting impacts of climate change that are devastating both communities and ecosystems all over the world."" Jake Schmidt, from the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ""In Madrid, the key polluting countries responsible for 80% of the world's climate-wrecking emissions stood mute, while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year. ""The mute majority must step up, and ramp up, their commitments to tackle the growing climate crisis well ahead of the COP26 gathering."" Also on Saturday, activists staged a protest outside the summit venue to express their frustration at what they see as the failure of world leaders in taking meaningful action on climate change.

"Ozil, a former Germany international, has been at Arsenal since 2013 Arsenal have distanced the club from midfielder Mesut Ozil's comments on the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. Rights groups say about a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial in high-security prison camps. China says they are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" to combat violent religious extremism. ""Arsenal is always apolitical as an organisation,"" the London club said. ""Following social media messages from Mesut Ozil on Friday, Arsenal Football Club must make it clear that these are Mesut's personal views."" The Gunners' statement was published on Chinese social media site Weibo. In his post Ozil, who is a Muslim, called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticised both China and the silence of Muslims in response. China has consistently denied mistreating Uighur Muslims in the country. Arsenal's statement received thousands of comments, many were critical or suggested it was not good enough. One commenter wrote ""that's it?"", while another responded with a picture of an Ozil shirt they had cut up. Some users also wrote posts with the hashtags ""#Protesting against Ozil"" and ""#Ozil made inappropriate comments about China"". In October, the US National Basketball Association suffered financial losses after an online comment from a team executive prompteda crisis in its relations with China. Houston Rockets' manager Daryl Morey had tweeted support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As a result Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals.

"Scroll to take a guided tour of the UK's results to find out how Boris Johnson gained the largest Conservative majority since the 1980s, while Labour took its lowest number of seats since 1935. (1/10)The Conservatives won 365 seats, giving Boris Johnson a majority of 80. Their 44% share of the vote was the highest since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. So how did this happen? (2/10)Right at the beginning of the night it was clear something unusual had happened. The third seat to declare,Blyth Valley, had been Labour for nearly 70 years and was predicted to stay that way. Labour lost here by 712 votes. (3/10)This story was repeated again and again, as Labour's ""Red Wall"" in the North crumbled. Labour's vote share reduced by 13% in the North East and 10% in Yorkshire & Humber. Many of these seats voted strongly to leave the EU. (4/10)Many northern Conservative wins were due more to a reduced Labour vote than a large boost for the Tories. However, inWakefield, which had been Labour since 1932, the Tories won a majority of over 3,000. (5/10)By around 02:00 GMT the Conservatives started to win seats in Wales, taking six from Labour in total. Plaid Cymru held on to their four seats, but a Remain pact with the Greens and Liberal Democrats failed to create a breakthrough. (6/10)The Liberal Democrats had hoped to win back seats in the South West that they lost to the Tories in 2015. Despite increasing their share of the vote by 3%, the Lib Dems failed to win any new seats here. (7/10)Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, narrowly lost her seat ofEast Dunbartonshirein Scotland to the Scottish National Party, who had a good night. (8/10)The SNP won 14 seats overall, from the Liberal Democrats, Tories and Labour. They now have 48 seats, up 13 from 2017 and only slightly down from their 2015 landslide. (9/10)In Northern Ireland the DUP, who had backed the Conservatives since 2017, lost two of their seats, including their Westminster leader Nigel Dodds. The SDLP picked up two and the Alliance Party won one. (10/10)Across the UK Labour suffered 60 losses. Their only gain was Putney in London, but Kensington, which they'd won in 2017, went back to the Conservatives. Despite breaking even in London, a largely Remain voting area, Labour's vote share still declined by 6%.

"With a substantial majority in Parliament, Boris Johnson can push ahead with his plans, confident that MPs will back them. So, what's in the prime minister's in-tray as he returns to work in Downing Street? The PM has a series of promises to keep. Firstly, to leave the EU on 31 January. He now has the majority in Parliament to push the necessary legislation through, so there's no reason to think that won't happen on schedule. But Mr Johnson then has to negotiatean ""ambitious"" trade agreement with the EUextremely quickly. Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The PM has to get it ratified before the end of the post-Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. This is the time between the UK leaving the EU with a deal and finally quitting it altogether under the terms of a new relationship. He has guaranteed that the transition period will not be extended - creating a potential crunch point, in just over a year's time. This will be far more difficult to achieve, especially if Mr Johnson wants to diverge from the EU rules and regulations that the UK currently follows. Finally, Mr Johnson has promised that after the transition period there will be no checks on goods moving within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The problem is that's exactly what his own withdrawal agreement creates. Anyone hoping to hear no more about Brexit after the end of January is likely to be disappointed. In their manifesto, the Conservatives - like all the main parties - promised extra funding for the NHS. Among other things, this would mean tens of thousands of extra nurses and about 50 million more GP surgery appointments a year. But many health leaders felt these pledges did not go nearly far enough to address a fundamental problem - demand for patient care is rising relentlessly, but NHS resources and staff levels just haven't kept up. Closing that gap will need time and money, but to actually bring down waiting lists and modernise services will require still more. Training enough new staff and getting them into clinical roles could take several years.  So there is a lot for the PM to face up to. Big decisions on funding and workforce planning will have to be made quickly to ensure adequate care is available in future years. Then there is the immediate challenge of the next few months and a potentially very difficult winter for the NHS, with increased pressures because of flu and other winter ailments. Finding a solution tothe crisis facing the care systemthat supports older and disabled people should be near the top of Boris Johnson's to-do list. He's promised cross-party talks within 100 days, but it is worth noting that it is more than 1,000 days since the Conservatives first promised to fix this overstretched, underfunded, yet vital system. This is after more than 20 years during which successive governments have failed to reform adult social care. The ""clear plan"" the prime minister promised in July has not materialised, but his guiding principle is that no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care. There will bean extra Â£1bn a year for the next five yearsto prop up the current system. However, it will be shared with equally stretched children's social care. Experts warn it won't be enough to tackle the pressures families face right now. Boris Johnson faces formidable environmental challenges - and needs to make quick decisions. Headache number one is climate change. In December 2020, the UK hosts a massively important global climate gathering in Glasgow -the UN COP26 meeting. Campaign group Friends of the Earth says the UK will be ""humiliated"",externalif it hosts the summit without setting out how it will meet its own carbon targets in advance. Climate change: Big lifestyle changes are the only answer The UK's advisory committee on climate change, made up of politicians, climate scientists and others, warns thattens of millions of homes must be insulated soon,external. Other experts say large-scale road and airport building,externalare not compatible with cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists say is the major cause of global heating. They say this is also the caseeven if cars are fully electric. And they recommend thatpeople should be helped to walk and cycle,external. The Conservative manifesto had comparatively little to say on these issues. The USA has said it won't have climate change even mentioned in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be very hard to please both. Last, but not least, is the state of nature. In October 2019, the Conservative governmentpublished a radical environment bill,setting firm targets for conservation - against the wish of the Treasury. The bill failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the election was called. Will it survive and be reintroduced into Parliament in the new term? There are three big questions hanging over the easy-to-repeat sloganof an ""Australian-style points-based system"".This ranks migrant workers according to their skills and abilities. First, can it really be introduced by the deadline the Conservatives have set of January 2021? The scale of the policy, legal aspects and staffing challenges ahead to make this happen are enormous - and government is a graveyard of failed IT projects. Secondly, can anyone be sure the final scheme will look like the one being promised? How significant is immigration to the UK? Nations the UK hopes to strike trade deals with may demand preferential access for their citizens. Specific sectors of the economy - such as social care - may be allowed to bring in as many workers as they can find to ease chronic staffing crises. Finally, what will be its impact on net migration? Boris Johnson says it will fall- but it's hard to see how he can deliver that. This is especially so as he's also promising no cap on skilled workers, or in other sectors, like hotels and construction. In other words - we simply don't know what the government will deliver, what the system's impact will be - and whether leaving the EU and implementing it will make a jot of difference to the overall numbers.

"Rail passengers are being urged to check their train times before they travel from Sunday as a new winter timetable comes into effect. The plan is that journey times will be cut, services increased and new routes added across the country, after infrastructure and carriage investment. Train timetables are changed twice a year, in May and December. When train timetables were changed in May last year, chaos ensued, with massive delays and overcrowding. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the new timetable change would mean 1,000 extra weekly services, on top of 4,000 introduced over the past two years. The launch of the May 2018 timetables saw services crippled in parts of the North and the South East, with blame attributed to Network Rail, train operators and the government. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""This time around, passengers need the rail industry to deliver a smooth set of timetable improvements - so they can reliably use both new and existing services. ""Many passengers should have a greater choice of services with more seats as result of these changes. However, there will also be some who lose out, with fewer or slower services."" Guy Dangerfield, Transport Focus head of strategy, said: ""There are lots of timetable improvements which should bring great benefits to passengers in terms of capacity and journey time improvements. ""Clearly, when you change anything, there's a degree of risk, but there isn't the sort of late chopping and changing of the plans which led to the problems in May 2018."" The RDG sought to reassure passengers over the upcoming timetable, stating that the industry had put ""years of work into drafting, consulting and planning for these changes"". Robert Nisbet, the organisation's director of nations and regions, urged passengers to check their journey details in advance, as many train times are changing. He said: ""Train operators and Network Rail will be working together to run a reliable service and respond quickly to any teething problems as people get used to the change."" Sunday will see the biggest timetable change on the Great Western Railway network since the 1970s, taking advantage of Network Rail's electrification of the line between London and Bristol, and the operator's new intercity express trains. Non-stop trains between London Paddington and Bristol Parkway will have journey times as short as one hour and eight minutes, shaving 12 minutes off the existing quickest services. Fastest journey times between the capital and Bristol Temple Meads - near the centre of the city - will be cut by 17 minutes to one hour and 19 minutes. The frequency of trains on this route will be increased from two an hour to three during the morning and evening peaks. There will be major improvements on the ScotRail network, with additional services in north-east Scotland and extra seats between Edinburgh and Glasgow. A new station, Robroyston, will open in north-east Glasgow on the line between Queen Street and Cumbernauld. Other operators introducing new services are Greater Anglia, London North Eastern Railway, Northern, TfL Rail, Thameslink, Transpennine Express (TPE), Transport for Wales, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway. The Maesteg and Conwy Valley lines in Wales will see Sunday services for the first time. TPE admitted last week that the frequency of its new direct Liverpool-Edinburgh trains will initially be lower than the planned hourly service. The firm blamed a maintenance backlog and infrastructure problems for delaying crew training, as well as the late delivery of new trains.

"Nicola Sturgeon joined the SNPâs newly-elected MPs for a group photo outside the V&A Museum Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the SNP's new raft of MPs in Dundee following their ""watershed"" general election win. The partywon 48 of Scotland's 59 constituencies in Thursday's poll. Ms Sturgeon was joined by a large number of her new Westminster contingent for a photo call at the city's V&A museum. She said the result showed that the majority of people in Scotland ""want a very different future"" to the rest of the UK. In a phone call on Friday, the first minister told Boris Johnson she would publish a paper next week outlining the case for another vote on Scottish independence. The prime minister said he was opposed to a referendum, despite the SNP's general election success.

They had sent a clear signal that they wanted the future of Scotland to be ""in the hands of people who live here"", she added. ""The Tories - although they will rage against that reality, no doubt, for as long as they can - have to accept and understand it,"" she said. ""They were rejected in Scotland. They put the issue of opposition to an independence referendum... on the ballot paper and they lost vote share, they lost more than 50% of their seats - it was a catastrophic defeat for the Tories on that single issue.""

"Money may go further for those on Christmas holidays overseas this year As the country contemplates the election results, people's thoughts will turn to the potential effect on their finances. Money matters are often to the fore at this, expensive, time of year. The December election is likely to mean some changes to the pound in your pocket before the winter is out, with other changes more long-term. Here are some of the key issues, based on the Conservative Party's manifesto, its plans before the campaign and its promises during it. Those who are heading abroad for Christmas will see their holiday money go a little further. Thevalue of the pound improvedagainst the US dollar and the euro when the Conservative victory became clear, and this will now have fed through to the rates at bureaux de change. However, travelling overseas at this time of year can be very expensive, so this will only bring a little relief. Exchange rates: Why has the value of the pound jumped? Election results 2019: Analysis in maps and charts The big set-piece financial event of the year had been planned for November, but was postponed as the prime minister pushed for an election. During the campaign, Boris Johnson promised a Budget within 100 days of the polling day if the Conservatives were elected. This is likely to mean a Budget in February or March, setting any changes to taxes, benefits and allowances in time for the start of the new financial year in April. Mr Johnson promised that a tax break for workers, through a change to National Insurance, would be confirmed in that first Budget. The current threshold sees workers paying National Insurance contributions once they earn Â£8,628 a year. The Conservatives said this would rise to Â£9,500. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculated this would be worth about Â£85 a year for all those with earnings above Â£9,500 a year. This Budget - and any subsequent ones during this five-year Parliament - will see no income tax or VAT rises (nor any National Insurance rises), according to a promise in the Conservative Party's manifesto. However, this was described as ""ill-advised"" by the IFS owing to the potential lack of room for financial manoeuvre it creates. SCROLL AND SEE:The results that sealed it,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points LAURA KUENSSBERG:Same PM, new map BREXIT:What happens now? WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external The Budget is likely to confirm the biggest increase in the state pension since 2012, with pensioners expected to receive a 3.9% boost. The full, new state pension is expected to go up from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is likely to go up from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up. The rise is the result of the triple-lock system, which means that the state pension rises in line with inflation, earnings or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. The Conservatives have pledged to keep this in place, as it has with the winter fuel payment and free bus passes for older people. A Pensions Bill is, to use one of Mr Johnson's phrases, oven-ready. It had been prepared before the election was called and includes new protection for those with workplace pensions, and reforms to allow a new type of shared-risk pension scheme to be made available. There is also a longer-term promise in the manifesto to look at a pension ""loophole"" that has seen workers, disproportionately women, who earn between Â£10,000 and Â£12,500 missing out on pension benefits. Despite a number of pension changes in the offing, it is hard to see how they will include any compensation for women born in the 1950s who believe they unfairly missed out on the state pension. Women's state pension protestors outside court There have been no promises made to the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality), although they will continue to put pressure on the government to address the issue. The separate Backto60 group, which campaigns on the same issue, recently losta high-profile court case. At the Conservative Party conference in September, Chancellor Sajid Javid pledged to raise the National Living Wage to Â£10.50 an hour within the next five years. The current rate for over 25s is Â£8.21. The age at which workers qualify for the National Living Wage - the highest level of minimum wage - is set to drop from 25 to 21 within five years. Commentators have suggested that there is pent-up demand in the UK housing market - particularly in London. Buyers and sellers have been put off making such a big financial commitment owing to political and economic uncertainty. Now the first of those is off the table, to a degree, given the size of the Conservative majority, there may be more transactions. More demand could push up prices - which is good for sellers, but bad for first-time buyers. However, one commentator says it may be a short-term phenomenon. ""We suggest only modest price growth in 2020 on the basis that, despite domestic political uncertainty receding, some economic uncertainty will remain until a trade deal is agreed with the EU,"" says Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills. ""This could mean a bounce in demand in the first part of 2020 proves difficult to sustain through the summer months and into the autumn market."" There is a promise in the manifesto to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding, led by Philip Augar. In the short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their current level of Â£9,250 will continue. Universal Credit has been one of the most controversial benefit reforms of a generation. A Conservative victory means the roll-out across the country will now continue. Universal Credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits including Income Support and Housing Benefit and merging them into one payment. The Department for Work and Pensions announced in November that working-age benefits such as Universal Credit and Jobseeker's Allowance would rise by 1.7% from April. It ends former chancellor George Osborne's decision to introduce a freeze which, according to the IFS, has cut an average of Â£560 per year from the income of the country's poorest seven million families since 2016. The Conservative manifesto promised free parking at hospitals for people with disabilities, those who attend outpatient departments frequently, parents of sick children staying overnight and staff working night shifts. It also promises to pave the way for longer-term mortgages, more similar to a US system, although there will be some regulatory and practical hurdles to clear before that becomes reality. There are questions too over whether there would be demand for such products among people who may wish to move more frequently. Mr Johnson also spoke a during the campaign, and prior to it, of a plan to abolish the 5% VAT rate on sanitary products once the UK has left the EU, which he called the ""tampon tax"".

"Gerald Cotten was the only person who had passwords to QuadrigaCX digital wallets Lawyers representing users of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX are asking Canadian authorities to exhume the body of its founder. They say they want an exhumation given ""questionable circumstances"" surrounding his death. Gerald Cotten died suddenly last year in India from complications related to Crohn's disease. Following his death, the exchange was unable to locate or secure significant cryptocurrency reserves. When he died, the 30-year-old founder was the only person who had passwords to digital wallets containing C$180 million ($137m; Â£105m) in cryptocurrencies. His untimely death forced the closure of QuadrigaCX, which had some 115,000 users at the time. Online rumours have circulated since, speculating that Cotten faked his own death and sought to abscond with the funds, though no evidence of such a scheme has been revealed in the year since he died. The cryptocurrency company that lost $135m Bitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work? On Friday, the legal team representing users of the platform in the bankruptcy proceedings sent a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an exhumation and post-mortem autopsy be performed on Cotten's body ""to confirm both its identity and the cause of death"". They say information revealed during the proceedings ""further highlight the need for certainty around the question of whether Mr Cotten is in fact deceased"". Earlier this year, a report by auditor Ernst & Young found significant problems in how the exchange was managed, including finding that Cotten created certain accounts on the Quadriga platform under aliases that may have been used to trade on the exchange. It was also found that substantial funds were transferred to Cotten personally and to other related parties. The auditor managed to retrieve approximately C$33m in missing funds. It confirmed in August it was aware of ""at least four independent active law enforcement or regulatory reviews in progress"" related to the platform's demise, which includes the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. In a statement sent through her lawyer on Friday, Cotten's widow said she ""is heartbroken to learn of this request"". Jennifer Robertson said her late husband's death ""should not be in doubt"", adding it is unclear how its confirmation ""would assist the asset recovery process further"".

They say information revealed during the proceedings ""further highlight the need for certainty around the question of whether Mr Cotten is in fact deceased"". Earlier this year, a report by auditor Ernst & Young found significant problems in how the exchange was managed, including finding that Cotten created certain accounts on the Quadriga platform under aliases that may have been used to trade on the exchange. It was also found that substantial funds were transferred to Cotten personally and to other related parties. The auditor managed to retrieve approximately C$33m in missing funds. It confirmed in August it was aware of ""at least four independent active law enforcement or regulatory reviews in progress"" related to the platform's demise, which includes the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. In a statement sent through her lawyer on Friday, Cotten's widow said she ""is heartbroken to learn of this request"". Jennifer Robertson said her late husband's death ""should not be in doubt"", adding it is unclear how its confirmation ""would assist the asset recovery process further"".

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There is no such thing as Corbynism"" Jeremy Corbyn says he did ""everything he could"" to get Labour into power and will not ""walk away"" until another leader is elected. The Labour leader said the election, which saw the Conservatives sweep aside his party in its traditional heartlands, was ""taken over by Brexit"". Mr Corbyn said he was ""obviously very sad"" but also had ""pride"" in themanifestohis party put forward. Some people within Labour have blamed Mr Corbyn's leadership for the defeat. Former Labour MP John Mann said the leader's unpopularity on the doorstep was palpable and Mr Corbyn should have ""gone already"" after presiding over his party's worst election performance since the 1930s. Lord Blunkett, a former Labour cabinet minister, called for the party leadership to apologise for the defeat, adding that they were ""lacking in any contrite belief that they made a mistake"". At 33%, Labour's share of the vote was down around eight points on the 2017 general election and is lower than that achieved by Neil Kinnock in 1992. LIVE: Updates and reaction as Tories win majority,external Let the healing begin, urges PM after poll win Does Labour need a new direction after Corbyn? Mr Corbyn said it was up to the National Executive, the ruling body of the party, to decide when he would go, adding it was likely a new leader would be selected in the early part of next year. He said he would not step down as leader yet because the ""responsible thing to do is not to walk away from the whole thing"". Asked whether he was part of the problem, he said: ""I've done everything I could to lead this partyâ¦ and since I became leader the membership has more than doubled and the party has developed a very serious, radical yes, but serious and fully-costed manifesto"". Keir Starmer, one of the favourites to be the new leader, says it's ""a big task"" to rebuild Labour Keir Starmer, one of the favourites to replace Mr Corbyn as leader, said there was ""no hiding"" from the election result which was ""devastating for our party"". He said it was the party's duty to ""rebuild"" which was going to be ""a very big task"". Asked if he wanted to be the next leader, he said: ""I think this is the time for reflecting and understanding the result. I don't underestimate the size of the task ahead."" Unite union boss Len McCluskey, an influential Labour ally, said the result was ""deeply, deeply disappointing"" and the party had ""failed"" because it had tried ""to go beyond Brexit"". In an article for theHuffington Post,external, he blamed Labour's poor election performance on Jeremy Corbyn's ""failure to apologise for anti-Semitism"" and an ""incontinent rush of policies which appeared to offer everything to everyone immediately"". He did praise Mr Corbyn's ""right and honourable"" decision to adopt a neutral stance in a future Brexit referendum, but said the strategy was ""fatally undermined from the outset by leading members of the shadow cabinet rushing to the TV cameras to pledge that they would support Remain"".

Speaking on BBC's Question Time, he said the party's loosening ties to its working class heartlands had been ""turbo charged by Brexit"". Shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner said his party needed to reflect on ""what was wrong in the offer that we put forward to the country and what it was people did not feel confident about in our manifesto"".

Some traditional Labour constituencies, such as Darlington, Sedgefield and Workington, in the north of England, have a Conservative MP for the first time in decades - or in the case of Bishop Auckland and Blyth Valley - for the first time since the seat was created. Mr Corbyn was re-elected with a reduced majority of 26,188 as the MP for Islington North. A brutal leadership battle is almost inevitable. The likely candidates are keeping their powder dry, but skirmishes have begun over the reasons for Labour's lowest tally of seats since the 1930s. Those close to Jeremy Corbyn blamed Brexit, media hostilityâ¦ even the weather. The party chairman Ian Lavery singled out the party's commitment to a second referendum. And Laura Parker from the left-wing grassroots group, Momentum, insisted Jeremy Corbyn was the victim of unfortunate political timing. Read more analysis from the BBC's political correspondent. Reflecting on his party's defeat, My Corbyn said: ""My whole strategy was to reach out beyond the Brexit divide to try and bring people together because ultimately the country has to come together."" The party promised to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, and put it to a referendum vote alongside the option of remaining in the EU. Asked what went wrong for the party, he said: ""Those in Leave areas, in some numbers, voted for Brexit or Conservative candidates which meant that we lost a number of seats and we didn't make the gains that I'd hoped we could have done"". Asked whether ""Corbynism"" is now dead, he said: ""There is no such thing as Corbyninsmâ¦ there is socialism."" He added: ""I don't think [socialist ideas] are unelectable."" Mr Corbyn said his party's policies were individually ""very popular"" and there was no ""huge debate"" about them within the party.

"Scroll to take a guided tour of the UK's results to find out how Boris Johnson gained the largest Conservative majority since the 1980s, while Labour took its lowest number of seats since 1935. (1/10)The Conservatives won 365 seats, giving Boris Johnson a majority of 80. Their 44% share of the vote was the highest since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. So how did this happen? (2/10)Right at the beginning of the night it was clear something unusual had happened. The third seat to declare,Blyth Valley, had been Labour for nearly 70 years and was predicted to stay that way. Labour lost here by 712 votes. (3/10)This story was repeated again and again, as Labour's ""Red Wall"" in the North crumbled. Labour's vote share reduced by 13% in the North East and 10% in Yorkshire & Humber. Many of these seats voted strongly to leave the EU. (4/10)Many northern Conservative wins were due more to a reduced Labour vote than a large boost for the Tories. However, inWakefield, which had been Labour since 1932, the Tories won a majority of over 3,000. (5/10)By around 02:00 GMT the Conservatives started to win seats in Wales, taking six from Labour in total. Plaid Cymru held on to their four seats, but a Remain pact with the Greens and Liberal Democrats failed to create a breakthrough. (6/10)The Liberal Democrats had hoped to win back seats in the South West that they lost to the Tories in 2015. Despite increasing their share of the vote by 3%, the Lib Dems failed to win any new seats here. (7/10)Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, narrowly lost her seat ofEast Dunbartonshirein Scotland to the Scottish National Party, who had a good night. (8/10)The SNP won 14 seats overall, from the Liberal Democrats, Tories and Labour. They now have 48 seats, up 13 from 2017 and only slightly down from their 2015 landslide. (9/10)In Northern Ireland the DUP, who had backed the Conservatives since 2017, lost two of their seats, including their Westminster leader Nigel Dodds. The SDLP picked up two and the Alliance Party won one. (10/10)Across the UK Labour suffered 60 losses. Their only gain was Putney in London, but Kensington, which they'd won in 2017, went back to the Conservatives. Despite breaking even in London, a largely Remain voting area, Labour's vote share still declined by 6%.

"Just three candidates remain in the race to become Labour's next leader, with party members due to start voting on 24 February. There is a big task ahead for the successor to Jeremy Corbyn, as they will need to bring the party back from its worst electoral defeat, in terms of House of Commons seats, since 1935. We'll find out who gets the top job on 4 April. But for now, here are the hopefuls: The 57-year-old shadow Brexit spokesman was the first to qualify for the members' ballot, doing so with the support of unions and affiliate groups. To qualify, candidates needed support from three such groups representing 5% of the membership, or 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). In total, he received nominations from 15 groups and 370 CLPs - more than any other candidate in both categories. He qualified for the first round of the contest with nominations from 88 MPs and MEPs, also more than his rivals. Among his notable backers are transport union the TSSA, and Unison, the UK's largest trade union. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: What you need to know about the new Labour leader A supporter of remaining in the EU, Sir Keir was director of public prosecutions before becoming MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. But critics have accused him of pushing Labour into its ""renegotiate then referendum"" Brexit position ahead of the 2019 election. Read a full profile of Sir Keir here The 40-year-old MP for Wigan became the second candidate to qualify for the members' ballot with nominations from four unions and affiliate groups. Among her backers are the GMB union, the National Union of Mineworkers and theJewish Labour Movement. She also secured support from 70 local Labour party branches. She was nominated by 31 Labour MPs and MEPs in the first round. Ms Nandy worked in the charitable sector before entering politics in 2010, and became one of a clutch of shadow ministers who resigned from Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench after the Brexit referendum. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: What you need to know about the Labour leadership candidate She has become known for her support of smaller towns, saying the party needed to appeal to voters outside big cities if it wanted to win at the next election. Ms Nandy declared her bid for leader ina letter to the Wigan Post,external, saying the loss to Boris Johnson's Conservatives had been ""a long time coming"" and she had a ""deeper understanding of what has gone awry"" than her rivals. Read a full profile of Ms Nandy here The 40-year-old shadow business secretary was the last of the remaining three candidates to secure her place on the members' ballot. She garnered support from seven affiliates and unions, as well as 160 constituency Labour parties. During the initial stage of the contest, she received the second highest number of nominations from her colleagues, with the backing of 33 MPs and MEPs. As well as backing from the Communication Workers Union, she is being supported by trade union Unite, Labour's biggest donor at the 2019 election. This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey: What you need to know about the Labour leadership candidate One of a new generation of MPs on the left of the party, she formed part of Mr Corbyn's inner circle and represented Labour in an election TV debate. She is widely regarded as the preferred candidate of Mr Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. But critics of the current leadership have accused her of representing ""continuity Corbyn"". Read a full profile of Mrs Long-Bailey here Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry was eliminated from the race in mid-February after failing to secure enough nominations from groups or local branches. She had managed to receive support from 31 CLPs - just two short of the required 33. Jess Phillips pulled out of the race in January Birmingham Yardley MP and outspoken Corbyn critic of Jess Phillipswithdrew from the race in January, having failed to secure any union, affiliate or constituency endorsements. Earlier in the contest, shadow Treasury secretary Clive Lewis withdrew from the race less than an hour before nominations closed, with only five MPs backing him. The post has been vacant since the election, when former Labour MP Tom Watson said he was stepping down, both from the role and as an MP. This means it is now up for grabs, with the winner chosen in a separate contest. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP Ian Murray and Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan are in the running. All five contenders have made the final ballot, after first getting the required support from MPs and MEPs and then the backing of the required number of local branches or union and affiliate groups. Ms Rayner - who was a care worker and Unison official before becoming an MP - received the endorsement of her flatmate and friend Mrs Long-Bailey. She has also received backing from seven unions and affiliate groups including Unison, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) and GMB. Mr Burgon - a supporter of Mr Corbyn who has pledged to continue the current leader's policy agenda - has the backing of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and Unite. Ms Butler has only one affiliate nomination - Chinese for Labour - but she has met the threshold by gaining the backing of at least 33 local branches. Mr Murray also has one affiliate nomination - Labour Movement for Europe - and he made the final ballot by gaining support from the required number of local branches. Dr Allin-Khan has gained the required support from local branches. Candidates for leader and deputy leader have to be MPs, and they required nominations from 10% of Labour MPs and MEPs to get onto the ballot. In a new rule, candidates also need nominations from 5% of Labour's constituency parties. Alternatively, they need nominations from three affiliated bodies, two of which must be trades unions, adding up to 5% of affiliated members. Does Labour need a new direction after Corbyn? Members of the Labour Party, affiliated trades unions (if they opt in), and socialist societies such as the Fabians, all get one vote each. Those who joined the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote. Registered supporters - who are not full party members - had 48 hours from 14-16 January to secure a vote by paying Â£25. They are cast on a one-member, one-vote basis. Voters fill in a preferential ballot, meaning they rank the candidates in order of preference. If any candidate gets more than half the first preference votes, they win. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their second preference votes are redistributed. If that results in any candidate with more than half the votes, they win. If not, the remaining candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes redistributed, until the contest produces a winner. Labour'sNational Executive Committee,externalhas 39 members, representing the trades unions, the shadow cabinet, Labour's elected representatives at local, national and European level, and constituency parties.

"After several elections where the polls as a whole were not a good guide to the result, this time they got it right. The final figures in the BBC poll tracker were very close to the actual result, as the table below shows, That's a very good performance - just a small underestimate of the Conservative share and a slight overestimate for the Brexit Party, with the other parties on the nose. Many of the polling companies had individual polls that were close to the result. But first prize should probably go jointly to Opinium and Ipsos Mori, whose final published polls were almost exactly correct. There was some evidence of the polls narrowing in the final couple of weeks but the polling companies that showed that most were the least successful at estimating the final result. Election analysis in maps and charts What is the result in my area? Furthermore, the polls were also consistently right to point to Conservative strength with Leave-supporting voters. The biggest swings came in areas that had voted strongly for Brexit in the 2016 referendum - constituencies like Bassetlaw, Dudley North, Redcar and Great Grimsby. In areas that voted strongly for Remain, the Conservative vote share fell. If you can't see the interactive above, click here,external What proved much harder was using polls to forecast how many seats each party would win. That is always difficult because of the unpredictable nature of the first-past-the-post electoral system. In 2017, YouGov's seat projection, using a technique called MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification), was very successful. But this time around, its final seat analysis wasn't so close. Even where the share of the vote is known, it's not always possible to estimate accurately what the House of Commons will look like.

He said he would not ignore those who opposed Brexit as he builds with Europe a partnership ""of sovereign equals"". The Tories have won a Commons majority of 80, the party's largest since 1987. It means the UK is heading out of the EU at the end of next month, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, with Mr Johnson's ""thumping"" majority allowing him to get the laws required through Parliament ""in a matter of weeks"". The Conservatives' victory in the 650th and final contest of the election - the seat of St Ives, in Cornwall - took their total number of MPs up to 365.

The Green Party and NI's Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. The Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England and picked up seats across Wales, while holding off the Lib Dem challenge in many seats in the south of England. Voter turnout overall, on a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%, which is down by 1.5% on the 2017 total. Speaking outside No 10, Mr Johnson thanked lifelong Labour supporters who deserted Jeremy Corbyn's party and turned to the Conservatives, saying he would fulfil his pledge to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January.

""We in this One Nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe,"" he said. Mr Johnson's focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands - more public spending, for example, after years of austerity, the BBC's political correspondent Nick Eardley said. He added that there is no strict definition of one nation conservatism, ""but broadly, it refers to the idea the Conservative Party should act for everybody in the UK. That means policies that work for people from different economic backgrounds, from different regions and from the different nations of the UK."" When they return to Westminster next week, MPs are due to begin the process of considering legislation paving the way for the UK to leave on 31 January. Talks about a future trade and security relationship will begin almost immediately.

Senior Labour figures have sought to defend the party's strategy, arguing that many of its policies were popular but that Brexit had crowded out all other issues for many voters. Wes Streeting, the newly elected MP for Ilford North, said the party's ""far left"" manifesto had jarred with the electorate and blaming Brexit was an attempt to ""kneecap"" credible centrist candidates such as Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry. Meanwhile, Jo Swinson has quit as Liberal Democrat leaderafter losing her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes. While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics. After the SNP's ""overwhelming"" election victory, which saw the party win 48 of Scotland's 59 seats, Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson had ""no right"" to stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum. However, the prime minister later spoke to the first minister by phone on Friday evening, with Downing Street saying he had told her he ""remained opposed"" to a second vote.

Mr Johnson won a Commons majority of 80, his party's biggest election win for 30 years, by sweeping aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. In contrast, Labour suffered its worst election result since the 1930s. Activists chanted ""Boris"" as Mr Johnson arrived in the County Durham constituency, which returned a Conservative MP on Thursday for the first time in 84 years. The prime minister said he wanted to thank voters in the ""incredible"" constituencies in north-east England for placing their trust in the Conservatives. They had ""changed the political landscape"" and ""changed the Conservative Party for the better"", he said. ""Everything that we do, everything that I do as your prime minister, will be devoted to repaying that trust,"" Mr Johnson added. ""We are the servants now and our job is to serve the people of this country and deliver on our priorities. And our priorities and their priorities are the same."" Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had done ""everything I could"" to get Labour into power but expected to stand down ""early next year"", after a successor has been chosen by the party. He said the general election had been ""taken over by Brexit"", the issue on which Mr Johnson campaigned most vociferously - but other figures in the party have disagreed over the reason. Shadow chancellor John McDonnellpromised to ""learn lessons and we'll listen to people""during the debate over the future of the party and its next leader. ""My fear is that we're in for the long haul now, possibly five years,"" he added. Latest updates after Tory election win What the Conservatives' win means for your money Corbyn: 'I did everything I could' Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? Labour's Helen Goodman, who lost the seat of Bishop Auckland to the Conservatives, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""the biggest factor"" in Labour's defeat ""was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader"". However, the Labour MP for York Central, Rachel Maskell, said: ""We've all got to take responsibility... I don't think apportioning blame to a complex situation in a simplistic way is really the way to approach this."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There is no such thing as Corbynism"" Mr Johnson is expected to announce a minor government re-shuffle as early as Monday. Asked whether his promise to be a one nation government meant bringing back Tory politicians like Penny Mordaunt and Jeremy Hunt - who left cabinet in July after Mr Johnson took over - the PM said he was ""not going to speculate about personalities"". MPs will then return to Westminster on Tuesday and begin the process of swearing in, before the Queen formally opens Parliament on Thursday with ""reduced ceremonial elements"". This video can not be played Phil Wilson had been the MP for Sedgefield since 2007 The prime minister has also vowed to reintroduce his Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament before Christmas, which could happen by the end of next week. It would see MPs begin the process of considering legislation that would pave the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Talks about a future trade and security relationship will begin almost immediately. Former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, who opposes Brexit and backed the Liberal Democrats in the election, told Today: ""We've lost. Brexit is going to happen and we have to live with it."" Asked whether he would support any future campaign to rejoin the EU, he said it would be ""20 years or something before the issue is once again raised"". Protests took place at Westminster on Friday following Mr Johnson's election victory. This video can not be played Cheryl Tompsett: ""I've never been on a protest before"" Demonstrators in Westminster carried signs that read ""Defy Tory Rule"" and ""No to Boris Johnson"". The Metropolitan Police said two people had been arrested in relation to the protests - one person on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and another for suspected affray.

IN PICTURES:Binface, a baby and Boris Johnson Following the Conservatives' election win, Mr Johnson spoke to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon on Friday evening and reiterated his opposition to a second independence referendum in Scotland. The conversation came after the first minister said the PM had ""no right"" to stand in the way of a second vote following her party's ""overwhelming"" election performance. The SNP won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats. Speaking on Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, cabinet minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey insisted there would be no referendum on Scottish independence during the Conservatives' five-year term. After speaking to Ms Sturgeon, the PM also took phone calls from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to discuss the next steps on Brexit. The Conservatives won a total of 365 seats in the election, while Labour finished on 203, the SNP on 48, Liberal Democrats on 11 and the DUP on eight. Sinn Fein has seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four and Northern Ireland's SDLP two. The Green Party and NI's Alliance Party have one each. The Brexit Party - which triumphed in the summer's European Parliament elections - failed to win any Westminster seats. The Conservatives swept aside Labour in its traditional heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England and picked up seats across Wales, while holding off the Lib Dem challenge in many seats in the south of England. Voter turnout overall, on a cold and damp polling day, was 67.3%, which is down by 1.5% on the 2017 total. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are looking for a new leader after Jo Swinsonlost her Dunbartonshire East seat to the SNP by 149 votes. While she admitted her ""unapologetic"" pro-Remain strategy had not worked, she said she did not regret standing up for her ""liberal values"" and urged the party to ""regroup and refresh"" itself in the face of a ""nationalist surge"" in British politics. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will be acting co-leaders for the party now that Ms Swinson is no longer an MP.

"Dominic Cummings, whose portrayal in a Channel 4 drama helped build a certain mysticism around Facebook's influence There is still a vast amount we simply don't know about how the election campaign played out digitally. This includes how much was spent by the main parties on targeted Facebook ads in the final few days; how much was spent advertising on other platforms; and whether foreign actors were behind any of the most controversial activity. Nevertheless, based on a huge amount of collective data and the combined efforts of journalists and analysts across many institutions, we can now make some firm conclusions, in addition to those made already by my excellent colleagues at BBC Trending. The Conservatives used banner advertising on YouTube A certain mysticism has grown around the issue of targeted ads on Facebook, in part because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Dominic Cummings in a Channel 4 drama. It has become a burning issue, fuelled by the fact Facebook went significantly further than other platforms in improving the transparency of their political ads - though there is still a great deal that we don't know - including who is ultimately funding them. Fascinating analysis byWho Targets Me,externalshows - against expectations - the Conservatives actually spent significantly less than Labour or the Lib Dems on targeted ads on Facebook. This despite having probably raised more money overall. We can't scientifically prove the effect ads have on persuading voters; but it is striking that the Lib Dems, who had a bad election, spent more than the Conservatives, who had a great one. At the same time, the Conservatives paid for a banner ad on newspaper websites and YouTube, meaning at one point anyone in the UK who visited YouTube saw their advert. We don't know how much this cost. But it is a more conventional, broadcast approach to advertising, rather than the hyper-targeted, constituency level ads you get on Facebook. Why might this be? Local Facebook groups have been the battleground for bitter political debate One reason might be that Tories have intuited that people are spending more time within open or closed group discussions - including on Facebook-owned WhatsApp - than scrolling through news feeds. In April, Mark Zuckerberg gave a landmark speech in which he said the internet was moving into a new era where private groups rather than public discussions dominated. And the thing about private groups is that they may be more likely to contain persuadable voters - particularly if the groups weren't set up for explicitly political reasons. Compare with Twitter. Very broadly speaking, Twitter is a news stream proliferated by people of strong opinions who already have a political world view and are likely to know how they'll vote. But a local Facebook group in Morpeth, or Hastings, or some other marginal, which may have been set up to talk about local issues, is more likely to have people who aren't political, and could be swayed. Some of these groups contain several tens of thousands of people - huge numbers in a marginal constituency. And while many journalists wrongly think of Facebook as a rolling news feed above all else, news is in fact a tiny part of Facebook: group discussions are where most of the activity on Facebook happens. Put that together with changes Facebook has made to de-prioritise news and prioritise ""meaningful interactions"" - that is, stuff from friends and family - and you can see why these groups are key to understanding that platform. Extensive reporting by my colleagues at BBC Trending and BBC Monitoring suggests that, during this election, a huge proportion of the national conversation was happening in these often more localised groups, far from public scrutiny. Getting inside these groups may become a priority for the MPs of the future. Sir John Curtice: What's behind the Conservative victory? What were people talking about online? 15 things you may have missed from election night No two Twitter users have the same experience, because all follow different people. But I think Piers Morgan was correct to say ""Twitter loses another election"" last night, though perhaps for more complex reasons than he implied. What he and others believe is that Twitter has a liberal bias, and that it can too often be a chat room for the metropolitan elite. That is my experience too, despite my best and constant attempts to follow people outside - and I use the phrase after long consideration - the London media bubble. If Twitter does seem like it's dominated by journalists from Remain-ish titles, or Corbyn supporters, well, both had a bad night. The main reason that Twitter had a bad election, however, is that it continues to be a handmaiden to appalling abuse and the proliferation of fake news. As a stream, Twitter is great for real-time updates. But so much of what you see is digital sewage, with trolls directing unconscionable abuse at innocent or vulnerable people, and a detection and reporting system that is wholly inadequate. Moreover, when the Conservative Party press account re-branded itself a fact-checking service early in the campaign - a dystopian tactic that was repeated last night - it is striking that it took to Twitter to, in effect, disseminate confusion. Sadly, it is a matter of fact in 2019 that the British party of government looks to Twitter to dupe people. We know that the leaked US-UK trade documents about the NHS appear to have been put into the public domain by accounts originating in Russia - though possibly before the election campaign began. We know that some of the attempts to spread disinformation,for instance around the picture of a four-year-old boy on the floor of a Leeds hospital,came from highly anonymised accounts that bear a discomforting resemblance to previous foreign operations that leant on bots. But it is hard to trace this stuff. A comprehensive audit of digital foreign interference in this election is going to take several months yet. The moment an ITV reporter confronted Boris Johnson with a photo of a sick child on a hospital floor Election campaigns always strain relations between the BBC and the government of the day. The consequences of that are for another blog and day. It is very interesting that many of the most viral clips on social media from the past few weeks were initially broadcast on traditional media. Andrew Neil's monologue about Boris Johnson's refusal to be interviewed by him, followed by an image of an empty chair, is one; Nicky Morgan's difficult interview about nursing numbers on Good Morning Britain, which really took off on Facebook and has had close to 14 million views, is another. And then there was Mr Johnson's interview with an ITV journalist who tried to show him that picture of a boy on a hospital floor. It may be that, for all the talk of linear decline, traditional broadcast media still carries an authority and weight that makes clips from news bulletins or studio programmes more likely to go viral.
