"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is accused of the murder of George Floyd last May It's day one of jury selection, which could take up to three weeks The first juror is picked after being asked about Black Lives Matter and the damning video at the centre of the case Several potential jurors are dismissed after questioning, due to various concerns about their impartiality and language skills After quizzing dozens of candidates, lawyers will eventually select 16 people, 12 to sit plus four in reserve Chauvin was filmed pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes before he died Floyd's death sparked mass anti-racism protests around the world and renewed calls to end police brutality Three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting murder and will stand trial later this year Edited by Boer Deng Thank you for following our live coverage of the second day of jury selection in the trial against ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Jury selection is expected to take about three more weeks, with the trial itself forecast by the judge to be about four weeks long. Today's coverage was provided by Sam Cabral, Ritu Prasad, Boer Deng and Max Matza. Barbed wire and fencing have gone up to protect the courthouse The court is adjourned for today, after selecting the third juror to serve on the panel that will determine Chauvin's guilt or innocence. It comes after 21 jurors were rejected. Jury selection will resume again tomorrow morning. Three jurors were selected today. Two are men and one is a woman. Nine more jurors must be selected, with two more to serve as alternates. Assistant prosecutor Steve Schleicher is now questioning the potential juror. He begins by asking what the man meant in his questionnaire when he says he had heard that Floyd had been on ""hard drugs"" at the time of his death. He defines ""hard drugs"" as anything harder than marijuana. ""Frankly I don't think that should have much impact on the case. Because whether you're under the influence of drugs shouldn't determine whether you're living or dead,"" he says. He says that Floyd's ""checkered past"" involving run-ins with law enforcement is something he is capable of putting aside for this trial. The potential juror discloses that he is an auditor by profession. He is selected just as the court reaches its adjournment time. ""I'm an honest person. Straightforward and easy to talk to,"" says prospective juror number 19. He says he previously served on a jury about five years ago and that he has a friend who is a police officer. The possible juror says he used to work across the street from the Minneapolis courtroom, and that all the new gates and protective measures were ""surprising"" to him when he saw them on his way to court today. Asked by Chauvin's lawyer if he could keep an open mind as he hears all the evidence, the man says ""yes"". He says he has some familiarity with the case, and is asked if he has already formed an opinion about Chauvin's guilt or innocence. ""I have not because I have not examined it from the viewpoint of the law,"" he says. ""I would have to take the charges that were brought against the defendant and based upon the fact presented, determine if that was met."" The juror who was just dismissed expressed scepticism for efforts to ""defund the police,"" a term that has been used significantly more often in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Critics of police say that cities and states spend far too much money on their police departments without sufficiently funding education, mental health, housing and other community-based social services. Last year, demand grew for political leaders to ""defund"" the police, usually meaning reducing funds, not cutting departments altogether. But the term is controversial among advocates for police reform. Former President Barack Obama was criticised by fellow Democrats after he condemned the term as a ""snappy slogan"".

""Police cover for each other a lot,"" he says, adding that he would be biased against witnesses who are police officers. The potential juror says he is a 19 year-old trade school student, and that he's feeling anxious about being in court today. Shortly afterwards, the judge dismisses the young man and he is not selected. According to the reporters at court, there were six people remaining in the potential jury pool this afternoon. There are five men, ranging in age from their 20s to the 60s. There is one woman remaining, who appears to be in her 40s, reporters say. They are a racially diverse group, including Caucasian, Asian and biracial citizens. As the jury selection continues, let's take a step out of the courtroom and back to last summer, when George Floyd's death led to nationwide protests. One woman came up with a simple way to explain how centuries of economic hardship have impacted black Americans: Monopoly. Author and activist Kimberly Jones was cleaning up the streets during the Floyd protests when she came up with a simple way to explain the impact of centuries of economic hardship on African Americans: the board game Monopoly. Her analogy was filmed by a friend and shared online. The video went viral, drawing praise from celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Lebron James, Trevor Noah and Madonna. In it, Jones explains that black Americans can't win because ""the game is fixed"". Here's what Jones told the BBC when we spoke to her last year: This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: 'How can we win?' â The Monopoly analogy explained ""It doesn't feel like a coincidence that I'm here and part of this trial,"" the potential juror says. Nelson asks for more clarity - does he feel like it's his purpose to be a juror? ""I wouldn't say it's my purpose to be here. I just think for whatever reason it is, I'm here right now and maybe there's something I need to learn...or something I've got to see for myself."" When asked what his personal opinion about the case is, the juror responds that the ""whole thing is very divisive"". He expresses concerns about the future. ""There's a lot of people I know and I just don't want them to know I was a juror on the case. I don't want to talk about it, I don't want to discuss it."" He ""isn't sure"" about the question of whether he can be impartial or not. ""I don't really trust law enforcement, I just feel intimidated when they come around,"" he adds. His father, he says, was racially profiled by Minneapolis police. Barricades have gone up around the area known as George Floyd Square As proceedings continue in the courtroom, tensions have been mounting outside at the intersection where Floyd was arrested - Chicago Avenue and E 38th St - and have escalated since the shooting death of a man there over the weekend. The corner was renamed George Perry Floyd Jr Place by city officials after a makeshift memorial was set up there following his death. Local activists took to Twitter yesterday to ask people to keep away from the area, known locally as George Floyd Square, as they grieve the man's death. Barricades are now up, which activists say are to keep police officers out of their ""autonomous zone"". Some residents oppose the zone, amid claims that crimes such as carjacking have risen. According toMinnesota Public Radio,external, some neighbours are concerned that criminals have hidden in the zone to avoid being caught during police chases. The memorial includes the names of others who died in police encounters Heading up the case against former officer Derek Chauvin is Minnesota's attorney general Keith Ellison. Appointed as special prosecutor in the Floyd murder case last May, Ellison proceeded to press more serious charges against Chauvin and his three colleagues than the originally put forth by the county attorney. Ellison, who is nearing the end of his second year in charge as the state's top prosecutor, was previously the first Muslim person to win a statewide election in the US. He served in the US House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019. He was the first Muslim to be elected to Congress. A progressive politician with ties to prominent Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Ilhan Omar, Ellison has drawn controversy in the past for his apparent affiliation with the Nation of Islam political group. The OJ Simpson murder trial was one of the most watched TV trials in the world. Trial by television is rare in the US and controversial in many countries. But when high profile cases have been televised in the US, the American public has followed along from the living room in trials of figures like OJ Simpson and Casey Anthony. Sometimes they watch out of genuine interest. Sometimes they watch for pure entertainment value. Legal observers have expressed concern that cameras in court can deter or unsettle victims, witnesses and even jurors. Thomas Mesereau, a former lawyer for Michael Jackson,told the BBC in 2014 that ""it's a case by case decision"". Jackson faced allegations of child sexual abuse but his trial was never televised. ""Sometimes you want to tone down the publicity,"" explained Mesereau. ""Cameras in the courtroom would make it even crazier."" However, Judge Cahill, who is presiding over the Chauvin trial, said camera access was ""the only reasonable and meaningful method"" to balance the right to a fair trial with the right of public access. Meanwhile, last year, the UK parliament ruled thatlive cameras would be  allowed in Crown Courts in England and Wales for the first time. Jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin will be difficult, but will be the critical element of the case, says Derrick Johnson, the CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). ""How well prepared the attorneys are in selecting individuals who will 
serve on a jury will absolutely determine the outcome of the case,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played George Floyd: 'Jury selection key to trial result' The jury requires 12 people and 4 alternatives. So far, all but two potential jurors have been dismissed. Juror number nine, a woman who has said she is eager to hear all the evidence in the trial and answered questions regarding her impartiality from both the defence and the prosecution, has become the second juror to be selected. A total of six potential jurors have been heard from so far today. The potential juror being interviewed is asked about her views on Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter - two loosely defined and opposing movements supporting black Americans allegedly harmed by authorities and police shamed by protesters, respectively. The woman is unimpressed with both, and indeed the movements are not without controversy. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has explored the journey of 'Black Lives Matter' -the social media post that became a global slogan. Jury trials in the UK are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances. In the US a pool of eligible citizens is called to appear and be questioned by both sides. The prosecution and defence can both ask a judge dismiss a potential juror ""for cause"" if they perceive bias. Once they're selected, the chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences. Read more about the jury selection process here. The potential juror who, before the lunch break, described himself as a Christian and voiced concerns over security, has been dismissed, and the next person called in. Potential juror nine has been sworn in. She acknowledges that she has some familiarity with the case, but has said that she would only incorporate information from the trial into any judgment should she be selected. A courtroom sketch from the trial over the beating of Rodney King The death of George Floyd at the hands of police was filmed by bystanders and sparked protests across the US, and around the globe. Some three decades ago, in Los Angeles, another black man suffered a beating with eerie parallels. Four police officers, three of whom were white, beat up motorist Rodney King after a car chase. Footage of the incident formed the centerpiece of a trial, but all four officers were acquitted, sparking violent riots in a community that felt there had been no sense of accountability. Now, as a different US city in a different decade awaits the verdict of an emotionally charged trial,here's a look back at the influential King trial, thanks to newly released sketches. The jury selection has resumed after a lunch break, with questioning continuing for the next potential juror. Millions of Americans protested in the days and weeks after Floyd was killed. But nine months on, the reforms they demanded have largely not materialised. The loudest cries were calls to defund the police and shift money toward social services. In December, the Minneapolis City Council redirected $8 million of the city's budget from the police department to mental health, violence prevention and other programmes. Then, last month, after some 200 officers resigned and with crime  sharply rising, the council voted unanimously to spend more than $6 million and recruit more police. On a national level, a law named for Floyd that would ban controversial police tactics faces an unlikely path forward in Congress. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hannah, Rob and Cathryn are celebrating an extraordinary find ""We're still pinching ourselves - to believe that this actually happened on our drive!"" Rob Wilcock, his wife Cathryn and daughter Hannah are astounded to find themselves at the centre of a major scientific discovery. It was their property in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, that was hit by the most valuable space rock ever to fall on the UK. The meteorite has had British scientists in raptures of joy. It's a carbonaceous chondrite - a dark stony material that retains unaltered chemistry from the formation of our Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, and, as such, could give us fresh insights on how the planets came into being. The first thing the Wilcock family knew about it was when they heard a dull thud outside their house on the night of Sunday 28 February. Winchcombe meteorite is first UK find in 30 years Meteorites may be just north of Cheltenham Martian meteorite to head home to Red Planet Antarctic meteorites yield global bombardment rate ""When I heard it drop, I stood up and looked out the window to see what was there,"" recalled Hannah. ""But because it was dark I couldn't see anything. ""It was only the next morning when we went out that we saw it on the drive - a bit like a kind of splatter. And in all honesty, my original thought was - has someone been driving around the Cotswolds lobbing lumps of coal into people's gardens?"" she told BBC News. ""Either that or someone had upturned a barbecue tray,"" chimed in Cathryn. Scientists knew fragments of a meteorite must be in the Gloucestershire area. Their cameras had recorded the rock coming through the atmosphere that Sunday night, creating a huge fireball in the process. This video can not be played ""It blows your mind"": The people of Winchcombe react to the meteorite discovery Imagery from multiple angles allowed researchers to narrow the drop zone, and when they went on the media to make an appeal on the Monday, they hoped one or two people might come forward with an interesting find. In fact, they were inundated with pictures. Most had nothing to do with meteorites, but when Open University planetary scientist Richard Greenwood looked at the Wilcocks' picture, he was blown away. ""It was one of those moments when your legs start going wobbly. I saw this thing; it was like a splat across [the Wilcocks'] drive; and it had all these rays coming off it; and I just thought - that is a meteorite. It was instantaneous,"" he said. With all the hullabaloo that was bound to follow the discovery, Rob's initial reaction was to try to stay out of the limelight - to be anonymous. But when he thought it through a little more, Rob said the three of them recognised they should talk about what had happened to them. ""We've been wrestling with the question of whether we should talk about it, and in the end we decided we should. There seems to be such a lot of genuine public interest in the find,"" Rob told BBC News. This video can not be played Thousands of people reported seeing the fireball ""We're absolutely thrilled that something that's going to be so valuable to science, to the human understanding of the world and of the Solar System has happened, and that we can be a small part in it."" The family have donated the meteorite remains to the national collection held by the Natural History Museum in London. They were determined the rock should not go to a dealer, but to science. The last meteorite observed to fall on the UK and then picked up was 30 years ago. That was an ""ordinary chondrite"" - a common type of space rock. The Winchcombe meteorite is far more valuable. Studying its chemistry - and what it can tell us about the conditions that went into building the planets - will keep scientists busy for years. As for the small Gloucestershire market town - it's now firmly on the map. ""We always felt that the Cotswolds is a wonderful place to live. But now the whole world seems to know about us,"" reflected one local resident on Tuesday afternoon.

"A diplomatic row has broken out after the EU's top official claimed the UK had imposed an ""outright ban"" on the export of Covid vaccines. European Council President Charles Michel said it applied to all vaccines and components produced in the UK. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the suggestion as ""completely false"", the BBC understands. The EU's deputy ambassador to the UK, Nicole Mannion, was summoned to the Foreign Office for ""discussions"". An EU spokesperson said there would be ""no further comment"" on the meeting ""at this stage"". EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Why is the EU having vaccine problems? The argument over vaccines comes with European leaders under pressure over the slow distribution of jabs. In the UK, meanwhile, 22.5 million people - a third of the population - have received their first dose. In his weekly briefing note,external, Mr Michel said he was ""shocked"" to hear the 27-member bloc being accused of ""vaccine nationalism"" following changes it made to export rules earlier this year. ""Here again, the facts do not lie,"" he wrote. ""The United Kingdom and the United States have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory. ""But the European Union, the region with the largest vaccine production capacity in the world, has simply put in place a system for controlling the export of doses produced in the EU."" In response, Mr Raab has written to Mr Michel to ""set the record straight"", saying the ""false claim has been repeated at various levels within the EU and the Commission"". His letter is understood to say: ""The UK government has not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components."" After news of the row broke,Mr Michel tweeted,externalthat there were ""different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines"". But he did not elaborate on this comment. The EU has faced production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. In January, it introduced a system of controls on exports, requiring manufacturers to seek permission from national governments for planned sales. The EU also drafted regulations which would haveoverridden the Northern Ireland Protocol- agreed with the UK last year - potentially allowing it to stop vaccines bound for Northern Ireland. But it backed down following widespread criticism. Earlier this month, Italy blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia. The UK, which is expected to have a large surplus of vaccines after ordering 400 million doses, has said it will donate most of those left over to poorer countries. France's President Emmanuel Macron has urged richer countries to put aside up to 5% of their current supplies for this purpose.

"Sallylouise Jones would like to see a five-miles from home travel rule imposed Non-essential retailers say they feel excited and apprehensive about the chance of reopening in Wales next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said therecould be ""opportunities""for likes of hairdressers to reopen on Monday. Only the likes of supermarkets and pharmacies can currently open but a review of lockdown measures in Wales is due on Friday. All non-essential shopswent into lockdown on 20 December. Hairdressers and other non-essential retailers in England are not due to reopen until 12 April. Pretty Vintage Things in Llantwit Major has been closed since December's lockdown began Sallylouise Jones, who owns antique shop Pretty Vintage Things in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, said she was feeling ""a mixture of excitement and apprehension"". She said: ""It is paramount we get up and running and get people in the door. ""I have been getting the shop ready but it is really hard not having a definite date. She said her main concern was working with short notice. ""Though I understand the reasons why, [the Welsh Government] have had to watch the figures,"" Ms Jones added. She said with the virus still not under control she was ""slightly nervous"" about having customers in her shop again. ""I've been reading about whether they're going to do the five-mile rule,"" she said. ""I'd probably be happier with that to start off with, because otherwise you worry about people coming from further away."" Salon owner Sarah Bruton is hoping to bring about half of her 16 staff back off furlough and into work next week Sarah Bruton, who owns Captiva Spa and Lounge in Caerphilly, says it is split equally between a hair and beauty business. She is hoping to bring about half of her 16 staff back off furlough, on the hairdressing side. She said: ""We're really excited about being able to open next Monday. ""We're cautious about what this means in reality because we have had a lot of false dawns with the Welsh Government. ""We really don't know if any of the business can open or half of it. ""Probably we're not going to know until Friday if we can open on Monday and that's zero business days to prepare."" How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? 'Stay local' rule considered for next Covid review Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Despite the uncertainty, the salon has been making preparations to reopen. ""We've purchased stock, we've done a bit of training with our teams,"" Ms Bruton said. ""We currently have a waiting list of 350 clients who are expecting us to contact them on Friday."" Now she has to play a waiting game and see if the preparations will be worth it. ""There's a bit of risk in purchasing stock which we have now had to commit to. We lost thousands of pounds at Christmas when we had to close at short notice,"" she explained. ""Things like hair colour and beauty products have a very short shelf life."" And if the door stays closed on Monday? ""I don't know where we'd be at that point - would [reopening] be sometime within the next three-week period or would we have to wait for the next review?,"" she asked. CBI (Confederation of British Industry) Wales said the Welsh Government's approach of staggered reopening of sectors had the backing of the business community. Director Ian Price, said: ""With transmission rates heading in the right direction and incredible progress being made on vaccination, non-essential retailers and close contact service providers will be looking to the potential prospect of a mid-March reopening with huge sense of relief. ""As jobs and livelihoods still hang in the balance, the prospect of bringing some economic activity back to struggling high streets and city centres represents a real step in the right direction for communities and businesses across Wales."" But he urged caution, in order to avoid a ""sharp rise"" in Covid transmission rates. ""Wales can't afford for... the country to return to a cycle of damaging restrictions,"" said ""Firms will be looking to work with government to ensure the process happens as safely and effectively as possible."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""In the last few months, we have made huge strides in rolling out vaccines, but faced with new variants of coronavirus, we cannot provide as much certainty and predictability as we would like. ""We cannot move directly and fully into alert level three in one step. We will need to get there in gradual steps, assessing the impact as we go along.""

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Officers searching for a missing woman in south London have put up a cordon outside a block of flats near to where she was last seen. Sarah Everard was last spotted by a doorbell camera on the A205 Poynders Road in Clapham at about 21:30 GMT on Wednesday. The cordon extends along Poynders Road from Rodenhurst Road to Cavendish Road. Detectives have released fresh images of the 33-year-old as the search continues ""at pace"". As part of the ongoing investigation police are searching a variety of areas, the Met said.

"Jurgen Klopp has been Liverpool boss since October 2015 A domestic abuse survivor whose photo was used alongside the Liverpool FC manager in a ""sickening"" social media post has said it made her relive her ordeal. Photos of several abuse victims were posted on Facebook next to a picture of Jurgen Klopp with the caption ""beaten at home throughout lockdown"". Katie Walker, whose image was used, said it was ""extremely traumatic"". Merseyside Police condemned ""making fun"" of ""this abhorrent abuse"". The image was widely shared on social media followingLiverpool's Premier League defeat to Fulham at the weekend. ""It is just a picture to these people sharing it but to us it is our lives. It is extremely traumatic,"" said Ms Walker, who lives in Liverpool. ""To see that it is being made a joke of in the name of football has brought back all those feelings of shame and anxiety."" Ms Walker, who has set up the charity Katie Cares to help support survivors, also called on football clubs to condemn the post, which she called ""sickening"". Jokes about domestic violence highlight a ""toxic culture"", says Amna Abdullatif Amna Abdullatif, from Women's Aid, said the post ""empowers abusers while simultaneously disempowering victims"". ""Jokes or [so-called] banter about domestic abuse and other forms of violence highlight a toxic culture where abuse of women is tolerated,"" she said. ""It also sadly conflates domestic violence with football fans."" She said women who spoke out about domestic abuse ""do so against a difficult backdrop and using images of abused women creates more hurdles for those abused not to report abusers"". Assistant Chief Constable Ian Critchley said no criminal offence had been committed but called the post ""hugely disrespectful and upsetting to anyone who has suffered domestic abuse"". He said domestic violence was ""abhorrent abuse and to make fun of this in such a way is demeaning and unhelpful and I urge people to think twice before sharing such images"".

"England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says it is likely there will be another surge of the virus in the UK Modelling suggests it could come later in the summer, as society opens up, or later in the autumn or winter, he says Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the roadmap out of lockdown in England is ""broadly"" in line with scientists' recommendations Up to four adults from two different households will be able to meet outdoors in Scotland from Friday of this week Restrictions on young people will also be eased, with four people aged between 12-17 able to meet even if they are all from different households A further 231 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, and there were 5,766 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours Hospitals in and around Paris have been told to reduce non-Covid treatments by 40%, amid extensive demand for intensive care beds Globally, there have now been more than 117 million recorded cases of Covid-19, and 2.6 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Rob Corp and Claire Heald We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here are the main stories we've covered in the UK and beyond:  Updates today were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea, Hamish Mackay, Alex Therrien, Rob Corp and Claire Heald,  We know. You wanted to spot someone across a crowded bar, get chatting, take their number, meet up for cocktails or coffees and eventually move in and get a dog together. You didn't think you'd be spending your prime years swiping endlessly on dating apps, answering, ""How's lockdown treating you? aha x"" for the third time today. But that's life for now, so you might as well get good at it. Newsbeat offers its advice here. Here's today's picture of coronavirus in the UK. Deaths and cases are down while vaccination figures continue to rise. A British zoo said it would not inoculate its apes ""at this stage"" despite several at an animal park in the US being given an experimental jab. Four orangutans and five bonobos at San Diego Zooeach had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine made for animals. Eight gorillas at the zoo became the first great apes in the world to test positive for coronavirus in January. Colchester Zoo in Essex said it was focusing on ""procedures to help prevent transmission"". Read more here. The Northern Ireland executive will try to ensure all children in the region can return to school as ""quickly as possible"", Finance Minister Conor Murphy says. The youngest pupils returned to school on Monday for the first time since before the Christmas break. Children in primary one to primary three (aged four to seven) and those in nursery and pre-school went back to face-to-face learning. But under current plans, they will return to remote learning on 22 March. The staggered approach is to allow the return to school of post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 until the start of the Easter holidays. However, Education Minister Peter Weir has argued for a ""continuity of learning""  and says he willbring a specific proposal to the executive for those year groups to continue to be in the classroom. He said health officials would need to consider this proposal and his suggestion that other primary school year groups - P4-P7 - also return to classes this month. It will need to be approved when ministers meet on Thursday. Mr Murphy said he would be guided by health advice. About 90% of Northern Ireland's 350,000 children have beenlearning remotely for more than two months. Pupils in primaries four to seven and years eight to 11 in post-primaries do not yet know when they will return to school. This video can not be played Covid-19 and schools: Pupils 'looking forward to playing with friends' Children in Englandare returning to the classroomthis week. But back to school nerves aren't only for kids - some newly qualified teachers are meeting their classes for the first time. Jess Toose began teaching last year and has been teaching online since October. ""I couldn't remember whether I could still control a classroom,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, which spent the first day of the reopening at her school - Merchant's Academy in Bristol. Jess says she's just glad to have a bit of normality and routine back. ""It's nice to use a whiteboard again, pick up a pen and gather ideas from my students - who have fantastic ideas but have felt too nervous in online lessons,"" she says. And the biggest difference teaching in-person compared to online? ""You can't mute them in-person. Sometimes, when you've got a bit too much banter going on, it's harder to control that kind of atmosphere."" Read more:'I met my class in real life for the first time this week' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online There are fewer than 10,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, the latest figures show - similar to the numbers of Covid patients being cared for on NHS wards at the end of October. Daily new Covid admissions have been declining since mid-January and now stand at 590, as of 5 March. At the peak of this latest pandemic wave they surpassed 4,500 in one day. New infections and deaths from Covid are also down. Today, 9 March, 766 people had a confirmed positive test result for coronavirus, while 231 deaths were reported. Meanwhile, more than two-fifths of UK adults have had their first dose of coronavirus vaccine, meaning they should start to have some protection against the virus. Experts say, despite this progress, unlocking should still be slow and measured. Go too quickly and there could be a substantial surge in Covid infections, risking the lives of many vulnerable people who are not yet sufficiently protected by immunisation. UK retail sales jumped in February as plans to ease lockdown drove purchases of school uniforms, computers and household goods, analysts say. The British Retail Consortiumsays like-for-like sales were up 9.5% year-on-year during the month, following a tough January. Valentine's Day also boosted the figures as locked-down couples splashed out at local supermarkets. But the BRC warns the coming months will be challenging. ""Many retail businesses will be hoping that customers will return to shops, and have spent hundreds of millions on making their premises Covid-secure, but previous reopenings have shown that demand can be slow to come back,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. The Scottish and UK governments have published their timetables for the easing of lockdown restrictions. So how do their plans compare? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiledher ""deliberately cautious"" frameworkfor easing restrictions in Scotland over the next two months. Her aim is that Scotland would return to its levels system of restrictions from 26 April, with all areas moving down to level three at that stage. The easing of the level four restrictions in Scotland will have a minimum gap of three weeks between phases, and will be assessed using conditions set out by the World Health Organization. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announceda four-step planwhich could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June in England. Each stage in his routemap will be a minimum of five weeks apart, with conditions which must be met before proceeding to the next step. Here's how the two plans compare. Hollywood star Michael Sheen has been ""laid low"" after contracting coronavirus,he has revealed,external. The Welsh actor said his illness had been ""difficult and quite scary"" to deal with. Sheen, 52, said he wanted to ""thank all the incredible women"" who helped get him through it. ""Anna, Mum, Lily, Joanne, my friends and all the women I am lucky enough to have support me, who've helped me,"" the Newport-born actor said. During the pandemic he and fellow actor David Tennant won plaudits for the BBC TV series Staged, which saw them play fictionalised versions of themselves dealing with lockdown. The series revolved around the pair trying to rehearse a play via video calls so that they would be able to quickly return to the theatre.

Shapps tweets that it is ""good news"" and says it will ease the movement of freight and goods. The transport secretary says the change is due to the UK's Covid rate being below France, Germany, Belgium and Holland. A further 231 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, according to the government'sdaily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 124,797. There were also 5,766 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. These figures are down on those from Tuesday of last week when 343 deaths and 6,391 positive cases were reported. A total of 22,592,528 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK and 1,181,431 have had their second dose. Officers made 28 arrests, of suspects aged 18 to 44, and seven people were issued with fixed penalty notices Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she ""cannot simply turn a blind eye"" to crowds of Rangers supporters breaching lockdown rules at the weekend. There were mass gatherings at the club's stadium and in the centre of Glasgow after Rangers clinched its first league title since 2011. Ms Sturgeon said the club could have done more to stop it happening. She said there were discussions taking place to make sure the scenes were not repeated. The first minister told MSPs during her Covid update that she would report back before the Old Firm match scheduled for 21 March on the outcome of those discussions. ""We will have to try to assure ourselves there will be no repeat of the scenes we saw at the weekend and that, frankly, is very much a work in progress,"" Ms Sturgeon said. Read more Parents should not pressurise teachers, but trust their judgement as they award GCSE and A-level grades this summer, England's exams regulator has said. For the second year running, teachers' grades will be used following the cancellation of exams due to Covid-19. Simon Lebus, acting head of Ofqual, said teachers' judgement was considered to be ""pretty reliable"". But he urged parents not to put teachers under pressure or make them ""uncomfortable"" over grade decisions. The acting chief regulator was giving evidence to the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday. He told MPs: ""We've created a system in which I think there are good incentives to allow teacher judgement to flourish and we've all got to play our part to support that."" Read more A health minister has defended the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England, saying ""nurses are well-paid for the job"". Lord Bethell praised the ""heroics"" of health workers during the pandemic, but said they had secure jobs that many people would ""envy"". He was responding to opposition calls for the government to rethink its ""miserly"" 1% pay offer. Labour peer Lord McNicol said it was a ""kick in the teeth"" for NHS workers. Lib Dem peer Lord Willis said it amounted to a pay cut - and the government should instead give staff a ""substantial bonus"" before negotiating a ""fair"" pay deal.

""That's why gaming has become such an influence in the past year because it's the way you socialise with the guys outside of cricket. ""We can't go out to Nando's or anything and grab a bite to eat."" ""So you say, 'right, Call of Duty 7pm?'

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be effective against a coronavirus ""variant of concern"" that emerged in Manaus, Brazil, and has now been detected in the UK, a new study suggests. Researchers found that neutralising antibodies were generated against all of the variants - in laboratory tests against an engineered version of the virus - although the response varied between variants. According to the correspondence published in the New England Journal Of Medicine, researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch and Pfizer found:  Dr Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control and a past chairman of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said: ""Reassuringly, while the levels were lower for the P1 and B151 variants, they were still substantial, and likely to indicate that the vaccine will be effective."" The schools minister is calling for parents to allow their children to wear face coverings in secondary school classrooms amid reports of opposition to the move. Nick Gibb told the Commons Education Select Committee wearing a covering might mean a child would not have to self-isolate because somebody near them tested positive for Covid. His comments come as David Johnston, Conservative MP for Wantage, says head teachers are telling him some parents are issuing a ""notice of liability"" about the Department for Education's face mask guidance. ""When a head teacher decides that actually they do need them, based on the DfE guidance, they're getting quite challenging, some might say threatening, letters from certain parents who disagree with the stance ordering them to desist,"" says Johnston. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a possible âalthough still unconfirmedâ further case of the Brazilian variant in Scotland has now been identified. It involves an individual who travelled to Scotland from Rio de Janeiro, via Paris, and arrived in the country on 19 February. Sturgeon told MSPs: âThe individual followed the procedures for managed self-isolation, and we currently have no reason to believe that this case presents any risk to the wider community. However, we are of course continuing to undertake all necessary follow-up work.â You can read more on the Brazil variant in Scotlandhere. Nicola Sturgeon has been giving more detail on the minor changes to lockdown restrictions. Meeting outdoors should be done close to home and people should only go indoors to reach a back garden or use a toilet, she says. Young people aged 12 to 17 will be able to meet outdoors with four people from four different households. This is ""to allow young people to see more of their friends than is currently the case"", Sturgeon told Holyrood. From Friday outdoor non-contact sports will be able to resume with up to 15 people. And ""assuming there is no deterioration"" in the Covid situation, the limit on the number of people to take part in communal worship will be increased from 20 to 50 people from 26 March, she says.

"Piers Morgan has presented Good Morning Britain since 2015 Piers Morgan has left ITV's Good Morning Britain following a row over comments he made about the Duchess of Sussex. It brings the controversial host's time on the show to an end after six years. ITV announced the decision after Ofcom said it was investigating his comments after receiving 41,000 complaints. On Monday's show, Morgan said he ""didn't believe a word"" the duchess had told Oprah Winfrey about her mental health in an interview. Piers Morgan: From being 'ghosted' by Meghan to GMB exit An ITV spokesperson said: ""Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain. ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add."" The channel confirmed to the BBC that his departure from the breakfast news show will take effect immediately but declined to say who would be replacing him on Wednesday. In atweet on Wednesday morning,externalMorgan said that he had reflected on his opinion on the Oprah interview and still did not believe Meghan, adding that ""freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on"". ""Thanks for all the love, and hate. I'm off to spend more time with my opinions,"" he said. He hosted the daily breakfast programme with Susanna Reid Morgan's departure followed an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford, who criticised his colleague on Tuesday for ""continuing to trash"" the duchess, prompting Morgan to walk off set. He returned within 10 minutes. Also on Tuesday,ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said,externalshe ""completely believed what [the duchess] says"", adding that ITV is ""totally committed to"" mental health. Mental health charity Mind, which is a partner with ITV on its Britain Get Talking campaign, also criticised Morgan, saying it was ""disappointed"" by the presenter's comments. On Monday's programme, Morgan picked up on the duchess's claim that her request to senior Buckingham Palace officials for help was rejected, after she told Oprah she had had suicidal thoughts. ""Who did you go to?"" he said. ""What did they say to you? I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she said, Meghan Markle. I wouldn't believe it if she read me a weather report. ""The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible."" He also referred to the duchess as the ""Pinocchio Princess"" in a tweet later that morning. Following an outcry, he said on Tuesday's episode that ""I still have serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what"" Meghan said, but that it was ""not for me to question if she felt suicidal"". He added: ""My real concern was a disbelief frankly... that she went to a senior member of the Royal household and told them she was suicidal and was told she could not have any help because it would be a bad look for the family."" A total of 41,015 complaints were made to media watchdog Ofcom by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday. That is the second highest number of complaints in Ofcom's 17-year history, behind the 44,500 submitted over several days about the racism row involving Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007. ""We have launched an investigation into Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain under our harm and offence rules,"" a spokesperson for the regulator said. Meanwhile, on Monday evening Mindtweeted,external: ""We were disappointed and concerned to see Piers Morgan's comments on not believing Meghan's experiences about suicidal thoughts today. ""It's vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy. We are in conversations with ITV about this at the moment."" There is a culture war going on, and Piers Morgan's job on Good Morning Britain has fallen victim to it. That's different from saying Morgan himself is a victim of it; in some ways he has been a beneficiary. But when the public position of a star presenter and a broadcaster's CEO are in sharp contrast, about such a sensitive subject, at a time of such heightened tensions, something has to give. Tonight, it did. This morning Carolyn McCall made it very clear that she believed Meghan Markle's central claim about her mental health. She went further: ITV takes mental health very seriously. It follows that the company must have expected Morgan to recant publicly, or apologise. He is unlikely to have been willing to do that. Therefore this was the moment to leave GMB. Read more on Amol's blog: Why Piers Morgan left Good Morning Britain Morgan has always divided opinion - and some people on social media were glad to see the back of him, while others offered their support.

ActressJameela Jamil reacted by revealing,externalthat Morgan's ""relentless campaign of lies and hatred against me"" had led her to contemplate suicide. TV critic Scott Bryant told BBC Radio 5 Live that the announcement had come as ""a big shock"". ""The big question people are asking is, did he decide to willingly leave the programme or was he pushed out of it?"" he said. Media commentator Alex DeGroote told 5 Live: ""Has he walked? Has be been pushed? Who knows. But it's a stunning development."" His departure ""will be a blow for Good Morning Britain because he is very much the public face of that show"", he said, adding: ""I suspect ITV have decided that their public brand and their public responsibility comes ahead of Piers Morgan. ""They have to be conscious of the fallout in terms of the damage to their own brand, and ultimately nobody is bigger than the station itself."" Morgan is not likely to struggle to find a new outlet, he said. ""He won't be short of offers, and he has a big social following, and those people will follow him to a new platform, so this is definitely not the last of Piers Morgan."" Born in 1965 in an East Sussex village, Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan was youngest of four children and the son of a meat distribution executive. After leaving school he studied journalism - working his way up through local papers before moving the Sun, where he was given his own showbiz column, Bizarre, by then-editor Kelvin MacKenzie. From there his career in media progressed rapidly. Morgan was just 28 when he became editor of the News of the World in January 1994. By November of the following year he'd joined the Mirror to become the youngest ever editor of a national daily newspaper. The paper's reputation grew under his stewardship but the success came to an abrupt end, when in 2004, he was sacked over approving the frontpage publication of falsified photographs allegedly showing British soldiers humiliating Iraqi prisoners of war. Morgan later told the Times the dismissal ""liberated"" him. A move into TV then followed. His ITV show Life Stories saw him interview prominent celebrity figures, while he also took up a judging role on Britain's Got Talent before landing a leading role on US broadcaster CNN in 2010. But the show was axed in March 2014 due to falling ratings, as Morgan's campaigning and combative stance toward the US gun lobby cemented his controversialist streak. However, as with his departure from the Mirror, he was not down for long. In 2015 he joined the presenting team on ITV's Good Morning Britain - bringing his street-fighting social media presence to breakfast TV every morning alongside Susanna Reid. The pair built up a strong partnership, with Morgan acting as the pantomime villain, outspoken and perfectly suited to the Twitter age.

Also on Tuesday,ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said,externalshe ""completely believed what [the duchess] says"", adding that ITV is ""totally committed to"" mental health. Mental health charity Mind, which is a partner with ITV on its Britain Get Talking campaign, also criticised Morgan, saying it was ""disappointed"" by the presenter's comments. On Monday's programme, Morgan picked up on the duchess's claim that her request to senior Buckingham Palace officials for help was rejected, after she told Oprah she had had suicidal thoughts. ""Who did you go to?"" he said. ""What did they say to you? I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she said, Meghan Markle. I wouldn't believe it if she read me a weather report. ""The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible."" He also referred to the duchess as the ""Pinocchio Princess"" in a tweet later that morning. Following an outcry, he said on Tuesday's episode that ""I still have serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what"" Meghan said, but that it was ""not for me to question if she felt suicidal"". He added: ""My real concern was a disbelief frankly... that she went to a senior member of the Royal household and told them she was suicidal and was told she could not have any help because it would be a bad look for the family."" A total of 41,015 complaints were made to media watchdog Ofcom by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday. That is the second highest number of complaints in Ofcom's 17-year history, behind the 44,500 submitted over several days about the racism row involving Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007. ""We have launched an investigation into Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain under our harm and offence rules,"" a spokesperson for the regulator said. Meanwhile, on Monday evening Mindtweeted,external: ""We were disappointed and concerned to see Piers Morgan's comments on not believing Meghan's experiences about suicidal thoughts today. ""It's vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy. We are in conversations with ITV about this at the moment."" There is a culture war going on, and Piers Morgan's job on Good Morning Britain has fallen victim to it. That's different from saying Morgan himself is a victim of it; in some ways he has been a beneficiary. But when the public position of a star presenter and a broadcaster's CEO are in sharp contrast, about such a sensitive subject, at a time of such heightened tensions, something has to give. Tonight, it did. This morning Carolyn McCall made it very clear that she believed Meghan Markle's central claim about her mental health. She went further: ITV takes mental health very seriously. It follows that the company must have expected Morgan to recant publicly, or apologise. He is unlikely to have been willing to do that. Therefore this was the moment to leave GMB.

""The big question people are asking is, did he decide to willingly leave the programme or was he pushed out of it?"" he said. Media commentator Alex DeGroote told 5 Live: ""Has he walked? Has be been pushed? Who knows. But it's a stunning development."" His departure ""will be a blow for Good Morning Britain because he is very much the public face of that show"", he said, adding: ""I suspect ITV have decided that their public brand and their public responsibility comes ahead of Piers Morgan. ""They have to be conscious of the fallout in terms of the damage to their own brand, and ultimately nobody is bigger than the station itself."" Morgan is not likely to struggle to find a new outlet, he said. ""He won't be short of offers, and he has a big social following, and those people will follow him to a new platform, so this is definitely not the last of Piers Morgan."" Born in 1965 in an East Sussex village, Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan was youngest of four children and the son of a meat distribution executive. After leaving school he studied journalism - working his way up through local papers before moving the Sun, where he was given his own showbiz column, Bizarre, by then-editor Kelvin MacKenzie. From there his career in media progressed rapidly. Morgan was just 28 when he became editor of the News of the World in January 1994. By November of the following year he'd joined the Mirror to become the youngest ever editor of a national daily newspaper. The paper's reputation grew under his stewardship but the success came to an abrupt end, when in 2004, he was sacked over approving the frontpage publication of falsified photographs allegedly showing British soldiers humiliating Iraqi prisoners of war. Morgan later told the Times the dismissal ""liberated"" him. A move into TV then followed. His ITV show Life Stories saw him interview prominent celebrity figures, while he also took up a judging role on Britain's Got Talent before landing a leading role on US broadcaster CNN in 2010. But the show was axed in March 2014 due to falling ratings, as Morgan's campaigning and combative stance toward the US gun lobby cemented his controversialist streak. However, as with his departure from the Mirror, he was not down for long. In 2015 he joined the presenting team on ITV's Good Morning Britain - bringing his street-fighting social media presence to breakfast TV every morning alongside Susanna Reid. The pair built up a strong partnership, with Morgan acting as the pantomime villain, outspoken and perfectly suited to the Twitter age.

""It's vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy. We are in conversations with ITV about this at the moment."" There is a culture war going on, and Piers Morgan's job on Good Morning Britain has fallen victim to it. That's different from saying Morgan himself is a victim of it; in some ways he has been a beneficiary. But when the public position of a star presenter and a broadcaster's CEO are in sharp contrast, about such a sensitive subject, at a time of such heightened tensions, something has to give. Tonight, it did. This morning Carolyn McCall made it very clear that she believed Meghan Markle's central claim about her mental health. She went further: ITV takes mental health very seriously. It follows that the company must have expected Morgan to recant publicly, or apologise. He is unlikely to have been willing to do that. Therefore this was the moment to leave GMB.

ActressJameela Jamil reacted by revealing,externalthat Morgan's ""relentless campaign of lies and hatred against me"" had led her to contemplate suicide. TV critic Scott Bryant told BBC Radio 5 Live that the announcement had come as ""a big shock"". ""The big question people are asking is, did he decide to willingly leave the programme or was he pushed out of it?"" he said. Media commentator Alex DeGroote told 5 Live: ""Has he walked? Has be been pushed? Who knows. But it's a stunning development."" His departure ""will be a blow for Good Morning Britain because he is very much the public face of that show"", he said, adding: ""I suspect ITV have decided that their public brand and their public responsibility comes ahead of Piers Morgan. ""They have to be conscious of the fallout in terms of the damage to their own brand, and ultimately nobody is bigger than the station itself."" Morgan is not likely to struggle to find a new outlet, he said. ""He won't be short of offers, and he has a big social following, and those people will follow him to a new platform, so this is definitely not the last of Piers Morgan."" Born in 1965 in an East Sussex village, Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan was youngest of four children and the son of a meat distribution executive. After leaving school he studied journalism - working his way up through local papers before moving the Sun, where he was given his own showbiz column, Bizarre, by then-editor Kelvin MacKenzie. From there his career in media progressed rapidly. Morgan was just 28 when he became editor of the News of the World in January 1994. By November of the following year he'd joined the Mirror to become the youngest ever editor of a national daily newspaper. The paper's reputation grew under his stewardship but the success came to an abrupt end, when in 2004, he was sacked over approving the frontpage publication of falsified photographs allegedly showing British soldiers humiliating Iraqi prisoners of war. Morgan later told the Times the dismissal ""liberated"" him. A move into TV then followed. His ITV show Life Stories saw him interview prominent celebrity figures, while he also took up a judging role on Britain's Got Talent before landing a leading role on US broadcaster CNN in 2010. But the show was axed in March 2014 due to falling ratings, as Morgan's campaigning and combative stance toward the US gun lobby cemented his controversialist streak. However, as with his departure from the Mirror, he was not down for long. In 2015 he joined the presenting team on ITV's Good Morning Britain - bringing his street-fighting social media presence to breakfast TV every morning alongside Susanna Reid. The pair built up a strong partnership, with Morgan acting as the pantomime villain, outspoken and perfectly suited to the Twitter age.

"The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles Crisis meetings involving senior royals have taken place following the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said Buckingham Palace ""will not want to feel rushed into saying something"" about Prince Harry and Meghan's claims. The couple spoke to Oprah about racism, mental health, the media and other members of the Royal Family. Prince Charles did not speak about the interview during a visit in London. An average of 11.1m people in the UK watched the interview on Monday night. In it, the duchess - who is the first mixed-race member of the modern Royal Family - said a low point came when Harry was asked by an unnamed royal family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Prince Harry later clarified to Oprah that the comments werenot made by either the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Why is Archie not a prince? Piers Morgan's comments about Meghan criticised 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden's spokeswoman said he would praise anyone for having the courage to speak out about mental health. White House press secretary Jen Psaki described Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, as ""private citizens"" who were ""sharing their own story in their own struggles"". Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton also backed Meghan, saying: ""This young woman was not about to keep her head down, you know, this is 2021."" Prince Charles did not respond to questions about the interview during a visit to a vaccine centre in north London The two-hour interview was screened on ITV on Monday night attracting 12.4m viewers at its peak - the broadcaster's biggest audience since the 2019 Rugby World Cup final - while it was viewed by an average of 17.1m in the US the previous day. In the interview, the duchess said that she found royal lifeso difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"", and when she approached the institution for help, she did not get it. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Meghan's allegations about racism and a lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". No 10 said Prime Minister Boris Johnson watched the interview on Monday night, but declined to comment further. It followed Mr Johnson's comments earlier on Monday, when he said he had ""always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role she plays"". He said ""when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing"", after being asked specifically if he believed the Royal Family was racist. Meanwhile, a YouGov opinion poll of 4,656 people conducted after the interview aired in the UK suggested: The public was equally split 32% by 32% on whether Prince Harry and Meghan were treated fairly or unfairly by the Royal Family - while 36% said they did not know Among over-65s, 50% thought the couple were treated fairly, compared with just 13% of 18 to 24-year-olds There was little to no change in people's opinions when compared with an identical poll carried out last week Prince Harry and Meghan have released a new image of them with their son Archie, who was born in 2019 During the interview, the duchess was asked why she thought the Royal Family did not make Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The couple's children do not automatically become princes or princesses due to a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" Prince Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. Analysis: Harry and Meghan rattle monarchy's gilded cage Meghan and Diana: Press coverage of two princesses 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' Prince Harry said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan about the ""colonial undertones"" of news headlines and articles. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" he said. The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. In footage not included in the original interview, Prince Harrysaid racism from the tabloid pressthat filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why he and his wife left the UK. The Society of Editors said it was ""not acceptable"" to claim sections of the press were bigoted ""without providing any supporting evidence"". Labour MP Diane Abbott said she could cite ""story after story when Meghan was treated quite differently from white members of the Royal Family"". Ms Abbott described the impact of coverage she has received as ""hurtful"", adding: ""It's corrosive and in the end, it makes you doubt yourself."" In other key revelations from the Oprah interview: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Prince Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But the prince said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month In further comments, Meghan told Oprah she felt betrayed by her father Thomas Markle's conduct in the run up to her 2018 wedding with Prince Harry. Mr Markle told ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday that the interview was the first time he had heard his daughter speak for several years. ""I'm very disappointed about it. I've apologised about this thing, what happened, at least 100 times or so,"" he said. This video can not be played Society of Editors executive director defends newspaper coverage of Meghan He described the interview as ""over the top"" and ill-timed, but said he did not believe the Royal Family was racist and that the comments about Archie's skin colour may have simply been a ""dumb question"". Asked about Meghan's claim she had ""lost"" her father, Mr Markle said: ""I'm available any time we can get together. I'd love to get together. I'd certainly like to see my grandson."" He also criticised the support from the Palace when he and his family were under intense scrutiny from the media, saying: ""Nobody was there to care for us, nobody looked after us.""

"Piers Morgan has presented Good Morning Britain since 2015 Piers Morgan has left ITV's Good Morning Britain following a row over comments he made about the Duchess of Sussex. It brings the controversial host's time on the show to an end after six years. ITV announced the decision after Ofcom said it was investigating his comments after receiving 41,000 complaints. On Monday's show, Morgan said he ""didn't believe a word"" the duchess had told Oprah Winfrey about her mental health in an interview. Piers Morgan: From being 'ghosted' by Meghan to GMB exit An ITV spokesperson said: ""Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain. ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add."" The channel confirmed to the BBC that his departure from the breakfast news show will take effect immediately but declined to say who would be replacing him on Wednesday. In atweet on Wednesday morning,externalMorgan said that he had reflected on his opinion on the Oprah interview and still did not believe Meghan, adding that ""freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on"". ""Thanks for all the love, and hate. I'm off to spend more time with my opinions,"" he said. He hosted the daily breakfast programme with Susanna Reid Morgan's departure followed an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford, who criticised his colleague on Tuesday for ""continuing to trash"" the duchess, prompting Morgan to walk off set. He returned within 10 minutes. Also on Tuesday,ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said,externalshe ""completely believed what [the duchess] says"", adding that ITV is ""totally committed to"" mental health. Mental health charity Mind, which is a partner with ITV on its Britain Get Talking campaign, also criticised Morgan, saying it was ""disappointed"" by the presenter's comments. On Monday's programme, Morgan picked up on the duchess's claim that her request to senior Buckingham Palace officials for help was rejected, after she told Oprah she had had suicidal thoughts. ""Who did you go to?"" he said. ""What did they say to you? I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she said, Meghan Markle. I wouldn't believe it if she read me a weather report. ""The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible."" He also referred to the duchess as the ""Pinocchio Princess"" in a tweet later that morning. Following an outcry, he said on Tuesday's episode that ""I still have serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what"" Meghan said, but that it was ""not for me to question if she felt suicidal"". He added: ""My real concern was a disbelief frankly... that she went to a senior member of the Royal household and told them she was suicidal and was told she could not have any help because it would be a bad look for the family."" A total of 41,015 complaints were made to media watchdog Ofcom by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday. That is the second highest number of complaints in Ofcom's 17-year history, behind the 44,500 submitted over several days about the racism row involving Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.

His departure ""will be a blow for Good Morning Britain because he is very much the public face of that show"", he said, adding: ""I suspect ITV have decided that their public brand and their public responsibility comes ahead of Piers Morgan. ""They have to be conscious of the fallout in terms of the damage to their own brand, and ultimately nobody is bigger than the station itself."" Morgan is not likely to struggle to find a new outlet, he said. ""He won't be short of offers, and he has a big social following, and those people will follow him to a new platform, so this is definitely not the last of Piers Morgan."" Born in 1965 in an East Sussex village, Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan was youngest of four children and the son of a meat distribution executive. After leaving school he studied journalism - working his way up through local papers before moving the Sun, where he was given his own showbiz column, Bizarre, by then-editor Kelvin MacKenzie. From there his career in media progressed rapidly. Morgan was just 28 when he became editor of the News of the World in January 1994. By November of the following year he'd joined the Mirror to become the youngest ever editor of a national daily newspaper. The paper's reputation grew under his stewardship but the success came to an abrupt end, when in 2004, he was sacked over approving the frontpage publication of falsified photographs allegedly showing British soldiers humiliating Iraqi prisoners of war. Morgan later told the Times the dismissal ""liberated"" him. A move into TV then followed. His ITV show Life Stories saw him interview prominent celebrity figures, while he also took up a judging role on Britain's Got Talent before landing a leading role on US broadcaster CNN in 2010. But the show was axed in March 2014 due to falling ratings, as Morgan's campaigning and combative stance toward the US gun lobby cemented his controversialist streak. However, as with his departure from the Mirror, he was not down for long. In 2015 he joined the presenting team on ITV's Good Morning Britain - bringing his street-fighting social media presence to breakfast TV every morning alongside Susanna Reid. The pair built up a strong partnership, with Morgan acting as the pantomime villain, outspoken and perfectly suited to the Twitter age.

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Officers searching for a missing woman in south London have put up a cordon outside a block of flats near to where she was last seen. Sarah Everard was last spotted by a doorbell camera on the A205 Poynders Road in Clapham at about 21:30 GMT on Wednesday. The cordon extends along Poynders Road from Rodenhurst Road to Cavendish Road. Detectives have released fresh images of the 33-year-old as the search continues ""at pace"".

Detectives continue to say they are ""keeping an open mind"" about her disappearance. Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said a number of CCTV recordings had been ""seized"". Ms Everard has not been seen since Wednesday evening ""We have committed significant resources to this investigation, with assistance coming from across the Met,"" she said. ""I want to remain clear that at this time we have no information to suggest that Sarah has come to any harm and we retain an open mind as to the circumstances. ""We share the wish of her family and friends to have her back safely with her loved ones."" Friends and relatives have issued appeals on social media to help find the marketing manager who vanished on her walk home to Brixton after visiting a friend's flat in Leathwaite Road, Battersea. Her family have said it is out of character for her to disappear. Women living in the area near to where she vanished told reporters they had been warned by police to be extra vigilant. Scotland Yard said no official advice was being given to local residents, but it would remind them of ""normal personal safety advice"". Ms Everard was wearing clothes and earphones like these when she was last seen Investigators are not currently linking the disappearance to reports of women being followed in surrounding areas.

"UK supermarkets have warned of a shortage of some dog and cat food products following an ""unprecedented"" rise in pet ownership during lockdown. Sainsbury's has apologised after running out of dog and cat food pouches due to a ""national shortage"", although tinned and dry food are unaffected. Morrisons said it might not have ""full availability for several months"", but said it had enough stock for customers. Waitrose is also running low, while Tesco has seen strong demand. Sainsbury's said it was trying to resolve the issue but warned it would be ""ongoing"" in 2021. It is blaming higher than usual demand for pouches after more pets were bought during lockdown. Pets prove 'a lifesaver' for lockdown loneliness Morrisons also said that there had been ""an unprecedented rise in pet ownership across the UK"" and it was seeing an ""increase in demand"". A spokesperson for Morrisons said: ""We're working closely with our suppliers who are investing in increasing their capacity and we may not have full availability for several months."" But the supermarket added that there was no need for people to start panic-buying pet food. ""We do have enough stock to support all our customers and their new pets and so there is no need for people to buy more than they need."" Tesco is believed to be working closely with suppliers to meet the needs of customers' pets, while Waitrose hopes to have its full range of pouches back on the shelves ""as soon as possible"". Helen Warren-Piper, general manager of Mars Petcare UK, which makes Pedigree and Whiskas, said: ""We recognise retailers are experiencing unusual demand for pet food during lockdown. ""We have made significant investment into our manufacturing network - including investment in our UK Melton pet food plant."" Pet food maker Purina said the UK market had ""changed significantly"" during the pandemic. ""We are experiencing unprecedented demand for our products, including cat food pouches where we have seen sales growth for our Felix and Gourmet brands at almost three times that of the market,"" it said. ""We have been working hard to meet this additional demand and are producing more pet food - including pouches - than ever before."" However, it added that consumers might find that  some of its products ""are not consistently available in their normal place of purchase"". Jonathan Josephs, business reporter, BBC News Millions more of us have got used to cats, dogs and other pets yelping for food. Even before another surge during November's second lockdown more than two million Britons had taken on new pets. That should have been good news for the profits of pet food manufacturers but it's an industry that was already manufacturing at close to capacity. It's not just the UK where demand for pet food is simply outstripping supply, but across Europe too; shortages are the inevitable results. Some owners have taken to feeding their animals other products, and that may have to be a growing trend. There are also bigger global issues at play, with concerns that increased demand for wheat and grain in China could cause shortages of some ingredients in the supply chain. One industry source said there has also been ""more of a crunch because of Brexit"" and the disruption that's caused with hauliers paperwork at UK borders. Despite the financial constraints many people are facing the pet-care industry is regarded as recession-proof.  It can take a lot of time and money to increase factory capacity but pet-food makers might have to do just that because after all; a dog is for life, not just for lockdown. Pet owners reacted with humour and dismay on Twitter. Some said Sainsbury's should have provided more information about the shortage when it emailed its customers about the issue. The journalist Owen Jones said his cat was less than impressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There has been a well documented rise in pet ownership during the pandemic, with retail chain Pets at Home reporting strong sales and profits last year. In November, it said that animals had been a ""lifesaver"" during lockdown, helping people through a period of ""social loneliness"". The firm not only saw stronger demand for pets, but also related services such as its Vets at Home business. Shoppers panic bought pet food during the first national lockdown in 2020 but there have been no reports of similar trends since then.

"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is accused of the murder of George Floyd last May It's day one of jury selection, which could take up to three weeks The first juror is picked after being asked about Black Lives Matter and the damning video at the centre of the case Several potential jurors are dismissed after questioning, due to various concerns about their impartiality and language skills After quizzing dozens of candidates, lawyers will eventually select 16 people, 12 to sit plus four in reserve Chauvin was filmed pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes before he died Floyd's death sparked mass anti-racism protests around the world and renewed calls to end police brutality Three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting murder and will stand trial later this year Edited by Boer Deng Thank you for following our live coverage of the second day of jury selection in the trial against ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Jury selection is expected to take about three more weeks, with the trial itself forecast by the judge to be about four weeks long. Today's coverage was provided by Sam Cabral, Ritu Prasad, Boer Deng and Max Matza. Barbed wire and fencing have gone up to protect the courthouse The court is adjourned for today, after selecting the third juror to serve on the panel that will determine Chauvin's guilt or innocence. It comes after 21 jurors were rejected. Jury selection will resume again tomorrow morning. Three jurors were selected today. Two are men and one is a woman. Nine more jurors must be selected, with two more to serve as alternates. Assistant prosecutor Steve Schleicher is now questioning the potential juror. He begins by asking what the man meant in his questionnaire when he says he had heard that Floyd had been on ""hard drugs"" at the time of his death. He defines ""hard drugs"" as anything harder than marijuana. ""Frankly I don't think that should have much impact on the case. Because whether you're under the influence of drugs shouldn't determine whether you're living or dead,"" he says. He says that Floyd's ""checkered past"" involving run-ins with law enforcement is something he is capable of putting aside for this trial. The potential juror discloses that he is an auditor by profession. He is selected just as the court reaches its adjournment time. ""I'm an honest person. Straightforward and easy to talk to,"" says prospective juror number 19. He says he previously served on a jury about five years ago and that he has a friend who is a police officer. The possible juror says he used to work across the street from the Minneapolis courtroom, and that all the new gates and protective measures were ""surprising"" to him when he saw them on his way to court today. Asked by Chauvin's lawyer if he could keep an open mind as he hears all the evidence, the man says ""yes"". He says he has some familiarity with the case, and is asked if he has already formed an opinion about Chauvin's guilt or innocence. ""I have not because I have not examined it from the viewpoint of the law,"" he says. ""I would have to take the charges that were brought against the defendant and based upon the fact presented, determine if that was met."" The juror who was just dismissed expressed scepticism for efforts to ""defund the police,"" a term that has been used significantly more often in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Critics of police say that cities and states spend far too much money on their police departments without sufficiently funding education, mental health, housing and other community-based social services. Last year, demand grew for political leaders to ""defund"" the police, usually meaning reducing funds, not cutting departments altogether. But the term is controversial among advocates for police reform. Former President Barack Obama was criticised by fellow Democrats after he condemned the term as a ""snappy slogan"". Read more here: Seven solutions to US police problems ""This whole thing is very divisive and I'm not a divisive person,"" says prospective juror number 17, who has been making it clear that he is not eager to serve in the trial. ""Police cover for each other a lot,"" he says, adding that he would be biased against witnesses who are police officers. The potential juror says he is a 19 year-old trade school student, and that he's feeling anxious about being in court today. Shortly afterwards, the judge dismisses the young man and he is not selected. According to the reporters at court, there were six people remaining in the potential jury pool this afternoon. There are five men, ranging in age from their 20s to the 60s. There is one woman remaining, who appears to be in her 40s, reporters say. They are a racially diverse group, including Caucasian, Asian and biracial citizens. As the jury selection continues, let's take a step out of the courtroom and back to last summer, when George Floyd's death led to nationwide protests. One woman came up with a simple way to explain how centuries of economic hardship have impacted black Americans: Monopoly. Author and activist Kimberly Jones was cleaning up the streets during the Floyd protests when she came up with a simple way to explain the impact of centuries of economic hardship on African Americans: the board game Monopoly. Her analogy was filmed by a friend and shared online. The video went viral, drawing praise from celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Lebron James, Trevor Noah and Madonna. In it, Jones explains that black Americans can't win because ""the game is fixed"". Here's what Jones told the BBC when we spoke to her last year: This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: 'How can we win?' â The Monopoly analogy explained ""It doesn't feel like a coincidence that I'm here and part of this trial,"" the potential juror says. Nelson asks for more clarity - does he feel like it's his purpose to be a juror? ""I wouldn't say it's my purpose to be here. I just think for whatever reason it is, I'm here right now and maybe there's something I need to learn...or something I've got to see for myself."" When asked what his personal opinion about the case is, the juror responds that the ""whole thing is very divisive"". He expresses concerns about the future. ""There's a lot of people I know and I just don't want them to know I was a juror on the case. I don't want to talk about it, I don't want to discuss it."" He ""isn't sure"" about the question of whether he can be impartial or not. ""I don't really trust law enforcement, I just feel intimidated when they come around,"" he adds. His father, he says, was racially profiled by Minneapolis police. Barricades have gone up around the area known as George Floyd Square As proceedings continue in the courtroom, tensions have been mounting outside at the intersection where Floyd was arrested - Chicago Avenue and E 38th St - and have escalated since the shooting death of a man there over the weekend. The corner was renamed George Perry Floyd Jr Place by city officials after a makeshift memorial was set up there following his death. Local activists took to Twitter yesterday to ask people to keep away from the area, known locally as George Floyd Square, as they grieve the man's death. Barricades are now up, which activists say are to keep police officers out of their ""autonomous zone"". Some residents oppose the zone, amid claims that crimes such as carjacking have risen. According toMinnesota Public Radio,external, some neighbours are concerned that criminals have hidden in the zone to avoid being caught during police chases. The memorial includes the names of others who died in police encounters Heading up the case against former officer Derek Chauvin is Minnesota's attorney general Keith Ellison. Appointed as special prosecutor in the Floyd murder case last May, Ellison proceeded to press more serious charges against Chauvin and his three colleagues than the originally put forth by the county attorney. Ellison, who is nearing the end of his second year in charge as the state's top prosecutor, was previously the first Muslim person to win a statewide election in the US. He served in the US House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019. He was the first Muslim to be elected to Congress. A progressive politician with ties to prominent Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Ilhan Omar, Ellison has drawn controversy in the past for his apparent affiliation with the Nation of Islam political group. The OJ Simpson murder trial was one of the most watched TV trials in the world. Trial by television is rare in the US and controversial in many countries. But when high profile cases have been televised in the US, the American public has followed along from the living room in trials of figures like OJ Simpson and Casey Anthony. Sometimes they watch out of genuine interest. Sometimes they watch for pure entertainment value. Legal observers have expressed concern that cameras in court can deter or unsettle victims, witnesses and even jurors. Thomas Mesereau, a former lawyer for Michael Jackson,told the BBC in 2014 that ""it's a case by case decision"". Jackson faced allegations of child sexual abuse but his trial was never televised. ""Sometimes you want to tone down the publicity,"" explained Mesereau. ""Cameras in the courtroom would make it even crazier."" However, Judge Cahill, who is presiding over the Chauvin trial, said camera access was ""the only reasonable and meaningful method"" to balance the right to a fair trial with the right of public access. Meanwhile, last year, the UK parliament ruled thatlive cameras would be  allowed in Crown Courts in England and Wales for the first time. Jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin will be difficult, but will be the critical element of the case, says Derrick Johnson, the CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). ""How well prepared the attorneys are in selecting individuals who will 
serve on a jury will absolutely determine the outcome of the case,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played George Floyd: 'Jury selection key to trial result' The jury requires 12 people and 4 alternatives. So far, all but two potential jurors have been dismissed. Juror number nine, a woman who has said she is eager to hear all the evidence in the trial and answered questions regarding her impartiality from both the defence and the prosecution, has become the second juror to be selected. A total of six potential jurors have been heard from so far today. The potential juror being interviewed is asked about her views on Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter - two loosely defined and opposing movements supporting black Americans allegedly harmed by authorities and police shamed by protesters, respectively. The woman is unimpressed with both, and indeed the movements are not without controversy. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has explored the journey of 'Black Lives Matter' -the social media post that became a global slogan. Jury trials in the UK are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances. In the US a pool of eligible citizens is called to appear and be questioned by both sides. The prosecution and defence can both ask a judge dismiss a potential juror ""for cause"" if they perceive bias. Once they're selected, the chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences. Read more about the jury selection process here. The potential juror who, before the lunch break, described himself as a Christian and voiced concerns over security, has been dismissed, and the next person called in. Potential juror nine has been sworn in. She acknowledges that she has some familiarity with the case, but has said that she would only incorporate information from the trial into any judgment should she be selected. A courtroom sketch from the trial over the beating of Rodney King The death of George Floyd at the hands of police was filmed by bystanders and sparked protests across the US, and around the globe. Some three decades ago, in Los Angeles, another black man suffered a beating with eerie parallels. Four police officers, three of whom were white, beat up motorist Rodney King after a car chase. Footage of the incident formed the centerpiece of a trial, but all four officers were acquitted, sparking violent riots in a community that felt there had been no sense of accountability. Now, as a different US city in a different decade awaits the verdict of an emotionally charged trial,here's a look back at the influential King trial, thanks to newly released sketches. The jury selection has resumed after a lunch break, with questioning continuing for the next potential juror. Millions of Americans protested in the days and weeks after Floyd was killed. But nine months on, the reforms they demanded have largely not materialised. The loudest cries were calls to defund the police and shift money toward social services. In December, the Minneapolis City Council redirected $8 million of the city's budget from the police department to mental health, violence prevention and other programmes. Then, last month, after some 200 officers resigned and with crime  sharply rising, the council voted unanimously to spend more than $6 million and recruit more police. On a national level, a law named for Floyd that would ban controversial police tactics faces an unlikely path forward in Congress. Â© 2025 BBC.

The corner was renamed George Perry Floyd Jr Place by city officials after a makeshift memorial was set up there following his death. Local activists took to Twitter yesterday to ask people to keep away from the area, known locally as George Floyd Square, as they grieve the man's death. Barricades are now up, which activists say are to keep police officers out of their ""autonomous zone"". Some residents oppose the zone, amid claims that crimes such as carjacking have risen. According toMinnesota Public Radio,external, some neighbours are concerned that criminals have hidden in the zone to avoid being caught during police chases. The memorial includes the names of others who died in police encounters Heading up the case against former officer Derek Chauvin is Minnesota's attorney general Keith Ellison. Appointed as special prosecutor in the Floyd murder case last May, Ellison proceeded to press more serious charges against Chauvin and his three colleagues than the originally put forth by the county attorney. Ellison, who is nearing the end of his second year in charge as the state's top prosecutor, was previously the first Muslim person to win a statewide election in the US. He served in the US House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019. He was the first Muslim to be elected to Congress. A progressive politician with ties to prominent Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Ilhan Omar, Ellison has drawn controversy in the past for his apparent affiliation with the Nation of Islam political group. The OJ Simpson murder trial was one of the most watched TV trials in the world. Trial by television is rare in the US and controversial in many countries. But when high profile cases have been televised in the US, the American public has followed along from the living room in trials of figures like OJ Simpson and Casey Anthony. Sometimes they watch out of genuine interest. Sometimes they watch for pure entertainment value. Legal observers have expressed concern that cameras in court can deter or unsettle victims, witnesses and even jurors. Thomas Mesereau, a former lawyer for Michael Jackson,told the BBC in 2014 that ""it's a case by case decision"". Jackson faced allegations of child sexual abuse but his trial was never televised. ""Sometimes you want to tone down the publicity,"" explained Mesereau. ""Cameras in the courtroom would make it even crazier."" However, Judge Cahill, who is presiding over the Chauvin trial, said camera access was ""the only reasonable and meaningful method"" to balance the right to a fair trial with the right of public access. Meanwhile, last year, the UK parliament ruled thatlive cameras would be  allowed in Crown Courts in England and Wales for the first time. Jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin will be difficult, but will be the critical element of the case, says Derrick Johnson, the CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). ""How well prepared the attorneys are in selecting individuals who will 
serve on a jury will absolutely determine the outcome of the case,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played George Floyd: 'Jury selection key to trial result' The jury requires 12 people and 4 alternatives. So far, all but two potential jurors have been dismissed. Juror number nine, a woman who has said she is eager to hear all the evidence in the trial and answered questions regarding her impartiality from both the defence and the prosecution, has become the second juror to be selected. A total of six potential jurors have been heard from so far today. The potential juror being interviewed is asked about her views on Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter - two loosely defined and opposing movements supporting black Americans allegedly harmed by authorities and police shamed by protesters, respectively. The woman is unimpressed with both, and indeed the movements are not without controversy. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has explored the journey of 'Black Lives Matter' -the social media post that became a global slogan. Jury trials in the UK are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances. In the US a pool of eligible citizens is called to appear and be questioned by both sides. The prosecution and defence can both ask a judge dismiss a potential juror ""for cause"" if they perceive bias. Once they're selected, the chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences. Read more about the jury selection process here. The potential juror who, before the lunch break, described himself as a Christian and voiced concerns over security, has been dismissed, and the next person called in. Potential juror nine has been sworn in. She acknowledges that she has some familiarity with the case, but has said that she would only incorporate information from the trial into any judgment should she be selected. A courtroom sketch from the trial over the beating of Rodney King The death of George Floyd at the hands of police was filmed by bystanders and sparked protests across the US, and around the globe. Some three decades ago, in Los Angeles, another black man suffered a beating with eerie parallels. Four police officers, three of whom were white, beat up motorist Rodney King after a car chase. Footage of the incident formed the centerpiece of a trial, but all four officers were acquitted, sparking violent riots in a community that felt there had been no sense of accountability. Now, as a different US city in a different decade awaits the verdict of an emotionally charged trial,here's a look back at the influential King trial, thanks to newly released sketches. The jury selection has resumed after a lunch break, with questioning continuing for the next potential juror. Millions of Americans protested in the days and weeks after Floyd was killed. But nine months on, the reforms they demanded have largely not materialised. The loudest cries were calls to defund the police and shift money toward social services. In December, the Minneapolis City Council redirected $8 million of the city's budget from the police department to mental health, violence prevention and other programmes. Then, last month, after some 200 officers resigned and with crime  sharply rising, the council voted unanimously to spend more than $6 million and recruit more police. On a national level, a law named for Floyd that would ban controversial police tactics faces an unlikely path forward in Congress. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hannah, Rob and Cathryn are celebrating an extraordinary find ""We're still pinching ourselves - to believe that this actually happened on our drive!"" Rob Wilcock, his wife Cathryn and daughter Hannah are astounded to find themselves at the centre of a major scientific discovery. It was their property in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, that was hit by the most valuable space rock ever to fall on the UK. The meteorite has had British scientists in raptures of joy. It's a carbonaceous chondrite - a dark stony material that retains unaltered chemistry from the formation of our Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, and, as such, could give us fresh insights on how the planets came into being. The first thing the Wilcock family knew about it was when they heard a dull thud outside their house on the night of Sunday 28 February. Winchcombe meteorite is first UK find in 30 years Meteorites may be just north of Cheltenham Martian meteorite to head home to Red Planet Antarctic meteorites yield global bombardment rate ""When I heard it drop, I stood up and looked out the window to see what was there,"" recalled Hannah. ""But because it was dark I couldn't see anything. ""It was only the next morning when we went out that we saw it on the drive - a bit like a kind of splatter. And in all honesty, my original thought was - has someone been driving around the Cotswolds lobbing lumps of coal into people's gardens?"" she told BBC News. ""Either that or someone had upturned a barbecue tray,"" chimed in Cathryn. Scientists knew fragments of a meteorite must be in the Gloucestershire area. Their cameras had recorded the rock coming through the atmosphere that Sunday night, creating a huge fireball in the process. This video can not be played ""It blows your mind"": The people of Winchcombe react to the meteorite discovery Imagery from multiple angles allowed researchers to narrow the drop zone, and when they went on the media to make an appeal on the Monday, they hoped one or two people might come forward with an interesting find. In fact, they were inundated with pictures. Most had nothing to do with meteorites, but when Open University planetary scientist Richard Greenwood looked at the Wilcocks' picture, he was blown away. ""It was one of those moments when your legs start going wobbly. I saw this thing; it was like a splat across [the Wilcocks'] drive; and it had all these rays coming off it; and I just thought - that is a meteorite. It was instantaneous,"" he said. With all the hullabaloo that was bound to follow the discovery, Rob's initial reaction was to try to stay out of the limelight - to be anonymous. But when he thought it through a little more, Rob said the three of them recognised they should talk about what had happened to them. ""We've been wrestling with the question of whether we should talk about it, and in the end we decided we should. There seems to be such a lot of genuine public interest in the find,"" Rob told BBC News. This video can not be played Thousands of people reported seeing the fireball ""We're absolutely thrilled that something that's going to be so valuable to science, to the human understanding of the world and of the Solar System has happened, and that we can be a small part in it."" The family have donated the meteorite remains to the national collection held by the Natural History Museum in London. They were determined the rock should not go to a dealer, but to science. The last meteorite observed to fall on the UK and then picked up was 30 years ago. That was an ""ordinary chondrite"" - a common type of space rock. The Winchcombe meteorite is far more valuable. Studying its chemistry - and what it can tell us about the conditions that went into building the planets - will keep scientists busy for years. As for the small Gloucestershire market town - it's now firmly on the map. ""We always felt that the Cotswolds is a wonderful place to live. But now the whole world seems to know about us,"" reflected one local resident on Tuesday afternoon.

"The government should hold annual planning exercises to prepare for future pandemics, Labour's shadow health secretary has said. Jonathan Ashworth said ""germ games"", modelled on yearly military drills, could help prepare the UK for an ""era of pandemics"". He said an independent body should audit the plans, as is done with annual spending. The government said its proposals would ""supercharge"" planning for the future. In a speech to the IPPR think tank, Mr Ashworth said ministers had been ""unprepared, complacent and inept"" when dealing with the Covid crisis. He added that academic discussions about the threat posed by new diseases had ""rarely surfaced in Westminster"" and ""that has to change"". Health Secretary axes public health body A pandemic is here. What else should we be worried about? Starmer targets savers in 'national recovery plan' Mr Ashworth also criticised the Conservatives' record on public health spending since 2010, arguing it had led to a worse death toll in the UK. ""Years of cuts to public services and austerity left our health and care services lacking the capacity needed when disaster struck,"" he said. ""Covid hit a population with millions of people in poor health, in poor housing and with job and income insecurity,"" he added. ""A healthier, more equal society would have weathered the storms better."" Warning that climate change and globalisation had increased the pandemic threat, he said the UK needed to dramatically improve its disease planning. He said preparation done by the new National Institute for Health Protection, which isreplacing Public Health England, should face independent scrutiny. And he called for a new agency to conduct this - similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which vets the government's annual spending plans. ""Governments rightly invest in defence planning and 'war games'. Practising for pandemics should be no different,"" he said. ""Ministers should 'germ game' on an annual basis, to prepare themselves and the country for the next pandemic or infectious outbreak. ""Never again should we have ministers ignoring the science and learning on the job."" The government has been criticised for failing to adequately stockpile protective equipment The government says it regularly plans for new infectious diseases and seeks to learn the lessons of previous outbreaks. Since it was first published in 2008, itsNational Risk Register,externalhas identified a pandemic as the most serious threat facing the country. But its planning has faced criticism from Phillip Lee, who was a Conservative minister during a 2016 simulation of an influenza pandemic in England. Mr Lee, who went on to become a Lib Dem MP, said last April that the three-day operation, known as ""Exercise Cygnus"", had revealed weaknesses in areas such as testing capacity and buying protective equipment. He said a failure to learn lessons from that exercise had led to ""panic decisions"" - and it had been a ""mistake"" not to publish the findings. Responding to Mr Ashworth's speech, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said Covid had ""challenged health systems around the world"". ""Our response has always been informed by the latest advice from our scientists and, we have taken swift action when new evidence has emerged,"" they said. The added that the government had now established the ""largest diagnostics network in UK history"" and the NHS's ""biggest-ever mass vaccination campaign"". Meanwhile ""almost half"" the data sent to the World Health Organization to map the evolution of the coronavirus had come from the UK, they added. ""We are already looking to our future preparedness, and through the new National Institute for Health Protection we will supercharge our response to health threats, both now and in the future.""

"Unilever will drop the word ""normal"" from its beauty products and ban excessive editing of models' photos in a push for inclusivity. Dove's owner said the editing ban would apply to ""body shape, size, proportion and skin colour"" and ""normal"" would be removed from 200 products. Its boss said it wanted to create a ""more inclusive definition of beauty"". The firm has previously faced allegations that it promoted stereotypes around dark skin tones. The London-based firm, which also owns the Simple and Sure beauty brands, is set to make the changes over the next year. The ban on editing will include photos taken of models as well as social media influencers. On the change to its marketing strategy, the firm's president of beauty and personal care products, Sunny Jain, said: ""We know that removing 'normal' from our products and packaging will not fix the problem alone, but it is an important step forward."" Marmite maker Unilever to insist suppliers pay 'living wage' Unilever to cut fossil fuels from cleaning brands Unilever renames Fair & Lovely skin cream after backlash The word ""normal"" is typically used on shampoos, conditioners and face products, such as for ""normal or oily skin"". But Roshida Khanom of market research firm Mintel said: ""'Normal' is such a loaded term because it indicates that there is an 'abnormal' and it doesn't actually describe anything, so it's about time that the term is dropped."" ""Young people in particular are shifting the conversation - the traditional notions of beauty no longer hold up for Generation Z, who see beauty as accepting and owning your imperfections,"" she said. Instead of the word ""normal"", Unilever will use different descriptors for customers looking for particular qualities in their beauty products. Shampoo for ""normal to dry"" hair, for example, will soon be labelled for ""dry and damaged"" hair. Unilever said on Tuesday it would also take a number of other steps in an attempt to promote ""a new era of beauty that's inclusive, equitable and sustainable"". It committed to increase the number of adverts portraying people from under-represented groups and use more natural and biodegradable ingredients across its range of products. Mr Jain added that consumers were increasingly ""rewarding brands"" that take action on environmental and social issues. He said the personal beauty campaign would make Unilever a ""more successful business"". The FTSE 100 firm has, however, faced criticism in the past over its advertisements and allegations that some products promote negative stereotypes around dark skin tones. Unilever renamed the ""Fair and Lovely"" brand after the Black Lives Matter movement spurred firms to reassess their marketing. Last year, it rebranded a skin-lightening creamsold across Asia from ""Fair and Lovely"" to ""Glow and Lovely"", but it still continues to be sold despite petitions calling on the firm to halt production. ""The product has never been and is not a skin bleaching cream,"" Unilever says on its website. The firm also apologisedafter it ran a Facebook advertising campaign in 2017 for Dove body lotion, which showed a series of three images, showing a black woman peeling off her T-shirt to reveal a white woman underneath her skin. The third image shows the white woman undressing to reveal an Asian woman. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The world's consumer base is becoming increasingly aware of social issues, and the threat of boycotts and backlashes means giants like Unilever are right to try and avoid PR headaches."" Such fallouts can have negative consequences such as hitting sales or damaging the brand, she said. But she pointed out that given Unilever's enormous scale, with some 400 brands, ""a tweak like this is unlikely to move the dial at the operating level"". ""What it does show, is a heightened awareness of the issues that matter to consumers, and a proactive approach suggests management has its eye on the ball,"" she added. The firm has since taken a number of other measures to address social issues. In January, Unilever said it would launch the Crown Fund UK, an initiative aimed at stopping discrimination around black hairstyles, while ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's has voiced support for the Black Lives Matter protests.

"The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles Crisis meetings involving senior royals have taken place following the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said Buckingham Palace ""will not want to feel rushed into saying something"" about Prince Harry and Meghan's claims. The couple spoke to Oprah about racism, mental health, the media and other members of the Royal Family. Prince Charles did not speak about the interview during a visit in London. An average of 11.1m people in the UK watched the interview on Monday night. In it, the duchess - who is the first mixed-race member of the modern Royal Family - said a low point came when Harry was asked by an unnamed royal family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Prince Harry later clarified to Oprah that the comments werenot made by either the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Why is Archie not a prince? Piers Morgan's comments about Meghan criticised 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden's spokeswoman said he would praise anyone for having the courage to speak out about mental health. White House press secretary Jen Psaki described Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, as ""private citizens"" who were ""sharing their own story in their own struggles"". Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton also backed Meghan, saying: ""This young woman was not about to keep her head down, you know, this is 2021."" Prince Charles did not respond to questions about the interview during a visit to a vaccine centre in north London The two-hour interview was screened on ITV on Monday night attracting 12.4m viewers at its peak - the broadcaster's biggest audience since the 2019 Rugby World Cup final - while it was viewed by an average of 17.1m in the US the previous day. In the interview, the duchess said that she found royal lifeso difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"", and when she approached the institution for help, she did not get it. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Meghan's allegations about racism and a lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". No 10 said Prime Minister Boris Johnson watched the interview on Monday night, but declined to comment further. It followed Mr Johnson's comments earlier on Monday, when he said he had ""always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role she plays"". He said ""when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing"", after being asked specifically if he believed the Royal Family was racist. Meanwhile, a YouGov opinion poll of 4,656 people conducted after the interview aired in the UK suggested: The public was equally split 32% by 32% on whether Prince Harry and Meghan were treated fairly or unfairly by the Royal Family - while 36% said they did not know Among over-65s, 50% thought the couple were treated fairly, compared with just 13% of 18 to 24-year-olds There was little to no change in people's opinions when compared with an identical poll carried out last week Prince Harry and Meghan have released a new image of them with their son Archie, who was born in 2019 During the interview, the duchess was asked why she thought the Royal Family did not make Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The couple's children do not automatically become princes or princesses due to a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" Prince Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. Analysis: Harry and Meghan rattle monarchy's gilded cage Meghan and Diana: Press coverage of two princesses 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' Prince Harry said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan about the ""colonial undertones"" of news headlines and articles. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" he said. The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. In footage not included in the original interview, Prince Harrysaid racism from the tabloid pressthat filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why he and his wife left the UK. The Society of Editors said it was ""not acceptable"" to claim sections of the press were bigoted ""without providing any supporting evidence"". Labour MP Diane Abbott said she could cite ""story after story when Meghan was treated quite differently from white members of the Royal Family"". Ms Abbott described the impact of coverage she has received as ""hurtful"", adding: ""It's corrosive and in the end, it makes you doubt yourself."" In other key revelations from the Oprah interview: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Prince Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But the prince said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month In further comments, Meghan told Oprah she felt betrayed by her father Thomas Markle's conduct in the run up to her 2018 wedding with Prince Harry. Mr Markle told ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday that the interview was the first time he had heard his daughter speak for several years. ""I'm very disappointed about it. I've apologised about this thing, what happened, at least 100 times or so,"" he said. This video can not be played Society of Editors executive director defends newspaper coverage of Meghan He described the interview as ""over the top"" and ill-timed, but said he did not believe the Royal Family was racist and that the comments about Archie's skin colour may have simply been a ""dumb question"". Asked about Meghan's claim she had ""lost"" her father, Mr Markle said: ""I'm available any time we can get together. I'd love to get together. I'd certainly like to see my grandson.""

"UK supermarkets have warned of a shortage of some dog and cat food products following an ""unprecedented"" rise in pet ownership during lockdown. Sainsbury's has apologised after running out of dog and cat food pouches due to a ""national shortage"", although tinned and dry food are unaffected. Morrisons said it might not have ""full availability for several months"", but said it had enough stock for customers. Waitrose is also running low, while Tesco has seen strong demand. Sainsbury's said it was trying to resolve the issue but warned it would be ""ongoing"" in 2021. It is blaming higher than usual demand for pouches after more pets were bought during lockdown. Pets prove 'a lifesaver' for lockdown loneliness Morrisons also said that there had been ""an unprecedented rise in pet ownership across the UK"" and it was seeing an ""increase in demand"". A spokesperson for Morrisons said: ""We're working closely with our suppliers who are investing in increasing their capacity and we may not have full availability for several months."" But the supermarket added that there was no need for people to start panic-buying pet food. ""We do have enough stock to support all our customers and their new pets and so there is no need for people to buy more than they need."" Tesco is believed to be working closely with suppliers to meet the needs of customers' pets, while Waitrose hopes to have its full range of pouches back on the shelves ""as soon as possible"". Helen Warren-Piper, general manager of Mars Petcare UK, which makes Pedigree and Whiskas, said: ""We recognise retailers are experiencing unusual demand for pet food during lockdown. ""We have made significant investment into our manufacturing network - including investment in our UK Melton pet food plant."" Pet food maker Purina said the UK market had ""changed significantly"" during the pandemic. ""We are experiencing unprecedented demand for our products, including cat food pouches where we have seen sales growth for our Felix and Gourmet brands at almost three times that of the market,"" it said. ""We have been working hard to meet this additional demand and are producing more pet food - including pouches - than ever before."" However, it added that consumers might find that  some of its products ""are not consistently available in their normal place of purchase"". Jonathan Josephs, business reporter, BBC News Millions more of us have got used to cats, dogs and other pets yelping for food. Even before another surge during November's second lockdown more than two million Britons had taken on new pets. That should have been good news for the profits of pet food manufacturers but it's an industry that was already manufacturing at close to capacity. It's not just the UK where demand for pet food is simply outstripping supply, but across Europe too; shortages are the inevitable results. Some owners have taken to feeding their animals other products, and that may have to be a growing trend. There are also bigger global issues at play, with concerns that increased demand for wheat and grain in China could cause shortages of some ingredients in the supply chain. One industry source said there has also been ""more of a crunch because of Brexit"" and the disruption that's caused with hauliers paperwork at UK borders. Despite the financial constraints many people are facing the pet-care industry is regarded as recession-proof.  It can take a lot of time and money to increase factory capacity but pet-food makers might have to do just that because after all; a dog is for life, not just for lockdown. Pet owners reacted with humour and dismay on Twitter. Some said Sainsbury's should have provided more information about the shortage when it emailed its customers about the issue. The journalist Owen Jones said his cat was less than impressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There has been a well documented rise in pet ownership during the pandemic, with retail chain Pets at Home reporting strong sales and profits last year. In November, it said that animals had been a ""lifesaver"" during lockdown, helping people through a period of ""social loneliness"". The firm not only saw stronger demand for pets, but also related services such as its Vets at Home business. Shoppers panic bought pet food during the first national lockdown in 2020 but there have been no reports of similar trends since then.

"The auctioneers say Oasis fans could whip up a ""bidding frenzy"" An Oasis gig contract requesting ""sober-speaking"" helpers and ""quality lager"" for the band and crew during a 1994 performance is to be auctioned. The paperwork is expected to sell for up to Â£1,500 at Hansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire later this month. The contract was drawn up ahead of an early Gallagher brothers show at The Old Trout venue in Windsor, Berkshire. A music memorabilia specialist at Hansons said items like this were ""extremely rare"". The performance in 1994 took place three months before Oasis released their debut album Definitely Maybe A two-course meal, water, fruit juice and soft drinks are also among the catering requests that feature in the Primary Talent International contract. Hansons said the seller is a woman who worked in the music industry who bought it directly from a man who organised gigs at The Old Trout at the time. She is looking to sell the contract, along with a flyer advertising the gig, ahead of retirement. The Oasis contract is listed for sale in the music memorabilia auction Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Claire Howell, music memorabilia specialist at Hansons, said: ""Items like this are extremely rare and this lot comes with great provenance. ""It's valued at Â£1,000-Â£1,500 but I wouldn't be surprised to see it sell for more. ""It could easily whip up a bidding frenzy among fans at auction, such is the enduring popularity and nostalgia for Oasis."" A music memorabilia specialist at Hansons said items like this were ""extremely rare"" The performance, in May 1994, took place three months before Oasis released their debut album Definitely Maybe. They went on to become one of the UK's most iconic bands before splitting in 2009. The contract is listed for sale in the music memorabilia auction on 23 March.

"Imagine if, at the first coronavirus briefing in Downing Street last year, Boris Johnson had said that he would put limits on our lives and the economy for 15 months. Imagine that he had, a week later, instead of saying that the tide could be turned in 12 weeks, said we should prepare for kids to be out of school, that most shops would be closed on and off for months, that families who don't live near each other might not be able to see each other either, that some of the most vulnerable would have to shield at home, from the disease, for all of that time. You would hardly have believed it. He would hardly have believed it either. The prime minister's trademark used to be optimism - accused often of bluffing over detail to hope for the political best. Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in April What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? How risky is the route out of lockdown? Yet as Mr Johnson tries to steer the country towards the exit in the second year of this pandemic, that habit is not much in evidence. He has accepted, at the insistence of the chief medical officer, there will be long gaps between the steps out of lockdown. Also, despite the remarkable progress, and excited rhetoric around the vaccine, there was an important acknowledgement from Mr Johnson too, that it will never reach everyone. The ""significant minority"" who will never take the vaccine will still therefore pose a risk. And while he has repeatedly promised the steps out of lockdown will be ""irreversible"", inside government of course there is an awareness that is just not the case. Everyone fervently hopes this is the last time but an aggressive and unforeseen variant of the disease could interrupt that plan. Some massive upset with the vaccine rollout could knock things off course. Even the limited easing up will lead to an increase in cases, and if that is more dramatic than hoped, the brakes could of course go back on. Dramatic changes in the public's behaviour could also make a difference in the wrong way. And the government also retains the right to bring back aggressive local lockdowns if infections surge in particular areas. But Mr Johnson's strongest motivation for the go-slow is the determination that this national lockdown can, should, and will be the last. With a belief too that much of the public will be perhaps not content, but willing, to wait that bit longer for a drink with friends if it means children can go back to school and stay there. All schools in England are going back from 8 March with schools able to decide a phased return during that week. His calculation is that people, after all this time, will prefer certainty over haste. That's why the prime minister won't be persuaded to go faster by some of his own restless backbenches. That's why other parts of government, even those eager to pull back restrictions, worried about the costs of all this, concede to hurry would be wrong this time. And that's why Mr Johnson, right now at least, is playing the role of a leader for whom caution is number one. A mantle this long pandemic has lent him - a political persona that also, would have been almost impossible to imagine last year. P.s. A huge amount of information did emerge today about the road ahead for England, but there were also really big gaps. There was no firm advice on when the millions of people who have been working at home will be expected to go back into the office. No solid expectations of when foreign travel will come back, when the social distancing rules could be relaxed, or whether the government might really introduce some kind of vaccine certification after all (despite previous suggestions that they would not). Alongside the plans are several reviews that will shape much of what happens in the next few months. The government, as well as Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff, still has many big decisions to take.

"This video can not be played Lakshmy Pengelly: ""It felt like we we were drowning"" A care home owner says she is trying to keep her ""head above water"" after a significant fall in occupancy levels during the pandemic. Data obtained byBBC Wales Livehas found in parts of Wales the number of care home residents has dropped by more than 20% compared with February 2020. Lakshmy Pengelly, who owns a home in Llanelli, said she was relying on savings which were ""running out"". The Welsh Government said a fund would be in place for another six months. Care Forum Wales, which represents care home owners, has warned ""the whole infrastructure of social care in Wales""could be under threat without financial support. Overall - based on data from 15 of Wales' 22 councils - the number of occupied places in adult care homes has fallen by 13% from 15,190 to 13,188. Care homes 'could close' without funding guarantee How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Covid jab 'set for even faster delivery rate' The biggest declines were seen in Blaenau Gwent (26%), Newport (21%), Bridgend (21%) and Rhondda Cynon Taf (21%). The data covers all residential care and nursing homes for adults and the elderly. Mrs Pengelly, who owns Ashley Court care home, said they managed to stay virus-free until the week before Christmas, just before residents and staff were due to receive the Covid vaccine. More than 14,300 (95%) care home residents have received their first Covid jab in Wales A total of 24 residents caught the virus and seven died with it and Mrs Pengelly said it was ""such a tough time"" for residents, their families and staff - and added she was now concerned about the home's future. ""We've been fortunate enough to be a home that's always full, the lowest we've ever dropped to is about 80% occupancy,"" she said. ""Normally throughout the year we maintain 95% status. This year we are just below 60%. ""As a business we've always put money aside as a contingency. But that contingency is actually starting to run out. ""We've gone nearly a year now and I think we can't do any longer. I just pray that it's all going to be over soon because, we're just trying to keep our heads above water."" As the vaccine rollout continues, Mrs Pengelly said she hoped demand would return. ""In some terms I think it's a pause button because people will always need care homes,"" she said. ""There is a loss of confidence at the moment in putting families in care homes because of the way Covid spread through care homes. This video can not be played ""We can't see mum unless she has hours to live"" ""But there's also the fact that people are off work so maybe they're able to take care of their parents or grandparents. ""But then once society goes back to normal and everybody is back in work they're going to have to start relying on the care homes again."" Cathy Gale, whose mother Jean is a resident at Cartref Residential Care Home in Cardiff, said the family would have ""really struggled"" if her mother was not in a home during lockdown. Ms Gale said her mother was unable to live alone due to memory loss and decreasing mobility and it was her decision to move into the home. Jean Gale's family said her mother's care home keeping things ""normal"" had made them grateful ""My mam has always been a really independent person and it was her decision she asked us to find somewhere close to me where she can live and we really haven't looked back,"" she said. ""She has got that bit of independence and she is a very sociable person so not being able to go out was really isolating for her. She said that where her mother was now meant ""she has the friends and the carers around her that are like a second family"". She said the home had kept services running relatively normally, offering events for Christmas and the Six Nations.

Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) figures show there have been 34% more care home deaths since March 2020 than in the same time period the year before. Mary Wimbury, from Care Forum Wales, said they had been hit by a ""double whammy of soaring costs and plummeting income"". She said detail from the Welsh Government on the extension of a hardship fund for care homes was needed ""as soon as possible"". ""It's absolutely vital if we're to keep the sector sustainable in any way that the hardship fund continues because we're not going to have seen the end of the pandemic by the end of March,"" she said. ""If average occupancy drops to 85% or even below, the whole of the infrastructure of social care in Wales would be under genuine threat without this vitally important support."" The Welsh Government said it was ""very grateful for the hard work and dedication"" of social care providers in Wales looking after care home residents during the pandemic"".

"Sports coaches and faith leaders who have sexual relationships with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care will be breaking the law undernew legislation planned for England and Wales.,external The move would put them on par with roles like teachers and social workers. Children's charity the NSPCC said it was a ""landmark step"" for the protection of young people. It is among a raft of measures included in a bill which is due to be introduced in Parliament later. Other provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill include: Allowing judges to give Whole Life Orders for the premeditated murder of a child, as well as to 18 to 20-year-olds in exceptional cases such as for acts of terrorism which result in the mass loss of life Life sentences for killer drivers and powers to stop the automatic release halfway through a sentence for serious violent and sexual offenders New court orders to help crack down on knife crime and make it easier for police to stop and search those they suspect of carrying a knife Tougher punishments for the criminal damage of a memorial, with the maximum penalty set to increase from three months to 10 years The government's plans follow prolonged calls from campaigners for the so-called Position of Trust laws to be extended to cover other roles that have responsibility over young people. While the age of consent is 16, it is illegal for those in some professions - such as teachers, social workers and doctors - to have a sexual relationship with 16 or 17-year-olds in their care. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), which campaigned for the law change, said it was ""delighted"" the government had agreed to ""close this legal loophole"". ""This landmark step sends a clear message that children and young people can return to the extracurricular activities they love without being at risk of grooming by the very adults they should look to for support and guidance,"" he added. The new bill, with its long list of proposals, is being described as a justice overhaul aimed at giving better protection to the public and more backing to the police. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the bill was delivering on the government's promise to ""crack down on crime and build safer communities"". He said the bill would give the ""police and courts the powers they need to keep our streets safe, while providing greater opportunities for offenders to turn their lives around and better contribute to society"". The government is also investing ""hundreds of millions to deliver speedier justice and boost support for victims"", he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the bill would help ""stop violent criminals in their tracks, putting the thugs who assault officers behind bars for longer and strengthening the support officers and their families receive"". However, some campaigners have criticised the proposals. Responding to the plans for longer sentences, Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ""There is not a shred of evidence to show that this runaway inflation in punishment reduces crime.""

"This video can not be played Lakshmy Pengelly: ""It felt like we we were drowning"" A care home owner says she is trying to keep her ""head above water"" after a significant fall in occupancy levels during the pandemic. Data obtained byBBC Wales Livehas found in parts of Wales the number of care home residents has dropped by more than 20% compared with February 2020. Lakshmy Pengelly, who owns a home in Llanelli, said she was relying on savings which were ""running out"". The Welsh Government said a fund would be in place for another six months. Care Forum Wales, which represents care home owners, has warned ""the whole infrastructure of social care in Wales""could be under threat without financial support. Overall - based on data from 15 of Wales' 22 councils - the number of occupied places in adult care homes has fallen by 13% from 15,190 to 13,188. Care homes 'could close' without funding guarantee How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Covid jab 'set for even faster delivery rate' The biggest declines were seen in Blaenau Gwent (26%), Newport (21%), Bridgend (21%) and Rhondda Cynon Taf (21%). The data covers all residential care and nursing homes for adults and the elderly. Mrs Pengelly, who owns Ashley Court care home, said they managed to stay virus-free until the week before Christmas, just before residents and staff were due to receive the Covid vaccine. More than 14,300 (95%) care home residents have received their first Covid jab in Wales A total of 24 residents caught the virus and seven died with it and Mrs Pengelly said it was ""such a tough time"" for residents, their families and staff - and added she was now concerned about the home's future. ""We've been fortunate enough to be a home that's always full, the lowest we've ever dropped to is about 80% occupancy,"" she said. ""Normally throughout the year we maintain 95% status. This year we are just below 60%. ""As a business we've always put money aside as a contingency. But that contingency is actually starting to run out. ""We've gone nearly a year now and I think we can't do any longer. I just pray that it's all going to be over soon because, we're just trying to keep our heads above water."" As the vaccine rollout continues, Mrs Pengelly said she hoped demand would return. ""In some terms I think it's a pause button because people will always need care homes,"" she said. ""There is a loss of confidence at the moment in putting families in care homes because of the way Covid spread through care homes. This video can not be played ""We can't see mum unless she has hours to live"" ""But there's also the fact that people are off work so maybe they're able to take care of their parents or grandparents. ""But then once society goes back to normal and everybody is back in work they're going to have to start relying on the care homes again."" Cathy Gale, whose mother Jean is a resident at Cartref Residential Care Home in Cardiff, said the family would have ""really struggled"" if her mother was not in a home during lockdown. Ms Gale said her mother was unable to live alone due to memory loss and decreasing mobility and it was her decision to move into the home. Jean Gale's family said her mother's care home keeping things ""normal"" had made them grateful ""My mam has always been a really independent person and it was her decision she asked us to find somewhere close to me where she can live and we really haven't looked back,"" she said. ""She has got that bit of independence and she is a very sociable person so not being able to go out was really isolating for her. She said that where her mother was now meant ""she has the friends and the carers around her that are like a second family"". She said the home had kept services running relatively normally, offering events for Christmas and the Six Nations. There have been a total of1,604 Covid-19 deaths in care homesup to 18 February, making up 21.7% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Does Wales have a roadmap out of lockdown? What are Wales' lockdown rules? Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) figures show there have been 34% more care home deaths since March 2020 than in the same time period the year before. Mary Wimbury, from Care Forum Wales, said they had been hit by a ""double whammy of soaring costs and plummeting income"". She said detail from the Welsh Government on the extension of a hardship fund for care homes was needed ""as soon as possible"". ""It's absolutely vital if we're to keep the sector sustainable in any way that the hardship fund continues because we're not going to have seen the end of the pandemic by the end of March,"" she said.

"UK supermarkets have warned of a shortage of some dog and cat food products following an ""unprecedented"" rise in pet ownership during lockdown. Sainsbury's has apologised after running out of dog and cat food pouches due to a ""national shortage"", although tinned and dry food are unaffected. Morrisons said it might not have ""full availability for several months"", but said it had enough stock for customers. Waitrose is also running low, while Tesco has seen strong demand. Sainsbury's said it was trying to resolve the issue but warned it would be ""ongoing"" in 2021. It is blaming higher than usual demand for pouches after more pets were bought during lockdown. Pets prove 'a lifesaver' for lockdown loneliness Morrisons also said that there had been ""an unprecedented rise in pet ownership across the UK"" and it was seeing an ""increase in demand"". A spokesperson for Morrisons said: ""We're working closely with our suppliers who are investing in increasing their capacity and we may not have full availability for several months."" But the supermarket added that there was no need for people to start panic-buying pet food. ""We do have enough stock to support all our customers and their new pets and so there is no need for people to buy more than they need."" Tesco is believed to be working closely with suppliers to meet the needs of customers' pets, while Waitrose hopes to have its full range of pouches back on the shelves ""as soon as possible"". Helen Warren-Piper, general manager of Mars Petcare UK, which makes Pedigree and Whiskas, said: ""We recognise retailers are experiencing unusual demand for pet food during lockdown. ""We have made significant investment into our manufacturing network - including investment in our UK Melton pet food plant."" Pet food maker Purina said the UK market had ""changed significantly"" during the pandemic. ""We are experiencing unprecedented demand for our products, including cat food pouches where we have seen sales growth for our Felix and Gourmet brands at almost three times that of the market,"" it said. ""We have been working hard to meet this additional demand and are producing more pet food - including pouches - than ever before."" However, it added that consumers might find that  some of its products ""are not consistently available in their normal place of purchase"". Jonathan Josephs, business reporter, BBC News Millions more of us have got used to cats, dogs and other pets yelping for food. Even before another surge during November's second lockdown more than two million Britons had taken on new pets. That should have been good news for the profits of pet food manufacturers but it's an industry that was already manufacturing at close to capacity. It's not just the UK where demand for pet food is simply outstripping supply, but across Europe too; shortages are the inevitable results. Some owners have taken to feeding their animals other products, and that may have to be a growing trend. There are also bigger global issues at play, with concerns that increased demand for wheat and grain in China could cause shortages of some ingredients in the supply chain. One industry source said there has also been ""more of a crunch because of Brexit"" and the disruption that's caused with hauliers paperwork at UK borders. Despite the financial constraints many people are facing the pet-care industry is regarded as recession-proof.  It can take a lot of time and money to increase factory capacity but pet-food makers might have to do just that because after all; a dog is for life, not just for lockdown. Pet owners reacted with humour and dismay on Twitter. Some said Sainsbury's should have provided more information about the shortage when it emailed its customers about the issue. The journalist Owen Jones said his cat was less than impressed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There has been a well documented rise in pet ownership during the pandemic, with retail chain Pets at Home reporting strong sales and profits last year. In November, it said that animals had been a ""lifesaver"" during lockdown, helping people through a period of ""social loneliness"". The firm not only saw stronger demand for pets, but also related services such as its Vets at Home business. Shoppers panic bought pet food during the first national lockdown in 2020 but there have been no reports of similar trends since then.

"Google is failing to do enough to combat fake reviews within its business listings, and must be held to account by a UK watchdog, according to Which? The consumer group set up a fake company and bought bogus five-star reviews as part of an investigation. In doing so, it was able to tie its sham ""customers"" to dozens of other highly-rated British firms, including a dentist and a stockbroker. Google says it has ""significantly"" invested in tech to tackle the issue. But it and other review sites are in the sightlines of the Competition and Markets Authority,which began examining the sector last year.It has threatened enforcement action against platforms which have fallen short of their responsibilities. Previous research from Which? suggests that nearly half of people who check online reviews of local businesses read them on Google. 'Why I write fake online reviews' Fake Amazon reviews 'being sold in bulk' online Trustpilot wiped 2.2 million bogus reviews Which? conducted its research by essentially setting up a ""sting"" operation to catch unscrupulous operators in the act. It created a fake business listing which it called ""five-star reviews"", and searched online for companies advertising paid-for Google reviews. It then spent $150 (Â£108) on their services. Which? told each company it wanted five-star reviews only, and between three and five of them a day - and the consumer group's researchers wrote the reviews themselves, ""praising how good the made-up business and its fake owner Catherine are"". The fake reviews appeared over the following week, a few at a time. But in investigating the ""reviewers"" behind them, the Which? team found, among others: 15 reviewers who had rated both an Edinburgh search engine optimisation business and a London psychic as five stars, which it called ""an unlikely coincidence"" A stockbroker in Canary Wharf who, having had several bad reviews in mid-2020, received 30 five-star ones ""in quick succession"" a few months later A reviewer who claimed to have lived in Surrey for years while praising a local car company, and a Glasgow electric gate firm 412 miles (663 km) away for work on his home The same reviewer also praised a dentist in Manchester, a paving firm in Bournemouth, and a Cambridgeshire locksmith, who allegedly saved his toddler from a locked car Which? said it linked some 45 businesses scattered across the country to three suspicious ""reviewers"". That suggested they had each paid the same review seller to post their reviews, it said. Which? said that some fake reviews could have serious real-world consequences. For example, one claimed that a Liverpool solicitor had helped them recover tens of thousands of pounds. If false, it could scam people in a vulnerable financial position, the group argued. In another, the positive reviews outweighed several presumably genuine negative reviews which warned customers away from allegedly unscrupulous or ""scam"" companies. ""Businesses exploiting flaws in Google's review system to rise up the ranks are putting honest businesses on the back foot and leaving consumers at risk of being misled,"" said Natalie Hitchins from Which?. It called on regulators and Google to take action. This video can not be played Richard Boatwright says Google refuses to take down fake reviews which are damaging his business When it presented Google with the findings, the fake sting company was immediately deleted, Which? said. Google said that its policies ban fake reviews, and that it monitors the system for fraud around the clock, ""using a combination of people and technology"". ""When we find scammers trying to mislead people, we take swift action ranging from content removal to account suspension and even litigation,"" the company said. Which? did find that one of the fake reviews was removed by Google during the course of its investigation - but the firm it bought from said it would ""slow down"" the rate of fake review posting so future ones would ""stick"". The consumer group also offered the review-selling companies which it had researched the opportunity to say something. Only two replied: one to argue that its services help new businesses to get started and that it was not breaking any Google terms and conditions; and another to deny that it had ever sold any fake reviews and that Which? was mistaken.

"England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says it is likely there will be another surge of the virus in the UK Modelling suggests it could come later in the summer, as society opens up, or later in the autumn or winter, he says Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the roadmap out of lockdown in England is ""broadly"" in line with scientists' recommendations Up to four adults from two different households will be able to meet outdoors in Scotland from Friday of this week Restrictions on young people will also be eased, with four people aged between 12-17 able to meet even if they are all from different households A further 231 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, and there were 5,766 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours Hospitals in and around Paris have been told to reduce non-Covid treatments by 40%, amid extensive demand for intensive care beds Globally, there have now been more than 117 million recorded cases of Covid-19, and 2.6 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Rob Corp and Claire Heald We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here are the main stories we've covered in the UK and beyond:  Updates today were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea, Hamish Mackay, Alex Therrien, Rob Corp and Claire Heald,  We know.

Deaths and cases are down while vaccination figures continue to rise. A British zoo said it would not inoculate its apes ""at this stage"" despite several at an animal park in the US being given an experimental jab. Four orangutans and five bonobos at San Diego Zooeach had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine made for animals. Eight gorillas at the zoo became the first great apes in the world to test positive for coronavirus in January. Colchester Zoo in Essex said it was focusing on ""procedures to help prevent transmission"". Read more here. The Northern Ireland executive will try to ensure all children in the region can return to school as ""quickly as possible"", Finance Minister Conor Murphy says. The youngest pupils returned to school on Monday for the first time since before the Christmas break. Children in primary one to primary three (aged four to seven) and those in nursery and pre-school went back to face-to-face learning. But under current plans, they will return to remote learning on 22 March. The staggered approach is to allow the return to school of post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 until the start of the Easter holidays. However, Education Minister Peter Weir has argued for a ""continuity of learning""  and says he willbring a specific proposal to the executive for those year groups to continue to be in the classroom. He said health officials would need to consider this proposal and his suggestion that other primary school year groups - P4-P7 - also return to classes this month. It will need to be approved when ministers meet on Thursday. Mr Murphy said he would be guided by health advice. About 90% of Northern Ireland's 350,000 children have beenlearning remotely for more than two months. Pupils in primaries four to seven and years eight to 11 in post-primaries do not yet know when they will return to school. This video can not be played Covid-19 and schools: Pupils 'looking forward to playing with friends' Children in Englandare returning to the classroomthis week. But back to school nerves aren't only for kids - some newly qualified teachers are meeting their classes for the first time. Jess Toose began teaching last year and has been teaching online since October. ""I couldn't remember whether I could still control a classroom,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, which spent the first day of the reopening at her school - Merchant's Academy in Bristol. Jess says she's just glad to have a bit of normality and routine back. ""It's nice to use a whiteboard again, pick up a pen and gather ideas from my students - who have fantastic ideas but have felt too nervous in online lessons,"" she says. And the biggest difference teaching in-person compared to online? ""You can't mute them in-person. Sometimes, when you've got a bit too much banter going on, it's harder to control that kind of atmosphere."" Read more:'I met my class in real life for the first time this week' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online There are fewer than 10,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, the latest figures show - similar to the numbers of Covid patients being cared for on NHS wards at the end of October. Daily new Covid admissions have been declining since mid-January and now stand at 590, as of 5 March. At the peak of this latest pandemic wave they surpassed 4,500 in one day. New infections and deaths from Covid are also down. Today, 9 March, 766 people had a confirmed positive test result for coronavirus, while 231 deaths were reported. Meanwhile, more than two-fifths of UK adults have had their first dose of coronavirus vaccine, meaning they should start to have some protection against the virus. Experts say, despite this progress, unlocking should still be slow and measured. Go too quickly and there could be a substantial surge in Covid infections, risking the lives of many vulnerable people who are not yet sufficiently protected by immunisation. UK retail sales jumped in February as plans to ease lockdown drove purchases of school uniforms, computers and household goods, analysts say. The British Retail Consortiumsays like-for-like sales were up 9.5% year-on-year during the month, following a tough January. Valentine's Day also boosted the figures as locked-down couples splashed out at local supermarkets. But the BRC warns the coming months will be challenging. ""Many retail businesses will be hoping that customers will return to shops, and have spent hundreds of millions on making their premises Covid-secure, but previous reopenings have shown that demand can be slow to come back,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. The Scottish and UK governments have published their timetables for the easing of lockdown restrictions. So how do their plans compare? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiledher ""deliberately cautious"" frameworkfor easing restrictions in Scotland over the next two months. Her aim is that Scotland would return to its levels system of restrictions from 26 April, with all areas moving down to level three at that stage. The easing of the level four restrictions in Scotland will have a minimum gap of three weeks between phases, and will be assessed using conditions set out by the World Health Organization. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announceda four-step planwhich could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June in England. Each stage in his routemap will be a minimum of five weeks apart, with conditions which must be met before proceeding to the next step. Here's how the two plans compare. Hollywood star Michael Sheen has been ""laid low"" after contracting coronavirus,he has revealed,external. The Welsh actor said his illness had been ""difficult and quite scary"" to deal with. Sheen, 52, said he wanted to ""thank all the incredible women"" who helped get him through it. ""Anna, Mum, Lily, Joanne, my friends and all the women I am lucky enough to have support me, who've helped me,"" the Newport-born actor said. During the pandemic he and fellow actor David Tennant won plaudits for the BBC TV series Staged, which saw them play fictionalised versions of themselves dealing with lockdown. The series revolved around the pair trying to rehearse a play via video calls so that they would be able to quickly return to the theatre.

Shapps tweets that it is ""good news"" and says it will ease the movement of freight and goods. The transport secretary says the change is due to the UK's Covid rate being below France, Germany, Belgium and Holland.

A total of 22,592,528 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK and 1,181,431 have had their second dose. Officers made 28 arrests, of suspects aged 18 to 44, and seven people were issued with fixed penalty notices Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she ""cannot simply turn a blind eye"" to crowds of Rangers supporters breaching lockdown rules at the weekend. There were mass gatherings at the club's stadium and in the centre of Glasgow after Rangers clinched its first league title since 2011. Ms Sturgeon said the club could have done more to stop it happening. She said there were discussions taking place to make sure the scenes were not repeated. The first minister told MSPs during her Covid update that she would report back before the Old Firm match scheduled for 21 March on the outcome of those discussions. ""We will have to try to assure ourselves there will be no repeat of the scenes we saw at the weekend and that, frankly, is very much a work in progress,"" Ms Sturgeon said.

For the second year running, teachers' grades will be used following the cancellation of exams due to Covid-19.

But he urged parents not to put teachers under pressure or make them ""uncomfortable"" over grade decisions. The acting chief regulator was giving evidence to the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday.

Deaths and cases are down while vaccination figures continue to rise.

The Northern Ireland executive will try to ensure all children in the region can return to school as ""quickly as possible"", Finance Minister Conor Murphy says. The youngest pupils returned to school on Monday for the first time since before the Christmas break. Children in primary one to primary three (aged four to seven) and those in nursery and pre-school went back to face-to-face learning. But under current plans, they will return to remote learning on 22 March. The staggered approach is to allow the return to school of post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 until the start of the Easter holidays. However, Education Minister Peter Weir has argued for a ""continuity of learning""  and says he willbring a specific proposal to the executive for those year groups to continue to be in the classroom. He said health officials would need to consider this proposal and his suggestion that other primary school year groups - P4-P7 - also return to classes this month. It will need to be approved when ministers meet on Thursday. Mr Murphy said he would be guided by health advice. About 90% of Northern Ireland's 350,000 children have beenlearning remotely for more than two months. Pupils in primaries four to seven and years eight to 11 in post-primaries do not yet know when they will return to school.

But back to school nerves aren't only for kids - some newly qualified teachers are meeting their classes for the first time. Jess Toose began teaching last year and has been teaching online since October. ""I couldn't remember whether I could still control a classroom,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, which spent the first day of the reopening at her school - Merchant's Academy in Bristol. Jess says she's just glad to have a bit of normality and routine back. ""It's nice to use a whiteboard again, pick up a pen and gather ideas from my students - who have fantastic ideas but have felt too nervous in online lessons,"" she says. And the biggest difference teaching in-person compared to online? ""You can't mute them in-person. Sometimes, when you've got a bit too much banter going on, it's harder to control that kind of atmosphere."" Read more:'I met my class in real life for the first time this week' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online There are fewer than 10,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, the latest figures show - similar to the numbers of Covid patients being cared for on NHS wards at the end of October. Daily new Covid admissions have been declining since mid-January and now stand at 590, as of 5 March. At the peak of this latest pandemic wave they surpassed 4,500 in one day. New infections and deaths from Covid are also down. Today, 9 March, 766 people had a confirmed positive test result for coronavirus, while 231 deaths were reported. Meanwhile, more than two-fifths of UK adults have had their first dose of coronavirus vaccine, meaning they should start to have some protection against the virus. Experts say, despite this progress, unlocking should still be slow and measured. Go too quickly and there could be a substantial surge in Covid infections, risking the lives of many vulnerable people who are not yet sufficiently protected by immunisation. UK retail sales jumped in February as plans to ease lockdown drove purchases of school uniforms, computers and household goods, analysts say. The British Retail Consortiumsays like-for-like sales were up 9.5% year-on-year during the month, following a tough January. Valentine's Day also boosted the figures as locked-down couples splashed out at local supermarkets. But the BRC warns the coming months will be challenging. ""Many retail businesses will be hoping that customers will return to shops, and have spent hundreds of millions on making their premises Covid-secure, but previous reopenings have shown that demand can be slow to come back,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. The Scottish and UK governments have published their timetables for the easing of lockdown restrictions. So how do their plans compare? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiledher ""deliberately cautious"" frameworkfor easing restrictions in Scotland over the next two months. Her aim is that Scotland would return to its levels system of restrictions from 26 April, with all areas moving down to level three at that stage. The easing of the level four restrictions in Scotland will have a minimum gap of three weeks between phases, and will be assessed using conditions set out by the World Health Organization. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announceda four-step planwhich could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June in England. Each stage in his routemap will be a minimum of five weeks apart, with conditions which must be met before proceeding to the next step. Here's how the two plans compare. Hollywood star Michael Sheen has been ""laid low"" after contracting coronavirus,he has revealed,external. The Welsh actor said his illness had been ""difficult and quite scary"" to deal with. Sheen, 52, said he wanted to ""thank all the incredible women"" who helped get him through it. ""Anna, Mum, Lily, Joanne, my friends and all the women I am lucky enough to have support me, who've helped me,"" the Newport-born actor said. During the pandemic he and fellow actor David Tennant won plaudits for the BBC TV series Staged, which saw them play fictionalised versions of themselves dealing with lockdown. The series revolved around the pair trying to rehearse a play via video calls so that they would be able to quickly return to the theatre.

The transport secretary says the change is due to the UK's Covid rate being below France, Germany, Belgium and Holland.

Officers made 28 arrests, of suspects aged 18 to 44, and seven people were issued with fixed penalty notices Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she ""cannot simply turn a blind eye"" to crowds of Rangers supporters breaching lockdown rules at the weekend. There were mass gatherings at the club's stadium and in the centre of Glasgow after Rangers clinched its first league title since 2011. Ms Sturgeon said the club could have done more to stop it happening. She said there were discussions taking place to make sure the scenes were not repeated. The first minister told MSPs during her Covid update that she would report back before the Old Firm match scheduled for 21 March on the outcome of those discussions. ""We will have to try to assure ourselves there will be no repeat of the scenes we saw at the weekend and that, frankly, is very much a work in progress,"" Ms Sturgeon said.

For the second year running, teachers' grades will be used following the cancellation of exams due to Covid-19.

But he urged parents not to put teachers under pressure or make them ""uncomfortable"" over grade decisions. The acting chief regulator was giving evidence to the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday.

"The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles Crisis meetings involving senior royals have taken place following the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said Buckingham Palace ""will not want to feel rushed into saying something"" about Prince Harry and Meghan's claims. The couple spoke to Oprah about racism, mental health, the media and other members of the Royal Family. Prince Charles did not speak about the interview during a visit in London. An average of 11.1m people in the UK watched the interview on Monday night. In it, the duchess - who is the first mixed-race member of the modern Royal Family - said a low point came when Harry was asked by an unnamed royal family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Prince Harry later clarified to Oprah that the comments werenot made by either the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Why is Archie not a prince? Piers Morgan's comments about Meghan criticised 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden's spokeswoman said he would praise anyone for having the courage to speak out about mental health. White House press secretary Jen Psaki described Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, as ""private citizens"" who were ""sharing their own story in their own struggles"". Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton also backed Meghan, saying: ""This young woman was not about to keep her head down, you know, this is 2021."" Prince Charles did not respond to questions about the interview during a visit to a vaccine centre in north London The two-hour interview was screened on ITV on Monday night attracting 12.4m viewers at its peak - the broadcaster's biggest audience since the 2019 Rugby World Cup final - while it was viewed by an average of 17.1m in the US the previous day. In the interview, the duchess said that she found royal lifeso difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"", and when she approached the institution for help, she did not get it. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Meghan's allegations about racism and a lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". No 10 said Prime Minister Boris Johnson watched the interview on Monday night, but declined to comment further. It followed Mr Johnson's comments earlier on Monday, when he said he had ""always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role she plays"". He said ""when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing"", after being asked specifically if he believed the Royal Family was racist. Meanwhile, a YouGov opinion poll of 4,656 people conducted after the interview aired in the UK suggested: The public was equally split 32% by 32% on whether Prince Harry and Meghan were treated fairly or unfairly by the Royal Family - while 36% said they did not know Among over-65s, 50% thought the couple were treated fairly, compared with just 13% of 18 to 24-year-olds There was little to no change in people's opinions when compared with an identical poll carried out last week Prince Harry and Meghan have released a new image of them with their son Archie, who was born in 2019 During the interview, the duchess was asked why she thought the Royal Family did not make Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The couple's children do not automatically become princes or princesses due to a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" Prince Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. Analysis: Harry and Meghan rattle monarchy's gilded cage Meghan and Diana: Press coverage of two princesses 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' Prince Harry said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan about the ""colonial undertones"" of news headlines and articles. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" he said. The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. In footage not included in the original interview, Prince Harrysaid racism from the tabloid pressthat filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why he and his wife left the UK. The Society of Editors said it was ""not acceptable"" to claim sections of the press were bigoted ""without providing any supporting evidence"". Labour MP Diane Abbott said she could cite ""story after story when Meghan was treated quite differently from white members of the Royal Family"". Ms Abbott described the impact of coverage she has received as ""hurtful"", adding: ""It's corrosive and in the end, it makes you doubt yourself."" In other key revelations from the Oprah interview: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Prince Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But the prince said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month In further comments, Meghan told Oprah she felt betrayed by her father Thomas Markle's conduct in the run up to her 2018 wedding with Prince Harry. Mr Markle told ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday that the interview was the first time he had heard his daughter speak for several years. ""I'm very disappointed about it. I've apologised about this thing, what happened, at least 100 times or so,"" he said. This video can not be played Society of Editors executive director defends newspaper coverage of Meghan He described the interview as ""over the top"" and ill-timed, but said he did not believe the Royal Family was racist and that the comments about Archie's skin colour may have simply been a ""dumb question"". Asked about Meghan's claim she had ""lost"" her father, Mr Markle said: ""I'm available any time we can get together. I'd love to get together. I'd certainly like to see my grandson."" He also criticised the support from the Palace when he and his family were under intense scrutiny from the media, saying: ""Nobody was there to care for us, nobody looked after us.""
