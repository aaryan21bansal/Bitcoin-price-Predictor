"Facebook has been accused of colluding with OnlyFans to blacklist rival adult websites in a lawsuit filed in the US. This week,BBC News revealed that OnlyFans was being suedover claims it directed a social media company to disable accounts of adult entertainers by placing their content on a terrorism database. Facebook has now been named as the company alleged to have conspired with OnlyFans in a class action filing. Its parent company, Meta, says the claims are ""without merit"". UK website OnlyFans - best known for hosting pornography - has grown hugely in recent years. It lets users share video clips and photos with subscribers in return for a monthly fee. Performers often use social media accounts to promote and link to adult websites showing their explicit content. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that rival adult website FanCentro is suing OnlyFans in the US. The legal action claims that social media content of adult performers promoting rival websites to OnlyFans was placed on a database of extremist material shared between tech companies that is run by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). The database - used by Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - flags terror content to other members so they can moderate similar content on their platform. OnlyFans has not yet issued a legal response but a spokesperson said the company was aware of the claims and they had ""no merit"". Now, a class action lawsuit has been launched which names Facebook as the company accused of colluding with OnlyFans.ââ Do you have more information about this story? You can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email atnoel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk,external The lawsuit, made on behalf of three adult entertainers, lists both Facebook and OnlyFans' parent company as defendants. It was made by the same US legal firm, Milberg, which is suing OnlyFans directly. The filing claims that performers' content was placed on the GIFCT's database despite not being terrorist in nature, and this led to reduced visibility on social media and a marked decline in traffic being driven to OnlyFans' rival websites. Performers who only promoted their OnlyFans accounts on social media did not face this punitive content moderation - it is alleged - leading to a big growth in traffic visiting the website. In recent years, performers using Instagram to promote and link to their adult websites have complained that even though they have not broken the site's community guidelines - they have been served with violation notifications and had posts removed. The subsequent loss of visibility and promotion of these accounts became known as a ""shadowban"". BBC investigations into OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans Under the skin of OnlyFans BBC News has spoken to a performer and adult website owner who say their incomes fell significantly after posts on Instagram - also owned by Meta - began being taken down in late 2018. Both say they do not know how or why this happened. The performer says some of her posts - which typically feature her in a bikini or underwear - included tourist snaps when she was fully clothed. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: ""These allegations are without merit and we will address them in the context of the litigation as needed."" It said it had investigated and found no evidence the terrorism database had been abused, and added it could not comment on the performer and business owner claims without their usernames or website names. Content hashed on the database run by the GIFCT is not independently audited. In a statement, a GIFCT spokesperson said: ""We are not aware of any evidence to support the theories presented in this lawsuit between two parties with no connection to GIFCT.""

"Prosecutors say former detective Brett Hankison fired 10 shots during the raid that killed Breonna Taylor A jury is deciding whether a former detective showed ""extreme indifference to human life"" during the raid that led to the death of Breonna Taylor. Brett Hankison allegedly fired 10 shots blindly into a neighbour's flat in the melee that followed a ""no-knock"" search of the black woman's Kentucky home. He is now standing trial on three charges of endangerment. Ms Taylor's death sparked racial injustice rallies across America. Officers had forced their way into the 26-year old paramedic's Louisville home during a narcotics raid using the ""no-knock"" warrant - which meant they did not have to announce themselves. Her boyfriend shot and wounded one of the officers. In response, officers fired 32 shots, six of which struck Ms Taylor. Prosecutors allege that in the raid some of the shots fired by Hankison entered a neighbouring flat, endangering three people inside: Cody Etherson, his pregnant wife Chelsey Napper and their five-year-old son. ""This is not a case to decide who is responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor,"" Kentucky assistant attorney general Barbara Maines Whaley said during her opening remarks on Wednesday, but more whether Hankison had showed ""extreme indifference to human life"" during the raid. But Hankison's team sought to portray him as an experienced officer who was facing a confusing situation.  Defence attorney Steve Matthews described it as a scene of ""total chaos"". At the trial, Mr Etherson said he believed the raid was ""reckless"" and described a chaotic scene with bullets shredding through a wall his apartment shared with Ms Taylor's, covering him in debris and only narrowly missing him and his son. He said he woke that March night to a ""boom"", then heard several shots and felt debris falling on him. When his glass patio door shattered, Mr Etherton said he went to see what was happening - but was faced with officers pointing guns at him. The case, in Jefferson County Circuit Court, is expected to take about two weeks. It is the only trial stemming from the death of Ms Taylor. In 2020, her family sued Louisville police and reached a $12m (Â£8.8m) settlement. A grand jury cleared the two white officers who actually shot Taylor but charged Hankison for endangering neighbours in the adjacent apartment. He has pleaded not guilty but if convicted could face up to five years in prison. Ms Taylor's death, along with that of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism against black Americans.

"Average UK petrol and diesel prices have hit new highs as the Ukraine crisis continues to affect oil prices, the RAC has said. On Wednesday, petrol prices rose  to 149.30p per litre amid warnings it could soon pass Â£1.50. Oil prices jumped after Russia ordered troops into two Ukrainian regions this week to ""maintain peace"". Wholesale gas prices also continue to climb, threatening to further push up heating bills. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top producer of natural gas globally. The UK only gets 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Oil prices surge as Ukraine-Russia tensions climb Putin tells Russians security is non-negotiable Former National Grid boss Steve Holliday told the BBC's Today programme: ""For the UK, it's a price issue, it's not a security supply issue. ""We already know that we've got consumers that are already experiencing huge jumps in their energy bills, so this is really very unwelcome."" The price of Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, hit a seven-year high of more than $99 (Â£73) on Tuesday before falling back on Wednesday. However, fuel pump prices lag behind oil prices and the RAC has warned petrol could go higher than Â£1.50 a litre in the coming days. Diesel has also risen, hitting 152.68p a litre on Wednesday. Justin Yates and Matt Williams run a removals company Matt Williams, 30, runs Williams & Yates, a removals company that operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 11 vans and lorries. Rising fuel costs have forced it to put up its prices and he fears it might impact the business in the months ahead. ""Unfortunately, we do have to pass [these costs] onto the customer,"" he told the BBC. ""All the competition has to do the same, but I think it does make some consumers reconsider their moving options."" The firm offers basic and bespoke services, and he expects more customers to choose the cheaper option in the coming months rather than ""paying loads of money"". Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, a trade body for independent UK forecourts, said whether fuel prices continue to rise depends on a number of factors. ""If [conflict] really sparks off in Ukraine, we could prices escalating dramatically,"" he said. However, he added that the US is in the process of negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran which could see more oil come onto the market. UK wholesale gas prices also jumped following Germany's decision on Tuesday to halt the final approval of Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline connecting the country with Russia. That decision drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. Allow Twitter content?

""Well, welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay â¬2,000 for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas!""he tweeted,external- suggesting prices were set to double. UK gas prices for delivery in March rose by 13.5p to 200p per therm, though that is still much lower than the highs of December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. The UK said it was ready to impose further sanctions in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, targeting more Russian banks and individuals as well as companies in the energy, defence, technology and chemical sectors. After a volatile trading session on Tuesday, global stock markets climbed on Wednesday before falling back again. Towards the end of the day, the UK's FTSE 100 was flat while France's CAC-40 and Germany's Dax had lost between 0.2% and 0.5%. The main three US indexes were all in the red. High energy prices in the UK have played a major part in pushing up the cost of living recently, while wages have lagged behind price rises. Inflation currently stands at 5.5% - its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee of MPs on Wednesday, Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said energy prices accounted for nearly half of the rise in inflation over the last year. That is likely to rise to 70% in the first three months of 2022, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. The Bank deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said: ""If you look at the increase in energy bills this year, it is just about twice as big as any single year in the 1970s - it is enormous."" The Bank expects inflation to hit 7% in spring when the price cap on household energy bills is raised. This is far above the Bank of England's 2% target. From April, about 18 million homes on standard tariffs will see an average increase of Â£693. Meanwhile, 4.5 million prepayment customers can expect their energy costs to rise by an average Â£708. Consumers are also being squeezed by rising prices on goods as many companies pass on higher costs such as fuel, shipping and wages to their customers. As well as the rise in energy prices in April, staff, companies and the self-employed will also have to pay an extra 1.25p on the pound in National Insurance. The rise is being introduced by the government to fund health and social care.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak told an audience today that not all tax cuts ""pay for themselves"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to ""deliver a low tax, higher growth economy"" amid criticism from MPs over rises to National Insurance. Mr Sunak told an audience at the Bayes Business School on Thursday that he would cut taxes ""sustainably"". It comes as National Insurance rates are set to rise from 1 April to help fund health and social care. The rise means employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound. ""I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges,"" Mr Sunak said in his speech. ""I firmly believe in lower taxes."" However, the chancellor also argued that taxes should not be cut if spending plans are unfunded. Johnson and Sunak confirm National Insurance rise Opposition MPs urge rethink on April NI tax rise National Insurance: Why is the tax rising and what will it cost me? Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Conservative Party was ""now the party of high tax"". ""The chancellor may say he 'believes' in low taxes in his lecture - but the hard facts are that Sunak has hit households and business with 15 tax rises in two years in post - with an unfair National Insurance rise down the line,"" Ms Reeves said. ""He has raised the most tax on average per budget than any chancellor in the last 50 years."" Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer was set to deliver a speech in Huddersfield outlining his party's approach to taxation and ending insecure employment, but it was cancelled due to the Ukraine crisis. Sir Keir had planned to say that a Labour government would end the ""economic fatalism"" of the Conservatives and build ""a new economy of security, where stable employment will be the bedrock of a better future for the next generation"". Mr Sunak said he was ""disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that 'tax cuts always pay for themselves'"". ""They do not,"" he added. ""Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere."" In Mr Sunak's two years in his role he has overseen hundreds of billions in Covid-related government spending through furlough payments, business grants and testing. He has also been at the helm as taxation as a share of the economy has risen to its highest level since the 1950s. Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes will see an employee on Â£20,000 a year pay an extra Â£89 in tax, while someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£464 more. The Liberal Democrats and some backbench Tory MPs have called for the chancellor to scrap the incoming NI hike to ease the financial burden on households and businesses at a time of rising costs. In the speech Mr Sunak also set out his priorities to increase the UK's economic growth, and argued that ""what government does is far less important than creating the conditions for private businesses and individuals to thrive"". Tony Danker, director general of the business group the CBI, said setting out how firms could ""achieve sustainable growth for the long term"" was ""vital"" at a period of volatility in the economy. ""Government enabling firms to invest, thrive and deliver prosperity is absolutely the right direction of travel,"" he added. Mr Danker has called for a permanent ""super-deduction"" tax break to boost business investment in the UK. The super-deduction allowance currently gives businesses investing in certain types of equipment, like machinery, a much higher tax reduction than usual but will expire in March next year.

"Julia Garner plays Anna Sorokin in Inventing Anna Inventing Anna has notched up the most viewing hours for an English-language series in a week since the service began a new ratings system last summer. The nine-part show stars Ozark's Julia Garner as fake heiress Anna Sorokin. It was watched for 196 million hours last week, on top of 77 million hours of viewing on the weekend of its release on 11 February. The previous highest was psychological thriller show You, whose third season achieved 179 million hours in October. Next on the list of the top English-language series are The Witcher, Maid and Sex Education. But Squid Game, the Korean-language survival drama, remains Netflix's most-watched show overall, peaking at almost 572 million hours in a single week. Another South Korean show, All of Us Are Dead, and Spanish crime drama Money Heist have scored 236 million and 202 million hours respectively. This video can not be played Anna Sorokin in March 2021: ""I never thought I was cheating"" Inventing Anna is based on a New York magazine investigation into Sorokin, who, going by the name of Anna Delvey, convinced people she was a wealthy European heiress. In fact, she turned out to have conned friends, hotels and banks out of eye-watering amounts of money and was eventually convicted on multiple fraud charges in 2019. The series follows the tenacious journalist Vivian Kent, played by Anna Chlumsky, in her attempts to discover the truth. Inventing Anna: The Netflix show versus reality Listen: Fake Heiress podcast on BBC Sounds The stranger-than-fiction story has been adapted by producer/screenwriter Shonda Rhimes and her company Shondaland, the creators of Bridgerton, Grey's Anatomy and Scandal. The cast also includes Laverne Cox (Orange is the New Black), Arian Moayed (Succession) and Terry Kinney (Billions). While it has been a hit with viewers, the show has also courted controversy, after real-life journalist Rachel DeLoache Williams, who is played by Katie Lowes, criticised its ""shocking"" portrayal of her. Williams became friends with Sorokin when she was a photojournalist at Vanity Fair.Speaking to her former publication,external, she condemned what she described as ""dangerous half-truths"" in the show and said the series created ""problematic"" empathy for a ""sociopathic, narcissistic, proven criminal"". ""Having had a front-row seat for far too long, I've studied the way a con works more than anybody needs to,"" said Williams, who was herself conned out of $62,000 (Â£45,500) by Sorokin. ""You watch the spectacle, but you're not paying attention to what's being marketed."" Sorokin is currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody but responded on Instagram, criticising Williams' ""flexible moral standards"" and ""blatant hypocrisy"".

"Anthony Elanga's goal was Manchester United's 500th in the European Cup/Champions League, Anthony Elanga says he has ""dreamt of moments"" like his late equaliser in the the first leg of Manchester United's Champions League last-16 draw at Atletico Madrid. The 19-year-old had been on the pitch less than six minutes after replacing Marcus Rashford, when he raced onto Bruno Fernandes' perfectly-weighted pass to roll the ball past home goalkeeper Jan Oblak with his first touch to earn his side a 1-1 draw. ""I told you how calm and cool I am and whenever I am given a opportunity. I want to repay the manager and give 150% every time I step onto the pitch,"" Elanga told BT Sport. ""I just do what I can do, I want to be the best player on the pitch and I appreciate the boss. ""He [Ralf Rangnick] said to me to make the defenders scared and run in behind when I get the opportunity. ""I have dreamt of moments like this, scoring in the Champions League against top European teams like Atletico Madrid, [it is] a dream come true."" Until that point it appeared as though Diego Simeone's Spanish champions were going to take a narrow advantage to Old Trafford after delivering a masterclass in controlling the game without the ball. Joao Felix's early header from Renan Lodi's inviting cross gave the hosts a dream start with United looking ragged on their right, where interim boss Rangnick's deployment of Victor Lindelof at full-back failed badly. Rangnick later conceded that his plan ""was in the dustbin"" after seven minutes with the Swedish central defender, who was uncomfortable throughout, being booked for a tug on Felix before his second-half withdrawal. By then Atletico should have been two goals ahead with Sime Vrsaljko heading the ball off Lindelof and onto the United bar in the closing moments of the first half after some more dismal defending. While Rangnick's side enjoyed plenty of the ball, they were slow and indecisive in possession and barely looked capable of carving open their well-drilled opponents who repeatedly picked off every sloppy United pass in midfield. Atletico were also unlucky to not score late on themselves when Antoine Griezmann rattled the visitors crossbar. However, Elanga, who missed the crucial penalty when Rangnick's side lost in the FA Cup to Middlesbrough earlier this month, followed up his goal at Leeds on Sunday with another important intervention to change the complexion of the tie before the second leg in Manchester in three weeks time. ""He is playing as though it is a dream come true,"" Rangnick added. ""It is a joy and fun to watch him play, I wish a few other players would take him as an example and as a role model."" Elanga's emergence a high point in a tough season for Man Utd Relive Manchester United's draw at Atletico Madrid in the Champions League Go straight to all the best United content For long periods of this encounter United served up the sort of fare that has typified Rangnick's three-month reign as boss. Disjointed in possession, misplaced and overhit passes were produced with alarming frequency as Fred, Paul Pogba and Fernandes failed to impose themselves on the game and the athleticism of Scott McTominay was sorely missed in midfield. There were also several elementary mistakes at the back, such as Fred's charge out towards the ball and the lack of communication as Felix stole past Harry Maguire to head the opening goal. Lindelof's unfamiliarity with his adopted position hardly helped and it was notable that United's main improvement came after the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Alex Telles and Elanga were introduced. Elanga in particular provided the pace to run in behind - an option that had barely been utilised with the visitors until then. And it reaped immediate dividends, with the Sweden under-21 international registering United's first shot on target with his goal to become the club's youngest goalscorer in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live:""It was exactly what I have been saying [all night]. Elanga has come on and made runs off the ball and probably for the first time all evening long Bruno Fernandes gets his pass right. ""For 75 minutes of this game you felt that Manchester United would have been happy to take a 2-0 defeat back to Old Trafford but they hung in there and those substitutions gave them that bit more control and Elanga got the goal."" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport:""Man United would have taken your hand off for that result. They were lucky tonight and were poor tonight. ""David de Gea did not have much to do [but] you are looking for a better performance."" Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes:""Ralf Rangnick's record is very good and his subs have been very good. It is not strange for me, it is a typical Manchester United performance under this manager."" Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves:""Anthony Elanga gave them some urgency, young kids are fearless and he galvanised United.

"Anna Karen was the last surviving star of On the Buses On the Buses and EastEnders actress Anna Karen has died at the age of 85.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak told an audience today that not all tax cuts ""pay for themselves"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to ""deliver a low tax, higher growth economy"" amid criticism from MPs over rises to National Insurance. Mr Sunak told an audience at the Bayes Business School on Thursday that he would cut taxes ""sustainably"". It comes as National Insurance rates are set to rise from 1 April to help fund health and social care. The rise means employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound. ""I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges,"" Mr Sunak said in his speech. ""I firmly believe in lower taxes."" However, the chancellor also argued that taxes should not be cut if spending plans are unfunded. Johnson and Sunak confirm National Insurance rise Opposition MPs urge rethink on April NI tax rise National Insurance: Why is the tax rising and what will it cost me? Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Conservative Party was ""now the party of high tax"". ""The chancellor may say he 'believes' in low taxes in his lecture - but the hard facts are that Sunak has hit households and business with 15 tax rises in two years in post - with an unfair National Insurance rise down the line,"" Ms Reeves said. ""He has raised the most tax on average per budget than any chancellor in the last 50 years."" Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer was set to deliver a speech in Huddersfield outlining his party's approach to taxation and ending insecure employment, but it was cancelled due to the Ukraine crisis. Sir Keir had planned to say that a Labour government would end the ""economic fatalism"" of the Conservatives and build ""a new economy of security, where stable employment will be the bedrock of a better future for the next generation"". Mr Sunak said he was ""disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that 'tax cuts always pay for themselves'"". ""They do not,"" he added. ""Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere."" In Mr Sunak's two years in his role he has overseen hundreds of billions in Covid-related government spending through furlough payments, business grants and testing. He has also been at the helm as taxation as a share of the economy has risen to its highest level since the 1950s. Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes will see an employee on Â£20,000 a year pay an extra Â£89 in tax, while someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£464 more. The Liberal Democrats and some backbench Tory MPs have called for the chancellor to scrap the incoming NI hike to ease the financial burden on households and businesses at a time of rising costs. In the speech Mr Sunak also set out his priorities to increase the UK's economic growth, and argued that ""what government does is far less important than creating the conditions for private businesses and individuals to thrive"". Tony Danker, director general of the business group the CBI, said setting out how firms could ""achieve sustainable growth for the long term"" was ""vital"" at a period of volatility in the economy. ""Government enabling firms to invest, thrive and deliver prosperity is absolutely the right direction of travel,"" he added. Mr Danker has called for a permanent ""super-deduction"" tax break to boost business investment in the UK. The super-deduction allowance currently gives businesses investing in certain types of equipment, like machinery, a much higher tax reduction than usual but will expire in March next year.

"Average UK petrol and diesel prices have hit new highs as the Ukraine crisis continues to affect oil prices, the RAC has said. On Wednesday, petrol prices rose  to 149.30p per litre amid warnings it could soon pass Â£1.50. Oil prices jumped after Russia ordered troops into two Ukrainian regions this week to ""maintain peace"". Wholesale gas prices also continue to climb, threatening to further push up heating bills. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top producer of natural gas globally. The UK only gets 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Oil prices surge as Ukraine-Russia tensions climb Putin tells Russians security is non-negotiable Former National Grid boss Steve Holliday told the BBC's Today programme: ""For the UK, it's a price issue, it's not a security supply issue. ""We already know that we've got consumers that are already experiencing huge jumps in their energy bills, so this is really very unwelcome."" The price of Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, hit a seven-year high of more than $99 (Â£73) on Tuesday before falling back on Wednesday. However, fuel pump prices lag behind oil prices and the RAC has warned petrol could go higher than Â£1.50 a litre in the coming days. Diesel has also risen, hitting 152.68p a litre on Wednesday. Justin Yates and Matt Williams run a removals company Matt Williams, 30, runs Williams & Yates, a removals company that operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 11 vans and lorries. Rising fuel costs have forced it to put up its prices and he fears it might impact the business in the months ahead. ""Unfortunately, we do have to pass [these costs] onto the customer,"" he told the BBC. ""All the competition has to do the same, but I think it does make some consumers reconsider their moving options."" The firm offers basic and bespoke services, and he expects more customers to choose the cheaper option in the coming months rather than ""paying loads of money"". Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, a trade body for independent UK forecourts, said whether fuel prices continue to rise depends on a number of factors. ""If [conflict] really sparks off in Ukraine, we could prices escalating dramatically,"" he said. However, he added that the US is in the process of negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran which could see more oil come onto the market. UK wholesale gas prices also jumped following Germany's decision on Tuesday to halt the final approval of Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline connecting the country with Russia. That decision drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. Allow Twitter content?

""Well, welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay â¬2,000 for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas!""he tweeted,external- suggesting prices were set to double. UK gas prices for delivery in March rose by 13.5p to 200p per therm, though that is still much lower than the highs of December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. The UK said it was ready to impose further sanctions in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, targeting more Russian banks and individuals as well as companies in the energy, defence, technology and chemical sectors. After a volatile trading session on Tuesday, global stock markets climbed on Wednesday before falling back again. Towards the end of the day, the UK's FTSE 100 was flat while France's CAC-40 and Germany's Dax had lost between 0.2% and 0.5%. The main three US indexes were all in the red. High energy prices in the UK have played a major part in pushing up the cost of living recently, while wages have lagged behind price rises. Inflation currently stands at 5.5% - its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee of MPs on Wednesday, Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said energy prices accounted for nearly half of the rise in inflation over the last year. That is likely to rise to 70% in the first three months of 2022, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. The Bank deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said: ""If you look at the increase in energy bills this year, it is just about twice as big as any single year in the 1970s - it is enormous."" The Bank expects inflation to hit 7% in spring when the price cap on household energy bills is raised. This is far above the Bank of England's 2% target. From April, about 18 million homes on standard tariffs will see an average increase of Â£693. Meanwhile, 4.5 million prepayment customers can expect their energy costs to rise by an average Â£708. Consumers are also being squeezed by rising prices on goods as many companies pass on higher costs such as fuel, shipping and wages to their customers. As well as the rise in energy prices in April, staff, companies and the self-employed will also have to pay an extra 1.25p on the pound in National Insurance. The rise is being introduced by the government to fund health and social care.

"The Supreme Court ruled James Craig's human rights had been breached The UK Supreme Court has halted the extradition of a Scottish man wanted by the United States over a Â£1.2m fraud. Five judges found James Craig's human rights had been breached as a legal measure which could have helped him had not been introduced in Scotland. The UK government did not bring in a measure north of the border allowing an extradition to be blocked if a trial could take place in the UK. It made the decision at the Scottish government's request. TheSupreme Court's ruling,externalwill set a precedent for other extradition cases. However, it is not immediately clear how many will now be open to challenge as a result. Mr Craig, from Dunragit in Dumfries and Galloway, has fought a marathon legal battle against his extradition to the US over a crime he denies committing. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused him of tweeting false information about two American companies in 2013, costing investors $1.6m. He was alleged to have made $97 by buying shares at a lower price and then reselling them.He later repaid the cash plus $120 interestwithout admitting that he had done anything wrong. The extradition process against Mr Craig began in 2017 Police Scotland searched Mr Craig's house at the request of the FBI in 2014. A warrant for his arrest was issued by the SEC in 2015. The extradition process began in 2017. Had Mr Craig been from England, Wales or Northern Ireland, he could have opposed his extradition on the grounds of ""forum bar."" It allows an extradition to be blocked on the basis that a trial could ""fairly and effectively"" take place in the UK and not abroad. The UK government introduced the measure in 2013 followingthe case of Gary McKinnon, a computer hacker who successfully fought extradition to the US. However, the Scottish government asked that it should not apply to Scottish cases over fears that it would interfere with the independence of Scottish prosecutors. That meant Mr Craig could not use forum bar as an argument against his extradition. Following a legal challenge by Mr Craig in 2018, the Court of Session declared that the UK government had acted unlawfully by failing to introduce forum bar in Scotland. A sheriff then ruled that Mr Craig's extradition could still go ahead, a judgement backed by the Appeal Court, which said the forum bar failure had not rendered the entire process unlawful. The UK Supreme Court has now ruled that the failure to bring in the forum bar in Scotland had breached Mr Craig's human rights. Announcing the decision, judge Lord Reed said: ""The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. ""A new extradition hearing may be held before a different sheriff, at which Mr Craig will be able to rely on the forum bar provisions in addition to any other arguments properly available to him."" Forum bar was finally introduced in Scotland in September 2021. The Supreme Court's ruling means the case is being brought back to Scotland to start all over again, nine years after the original alleged offence. Mr Craig has declined to comment on the judgement on the advice of his lawyers. His solicitor Paul Dunne said his client was ""very pleased"" with the Supreme Court's decision. ""He has felt all along that what has gone on hasn't been right,"" he said. ""For seven years he has had his life on hold due to a procedure that we knew in 2018 was unlawful."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""When the UK government determined that extradition law should be changed to introduce a forum bar, this was a decision for them, as extradition is a reserved matter. ""But the Scottish government indicated it would be preferable for this provision not to apply in Scotland because of concerns it would potentially impact on the independence of the role of the Lord Advocate in making prosecutorial decisions. ""Instead of not including provision for Scotland, the UK government decided to extend the forum bar provision to Scotland in legislation, but then did not commence the relevant provision for Scotland. This was entirely a matter for the UK government.""

"Free Covid testing will continue in Scotland at some level beyond April, the deputy first minister has said. The Scottish government is seeking clarity from the UK government about how testing is funded after mass free testing ends in England on 1 April. John Swinney said Scottish ministers would set out in March how free PCR and lateral flow tests would be allocated. The Scottish Conservatives said Nicola Sturgeon should fund testing from existing budgets. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab later said Scotland had been granted an additional Â£6.5bn to finance its Covid recovery. On Tuesday the first minister announcedScotland's legal Covid-19 restrictions would end on 21 Marchand the country would rely instead on vaccines,treatmentsand ""good public health behaviours"". The move comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that England's restrictions will be lifted on Thursday, with the requirement to self-isolate dropped and free mass testing ending in April. Ms Sturgeon expressed frustration at Mr Johnson's approach, calling for clarity about how the testing system - which operates UK-wide - would operate in future. Speaking to BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotland, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he did not yet know whether people would still be able to pick up free lateral flow tests (LFTs) at a pharmacy after 1 April. ""We think that where there is a requirement for testing to be undertaken, that should be delivered as part of the overall commitment of the National Health Service [and] that these services should be provided free of charge,"" he said. In the meantime, he said, the Scottish government was advising people to test a ""couple of times a week"", as they had done before the emergence of Omicron increased the guidance on frequency. Some high street pharmacies in England are planning to sell the tests for Â£2.50 each or Â£5.99 online from April, with supermarkets also expected to stock them. The Scottish government's transition plan, which is being prepared for March, will set out the ""circumstances and conditions"" which would allow people access to free testing. This was likely to be a combination of PCR and lateral flow testing, Mr Swinney said, and would ""reflect the settlement provided by the UK government"". Mr Swinney said the UK government indicated it wanted to do sufficient testing to ""maintain the intelligence that requires it to pick up where there are new strains of the virus emerging"". ""That approach sounds to me as if it requires testing to be continued within England,"" he said. ""We need to understand the financing of all of that."" He said all four nations needed clarity on the implications of that funding coming from the Treasury - which would allow for a proportionate amount of funding coming to the Scottish government - or if the Department of Health was expected to find the money from its existing budget for England. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, speak to BBC Scotland'sThe Nineon Tuesday, said: ""Those tests, as we know, are procured on a four nations basis. If the UK government chooses not to give us additional funding... then we would have to look within existing budgets to fund that."" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab praised the team effort of the devolved administrations and said collaborative working had enabled the UK to come through the pandemic. Mr Raab said Scotland had been allocated an additional Â£6.5bn from the Treasury, on top of the block grant, to fund its recovery from the crisis. During a visit to Edinburgh he told BBC Scotland: ""It is for the Scottish people and government and parliament to decide the best allocation, whether it is for testing or other measures, but I think that is the right approach to take. ""We would not stay in emergency measures indefinitely."" MSP Sandesh Gulhane, the Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman, told the BBC that testing had to continue while Scotland maintained restrictions, but that the Scottish government should fund it. Dr Gulhane said: ""Because we've started in such a restricted position compared to everyone else, it is only right and proper that Nicola Sturgeon funds the positions that we're in and accepts that the decisions that she has made, despite it not making any difference to her case numbers."" She should ""fund increased testing whilst we are coming out of the problem that she has created"", he added. However, he added it was right to move to allowing people to make their own decisions about Covid risks and said: ""It was never law to isolate in Scotland but people did it because we trust the Scottish people to do the right thing"". Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour's finance spokesman, toldGood Morning Scotlandhe still needed clarity about how the virus was going to be managed in Scotland. He added: ""I think it is grossly irresponsible of the UK government to withdraw this funding, collapsing what has definitely been a pillar of our response to this virus, before we have vanquished this virus."" Prof Cindy Gray, who studies health and behaviour at the University of Glasgow, told toBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Livethat abolishing free testing would create problems for many people. She said: ""People who can't afford it will not be able to access testing and won't know whether or not  they have Covid. I think the calls that testing should be retained and discussions around whether we can do that in Scotland, are really, really important. ""I do think free testing should be accessible for everybody."" FM confirms dates for ending Covid rules.

"This video can not be played Miriam Siddiqi says her brother's death has left her family living with ""a wound that won't heal"" One of Europe's most wanted men, suspected of being the mastermind in the mistaken identity killing of a schoolboy, has been to many countries while on the run, it has emerged. Mohammed Ali Ege is wanted by police in connection withAamir Siddiqi's murder. Two hitmenwere convicted of the 17-year-old's murder in a killing for hire which went wrong at his Cardiff home in front of his parents in 2010. South Wales Police said his hunt remains a priority. After escaping custody in India five years ago Mohammed Ali Ege is thought to have travelled across three continents. Aamir's mother and father, Parveen and Sheikh Iqbal Ahmed, were also injured in the attack that killed their son But the fugitive known asWales' most wanted manis still at large despite police appeals afterfleeing capture in 2017 as he awaited extradition. Aamir's sister said the family ""won't rest easy"" until the 44-year-old ""faces justice"". Aamir believed he was opening the door to a teacher in April 2010 when he was stabbed to death in a frenzied drug-fuelled attack by contract killers Jason Richards and Ben Hope. Ben Hope and Jason Richards were convicted of murder at Swansea Crown Court They burst screeching into Aamir's home wearing balaclavas, and stabbed him in the hallway. His parents were injured as they fought the attackers in vain as they tried to save their son. How error led to tragic Aamir murder Wrong-house murder 'an open wound' for family On-the-run murder suspect 'getting cash' The two heroin addicts were paid Â£1,000 to kill an innocent businessman and father-of-four who lived in a neighbouring street in the Roath area of Cardiff - but they went to the wrong house and killed Aamir. Both hitmen were given a minimum of 40 years in prison each, but the man accused of hiring them was Mohammed Ali Ege, who a court heard was angry over a collapsed property deal. Five months after Aamir's murder, South Wales Police offered a Â£10,000 reward for information on his whereabouts. Aamir Siddiqi was studying law and was also interested in politics when he was killed He was arrested in India in October 2011 on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. But after being taken to court in April 2017 to await extradition, he escaped from Indian police at a New Delhi railway station after removing a grill from a toilet window. Miriam Siddiqi wants to see the man said to be behind her brother's death face justice Now Miriam Siddiqi, Aamir's older sister has shed fresh light on the ""multiple countries"" he is believed to have travelled to after escaping Indian authorities. The Siddiqi family has been receiving updates from detectives. Police in Wales are still waiting to question Mohammed Ali Ege about Aamir Siddiqi's murder ""He's a man of means, he's a man of power and to be able to evade police for so many years, you cannot do that alone just by having a few false passports,"" said Ms Siddiqi. ""You need to be able to have a network that supports you and it felt as if he was using that time very wisely. ""When he escaped from India he left the country very quickly"". Ms Siddiqi said he was last thought to be in the Middle East and there were ""recent updates"" on the effort to make him face justice. ""I know that for a fact he travelled to multiple countries before we've heard that he's in Dubai,"" she said. She said he is believed to have travelled to Sri Lanka, and several countries in Africa, including Morocco or Tunisia, before eventually travelling to Dubai, where he was thought to have been as recently as last year. ""He's still at large, he's still living some sort of life,"" she said. Aamir Siddiqi was stabbed to death at his family home in Ninian Road in Roath, Cardiff She said detectives believed as recently as last year that he was in Dubai. She said: ""I know that he hasn't stayed in one place for very long"". Aamir's sister says her parents 'can't rest easy' until Mohammed Ali Ege 'has been brought to justice' Mohammed Ali Ege was born in Dubai in October 1977, and later settled in Wales. He is known to have used different names, identities and passports. In 2019 South Wales Police said they believed he may have been receiving financial support from within Wales. Officers searched several addresses in Cardiff at the time. South Wales Police said it ""continues to work with the National Crime Agency and international law enforcement agencies to trace Mohammed Ali Ege and return him to the UK"". In a statement, the force said: ""From our ongoing investigation to trace him we know that he has travelled"". It added: ""His current whereabouts remain unknown but if and when Mohammed Ali Ege is arrested anywhere in the world, current arrangements are in place to ensure that South Wales Police would be notified immediately."" Det Insp Stuart Wales from the force's Major Crime Investigations Team said: ""Nearly 12 years may have passed but until Mohammed Ali Ege is located and brought back to the UK, this remains a live and priority investigation for South Wales Police."". Mohammed Ali Ege escaped police custody before he was due to be extradited from India Ms Siddiqi has praised the work of Welsh detectives, but said she was ""frustrated"" by elements of the international appeal for Mr Ege. She has criticised the fact that there is no public appeal from the UK for him on the global police agency, Interpol's 'wanted person' list. There is a public Interpol appeal from Indian Police, known as a public facing red notice, but that is for passport and forgery charges he faces in India. She said: ""Maybe this has been a missed opportunity... ""Had it been on there I don't know what the results could have been, could he have been in the UK by now?"" Police released new images in 2021 of Mohammed Ali Ege while he was in police custody in India BBC Wales understands a red notice from South Wales Police does exist, and has been shared with police forces, but has not been made public. However, Ms Siddiqi believes this should be made public given how far Mohammed Ali Ege is said to have travelled, and how long he has managed to evade police. South Wales Police said: ""Red notice status is a matter for the Home Office and Interpol"". Det Insp Wales added: ""There are numerous appeals for information in relation to Mohammed Ali Ege on Interpol, the Major Investigation Public Portal, Crimestoppers, the South Wales Police website and many local, national and international media reports."". Interpol said that ""every red notice request is checked by a specialised task force to ensure it is compliant"" and added that the ""review takes into account information available at the time of publication"". The Home Office said: ""We can't comment on individual Interpol red notices."" Ms Siddiqi said: ""It is important that you find him - he has the most serious charges waiting for him in the UK."" She said her family would ""forever be indebted to South Wales Police"" for catching Aamir's killers, but the only way her parents ""will be able to rest easy in their lifetime"" is if Mr Ege faces justice in Wales. This video can not be played Mohammed Ali Ege is wanted by police in connection to Aamir Siddiqi's murder ""I don't think I'll ever stop grieving because I don't think I'll ever stop loving Aamir."" In a direct appeal to Mr Ege, she said: ""If he had no involvement in this, tell us that you didn't. ""My parents are suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, my parents suffer from trauma and they have to live with that for the rest of their lives."" Allow Twitter content?

"Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths Next month, a report will be published into one of the biggest scandals in the history of the NHS, the failures of maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. The BBC's Michael Buchanan who helped uncover the problems examines why so many failures were allowed to happen for so long. It began with an email from one mother to another.  The two were strangers - ""I hope you don't mind me contacting you and I hope I don't cause any upset."" But almost immediately, a bond was formed - a spark rekindled in a couple who just two months earlier had vowed to move on with their lives. It was a Monday evening in June 2016, when Kayleigh Griffiths in a moment of clarity amid the fog of grief, wrote the email.  She and her husband Colin had welcomed their second daughter Pippa into the world in late April. They had decided on a home birth because of what she said was the ""appalling state"" of the birthing centre in Shrewsbury. Pippa arrived safely but struggled to feed almost immediately. Kayleigh spoke to her midwifery team on four occasions about her concerns, including a frantic call around 03:00 after her daughter coughed up brown liquid. She was repeatedly told not to worry. By 11:30 the following morning, Pippa became unresponsive. ""I went still and watched her chest and it wasn't moving,"" recalls Kayleigh. ""I put my hand under her nose to feel the breath and there was nothing.  At which point utter panic set in."" She screamed for Colin who desperately started trying to resuscitate his daughter while an ambulance was called. Kayleigh Griffiths Pippa died that afternoon. She was just 31 hours old.  The cause of death, the couple were later told, was an infection - Group B Strep. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust told the family they would carry out an investigation. But after several weeks of silence, Kayleigh contacted the trust to be told it was an internal investigation and the couple's input wouldn't be required. Kayleigh, an NHS auditor at a different trust, feared the truth was being hidden from her. That's when she decided to send the email. Rhiannon Davies was on holiday in Pembrokeshire with her husband Richard Stanton when she received the message. Kayleigh had seen some of the significant local media coverage about the couple's seven-year effort to uncover the truth about their daughter's death under the care of the same Shropshire trust. Over a frenetic few hours the sheer elation of new life became overwhelmed by the grief of sudden loss. Rhiannon had become pregnant with the couple's first child in 2008. She had been assessed as being a low-risk pregnancy and was advised to have her child at a midwife-led birthing centre run by the Shropshire trust in Ludlow, her home town. Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton In the days leading up to the birth, she noticed her baby's movements had reduced. She reported her concerns to clinicians at the trust, but was told she simply had a lazy baby. So when Rhiannon went into labour on 1 March 2009, she headed to the midwife-led unit. ""Kate was delivered at 10:03 in the morning,"" recalls Richard. ""It's just hard to describe the happiness that you feel."" Rhiannon says Kate started to make a strange noise. ""It's called grunting but it's not, it's a murmuring.  The midwife said she was trying to cry. She wasn't - this is a distinct clear sign, if you know what you're doing, that the baby is in respiratory distress. She opened her eyes once, beautiful blue eyes."" Rhiannon and her daughter Kate Kate was seriously ill and needed urgent medical attention. But the nearest doctors were 45 minutes away. The midwives ""lost control of the situation,"" said Richard, but eventually an air ambulance arrived to take Kate to a hospital in Birmingham. The couple followed, but Rhiannon collapsed and was taken to hospital in Worcester. Richard raced to his daughter's side. ""Kate was in an incubation cot with cables and tubes,"" he recalls. ""There was no recovery from this situation. So six hours after holding my new born baby, I cradled Kate in my arms dying. The overriding memory I have from that one day is hearing Rhiannon arrive to be told that Kate was no longer with us, and the cries of pain from Rhiannon."" The initial report from the trust noted the death but described it as a ""no harm"" event. In 2012, an inquest jury concluded, however, that Kate's death was preventable - those reduced movements should have seen Rhiannon deliver in a hospital, with doctors on hand. In a written response however, the trust said the care ""given to Ms Davies was in line with both the local and national guidance"". But the couple continued to fight, pushing for two independent reports, which were published over the next four years. Finally, in April 2016, the board of the trust held an extraordinary meeting, in which they apologised and accepted Kate's death was avoidable. ""It was a very emotional experience,"" says Rhiannon, ""but it was one that was very, very, very much for us the end."" Rhiannon could easily have ignored the email in June, but there was something about Kayleigh, she says, that meant she had to respond. In many ways, the two are polar opposites - Kayleigh is quiet and analytical, Rhiannon energetic and passionate. The Griffiths family needed practical advice on how to hold the trust to account. Richard and Rhiannon provided that, and in April 2017 a coroner ruled that Pippa's death was preventable as the trust had failed to give the family information that would have allowed them to recognise the seriousness of the infant's deteriorating condition. As the bond between the mothers deepened, their conversations morphed into something else.  Armed with little more than a gnawing suspicion, they started to scour the internet, coroner's records and death notices to see if any other families had received poor maternity care at the Shropshire trust. They collated 23 cases dating back to 2000 - including stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and babies born with brain injuries. Appalled by what they had found, they wrote to the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2016, asking him to order an investigation. He agreed and in May 2017, senior midwife Donna Ockenden was appointed to lead the review. ""We sat looking through the case notes of the original 23, and our opinion was these are really, really serious cases,"" Ms Ockenden told Panorama. ""These are amongst the most serious cases that we have seen in our careers.  The likelihood would be that when one tried to put together the full jigsaw there would be other cases but we didn't know that at the outset."" By now I was aware of significant problems at the trust. I'd met Richard and Rhiannon in late 2016, and when they outlined their concerns, I started investigating. In April 2017, I revealed there had been at least seven avoidable deaths at the trust in just 20 months. That initial story set me off on a five-year quest, an investigation that has helped unravel years of failure and grief. As I revealed more failures, the number of families approaching Donna Ockenden escalated rapidly. It was initially an investigation into 23 cases - but the review team has now examined the care that 1862 families received. Watch Panorama Maternity Scandal: Fighting for the Truth is on BBC One on Wednesday 23 February at 21:00 or watch later onBBC iPlayer One of the themes the inquiry has already noted, in an interim report published in December 2020, is that in many cases the trust failed to investigate after something went wrong, or simply carried out its own inquiry. Panorama has discovered the trust even developed its own investigation system, what they called a High Risk Case Review. It was outside any national framework that has been used to help learn lessons from incidents and doesn't appear to be a system that's used in any other NHS organisation. Another consequence of the unorthodox system was that fewer incidents were reported to NHS regulators, limiting the opportunity to learn lessons. One of the earliest cases on the original list of 23 compiled by the two couples was the death of Kathryn Leigh in 2000.  Panorama has investigated the case and discovered that a theme identified almost two decades ago was to come up repeatedly in subsequent incidents. Kathryn was delivered in a poor condition following an emergency caesarean section after her mother had been in labour all night. She needed to be resuscitated but the medics used the wrong equipment, and the baby died within 21 minutes of her birth. The trust admitted that error but refused to accept criticism of its maternity care at the inquest into Kathryn's death, held in April 2003. An expert witness called by the coroner told the court, ""In my opinion, Kathryn Leigh's need for resuscitation arose from incompetent management of her mother's pregnancy and labour"". That criticism, Panorama can reveal, did lead the family's lawyer to raise in court whether there was ""any kind of inbuilt policy or inbuilt bias towards trying to achieve natural births in as many cases as possible"".  The question also built on inquiries made by Kathryn's parents, Phil and Sonia. ""I wondered about the fact that I'd been left so long before going to C-section,"" said Sonia. ""I did a lot of research and found out that Shrewsbury Hospital had the lowest rate of C-sections in the whole of the UK."" Most of the cases the Ockenden review is examining date from 2000-2019. In their interim report, the essence of Sonia Leigh's concerns was strongly highlighted. The inquiry found that rates of caesarean sections at the trust in Shropshire were up to 12% lower than the England average for the period they are examining. The trust's reputation for unusually high numbers of vaginal births was known. Panorama has discovered that just a month before Kathryn Leigh's inquest, a parliamentary hearing was held to discuss concerns about the rising number of caesarean births across England. There was concern that child birth was being over-medicalised, and that too many women were having to undergo unnecessary surgical procedures, which like any operation carries risk. It also costs more money. One hospital was praised for its approach however - the Royal Shrewsbury.  At the time, its caesarean levels were half the England average, and a team from the hospital travelled to London. In the evidence session, seen by Panorama, the then clinical director of the Royal Shrewsbury told MPs: ""The culture of our organisation is that we have low intervention rates and once that is known we attract both midwives and obstetricians who like to practise in that way."" His colleague, the manager of women's service at the time, added that midwives who had worked elsewhere ""almost need retraining to be able to work in Shropshire.  We have recruited people who are like minded. If you want to keep something going and you believe in it, you do not want to employ people who do not believe in what you believe in."" Discussing the initial findings of her inquiry, Donna Ockenden told Panorama, ""There wereâ¯cases where an earlier recourse to caesarean section rather than a persistence towards a normal delivery may well haveâ¯led to a better outcome for mother or baby or both. Low caesarean section rates were a prize."" And the trust had been lauded for them. As the Griffiths and the Stanton-Davies families were striving to bring rigorous external scrutiny to the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, inside the organisation Bernie Bentick was also agitating for change. A consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist for nearly 30 years at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust until he retired in 2020, he's the first former staff member to speak openly about what was happening on the inside. He told Panorama that he wrote to senior management on several occasions highlighting problems. ""I was supported by a number of my clinical colleagues and wrote a long email to my line managers, to the chief executive, outlining the severity of the problems as I saw it - incidents of dysfunctional culture, of bullying, of the imposition of changes in clinical practice that many clinicians felt was unsafe."" He says that while there was a ""genuine attempt to try to ensure the best standards were achieved"" within the maternity department, the deteriorating culture made staff increasingly ""anxious"" and ""cautious"", making their performance ""less than ideal"". ""Because resources were scarce,"" said Dr Bentick, ""there was a tendency to blame individuals for not following guidelines rather than look at the underlying factors which may have led to a particular problem, and in particular staffing levels in the midwifery department. There were frequently not enough."" A lack of both midwives and consultants was a problem for years at the trust according to former employees that Panorama has spoken to.  But there are too few staff in maternity wards across the country, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). They say thousands more midwives and hundreds more obstetricians are needed now.  Maternity services, they say, need additional funding of up to Â£300m a year. In response to his complaints, Bernie Bentick said some ""cursory"" investigations were launched, but he felt that management never got to the heart of the problems. ""I believed that some of the ways they responded to problems were to try to preserve the reputation of the organisation rather than to do anything practical. ""They were prepared to make small, what they regarded as proportionate, changes to try to improve the situation. But I don't think they really understood the gravity of the cultural problems within the trust."" In recent years, he said, a gap developed between the management of the trust and its clinicians, which he says was mainly caused by a problem the whole NHS faces - the lack of good quality, trained managers who have as much professional accountability as clinicians. ""If the resources had been made available to employ adequate numbers, then the situation may have been profoundly different. I feel intense sorry and sadness for the families and I would hope that the NHS responds in a way that ensures that quality of care is at the forefront of what we provide in the NHS."" The Ockenden team, which at one point grew to more than 80 clinicians, has now spoken to more than 800 families. Their interim report found nine areas where the trust had repeatedly failed. As well as low caesarean rates, they highlighted the excessive use of forceps, the repeated misuse of a labour inducing drug, a failure to escalate concerns to senior clinicians and a lack of compassion and kindness in the delivery of care. ""I've heard of accounts where mothers were told quite clearly that it was their fault,"" said Donna Ockenden. ""And heard from fathers who have carried a tremendous amount of guilt that they should have been able to stand up for their wives and partners. And what I say to them is, it isn't your guilt to carry."" One recurring theme the Ockenden team picked up on was a failure by staff to properly monitor the baby's heart rate. The problem raises significant questions for all NHS bodies charged with overseeing trusts because the issue was highlighted as a problem at the Shropshire trust as far back as 2007. After the failure had been noted as a contributory factor in two babies being born with severe brain damage, in 2004 and 2005, the Healthcare Commission, the regulator at the time, wrote to the trust demanding action to ensure the problems ""are not repetitive and that learning is taking place"". But there's no evidence the regulator followed up, with repeated catastrophic consequences: September 2014, Kelly Jones had stillborn twins, Ella and Lola, after the trust failed to properly read and interpret their heart rates. 4 December 2015, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn.  The trust accepted they'd failure to monitor the foetal heart rate. 15 December 2015, Ivy Morris was born with a severe brain injury after staff monitored her mother's heart rate rather than Ivy's and failed to spot she was in distress.  She died aged four months. Despite the errors, the new regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), didn't pick up on the problem. Its reports, following inspections of the trust in October 2014 and December 2016, make no mention of a problem with monitoring baby's heart rates.  It wasn't until November 2018, when the CQC rated the trust as inadequate, that the need for training in monitoring baby's heart rates is mentioned. Kelly Jones Chief Inspector of Hospitals at the CQC, Professor Ted Baker, robustly defended his organisation's handling of the trust. ""The families of Shrewsbury and Telford have been really important in driving forward the improvements,"" he told Panorama. ""The regulators identified problems in the maternity service and have subsequently taken enforcement action.  I don't accept that [we didn't spot the problems]."" In a statement, the trust told the BBC they took ""full responsibility"" for the failings in maternity care.  ""We offer our sincere apologies for all the distress and hurt we know this caused. ""Apologies alone are not enough and must be backed up with clear and meaningful action. We have made strong progress, including significant investment in additional staff and staff training. We have completed more than 80% of the recommendations in the interim Ockenden Report."" They added that the term High Risk Case Review is ""no longer used"", adding that its ""aligning"" its investigation systems with those ""being developed across the NHS in England."" The sheer scale of the maternity errors in Shropshire means the well of grief may run deeper here, but it's not the only area to have failed women and babies. In recent years, independent investigations have been ordered into maternity services in Cumbria, East Kent, Nottingham and South Wales. Since 2017, the CQC has been rating the safety of maternity services in England.  Its latest figures show that 41% of units need to improve their safety, while just 1% are rated as outstanding.  The CQC says the rate of improvement is not good enough and Jo Mountfield, vice president of the RCOG, says it's ""probably"" because the patients are women. ""I think women's health and research in this country should be given much higher priority. I think women's voices need to be heard much more loudly."" The interim Ockenden report led to a near Â£100m investment in maternity services in England.  NHS England wrote to all health trusts last week telling them to no longer limit the number of caesarean sections they offer women. They also said they were committed to providing safe, compassionate maternity services. The publication of the final report by Donna Ockenden next month will be a watershed moment in the history of the NHS - the revelation of multiple instances of maternity failures in a rural corner of England. Pippa Griffiths and Kate Stanton-Davies lived fewer than 40 hours between them, but their legacy, in terms of improved maternity care, could last decades. Photographs by Phil Coomes Â© 2025 BBC.

"The crisis in Ukraine has led to renewed focus on London's role as a centre for Russian money Labour is urging the government to fast-track plans to clamp down on economic crime, amid pressure over UK links to Russia. Sir Keir Starmer called for long-promised legislation to be introduced in the coming days, adding there's ""no reason to delay"". The Economic Crime Bill is expected to bring in new transparency measures for UK firms and property. Boris Johnson said the bill would be put forward within the next year. At Prime Minister's Questions, he said he was ""proud"" of the government's attempts to ""root out corrupt Russian money"". UK out in front on Russia sanctions, says Johnson What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Why is Putin ordering troops into Ukraine? The bill has reportedly been under consideration for some time, but has come under greater focus amid tensions with Russia over Ukraine. The UK has joined other Western countries in introducing sanctions after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two rebel-held regions of eastern Ukraine he recognised as independent on Monday. Ministers have since faced increasing calls from opposition parties to take action against Russians accused of financial crime or with links to the Kremlin. During PMQs, Sir Keir called on the prime minister to introduce the bill before the current session of Parliament is due to end in a few weeks' time. He added: ""He will have our support - there's no reason to delay this,"" telling MPs Russia had already ""invaded"" Ukraine and it was ""time to act"". The prime minister replied that the legislation would be introduced in the next parliamentary session, which begins in the spring. Mr Johnson said it would allow the UK to ""peel back the faÃ§ade"" of who ultimately owns properties and companies based in the UK. ""It's gone on for far too long, we are going to tackle it under this government,"" he added. President Putin's decision to order troops into Donetsk and Luhansk has sparked outrage from Western allies The government has never given a precise timetable of when the bill would be introduced - or details of what it will contain. After he quit as a Treasury minister last month over the government's record in tackling Covid fraud, Tory peer Lord Agnewwrote in the Financial Times,externalthat the government had recently ""foolishly rejected"" introducing it next year. The government has said since 2016 it plans a new register of the beneficial owners of UK property - an idea it also recommitted to as part of a foreign policy review published in March 2021. As part of that review, it also said it was looking at reform of Companies House - the body responsible for registering UK companies. Transparency campaigners have long called for the body to get greater powers to monitor and investigate firms, amid concern the UK is becoming a haven for the registration of shell companies. Ministers have previously said they were looking at requiring more information from people registering companies, as well as additional checks. But speaking in the Commons during a debate on economic crime on Wednesday, Labour shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden said there was an ""enormous gulf"" between ministers' ""rhetoric"" and their actions so far.

"This video can not be played Britain will provide a ""further package of military support"" to help Ukraine says the PM Boris Johnson has defended his sanctions against Russia, saying the UK is ""out in front"" globally when it comes to action against Vladimir Putin. He promised a ""further package of military support"" for Ukraine, with the assets of five Russian banks and three Russian billionaires already frozen. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the PM to bring in laws to stop oligarchs buying UK firms and property. But Mr Johnson said no government could ""conceivably be doing more"". Russian President Mr Putin ordered troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine on Monday, after recognising them as independent. It is not clear if any new Russian troops have yet been sent into the two regions, which are run by Moscow-backed separatists. Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Mr Putin had gone ""full tonto"" in escalating the Ukraine crisis, adding that he had ""no friends, no alliances"" internationally. In comments made to serving military personnel, the former Scots Guards officer added that his regiment had ""kicked the backside"" of Russia's Tsar Nicolas I in the Crimean war in the mid-19th Century, arguing that ""we can always do it again"".

""The prime minister promised that in the event of an invasion he would unleash a full package of sanctions. If not now, then when?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""I don't think people quite realise the UK is out in front. We have sanctioned 275 individuals already."" He added: ""There is more to come and we will be stopping Russia from raising sovereign debt, stopping companies from raising money and stopping Russian companies... even clearing in sterling and dollars on international markets."" UK ready to escalate Russia sanctions, says Truss What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How much Russian money is there in the UK? Mr Johnson also confirmed that media watchdog Ofcom was reviewing Russia Today's licence to broadcast in the UK. And he said an Economic Crime Bill would be brought forward in the next parliamentary session to ""peel back the facade"" of beneficial ownership by Russians and others of UK property and companies.

"People have described the state of the road as looking like the aftermath of an earthquake A ripped up road likened to being hit by an earthquake could take up to a year to fix and cost millions of pounds, a council has said. The B4069 near Lyneham in Wiltshire has buckled in places, leaving huge cracks in the road, due to subsidence. An emergency road closure was put in place on 17 February but police said some drivers were ignoring it, putting themselves and workers in danger. Wiltshire Council said it was awaiting a report from geotechnical specialists. Local residents claim the subsidence has been getting worse over the last year and that a landslip was inevitable. An investigation is under way into the cause. Police said some drivers have been ignoring the closure signs Dr Mark McClelland, Wiltshire Council cabinet member for transport, told BBC Radio Wiltshire: ""It could costs hundreds of thousands or up into the millions [to fix]. ""There is significant damage to the road. It could be up to 12 months in total. It's not something that can be resolved in a matter of days or weeks."" Dr McClelland said people's description of it looking like an earthquake or the San Andreas Fault were ""accurate"", with the road ""buckled three to four feet in places"". Dr Mark McClelland said they had never seen anything like it before He said the council would wait until it had the report before deciding the next steps and asked drivers to obey the signs in place. ""The underlying ground has slipped and we need to understand why that has happened,"" he said. ""This road has been subject to remedial works in the past and it has been a difficult road to deal with, but we've never seen anything like this before. ""The police have been very clear that it's very dangerous for motorists to ignore signage."" Brendan Watkins, who runs the nearby Peterborough Arms pub, said the closure is already having an impact on trade. ""It's been quite bad. We lost about 50% of our restaurant bookings this weekend,"" he said. ""It's a big job but it needs to be done as quickly as possible because local businesses are suffering."" Local businesses said the closure is having an impact on trade Jay Collings, director of 3Sixty Bodyworx, a car body workshop on the B4069, said the road has been an issue for many years. ""I'm surprised it's not been shut earlier. All they've been doing is patching it up and not addressing the problem. ""I think they should put a weight limit in or put money into it and do it correctly. They need to invest in the safety of the road,"" he said. The road will remain closed while further investigations take place and motorists have been urged to follow the diversion. Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"President Putin's video message took place on a public holiday to mark Defend the Fatherland Day President Vladimir Putin has insisted that Russia's interests and security are non-negotiable, amid reports of more Russian troops moving closer towards Ukraine's borders. Mr Putin gave a video address, hours after US President Joe Biden warned of ""the beginning of a Russian invasion"". Russia was always ""open for direct and honest dialogue"", Mr Putin said, but he had full confidence in the military. The West has announced a range of sanctions on Russian interests. ""We've cut off Russia's government from Western financing,"" Mr Biden said, after Russia's upper house of parliament authorised the president to send troops into two parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists. EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? THE BASICS:What does Putin want? FACT-CHECKED:Vladimir Putin's Ukraine speech Mr Putin declared on Monday night that Russia had recognised the independence of the so-called people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, tearing up a peace accord with Ukraine. Ukraine's foreign ministry urged all its citizens to leave Russia, warning that the ""escalating Russia aggression against Ukraine"" could limit consular assistance. The military in Kyiv also announced it was immediately calling up all reservists aged 18 to 60, both officers and privates for a maximum of a year. Meanwhile, in the rebel-held areas, separatist leader Denis Pushilin said military mobilisation was gathering pace to counter what he described as Ukrainian aggression, adding that he could also ask Russia for help. Appearing alongside him, a senior official from Russia's ruling United Russia party said 93,000 people had been evacuated to Russia. Moscow has also begun evacuating its embassy in Kyiv and has lowered its flag there, reports say. This video can not be played Watch: US announces full-blocking sanctions on Russia President Putin's claim that the military would go to ""maintain peace"" was derided as nonsense by the West. Rejecting his spurious claim of genocide in eastern Ukraine, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was concerned about ""the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping"". Mr Biden said ""to put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine"". Despite Mr Putin's insistence that he was still open to diplomacy, France's foreign minister and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken both cancelled planned meetings with Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian later said Mr Putin's aim was to ""negate"" Ukraine as a sovereign country. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Mr Putin was trying to turn back the wheel of history. But both said they were open to further negotiations with Moscow. It is not yet clear if any Russian troops have yet crossed the border into Ukraine. However, US satellite imagery has highlighted several new troop and equipment deployments in western Russia, and more than 100 vehicles at an airfield in Belarus near Ukraine's border. A handout satellite image made available by Maxar Technologies shows troop tents and a housing area in Pochep, Russia Mr Biden said he was announcing an initial tranche of measures, targeting high-ranking Russia's ""elites"" and its foreign debt, to prevent it raising state financing from Western financial institutions. The European Union and UK also announced a wave of sanctions against Russian banks and individuals on Tuesday: Germany alsohalted a major joint infrastructure project with Russia, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline,despite Europe's reliance on Russian gas supplies and the fact that the â¬10bn (Â£8.3bn) project is ready to open supply lines All 27 EU member states agreed a range of anti-Russia measures, targeting all 351 members of Russia's lower house who voted to recognise the two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent states. The EU's response also targets 27 individuals and entities involved in the decision. Sources say Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister spokeswoman Maria Zakharova face a travel ban and asset freeze. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedthat five banks have had their assets frozen in Britain, along with three Russian billionaires who will be hit with UK travel bans. Canada, Japan and Australia later confirmed similar measures Ukraine's parliament voted on Wednesday to impose sanctions on 351 Russian individuals. European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova said it was a mistake to exclude the Russian leader. ""Vladimir Putin should be first on the list,"" she told Czech daily Hospodarske Noviny. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said theUK would use ""every lever at our disposal""to stop Russia's threats against Ukraine. Responding to criticism from some MPs that the UK government had not gone far enough Ms Truss wrote in The Times that G7 allies had agreed on further sanctions and ""nothing is off the table"".

"The entrance to a virtual strip club, accessed by the VRChat app Some apps in the virtual-reality metaverse are ""dangerous by design"", the NSPCC has warned in response to a BBC News investigation. A researcher posing as a 13-year-old girl witnessed grooming, sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat in the virtual-reality world. The children's charity said it was ""shocked and angry"" at the findings. Head of online child safety policy Andy Burrows added the investigation had found ""a toxic combination of risks"". The BBC News researcher - using an app with a minimum age rating of 13 - visited virtual-reality rooms where avatars were simulating sex. She was shown sex toys and condoms, and approached by numerous adult men. The metaverse is the name given to games and experiences accessed by people wearing virtual reality headsets. The technology, previously confined to gaming, could be adapted for use in many other areas - from work to play, concerts to cinema trips. Mark Zuckerberg thinks it could be the future of the internet - so much so, he recently rebranded Facebook as Meta, with the company investing billions developing its Oculus Quest headset. That headset - now rebranded the Meta Quest - is thought to have as much as 75% of the market share. It was one of these headsets which the BBC News researcher used to explore an app, and part of the metaverse. The app, called VRChat, is an online virtual platform which users can explore with 3D avatars. While it is not made by Facebook, it can be downloaded from an app store on Facebook's Meta Quest headset, with no age verification checks - the only requirement being a Facebook account. The BBC News researcher created a fake profile to set up her account - and her real identity was not checked. Inside VRChat, there are rooms where users can meet: some are innocent and everyday - such as a McDonald's restaurant, for example - but there are also pole-dancing and strip clubs. Children mix freely with adults. Roblox: The children's game with a sex problem Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse? Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse One man told our researcher that avatars can ""get naked and do unspeakable things"". Others talked about ""erotic role-play"". Following the BBC News investigation, the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) said improvements in online safety are a matter of urgency. Mr Burrows, from the NSPCC, told us what we had found was ""extraordinary"". ""It's children being exposed to entirely inappropriate, really incredibly harmful experiences,"" he said. He believes technology companies have learned little from mistakes made with the first generation of social media. ""This is a product that is dangerous by design, because of oversight and neglect. We are seeing products rolled out without any suggestion that safety has been considered,"" he said. Meta says it does have tools that allow players to block other users, and is looking to make safety improvements ""as it learns how people interact in these spaces"". There are pole dancing clubs and dungeons BBC News also spoke to a safety campaigner who has spent months investigating VRChat and who now posts his videos on YouTube. He has spoken to children who say they were groomed on the platform and forced to take part in virtual sex. He chooses to remain anonymous because he is concerned for the safety of his family. The safety campaigner explained because VR is so immersive, children actually have to act out sexual movements. BBC researcher Jess Sherwood This video can not be played Undercover BBC researcher witnesses sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat in metaverse I was surprised how totally immersed in the spaces you are. I started to feel like a child again. So when grown men were asking why I wasn't in school and encouraging me to engage in VR sex acts, it felt all the more disturbing. VRChat definitely felt more like an adult's playground than a child's. A lot of the rooms were overtly sexualised in pink neon, similar to what you might see in the red light district in Amsterdam or in the more seedy parts of London's Soho at night. Inside, sex toys were on display. The music playing in the rooms, which can be controlled by the players, adds to the impression that it is not a space that is suitable for children. Everything about the rooms feels unnerving. There are characters simulating sex acts on the floor in big groups, speaking to one another like children play-acting at being adult couples. It's very uncomfortable, and your options are to stay and watch, move on to another room where you might see something similar, or join in - which, on many occasions, I was instructed to do. People whose job it is to observe developments in VR are also concerned. Catherine Allen runs the consultancy Limina Immersive and is currently writing a report about VR for the Institute of Engineering and Technology. She says her research team has found many of their experiences in VR ""fun and surreal"", but others have been ""quite traumatic and disturbing"". She described one incident in a Meta-owned app where she encountered a seven-year-old girl. A group of men surrounded them both and joked about raping them. Ms Allen said she had to step between the men and the child to protect her. ""I shouldn't have had to do that, but that's because there's no moderation, or apparently very little moderation."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's technology correspondent Marc Cieslak enters the metaverse VR and the metaverse are not specifically mentioned inthe UK's forthcoming Online Safety Bill, which is due before parliament in the coming months. But in evidence to Parliament last year, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries made it clear the legislation would cover the technology. The bill, when passed, would impose a duty of care on platforms and providers to protect children from harmful content. VRChat told us it was ""working hard to make itself a safe and welcoming place for everyone."" It said ""predatory and toxic behaviour has no place on the platform"". Meta's product manager for VR integrity Bill Stillwell said in a statement: ""We want everyone using our products to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help in situations like these, so we can investigate and take action."" He added: ""For cross platform appsâ¦we provide tools that allow players to report and block users. ""We will continue to make improvements as we learn more about how people interact in these spaces."" Charities advise parents to check which apps their children are using on VR Headsets and, where possible, try them out for themselves, to assess whether they're appropriate. Many apps allow users to simultaneously ""cast"" their experience to a phone or laptop, so a parent can watch what's going on at the same time as their child plays.

Mohammed Ali Ege is wanted by police in connection withAamir Siddiqi's murder. Two hitmenwere convicted of the 17-year-old's murder in a killing for hire which went wrong at his Cardiff home in front of his parents in 2010. South Wales Police said his hunt remains a priority. After escaping custody in India five years ago Mohammed Ali Ege is thought to have travelled across three continents. Aamir's mother and father, Parveen and Sheikh Iqbal Ahmed, were also injured in the attack that killed their son But the fugitive known asWales' most wanted manis still at large despite police appeals afterfleeing capture in 2017 as he awaited extradition. Aamir's sister said the family ""won't rest easy"" until the 44-year-old ""faces justice"". Aamir believed he was opening the door to a teacher in April 2010 when he was stabbed to death in a frenzied drug-fuelled attack by contract killers Jason Richards and Ben Hope. Ben Hope and Jason Richards were convicted of murder at Swansea Crown Court They burst screeching into Aamir's home wearing balaclavas, and stabbed him in the hallway. His parents were injured as they fought the attackers in vain as they tried to save their son. How error led to tragic Aamir murder Wrong-house murder 'an open wound' for family On-the-run murder suspect 'getting cash' The two heroin addicts were paid Â£1,000 to kill an innocent businessman and father-of-four who lived in a neighbouring street in the Roath area of Cardiff - but they went to the wrong house and killed Aamir. Both hitmen were given a minimum of 40 years in prison each, but the man accused of hiring them was Mohammed Ali Ege, who a court heard was angry over a collapsed property deal. Five months after Aamir's murder, South Wales Police offered a Â£10,000 reward for information on his whereabouts. Aamir Siddiqi was studying law and was also interested in politics when he was killed He was arrested in India in October 2011 on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. But after being taken to court in April 2017 to await extradition, he escaped from Indian police at a New Delhi railway station after removing a grill from a toilet window. Miriam Siddiqi wants to see the man said to be behind her brother's death face justice Now Miriam Siddiqi, Aamir's older sister has shed fresh light on the ""multiple countries"" he is believed to have travelled to after escaping Indian authorities. The Siddiqi family has been receiving updates from detectives. Police in Wales are still waiting to question Mohammed Ali Ege about Aamir Siddiqi's murder ""He's a man of means, he's a man of power and to be able to evade police for so many years, you cannot do that alone just by having a few false passports,"" said Ms Siddiqi. ""You need to be able to have a network that supports you and it felt as if he was using that time very wisely. ""When he escaped from India he left the country very quickly"". Ms Siddiqi said he was last thought to be in the Middle East and there were ""recent updates"" on the effort to make him face justice. ""I know that for a fact he travelled to multiple countries before we've heard that he's in Dubai,"" she said. She said he is believed to have travelled to Sri Lanka, and several countries in Africa, including Morocco or Tunisia, before eventually travelling to Dubai, where he was thought to have been as recently as last year. ""He's still at large, he's still living some sort of life,"" she said. Aamir Siddiqi was stabbed to death at his family home in Ninian Road in Roath, Cardiff She said detectives believed as recently as last year that he was in Dubai. She said: ""I know that he hasn't stayed in one place for very long"". Aamir's sister says her parents 'can't rest easy' until Mohammed Ali Ege 'has been brought to justice' Mohammed Ali Ege was born in Dubai in October 1977, and later settled in Wales. He is known to have used different names, identities and passports. In 2019 South Wales Police said they believed he may have been receiving financial support from within Wales. Officers searched several addresses in Cardiff at the time. South Wales Police said it ""continues to work with the National Crime Agency and international law enforcement agencies to trace Mohammed Ali Ege and return him to the UK"". In a statement, the force said: ""From our ongoing investigation to trace him we know that he has travelled"". It added: ""His current whereabouts remain unknown but if and when Mohammed Ali Ege is arrested anywhere in the world, current arrangements are in place to ensure that South Wales Police would be notified immediately."" Det Insp Stuart Wales from the force's Major Crime Investigations Team said: ""Nearly 12 years may have passed but until Mohammed Ali Ege is located and brought back to the UK, this remains a live and priority investigation for South Wales Police."". Mohammed Ali Ege escaped police custody before he was due to be extradited from India Ms Siddiqi has praised the work of Welsh detectives, but said she was ""frustrated"" by elements of the international appeal for Mr Ege. She has criticised the fact that there is no public appeal from the UK for him on the global police agency, Interpol's 'wanted person' list. There is a public Interpol appeal from Indian Police, known as a public facing red notice, but that is for passport and forgery charges he faces in India. She said: ""Maybe this has been a missed opportunity... ""Had it been on there I don't know what the results could have been, could he have been in the UK by now?"" Police released new images in 2021 of Mohammed Ali Ege while he was in police custody in India BBC Wales understands a red notice from South Wales Police does exist, and has been shared with police forces, but has not been made public. However, Ms Siddiqi believes this should be made public given how far Mohammed Ali Ege is said to have travelled, and how long he has managed to evade police. South Wales Police said: ""Red notice status is a matter for the Home Office and Interpol"". Det Insp Wales added: ""There are numerous appeals for information in relation to Mohammed Ali Ege on Interpol, the Major Investigation Public Portal, Crimestoppers, the South Wales Police website and many local, national and international media reports."". Interpol said that ""every red notice request is checked by a specialised task force to ensure it is compliant"" and added that the ""review takes into account information available at the time of publication"". The Home Office said: ""We can't comment on individual Interpol red notices."" Ms Siddiqi said: ""It is important that you find him - he has the most serious charges waiting for him in the UK."" She said her family would ""forever be indebted to South Wales Police"" for catching Aamir's killers, but the only way her parents ""will be able to rest easy in their lifetime"" is if Mr Ege faces justice in Wales. This video can not be played Mohammed Ali Ege is wanted by police in connection to Aamir Siddiqi's murder ""I don't think I'll ever stop grieving because I don't think I'll ever stop loving Aamir."" In a direct appeal to Mr Ege, she said: ""If he had no involvement in this, tell us that you didn't. ""My parents are suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, my parents suffer from trauma and they have to live with that for the rest of their lives."" Allow Twitter content?

"Julia Garner plays Anna Sorokin in Inventing Anna Inventing Anna has notched up the most viewing hours for an English-language series in a week since the service began a new ratings system last summer. The nine-part show stars Ozark's Julia Garner as fake heiress Anna Sorokin. It was watched for 196 million hours last week, on top of 77 million hours of viewing on the weekend of its release on 11 February. The previous highest was psychological thriller show You, whose third season achieved 179 million hours in October. Next on the list of the top English-language series are The Witcher, Maid and Sex Education. But Squid Game, the Korean-language survival drama, remains Netflix's most-watched show overall, peaking at almost 572 million hours in a single week. Another South Korean show, All of Us Are Dead, and Spanish crime drama Money Heist have scored 236 million and 202 million hours respectively. This video can not be played Anna Sorokin in March 2021: ""I never thought I was cheating"" Inventing Anna is based on a New York magazine investigation into Sorokin, who, going by the name of Anna Delvey, convinced people she was a wealthy European heiress. In fact, she turned out to have conned friends, hotels and banks out of eye-watering amounts of money and was eventually convicted on multiple fraud charges in 2019. The series follows the tenacious journalist Vivian Kent, played by Anna Chlumsky, in her attempts to discover the truth. Inventing Anna: The Netflix show versus reality Listen: Fake Heiress podcast on BBC Sounds The stranger-than-fiction story has been adapted by producer/screenwriter Shonda Rhimes and her company Shondaland, the creators of Bridgerton, Grey's Anatomy and Scandal. The cast also includes Laverne Cox (Orange is the New Black), Arian Moayed (Succession) and Terry Kinney (Billions). While it has been a hit with viewers, the show has also courted controversy, after real-life journalist Rachel DeLoache Williams, who is played by Katie Lowes, criticised its ""shocking"" portrayal of her. Williams became friends with Sorokin when she was a photojournalist at Vanity Fair.Speaking to her former publication,external, she condemned what she described as ""dangerous half-truths"" in the show and said the series created ""problematic"" empathy for a ""sociopathic, narcissistic, proven criminal"". ""Having had a front-row seat for far too long, I've studied the way a con works more than anybody needs to,"" said Williams, who was herself conned out of $62,000 (Â£45,500) by Sorokin. ""You watch the spectacle, but you're not paying attention to what's being marketed."" Sorokin is currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody but responded on Instagram, criticising Williams' ""flexible moral standards"" and ""blatant hypocrisy"".

"The entrance to a virtual strip club, accessed by the VRChat app Some apps in the virtual-reality metaverse are ""dangerous by design"", the NSPCC has warned in response to a BBC News investigation. A researcher posing as a 13-year-old girl witnessed grooming, sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat in the virtual-reality world. The children's charity said it was ""shocked and angry"" at the findings. Head of online child safety policy Andy Burrows added the investigation had found ""a toxic combination of risks"". The BBC News researcher - using an app with a minimum age rating of 13 - visited virtual-reality rooms where avatars were simulating sex. She was shown sex toys and condoms, and approached by numerous adult men. The metaverse is the name given to games and experiences accessed by people wearing virtual reality headsets. The technology, previously confined to gaming, could be adapted for use in many other areas - from work to play, concerts to cinema trips. Mark Zuckerberg thinks it could be the future of the internet - so much so, he recently rebranded Facebook as Meta, with the company investing billions developing its Oculus Quest headset. That headset - now rebranded the Meta Quest - is thought to have as much as 75% of the market share. It was one of these headsets which the BBC News researcher used to explore an app, and part of the metaverse. The app, called VRChat, is an online virtual platform which users can explore with 3D avatars. While it is not made by Facebook, it can be downloaded from an app store on Facebook's Meta Quest headset, with no age verification checks - the only requirement being a Facebook account. The BBC News researcher created a fake profile to set up her account - and her real identity was not checked. Inside VRChat, there are rooms where users can meet: some are innocent and everyday - such as a McDonald's restaurant, for example - but there are also pole-dancing and strip clubs. Children mix freely with adults. Roblox: The children's game with a sex problem Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse? Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse One man told our researcher that avatars can ""get naked and do unspeakable things"". Others talked about ""erotic role-play"". Following the BBC News investigation, the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) said improvements in online safety are a matter of urgency. Mr Burrows, from the NSPCC, told us what we had found was ""extraordinary"". ""It's children being exposed to entirely inappropriate, really incredibly harmful experiences,"" he said. He believes technology companies have learned little from mistakes made with the first generation of social media. ""This is a product that is dangerous by design, because of oversight and neglect. We are seeing products rolled out without any suggestion that safety has been considered,"" he said. Meta says it does have tools that allow players to block other users, and is looking to make safety improvements ""as it learns how people interact in these spaces"". There are pole dancing clubs and dungeons BBC News also spoke to a safety campaigner who has spent months investigating VRChat and who now posts his videos on YouTube. He has spoken to children who say they were groomed on the platform and forced to take part in virtual sex. He chooses to remain anonymous because he is concerned for the safety of his family. The safety campaigner explained because VR is so immersive, children actually have to act out sexual movements. BBC researcher Jess Sherwood This video can not be played Undercover BBC researcher witnesses sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat in metaverse I was surprised how totally immersed in the spaces you are. I started to feel like a child again. So when grown men were asking why I wasn't in school and encouraging me to engage in VR sex acts, it felt all the more disturbing. VRChat definitely felt more like an adult's playground than a child's. A lot of the rooms were overtly sexualised in pink neon, similar to what you might see in the red light district in Amsterdam or in the more seedy parts of London's Soho at night. Inside, sex toys were on display. The music playing in the rooms, which can be controlled by the players, adds to the impression that it is not a space that is suitable for children. Everything about the rooms feels unnerving. There are characters simulating sex acts on the floor in big groups, speaking to one another like children play-acting at being adult couples. It's very uncomfortable, and your options are to stay and watch, move on to another room where you might see something similar, or join in - which, on many occasions, I was instructed to do. People whose job it is to observe developments in VR are also concerned. Catherine Allen runs the consultancy Limina Immersive and is currently writing a report about VR for the Institute of Engineering and Technology. She says her research team has found many of their experiences in VR ""fun and surreal"", but others have been ""quite traumatic and disturbing"". She described one incident in a Meta-owned app where she encountered a seven-year-old girl. A group of men surrounded them both and joked about raping them. Ms Allen said she had to step between the men and the child to protect her. ""I shouldn't have had to do that, but that's because there's no moderation, or apparently very little moderation."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's technology correspondent Marc Cieslak enters the metaverse VR and the metaverse are not specifically mentioned inthe UK's forthcoming Online Safety Bill, which is due before parliament in the coming months. But in evidence to Parliament last year, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries made it clear the legislation would cover the technology. The bill, when passed, would impose a duty of care on platforms and providers to protect children from harmful content. VRChat told us it was ""working hard to make itself a safe and welcoming place for everyone."" It said ""predatory and toxic behaviour has no place on the platform"". Meta's product manager for VR integrity Bill Stillwell said in a statement: ""We want everyone using our products to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help in situations like these, so we can investigate and take action."" He added: ""For cross platform appsâ¦we provide tools that allow players to report and block users. ""We will continue to make improvements as we learn more about how people interact in these spaces."" Charities advise parents to check which apps their children are using on VR Headsets and, where possible, try them out for themselves, to assess whether they're appropriate. Many apps allow users to simultaneously ""cast"" their experience to a phone or laptop, so a parent can watch what's going on at the same time as their child plays.

"This video can not be played Britain will provide a ""further package of military support"" to help Ukraine says the PM Boris Johnson has defended his sanctions against Russia, saying the UK is ""out in front"" globally when it comes to action against Vladimir Putin. He promised a ""further package of military support"" for Ukraine, with the assets of five Russian banks and three Russian billionaires already frozen. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the PM to bring in laws to stop oligarchs buying UK firms and property. But Mr Johnson said no government could ""conceivably be doing more"". Russian President Mr Putin ordered troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine on Monday, after recognising them as independent. It is not clear if any new Russian troops have yet been sent into the two regions, which are run by Moscow-backed separatists. Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Mr Putin had gone ""full tonto"" in escalating the Ukraine crisis, adding that he had ""no friends, no alliances"" internationally. In comments made to serving military personnel, the former Scots Guards officer added that his regiment had ""kicked the backside"" of Russia's Tsar Nicolas I in the Crimean war in the mid-19th Century, arguing that ""we can always do it again"". This video can not be played Watch Defence Secretary Ben Wallace say that Vladimir Putin has gone ""full tonto"" over Russian actions in Ukraine Amid a largely sombre atmosphere at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: ""We all want to deter aggression in Europe. ""We are not dealing with breakaway republics. Putin is not a peacekeeper. A sovereign nation has been invaded. ""The prime minister promised that in the event of an invasion he would unleash a full package of sanctions. If not now, then when?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""I don't think people quite realise the UK is out in front. We have sanctioned 275 individuals already."" He added: ""There is more to come and we will be stopping Russia from raising sovereign debt, stopping companies from raising money and stopping Russian companies... even clearing in sterling and dollars on international markets."" UK ready to escalate Russia sanctions, says Truss What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How much Russian money is there in the UK? Mr Johnson also confirmed that media watchdog Ofcom was reviewing Russia Today's licence to broadcast in the UK. And he said an Economic Crime Bill would be brought forward in the next parliamentary session to ""peel back the facade"" of beneficial ownership by Russians and others of UK property and companies. But Sir Keir said this should be brought forward to the current session, adding that Labour would support such a move. Downing Street would not provide further details on the equipment being provided to Ukraine, for ""operational security reasons"".

The prime minister's spokesman said on Wednesday: ""We can do this under existing legislation. ""We are finalising the evidence to bring forward new designations against the 351 members of the Russian State Assembly [or Duma] and the members of the Federation Council who voted in that way.""

Sources have told the BBC that Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has written up a ""long list"" of Russian individuals and organisations, including more oligarchs and banks close to the Kremlin, to be sanctioned if the situation in Ukraine gets worse.

"Average UK petrol and diesel prices have hit new highs as the Ukraine crisis continues to affect oil prices, the RAC has said. On Wednesday, petrol prices rose  to 149.30p per litre amid warnings it could soon pass Â£1.50. Oil prices jumped after Russia ordered troops into two Ukrainian regions this week to ""maintain peace"". Wholesale gas prices also continue to climb, threatening to further push up heating bills. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top producer of natural gas globally. The UK only gets 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Oil prices surge as Ukraine-Russia tensions climb Putin tells Russians security is non-negotiable Former National Grid boss Steve Holliday told the BBC's Today programme: ""For the UK, it's a price issue, it's not a security supply issue. ""We already know that we've got consumers that are already experiencing huge jumps in their energy bills, so this is really very unwelcome."" The price of Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, hit a seven-year high of more than $99 (Â£73) on Tuesday before falling back on Wednesday. However, fuel pump prices lag behind oil prices and the RAC has warned petrol could go higher than Â£1.50 a litre in the coming days. Diesel has also risen, hitting 152.68p a litre on Wednesday. Justin Yates and Matt Williams run a removals company Matt Williams, 30, runs Williams & Yates, a removals company that operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 11 vans and lorries. Rising fuel costs have forced it to put up its prices and he fears it might impact the business in the months ahead. ""Unfortunately, we do have to pass [these costs] onto the customer,"" he told the BBC. ""All the competition has to do the same, but I think it does make some consumers reconsider their moving options."" The firm offers basic and bespoke services, and he expects more customers to choose the cheaper option in the coming months rather than ""paying loads of money"". Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, a trade body for independent UK forecourts, said whether fuel prices continue to rise depends on a number of factors. ""If [conflict] really sparks off in Ukraine, we could prices escalating dramatically,"" he said. However, he added that the US is in the process of negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran which could see more oil come onto the market. UK wholesale gas prices also jumped following Germany's decision on Tuesday to halt the final approval of Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline connecting the country with Russia. That decision drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. Allow Twitter content?

""Well, welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay â¬2,000 for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas!""he tweeted,external- suggesting prices were set to double. UK gas prices for delivery in March rose by 13.5p to 200p per therm, though that is still much lower than the highs of December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. The UK said it was ready to impose further sanctions in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, targeting more Russian banks and individuals as well as companies in the energy, defence, technology and chemical sectors. After a volatile trading session on Tuesday, global stock markets climbed on Wednesday before falling back again. Towards the end of the day, the UK's FTSE 100 was flat while France's CAC-40 and Germany's Dax had lost between 0.2% and 0.5%. The main three US indexes were all in the red. High energy prices in the UK have played a major part in pushing up the cost of living recently, while wages have lagged behind price rises. Inflation currently stands at 5.5% - its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee of MPs on Wednesday, Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said energy prices accounted for nearly half of the rise in inflation over the last year. That is likely to rise to 70% in the first three months of 2022, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. The Bank deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said: ""If you look at the increase in energy bills this year, it is just about twice as big as any single year in the 1970s - it is enormous."" The Bank expects inflation to hit 7% in spring when the price cap on household energy bills is raised. This is far above the Bank of England's 2% target. From April, about 18 million homes on standard tariffs will see an average increase of Â£693. Meanwhile, 4.5 million prepayment customers can expect their energy costs to rise by an average Â£708. Consumers are also being squeezed by rising prices on goods as many companies pass on higher costs such as fuel, shipping and wages to their customers. As well as the rise in energy prices in April, staff, companies and the self-employed will also have to pay an extra 1.25p on the pound in National Insurance. The rise is being introduced by the government to fund health and social care.

"Barclays has suspended millions of pounds in bonus share awards to former boss Jes Staley amid an investigation by regulators into his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Staley left the bank last November after watchdogs began a probe into his links to the dead sex trafficker. Mr Staley is contesting the City regulators' findings. But Barclays has announced that in the meantime it is freezing long-term bonus and share payments for Mr Staley. Mr Staley's share awards that have been suspended are worth nearly Â£22m based on Barclays' share price on Wednesday. The bank said in a statement: ""In line with its normal procedures, the committee exercised its discretion to suspend the vesting of all of Mr Staley's unvested awards, pending further developments in respect of the regulatory and legal proceedings related to the ongoing Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) investigation regarding Mr Staley."" Regulators are investigating whether Mr Staley's relationship with Epstein was closer than he described to the board. Deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein According to Barclays latest annual report, Mr Staley holds 9 million unvested shares - stock that has been promised but not yet paid out - which are subject to performance targets, and an additional 2.1 million shares not subject to targets. Based on Barclays' latest share price, Mr Staley's package is worth Â£21.9m. He also holds an additional 6.7 million shares that he owns outright. These are worth Â£13.1m. Barclays revealed the move as it published its full-year results which showed a sharp rise in pre-tax profits to Â£8.4bn for 2021 compared to Â£3.1bn the previous year. Barclays' share price rose by 3.3% to 196p in early trading. Profits were lifted by the release of Â£700m that Barclays had set aside to cover anticipated losses on Covid loans. That compares to Â£4.8bn the bank set aside in 2020 for Covid loan losses. Mr Staley's relationship with Epstein can be traced back to US investment bank JP Morgan where the former Barclays boss used to work and where the sex offender was a client. Jes Staley visited Jeffrey Epstein on his private island - Little St James - in 2015 Mr Staley has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional. He said that his contact with Epstein - who took his own life in 2019 - began to ""taper off"" around 2013 when he left JP Morgan. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction for solicitation of prostitution involving a minor. It is also known that Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. The investigation by the FCA and the PRA began in 2019 after JP Morgan handed over 1,200 emails - initially to US regulators - sent between Mr Staley and Epstein mostly around 2008 to 2012,according to the Financial Times,external. Regulators were concerned that the emails showed a closer relationship between the two men than was characterised in a previous letter from Barclays which had described it as professional. Mr Staley resigned late last year after the regulators sent their conclusions of the investigation to Barclays' board. He said he was ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the findings and that he would contest them. At the time, Barclays said: ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019."" In its annual report for 2021, Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins praised Mr Staley, stating that the bank's performance for the year ""was in no small way a credit to Jes Staley... and the team he assembled"". He said Barclays is ""grateful for the hard work that he put in for the company"". Who is the outgoing Barclays boss Jes Staley?

"This video can not be played 'We expect a full-scale invasion of Ukraine' - UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss The UK is ready to escalate sanctions against Russia in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, the foreign secretary has said. Liz Truss defended existing measures, describing them as the most severe the UK had ever placed on Russia. She said it was important to keep further sanctions ""in the locker"". Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops to be sent into two Ukrainian regions held by Russian-backed separatists. On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced sanctions against Russia in response, with five banks having their assets frozen, along with those of three Russian billionaires who will also be hit with UK travel bans. But a number of MPs, including some Conservatives, have called for tougher measures. During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed Mr Johnson to bring in a ""full package of sanctions"" immediately, saying Russia had already invaded. ""There is clearly concern across the house that his strategy, I accept unintentionally, could send the wrong message,"" he added. The prime minister defended the government's actions, saying it was ready to escalate sanctions ""very rapidly"" but it was ""vital"" to work in ""lockstep"" with allies. Downing Street will hold a summit later with finance chiefs and regulators to discuss how to make sanctions effective. Live updates: Ukraine tells citizens to leave Russia immediately Why is Putin ordering troops into Ukraine? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Mr Johnson announced the UK would be providing a further package of military support to Ukraine shortly. ""This will include lethal aid in the form of defensive weapons and non-lethal aid,"" he said. He also confirmed the culture secretary had asked media regulator Ofcom to review the licence of RT- a Russian state-controlled TV network formerly known as Russia Today - to operate in the UK. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was working to prevent Russian money obtained through corrupt practices coming in to the UK. She acknowledged that ""for too long London has been the place that people have come to wash dirty money"" and said stronger legislative tools were needed to tackle this. Ms Truss told BBC Breakfast the sanctions were ""coordinated"" with the US and Europe ""to make sure that Vladimir Putin cannot play divide and rule amongst the allies"". ""We've shown we are united and we will escalate those sanctions in the event of a full invasion into Ukraine,"" she added. Ms Truss said she believed Mr Putin was ""hell-bent on invading Ukraine"" and that this was a long-standing plan. She reiterated comments made by Mr Johnson that football's Champions League final should no longer be held in the Russian city of St Petersburg. Elsewhere, in unguarded comments made while chatting to military personnel at an event in London, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Mr Putin had gone ""full tonto"" over Ukraine and had ""no friends"" internationally. Lubov Chernukhin has been among the largest donors to the Conservative Party Earlier, Ms Truss also defended donations made by Russians to the Conservative Party, saying there was a distinction between those who had moved to the UK years ago and those who were actively supporting Mr Putin's government. She was shown a picture from May 2019 which showed her, former Prime Minister Theresa May and other cabinet ministers at the time withLubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Russian minister who has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin has been one of the Conservative Party's biggest donors. Her lawyers say the donations are not tainted by Kremlin influence. Asked if she was embarrassed by the picture, Ms Truss said ""no, I'm not"". At the start of this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Russia the UK was ""preparing a package of sanctions and other measures to be enacted the moment the first Russian toe cap crosses further into Ukrainian territory"". Fast forward to today - and the view in London is very much that toe-caps have crossed that threshold. The prime minister believes an invasion is under way, even if Downing Street says it's not a full-scale one yet and is still urging Russia to stand back from the brink. So, has the UK followed through on its threats about sanctions? Read more. Sources have told the BBC that the foreign secretary has written up a ""long list"" of Russian individuals and organisations, including more oligarchs and banks close to the Kremlin, to be sanctioned if the situation in Ukraine gets worse. The Foreign Office is also likely to target Russian companies in the defence, energy, technology and chemical sectors. Other measures announced by the Foreign Office on Tuesdayinclude sanctioning Russian parliamentarians and preventing British firms from doing business in the two rebel-held areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, recognised by Russia as independent. Ms Truss also said the UK would restrict the Russian state and key companies from raising funding in UK financial markets, as well as ban a range of high-tech exports to Russia, ""degrading the development of its military-industrial base for years"". In a statement released on Wednesday, Ms Truss reaffirmed the UK's commitment to guarantee up to $500m (Â£368m) in loans to Ukraine to mitigate the economic effects of Russian aggression. Lord Kim Darroch, a former UK ambassador to the US, said the UK's sanctions appeared ""pretty modest"" compared to the EU's and particularly Germany's, but he understood the desire to ""hold some things back"" to deploy in the event of an escalation. Tom Keatinge, director of RUSI's Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, described the UK's sanctions as ""essentially taking a pea-shooter to a gun-fight"". Perhaps the biggest penalty Russia has faced so far is the decision by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tohalt approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipelinebetween the two countries. The US and EU have both introduced a range of sanctions, including restricting the Russian state from financing its debt from their banks and banning their own companies from trading with the two rebel-held regions. They have also targeted key Russian individuals and organisations with sanctions. Billionaire Boris Rotenberg is among three men to be sanctioned by the UK Putin allyGennady Timchenkois a billionaire hockey enthusiast with wide business interests in energy, transportation and construction via his Volga investment group. The UK government has accused him of supporting a Russian policy of destabilising Ukraine through his association with Bank Rossiya, of which he is a major shareholder. Igor Rotenberg, another close associate of President Putin, is the oldest son of Arkady Rotenberg and the majority shareholder in the Gazprom Drilling company. Igor's uncle,Boris Rotenberg, has also been targeted. Mr Rotenberg is the co-owner - along with his brother Arkady - of the SGM group, the largest construction company for gas pipelines and electrical power supply lines in Russia. The UK's sanctions notice says he is ""benefiting from or supporting"" the Russian state in his role in a key strategic sector. Rossiyais a privately-owned bank, which also has stakes in a television company. TheBlack Sea Bankis a Crimean bank and was created in 2014 after Russia annexed the region. TheGeneral Bankis a financial institution which also operates in Crimea. Promsvyazbankis a Russian state-owned bank, which the UK government says provides funding to Russia's military. The BBC's business correspondent Theo Leggett says the UK was not targeting the biggest banks but banks known to be used by President Putin's inner circle.

"Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths Next month, a report will be published into one of the biggest scandals in the history of the NHS, the failures of maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. The BBC's Michael Buchanan who helped uncover the problems examines why so many failures were allowed to happen for so long. It began with an email from one mother to another.  The two were strangers - ""I hope you don't mind me contacting you and I hope I don't cause any upset."" But almost immediately, a bond was formed - a spark rekindled in a couple who just two months earlier had vowed to move on with their lives. It was a Monday evening in June 2016, when Kayleigh Griffiths in a moment of clarity amid the fog of grief, wrote the email.  She and her husband Colin had welcomed their second daughter Pippa into the world in late April. They had decided on a home birth because of what she said was the ""appalling state"" of the birthing centre in Shrewsbury. Pippa arrived safely but struggled to feed almost immediately. Kayleigh spoke to her midwifery team on four occasions about her concerns, including a frantic call around 03:00 after her daughter coughed up brown liquid. She was repeatedly told not to worry. By 11:30 the following morning, Pippa became unresponsive. ""I went still and watched her chest and it wasn't moving,"" recalls Kayleigh. ""I put my hand under her nose to feel the breath and there was nothing.  At which point utter panic set in."" She screamed for Colin who desperately started trying to resuscitate his daughter while an ambulance was called. Kayleigh Griffiths Pippa died that afternoon. She was just 31 hours old.  The cause of death, the couple were later told, was an infection - Group B Strep. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust told the family they would carry out an investigation. But after several weeks of silence, Kayleigh contacted the trust to be told it was an internal investigation and the couple's input wouldn't be required. Kayleigh, an NHS auditor at a different trust, feared the truth was being hidden from her. That's when she decided to send the email. Rhiannon Davies was on holiday in Pembrokeshire with her husband Richard Stanton when she received the message. Kayleigh had seen some of the significant local media coverage about the couple's seven-year effort to uncover the truth about their daughter's death under the care of the same Shropshire trust. Over a frenetic few hours the sheer elation of new life became overwhelmed by the grief of sudden loss. Rhiannon had become pregnant with the couple's first child in 2008. She had been assessed as being a low-risk pregnancy and was advised to have her child at a midwife-led birthing centre run by the Shropshire trust in Ludlow, her home town. Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton In the days leading up to the birth, she noticed her baby's movements had reduced. She reported her concerns to clinicians at the trust, but was told she simply had a lazy baby. So when Rhiannon went into labour on 1 March 2009, she headed to the midwife-led unit. ""Kate was delivered at 10:03 in the morning,"" recalls Richard. ""It's just hard to describe the happiness that you feel."" Rhiannon says Kate started to make a strange noise. ""It's called grunting but it's not, it's a murmuring.  The midwife said she was trying to cry. She wasn't - this is a distinct clear sign, if you know what you're doing, that the baby is in respiratory distress. She opened her eyes once, beautiful blue eyes."" Rhiannon and her daughter Kate Kate was seriously ill and needed urgent medical attention. But the nearest doctors were 45 minutes away. The midwives ""lost control of the situation,"" said Richard, but eventually an air ambulance arrived to take Kate to a hospital in Birmingham. The couple followed, but Rhiannon collapsed and was taken to hospital in Worcester. Richard raced to his daughter's side. ""Kate was in an incubation cot with cables and tubes,"" he recalls. ""There was no recovery from this situation. So six hours after holding my new born baby, I cradled Kate in my arms dying. The overriding memory I have from that one day is hearing Rhiannon arrive to be told that Kate was no longer with us, and the cries of pain from Rhiannon."" The initial report from the trust noted the death but described it as a ""no harm"" event. In 2012, an inquest jury concluded, however, that Kate's death was preventable - those reduced movements should have seen Rhiannon deliver in a hospital, with doctors on hand. In a written response however, the trust said the care ""given to Ms Davies was in line with both the local and national guidance"". But the couple continued to fight, pushing for two independent reports, which were published over the next four years. Finally, in April 2016, the board of the trust held an extraordinary meeting, in which they apologised and accepted Kate's death was avoidable. ""It was a very emotional experience,"" says Rhiannon, ""but it was one that was very, very, very much for us the end."" Rhiannon could easily have ignored the email in June, but there was something about Kayleigh, she says, that meant she had to respond. In many ways, the two are polar opposites - Kayleigh is quiet and analytical, Rhiannon energetic and passionate. The Griffiths family needed practical advice on how to hold the trust to account. Richard and Rhiannon provided that, and in April 2017 a coroner ruled that Pippa's death was preventable as the trust had failed to give the family information that would have allowed them to recognise the seriousness of the infant's deteriorating condition. As the bond between the mothers deepened, their conversations morphed into something else.  Armed with little more than a gnawing suspicion, they started to scour the internet, coroner's records and death notices to see if any other families had received poor maternity care at the Shropshire trust. They collated 23 cases dating back to 2000 - including stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and babies born with brain injuries. Appalled by what they had found, they wrote to the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2016, asking him to order an investigation. He agreed and in May 2017, senior midwife Donna Ockenden was appointed to lead the review. ""We sat looking through the case notes of the original 23, and our opinion was these are really, really serious cases,"" Ms Ockenden told Panorama. ""These are amongst the most serious cases that we have seen in our careers.  The likelihood would be that when one tried to put together the full jigsaw there would be other cases but we didn't know that at the outset."" By now I was aware of significant problems at the trust. I'd met Richard and Rhiannon in late 2016, and when they outlined their concerns, I started investigating. In April 2017, I revealed there had been at least seven avoidable deaths at the trust in just 20 months. That initial story set me off on a five-year quest, an investigation that has helped unravel years of failure and grief. As I revealed more failures, the number of families approaching Donna Ockenden escalated rapidly. It was initially an investigation into 23 cases - but the review team has now examined the care that 1862 families received. Watch Panorama Maternity Scandal: Fighting for the Truth is on BBC One on Wednesday 23 February at 21:00 or watch later onBBC iPlayer One of the themes the inquiry has already noted, in an interim report published in December 2020, is that in many cases the trust failed to investigate after something went wrong, or simply carried out its own inquiry. Panorama has discovered the trust even developed its own investigation system, what they called a High Risk Case Review. It was outside any national framework that has been used to help learn lessons from incidents and doesn't appear to be a system that's used in any other NHS organisation. Another consequence of the unorthodox system was that fewer incidents were reported to NHS regulators, limiting the opportunity to learn lessons. One of the earliest cases on the original list of 23 compiled by the two couples was the death of Kathryn Leigh in 2000.  Panorama has investigated the case and discovered that a theme identified almost two decades ago was to come up repeatedly in subsequent incidents. Kathryn was delivered in a poor condition following an emergency caesarean section after her mother had been in labour all night. She needed to be resuscitated but the medics used the wrong equipment, and the baby died within 21 minutes of her birth. The trust admitted that error but refused to accept criticism of its maternity care at the inquest into Kathryn's death, held in April 2003. An expert witness called by the coroner told the court, ""In my opinion, Kathryn Leigh's need for resuscitation arose from incompetent management of her mother's pregnancy and labour"". That criticism, Panorama can reveal, did lead the family's lawyer to raise in court whether there was ""any kind of inbuilt policy or inbuilt bias towards trying to achieve natural births in as many cases as possible"".  The question also built on inquiries made by Kathryn's parents, Phil and Sonia. ""I wondered about the fact that I'd been left so long before going to C-section,"" said Sonia. ""I did a lot of research and found out that Shrewsbury Hospital had the lowest rate of C-sections in the whole of the UK."" Most of the cases the Ockenden review is examining date from 2000-2019. In their interim report, the essence of Sonia Leigh's concerns was strongly highlighted. The inquiry found that rates of caesarean sections at the trust in Shropshire were up to 12% lower than the England average for the period they are examining. The trust's reputation for unusually high numbers of vaginal births was known. Panorama has discovered that just a month before Kathryn Leigh's inquest, a parliamentary hearing was held to discuss concerns about the rising number of caesarean births across England. There was concern that child birth was being over-medicalised, and that too many women were having to undergo unnecessary surgical procedures, which like any operation carries risk. It also costs more money. One hospital was praised for its approach however - the Royal Shrewsbury.  At the time, its caesarean levels were half the England average, and a team from the hospital travelled to London. In the evidence session, seen by Panorama, the then clinical director of the Royal Shrewsbury told MPs: ""The culture of our organisation is that we have low intervention rates and once that is known we attract both midwives and obstetricians who like to practise in that way."" His colleague, the manager of women's service at the time, added that midwives who had worked elsewhere ""almost need retraining to be able to work in Shropshire.  We have recruited people who are like minded. If you want to keep something going and you believe in it, you do not want to employ people who do not believe in what you believe in."" Discussing the initial findings of her inquiry, Donna Ockenden told Panorama, ""There wereâ¯cases where an earlier recourse to caesarean section rather than a persistence towards a normal delivery may well haveâ¯led to a better outcome for mother or baby or both. Low caesarean section rates were a prize."" And the trust had been lauded for them. As the Griffiths and the Stanton-Davies families were striving to bring rigorous external scrutiny to the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, inside the organisation Bernie Bentick was also agitating for change. A consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist for nearly 30 years at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust until he retired in 2020, he's the first former staff member to speak openly about what was happening on the inside. He told Panorama that he wrote to senior management on several occasions highlighting problems. ""I was supported by a number of my clinical colleagues and wrote a long email to my line managers, to the chief executive, outlining the severity of the problems as I saw it - incidents of dysfunctional culture, of bullying, of the imposition of changes in clinical practice that many clinicians felt was unsafe."" He says that while there was a ""genuine attempt to try to ensure the best standards were achieved"" within the maternity department, the deteriorating culture made staff increasingly ""anxious"" and ""cautious"", making their performance ""less than ideal"". ""Because resources were scarce,"" said Dr Bentick, ""there was a tendency to blame individuals for not following guidelines rather than look at the underlying factors which may have led to a particular problem, and in particular staffing levels in the midwifery department. There were frequently not enough."" A lack of both midwives and consultants was a problem for years at the trust according to former employees that Panorama has spoken to.  But there are too few staff in maternity wards across the country, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). They say thousands more midwives and hundreds more obstetricians are needed now.  Maternity services, they say, need additional funding of up to Â£300m a year. In response to his complaints, Bernie Bentick said some ""cursory"" investigations were launched, but he felt that management never got to the heart of the problems. ""I believed that some of the ways they responded to problems were to try to preserve the reputation of the organisation rather than to do anything practical. ""They were prepared to make small, what they regarded as proportionate, changes to try to improve the situation. But I don't think they really understood the gravity of the cultural problems within the trust."" In recent years, he said, a gap developed between the management of the trust and its clinicians, which he says was mainly caused by a problem the whole NHS faces - the lack of good quality, trained managers who have as much professional accountability as clinicians. ""If the resources had been made available to employ adequate numbers, then the situation may have been profoundly different. I feel intense sorry and sadness for the families and I would hope that the NHS responds in a way that ensures that quality of care is at the forefront of what we provide in the NHS."" The Ockenden team, which at one point grew to more than 80 clinicians, has now spoken to more than 800 families. Their interim report found nine areas where the trust had repeatedly failed. As well as low caesarean rates, they highlighted the excessive use of forceps, the repeated misuse of a labour inducing drug, a failure to escalate concerns to senior clinicians and a lack of compassion and kindness in the delivery of care. ""I've heard of accounts where mothers were told quite clearly that it was their fault,"" said Donna Ockenden. ""And heard from fathers who have carried a tremendous amount of guilt that they should have been able to stand up for their wives and partners. And what I say to them is, it isn't your guilt to carry."" One recurring theme the Ockenden team picked up on was a failure by staff to properly monitor the baby's heart rate. The problem raises significant questions for all NHS bodies charged with overseeing trusts because the issue was highlighted as a problem at the Shropshire trust as far back as 2007. After the failure had been noted as a contributory factor in two babies being born with severe brain damage, in 2004 and 2005, the Healthcare Commission, the regulator at the time, wrote to the trust demanding action to ensure the problems ""are not repetitive and that learning is taking place"". But there's no evidence the regulator followed up, with repeated catastrophic consequences: September 2014, Kelly Jones had stillborn twins, Ella and Lola, after the trust failed to properly read and interpret their heart rates. 4 December 2015, Graham Scott Holmes-Smith was stillborn.  The trust accepted they'd failure to monitor the foetal heart rate. 15 December 2015, Ivy Morris was born with a severe brain injury after staff monitored her mother's heart rate rather than Ivy's and failed to spot she was in distress.  She died aged four months. Despite the errors, the new regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), didn't pick up on the problem. Its reports, following inspections of the trust in October 2014 and December 2016, make no mention of a problem with monitoring baby's heart rates.  It wasn't until November 2018, when the CQC rated the trust as inadequate, that the need for training in monitoring baby's heart rates is mentioned. Kelly Jones Chief Inspector of Hospitals at the CQC, Professor Ted Baker, robustly defended his organisation's handling of the trust. ""The families of Shrewsbury and Telford have been really important in driving forward the improvements,"" he told Panorama. ""The regulators identified problems in the maternity service and have subsequently taken enforcement action.  I don't accept that [we didn't spot the problems]."" In a statement, the trust told the BBC they took ""full responsibility"" for the failings in maternity care.  ""We offer our sincere apologies for all the distress and hurt we know this caused. ""Apologies alone are not enough and must be backed up with clear and meaningful action. We have made strong progress, including significant investment in additional staff and staff training. We have completed more than 80% of the recommendations in the interim Ockenden Report."" They added that the term High Risk Case Review is ""no longer used"", adding that its ""aligning"" its investigation systems with those ""being developed across the NHS in England."" The sheer scale of the maternity errors in Shropshire means the well of grief may run deeper here, but it's not the only area to have failed women and babies. In recent years, independent investigations have been ordered into maternity services in Cumbria, East Kent, Nottingham and South Wales. Since 2017, the CQC has been rating the safety of maternity services in England.  Its latest figures show that 41% of units need to improve their safety, while just 1% are rated as outstanding.  The CQC says the rate of improvement is not good enough and Jo Mountfield, vice president of the RCOG, says it's ""probably"" because the patients are women. ""I think women's health and research in this country should be given much higher priority. I think women's voices need to be heard much more loudly."" The interim Ockenden report led to a near Â£100m investment in maternity services in England.  NHS England wrote to all health trusts last week telling them to no longer limit the number of caesarean sections they offer women. They also said they were committed to providing safe, compassionate maternity services. The publication of the final report by Donna Ockenden next month will be a watershed moment in the history of the NHS - the revelation of multiple instances of maternity failures in a rural corner of England. Pippa Griffiths and Kate Stanton-Davies lived fewer than 40 hours between them, but their legacy, in terms of improved maternity care, could last decades. Photographs by Phil Coomes Â© 2025 BBC.

"Average UK petrol and diesel prices have hit new highs as the Ukraine crisis continues to affect oil prices, the RAC has said. On Wednesday, petrol prices rose  to 149.30p per litre amid warnings it could soon pass Â£1.50. Oil prices jumped after Russia ordered troops into two Ukrainian regions this week to ""maintain peace"". Wholesale gas prices also continue to climb, threatening to further push up heating bills. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top producer of natural gas globally. The UK only gets 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Oil prices surge as Ukraine-Russia tensions climb Putin tells Russians security is non-negotiable Former National Grid boss Steve Holliday told the BBC's Today programme: ""For the UK, it's a price issue, it's not a security supply issue. ""We already know that we've got consumers that are already experiencing huge jumps in their energy bills, so this is really very unwelcome."" The price of Brent crude oil, an international benchmark, hit a seven-year high of more than $99 (Â£73) on Tuesday before falling back on Wednesday. However, fuel pump prices lag behind oil prices and the RAC has warned petrol could go higher than Â£1.50 a litre in the coming days. Diesel has also risen, hitting 152.68p a litre on Wednesday. Justin Yates and Matt Williams run a removals company Matt Williams, 30, runs Williams & Yates, a removals company that operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 11 vans and lorries. Rising fuel costs have forced it to put up its prices and he fears it might impact the business in the months ahead. ""Unfortunately, we do have to pass [these costs] onto the customer,"" he told the BBC. ""All the competition has to do the same, but I think it does make some consumers reconsider their moving options."" The firm offers basic and bespoke services, and he expects more customers to choose the cheaper option in the coming months rather than ""paying loads of money"". Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, a trade body for independent UK forecourts, said whether fuel prices continue to rise depends on a number of factors. ""If [conflict] really sparks off in Ukraine, we could prices escalating dramatically,"" he said. However, he added that the US is in the process of negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran which could see more oil come onto the market. UK wholesale gas prices also jumped following Germany's decision on Tuesday to halt the final approval of Nord Stream 2 - a new gas pipeline connecting the country with Russia. That decision drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. Allow Twitter content?

""Well, welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay â¬2,000 for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas!""he tweeted,external- suggesting prices were set to double. UK gas prices for delivery in March rose by 13.5p to 200p per therm, though that is still much lower than the highs of December last year, when it peaked at over 400p per therm. Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. The UK said it was ready to impose further sanctions in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, targeting more Russian banks and individuals as well as companies in the energy, defence, technology and chemical sectors. After a volatile trading session on Tuesday, global stock markets climbed on Wednesday before falling back again. Towards the end of the day, the UK's FTSE 100 was flat while France's CAC-40 and Germany's Dax had lost between 0.2% and 0.5%. The main three US indexes were all in the red. High energy prices in the UK have played a major part in pushing up the cost of living recently, while wages have lagged behind price rises. Inflation currently stands at 5.5% - its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee of MPs on Wednesday, Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said energy prices accounted for nearly half of the rise in inflation over the last year. That is likely to rise to 70% in the first three months of 2022, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. The Bank deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said: ""If you look at the increase in energy bills this year, it is just about twice as big as any single year in the 1970s - it is enormous."" The Bank expects inflation to hit 7% in spring when the price cap on household energy bills is raised. This is far above the Bank of England's 2% target. From April, about 18 million homes on standard tariffs will see an average increase of Â£693. Meanwhile, 4.5 million prepayment customers can expect their energy costs to rise by an average Â£708. Consumers are also being squeezed by rising prices on goods as many companies pass on higher costs such as fuel, shipping and wages to their customers. As well as the rise in energy prices in April, staff, companies and the self-employed will also have to pay an extra 1.25p on the pound in National Insurance. The rise is being introduced by the government to fund health and social care.

"Screaming Trees frontman and former Queens of the Stone Age member Mark Lanegan has died at the age of 57. Known for his deep, melancholy vocals, the American singer-songwriter died at his home in Killarney, Ireland, a statement on hisTwitter account,externalsaid. During his career he collaborated with musicians including Kurt Cobain, PJ Harvey, Isobel Campbell and Moby. Last year, he was in hospital for months after contracting Covid, and was put into a medically-induced coma. No cause of death has been given. A statement said: ""Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland. ""A beloved singer, songwriter, author, and musician he was 57 and is survived by his wife Shelley [Brien]."" Born in Washington state in 1964, Lanegan joined Screaming Trees in the 1980s and went on to produce eight studio albums until the group's split in 2000. The band pioneered a sound that combined 1960s garage rock with 1970s punk - which later became known as grunge. Although they never achieved the mainstream success of contemporaries like Soundgarden and Nirvana, they scored hits in the US with Nearly Lost You in 1992 and All I Know in 1996.

"Mistakes, waste and fraud that led to billions of pounds of Covid loan support being lost were ""unacceptable"", the head of a group of MPs has said. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said taxpayers will be exposed to financial risks for decades. Previous official figures estimated the government is unlikely to recoup up to Â£21bn of Covid loans to business. The Treasury said it rejects the claims made in the PAC report. Ms Hillier said repeated PAC reports had made clear that a ""lack of preparedness and planning, combined with weaknesses in existing systems across government, have led to an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters"". She said this would end up robbing current and future taxpayers of billions of pounds, and that the ""government must be held accountable"". ""It is essential that for as long as we will be paying the costs of Covid-19, which is at least the next 20 years just in some of the loan repayment terms, the Treasury and all of government continue to account specifically for what it has spent in response to the pandemic. ""Crucially this must ensure lessons are learned for when the next big crisis hits - be it climate, health or financial."" But the Treasury rejected the claims in the report, saying that no fraudulent payments have been written off and the Taxpayer Protection Taskforce it has set up is expected to recover up to Â£1bn from fraudulent or incorrect payments. Bounce Back Loan fraud checks called inadequate Men behind largest Covid loan fraud jailed The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme - commonly known as furlough - alone is estimated to have lost Â£5.3bn to fraud and error. That's almost 9% of the total funding distributed through the programme. The estimated loss to fraud and error across all Covid-19 response measures is not known but is expected to be at least Â£15bn across the schemes and loans implemented by various government departments. In September, spending watchdog the National Audit Office said the government had spent Â£261bn on 374 measures in response to the pandemic. These measures are expected to cost a total of about Â£370bn over their lifetime. That same month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that a provision of nearly Â£21bn had been made for defaults under loan schemes for companies, such as the Covid bounce-back loan policy. The PAC said the Treasury should state what it has learned from the Covid response and what it is doing to collect lessons across government departments. It should also find out how much money has been lost in error and to fraudsters, how much of this will be recovered and how much it will cost to recover it, the committee added. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Our Covid support schemes were rolled out at a time of national crisis, protecting millions of jobs and businesses when they needed it most. ""Thanks to the speed and scale of our intervention, the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at the fastest rate in the G7."" They argued that the ""cost of inaction"" could have had a big impact on jobs and livelihoods.

"Barclays has suspended millions of pounds in bonus share awards to former boss Jes Staley amid an investigation by regulators into his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Staley left the bank last November after watchdogs began a probe into his links to the dead sex trafficker. Mr Staley is contesting the City regulators' findings. But Barclays has announced that in the meantime it is freezing long-term bonus and share payments for Mr Staley. Mr Staley's share awards that have been suspended are worth nearly Â£22m based on Barclays' share price on Wednesday. The bank said in a statement: ""In line with its normal procedures, the committee exercised its discretion to suspend the vesting of all of Mr Staley's unvested awards, pending further developments in respect of the regulatory and legal proceedings related to the ongoing Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) investigation regarding Mr Staley."" Regulators are investigating whether Mr Staley's relationship with Epstein was closer than he described to the board. Deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein According to Barclays latest annual report, Mr Staley holds 9 million unvested shares - stock that has been promised but not yet paid out - which are subject to performance targets, and an additional 2.1 million shares not subject to targets. Based on Barclays' latest share price, Mr Staley's package is worth Â£21.9m. He also holds an additional 6.7 million shares that he owns outright. These are worth Â£13.1m. Barclays revealed the move as it published its full-year results which showed a sharp rise in pre-tax profits to Â£8.4bn for 2021 compared to Â£3.1bn the previous year. Barclays' share price rose by 3.3% to 196p in early trading. Profits were lifted by the release of Â£700m that Barclays had set aside to cover anticipated losses on Covid loans. That compares to Â£4.8bn the bank set aside in 2020 for Covid loan losses. Mr Staley's relationship with Epstein can be traced back to US investment bank JP Morgan where the former Barclays boss used to work and where the sex offender was a client. Jes Staley visited Jeffrey Epstein on his private island - Little St James - in 2015 Mr Staley has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional. He said that his contact with Epstein - who took his own life in 2019 - began to ""taper off"" around 2013 when he left JP Morgan. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction for solicitation of prostitution involving a minor. It is also known that Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. The investigation by the FCA and the PRA began in 2019 after JP Morgan handed over 1,200 emails - initially to US regulators - sent between Mr Staley and Epstein mostly around 2008 to 2012,according to the Financial Times,external. Regulators were concerned that the emails showed a closer relationship between the two men than was characterised in a previous letter from Barclays which had described it as professional. Mr Staley resigned late last year after the regulators sent their conclusions of the investigation to Barclays' board. He said he was ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the findings and that he would contest them. At the time, Barclays said: ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019."" In its annual report for 2021, Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins praised Mr Staley, stating that the bank's performance for the year ""was in no small way a credit to Jes Staley... and the team he assembled"". He said Barclays is ""grateful for the hard work that he put in for the company"". Who is the outgoing Barclays boss Jes Staley?

"Free Covid testing will continue in Scotland at some level beyond April, the deputy first minister has said. The Scottish government is seeking clarity from the UK government about how testing is funded after mass free testing ends in England on 1 April. John Swinney said Scottish ministers would set out in March how free PCR and lateral flow tests would be allocated. The Scottish Conservatives said Nicola Sturgeon should fund testing from existing budgets. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab later said Scotland had been granted an additional Â£6.5bn to finance its Covid recovery. On Tuesday the first minister announcedScotland's legal Covid-19 restrictions would end on 21 Marchand the country would rely instead on vaccines,treatmentsand ""good public health behaviours"". The move comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that England's restrictions will be lifted on Thursday, with the requirement to self-isolate dropped and free mass testing ending in April. Ms Sturgeon expressed frustration at Mr Johnson's approach, calling for clarity about how the testing system - which operates UK-wide - would operate in future. Speaking to BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotland, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he did not yet know whether people would still be able to pick up free lateral flow tests (LFTs) at a pharmacy after 1 April. ""We think that where there is a requirement for testing to be undertaken, that should be delivered as part of the overall commitment of the National Health Service [and] that these services should be provided free of charge,"" he said. In the meantime, he said, the Scottish government was advising people to test a ""couple of times a week"", as they had done before the emergence of Omicron increased the guidance on frequency. Some high street pharmacies in England are planning to sell the tests for Â£2.50 each or Â£5.99 online from April, with supermarkets also expected to stock them. The Scottish government's transition plan, which is being prepared for March, will set out the ""circumstances and conditions"" which would allow people access to free testing. This was likely to be a combination of PCR and lateral flow testing, Mr Swinney said, and would ""reflect the settlement provided by the UK government"". Mr Swinney said the UK government indicated it wanted to do sufficient testing to ""maintain the intelligence that requires it to pick up where there are new strains of the virus emerging"". ""That approach sounds to me as if it requires testing to be continued within England,"" he said. ""We need to understand the financing of all of that."" He said all four nations needed clarity on the implications of that funding coming from the Treasury - which would allow for a proportionate amount of funding coming to the Scottish government - or if the Department of Health was expected to find the money from its existing budget for England. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, speak to BBC Scotland'sThe Nineon Tuesday, said: ""Those tests, as we know, are procured on a four nations basis. If the UK government chooses not to give us additional funding... then we would have to look within existing budgets to fund that."" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab praised the team effort of the devolved administrations and said collaborative working had enabled the UK to come through the pandemic. Mr Raab said Scotland had been allocated an additional Â£6.5bn from the Treasury, on top of the block grant, to fund its recovery from the crisis. During a visit to Edinburgh he told BBC Scotland: ""It is for the Scottish people and government and parliament to decide the best allocation, whether it is for testing or other measures, but I think that is the right approach to take. ""We would not stay in emergency measures indefinitely."" MSP Sandesh Gulhane, the Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman, told the BBC that testing had to continue while Scotland maintained restrictions, but that the Scottish government should fund it. Dr Gulhane said: ""Because we've started in such a restricted position compared to everyone else, it is only right and proper that Nicola Sturgeon funds the positions that we're in and accepts that the decisions that she has made, despite it not making any difference to her case numbers."" She should ""fund increased testing whilst we are coming out of the problem that she has created"", he added. However, he added it was right to move to allowing people to make their own decisions about Covid risks and said: ""It was never law to isolate in Scotland but people did it because we trust the Scottish people to do the right thing"". Daniel Johnson, Scottish Labour's finance spokesman, toldGood Morning Scotlandhe still needed clarity about how the virus was going to be managed in Scotland. He added: ""I think it is grossly irresponsible of the UK government to withdraw this funding, collapsing what has definitely been a pillar of our response to this virus, before we have vanquished this virus."" Prof Cindy Gray, who studies health and behaviour at the University of Glasgow, told toBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Livethat abolishing free testing would create problems for many people. She said: ""People who can't afford it will not be able to access testing and won't know whether or not  they have Covid. I think the calls that testing should be retained and discussions around whether we can do that in Scotland, are really, really important.

"This video can not be played Watch: US announces full-blocking sanctions on Russia The US has hit Russia with wide-ranging sanctions over what President Joe Biden called ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine"". ""We've cut off Russia's government from Western financing,"" Mr Biden said. It came after Russian politicians authorised President Vladimir Putin to send troops into two rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine. Russia has recognised the regions as independent - a move Ukraine said attacks its sovereignty. Western nations largely see the action as a pretext for a wider invasion. On Monday Mr Putin ordered soldiers into the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions, to ""keep the peace"" - a description the US called ""nonsense"". Satellite imagery over the past 24 hours has shown several new troop and equipment deployments in western Russia, and more than 100 vehicles at an airfield in Belarus near Ukraine's border, according to US space technology company Maxar. Russia's military has not commented, and it is not clear if any Russian troops have yet been sent into eastern Ukraine. A handout satellite image made available by Maxar Technologies shows troop tents and a housing area in Pochep, Russia Announcing his ""first tranche"" of measures directly targeting the Russian state, Mr Biden said on Tuesday: ""To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine."" The moves include sanctions on Russia's foreign debt, meaning the country can no longer raise money for its state financing from Western financial institutions. The US is also punishing high-ranking ""elites"" from Russia. ""They share the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies, and should share in the pain as well,"" Mr Biden said. The US had already banned American companies from dealing with the rebel-held Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - but few companies do. The UK and European Union also announced a wave of sanctions against Russian banks and individuals earlier on Tuesday. Among the developments: All 27 EU member states agreed a range of anti-Russia measures, targeting all 351 members of Russia's upper house that voted to recognise the two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent states. The EU's response also targets 27 individuals and entities involved in the decision. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedthat five banks have had their assets frozen in Britain, along with three Russian billionaires who will be hit with UK travel bans. Canada, Japan and Australia later confirmed similar measures Germany alsohalted a major joint infrastructure project with Russia, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline,despite Europe's reliance on Russian gas supplies and the fact that the â¬10bn (Â£8.3bn) project is ready to open supply lines. None of the sanctions went as far as what had been threatened in the event of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, though both US and European officials stressed that more action would follow if the situation deteriorated. The US is also moving troops into Nato member states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - which are on or near Russia's border - an official said. The military redeployment from Italy involves some 800 infantry troops along with a number of F-35 fighter jets and 20 attack helicopters, some of which will go to Poland. EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? BACKGROUND:The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis FACT-CHECKED:Vladimir Putin's Ukraine speech Diplomatic efforts to avert the Ukraine crisis have so far failed, and in Russia on Tuesday President Putin said the Minsk agreements - the peace deals aimed at averting years-long conflict in eastern Ukraine - ""do not exist"". The agreements ""were killed long before yesterday's recognition of the people's republics of Donbas,"" he said, using the administrative name for the two regions of eastern Ukraine. ""And not by us, not by representatives of these republics, but by the current Kyiv authorities."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken followed Mr Biden's speech by announcing he had cancelled a planned Thursday meeting with his Russian counterpart. ""Now that we see the invasion is beginning and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy, it does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,"" he said. But he added that the US would engage with Russia if it changed its approach. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier said he would consider cutting off diplomatic ties with Russia altogether over the crisis. In an evening address to the nation, he said he was calling up military reserve members for training - but also said Ukraine would still pursue a diplomatic solution. There was ""no need"" for a full military mobilisation, Mr Zelensky said. Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine have seized large swathes of territory since fierce fighting broke out in 2014. An estimated 14,000 people - including many civilians - have since died.

"Extreme wildfires are set to become more frequent, increasing by around 50% by the end of this century, according to a new UN report. Thereport,externalfinds there's an elevated risk in the Arctic and other regions previously unaffected by fires. The scientists define extreme fires as extraordinary conflagrations that occur roughly once in a hundred years. Researchers say that rising temperatures and changes to the way we use land will drive the increase. The new study calls for a radical reallocation of financial resources from fighting fires to prevention. Amazon protected areas face mining proposal risk Covid shutdown linked to record rainfall in China Biggest coal plant in Australia to close early The scientists from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) say that large fires that burn for weeks are already becoming hotter and burning longer in many parts of the planet where wildfires have always occurred. But they are now beginning to flare up in remote northern areas, in drying peatlands and on thawing permafrost. A fire in a forest in Siberia - researchers are worried about the spread of extreme fires in the Arctic This latest study says that there will be a global increase in extreme fires of up to 14% by 2030, compared to the number recorded in 2010-2020. The increase could reach 30% by 2050 and 50% by the end of the century. ""The analysis was based on the definition of a catastrophic fire being one that would occur once every 100 years, so it's a very low frequency fire event,"" said Dr Andrew Sullivan from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Canberra, Australia. ""The result was that the potential for that sort of fire would increase by a factor of 1.3 to 1.5 times, based on global analysis of fire frequency."" The results were similar in a low or high carbon emissions scenario. The study defines extreme conflagrations as fires that are extraordinary or unusual - but this definition can differ markedly depending on your location. ""If you imagine a peat fire in the Arctic, it's spreading at centimetres an hour. It's not necessarily a raging inferno, but it's unusual and spreading over immense areas because there's no one there to do anything about it,"" said Dr Sullivan. ""A fire like this in the peatlands is an extreme fire, but it's not what you would envisage as being an extreme fire if you lived in California."" And even though the study only makes projections on extreme events, the authors believe that lesser incidents of wildfire will also increase as land use changes and populations increase.  This could have significant implications for climate change as the extra burning will increase the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere. Researchers say that technology by itself is not a solution to extreme fires But the change in frequency will vary depending on a number of local factors. The world is likely to see more fires in Arctic regions because climate change is having such a major impact in the region. However in Africa, where about two thirds of the world's wildfires now occur, there are likely to be fewer fires in the coming decades as a growing population is clearing more forest areas for farmland. ""In Africa, the number of fires is decreasing, because of the change in land use and the intensification of agriculture,"" said Dr Glynis Humphrey from the University of Cape Town. ""Our percentage of area burned is actually decreasing, and our fires are becoming smaller and smaller, because of the reduction in fuel load."" The authors are calling on governments to change their model of spending on large fires. Right now, the study says that planning and prevention receives less than 1% of funding while firefighting takes over half of the available budget. A villager fights a fire in Portugal in 2017 - the extreme fires that hit the country killed over 100 people Many governments have good intentions in terms of spending more on planning and prevention - but the reality on the ground is different. ""We need to invest more in fire prevention, in full management, also in allowing fires to fulfil their ecological roles,"" said Prof Paulo Fernandes, from the Universidade de TrÃ¡s-os-Montes e Alto Douro in Portugal, one of the report's authors. ""But then, when things get hot, their response will be to deviate from the policy that's supposed to be in place. In places like California they talk a lot, but then in terms of action, they put the money always in the same place, in firefighting."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"The brand is one of Europe's largest producers of smoothies and fruit juices Adverts for drinks firm Innocent have been banned after the advertising regulator ruled they ""misled"" customers over the firm's environmental impact. The adverts show animated characters encouraging people to ""get fixing up the planet"" by buying Innocent drinks. The regulator said it implied buying Innocent drinks ""was a choice which would have a positive environmental impact when that was not the case"", Innocent said it had aimed to show ""the need for collective action"". But the Advertising Standards Authority said the adverts did not show that Innocent's single-use plastic products had a ""net positive"" environmental impact over their full life cycles. Twenty-six viewers, one of whom identified themselves as representing environmental group Plastics Rebellion, complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the adverts misled customers by exaggerating the ""total environmental benefits"" of the drinks. 20 firms make half of all one-use plastic - study UK criticised for dumping plastic waste in Turkey Greenwashing tricks: Seven ways not to be fooled The ASA said the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing in order to produce its bottles would also have a negative impact on the environment. Innocent is owned by Coca-Cola. The bottles that Innocent sells in the UK contain 50% recycled plastic and 50% virgin material, not including the caps and labels. The regulator said that because the ads ""implied that purchasing Innocent products was a choice which would have a positive environmental impact when that was not the case"", it concluded that the ads were ""misleading."" In the ruling, Innocent responded that there was no suggestion in the ads that buying Innocent products would lead to a positive environmental impact. Instead, the ruling states that Innocent said the ad was a ""call to action"", asking for their drinkers to join them in making changes happen, which was demonstrated by the change of leadership from the man to the otter. Innocent said: ""Our advert was always intended to highlight important global environmental issues and the need for collective action to make a change. We transparently share more about the work that we do on sustainability on our website. ""As with any new guidelines, we'd like to work with the ASA and other brands to understand how to align to them to continue the conversation on these important topics."" Mother advertising agency declined to comment when approached by the BBC. In a statement, Plastics Rebellion said that Innocent were being ""disingenuous"" about the dangers of plastic's threat to human health and environment, as well as ""trivialising the horrific scale of the problem by repeating the mantra: 'Reduce, re-use, recycle'"". Coca-Cola, owner of Innocent, produces about three million tonnes of plastic packaging a year - equivalent to 200,000 bottles a minute. In 2019, it was found to be the most polluting brand in a global audit of plastic waste by the charity Break Free From Plastic. Environmental groups have repeatedly campaigned for single-use plastic to be drastically reduced to prevent pollution. Scotlandhas announced it will banmost single-use plastic from June 2022. In January an advert for Lipton Ice Tea was also banned after the ASA ruled it ""misleadingly implied"" that all of the Lipton bottle was made from 100% recycled plastic. The watchdog also banned an Aqua Pura advert earlier this year for the claim ""100% recycled bottle"" because not all of the parts of the bottle were recycled and warned the firm to ensure they did not ""overstate the environmental benefit"" of their brand and products, and did not claim that products made of plastic were ""eco-friendly"" or ""nature friendly"".

"This video can not be played 'We expect a full-scale invasion of Ukraine' - UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss The UK is ready to escalate sanctions against Russia in the event of a full invasion of Ukraine, the foreign secretary has said. Liz Truss defended existing measures, describing them as the most severe the UK had ever placed on Russia. She said it was important to keep further sanctions ""in the locker"". Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops to be sent into two Ukrainian regions held by Russian-backed separatists. On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced sanctions against Russia in response, with five banks having their assets frozen, along with those of three Russian billionaires who will also be hit with UK travel bans. But a number of MPs, including some Conservatives, have called for tougher measures. During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed Mr Johnson to bring in a ""full package of sanctions"" immediately, saying Russia had already invaded. ""There is clearly concern across the house that his strategy, I accept unintentionally, could send the wrong message,"" he added. The prime minister defended the government's actions, saying it was ready to escalate sanctions ""very rapidly"" but it was ""vital"" to work in ""lockstep"" with allies. Downing Street will hold a summit later with finance chiefs and regulators to discuss how to make sanctions effective. Live updates: Ukraine tells citizens to leave Russia immediately Why is Putin ordering troops into Ukraine? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Mr Johnson announced the UK would be providing a further package of military support to Ukraine shortly. ""This will include lethal aid in the form of defensive weapons and non-lethal aid,"" he said. He also confirmed the culture secretary had asked media regulator Ofcom to review the licence of RT- a Russian state-controlled TV network formerly known as Russia Today - to operate in the UK. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was working to prevent Russian money obtained through corrupt practices coming in to the UK. She acknowledged that ""for too long London has been the place that people have come to wash dirty money"" and said stronger legislative tools were needed to tackle this. Ms Truss told BBC Breakfast the sanctions were ""coordinated"" with the US and Europe ""to make sure that Vladimir Putin cannot play divide and rule amongst the allies"". ""We've shown we are united and we will escalate those sanctions in the event of a full invasion into Ukraine,"" she added. Ms Truss said she believed Mr Putin was ""hell-bent on invading Ukraine"" and that this was a long-standing plan. She reiterated comments made by Mr Johnson that football's Champions League final should no longer be held in the Russian city of St Petersburg. Elsewhere, in unguarded comments made while chatting to military personnel at an event in London, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Mr Putin had gone ""full tonto"" over Ukraine and had ""no friends"" internationally. Lubov Chernukhin has been among the largest donors to the Conservative Party Earlier, Ms Truss also defended donations made by Russians to the Conservative Party, saying there was a distinction between those who had moved to the UK years ago and those who were actively supporting Mr Putin's government. She was shown a picture from May 2019 which showed her, former Prime Minister Theresa May and other cabinet ministers at the time withLubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Russian minister who has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin has been one of the Conservative Party's biggest donors. Her lawyers say the donations are not tainted by Kremlin influence. Asked if she was embarrassed by the picture, Ms Truss said ""no, I'm not"". At the start of this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Russia the UK was ""preparing a package of sanctions and other measures to be enacted the moment the first Russian toe cap crosses further into Ukrainian territory"". Fast forward to today - and the view in London is very much that toe-caps have crossed that threshold. The prime minister believes an invasion is under way, even if Downing Street says it's not a full-scale one yet and is still urging Russia to stand back from the brink. So, has the UK followed through on its threats about sanctions? Read more. Sources have told the BBC that the foreign secretary has written up a ""long list"" of Russian individuals and organisations, including more oligarchs and banks close to the Kremlin, to be sanctioned if the situation in Ukraine gets worse. The Foreign Office is also likely to target Russian companies in the defence, energy, technology and chemical sectors. Other measures announced by the Foreign Office on Tuesdayinclude sanctioning Russian parliamentarians and preventing British firms from doing business in the two rebel-held areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, recognised by Russia as independent. Ms Truss also said the UK would restrict the Russian state and key companies from raising funding in UK financial markets, as well as ban a range of high-tech exports to Russia, ""degrading the development of its military-industrial base for years"". In a statement released on Wednesday, Ms Truss reaffirmed the UK's commitment to guarantee up to $500m (Â£368m) in loans to Ukraine to mitigate the economic effects of Russian aggression. Lord Kim Darroch, a former UK ambassador to the US, said the UK's sanctions appeared ""pretty modest"" compared to the EU's and particularly Germany's, but he understood the desire to ""hold some things back"" to deploy in the event of an escalation. Tom Keatinge, director of RUSI's Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, described the UK's sanctions as ""essentially taking a pea-shooter to a gun-fight"". Perhaps the biggest penalty Russia has faced so far is the decision by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tohalt approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipelinebetween the two countries. The US and EU have both introduced a range of sanctions, including restricting the Russian state from financing its debt from their banks and banning their own companies from trading with the two rebel-held regions. They have also targeted key Russian individuals and organisations with sanctions. Billionaire Boris Rotenberg is among three men to be sanctioned by the UK Putin allyGennady Timchenkois a billionaire hockey enthusiast with wide business interests in energy, transportation and construction via his Volga investment group. The UK government has accused him of supporting a Russian policy of destabilising Ukraine through his association with Bank Rossiya, of which he is a major shareholder. Igor Rotenberg, another close associate of President Putin, is the oldest son of Arkady Rotenberg and the majority shareholder in the Gazprom Drilling company. Igor's uncle,Boris Rotenberg, has also been targeted. Mr Rotenberg is the co-owner - along with his brother Arkady - of the SGM group, the largest construction company for gas pipelines and electrical power supply lines in Russia. The UK's sanctions notice says he is ""benefiting from or supporting"" the Russian state in his role in a key strategic sector. Rossiyais a privately-owned bank, which also has stakes in a television company. TheBlack Sea Bankis a Crimean bank and was created in 2014 after Russia annexed the region. TheGeneral Bankis a financial institution which also operates in Crimea. Promsvyazbankis a Russian state-owned bank, which the UK government says provides funding to Russia's military. The BBC's business correspondent Theo Leggett says the UK was not targeting the biggest banks but banks known to be used by President Putin's inner circle.

"Screaming Trees frontman and former Queens of the Stone Age member Mark Lanegan has died at the age of 57. Known for his deep, melancholy vocals, the American singer-songwriter died at his home in Killarney, Ireland, a statement on hisTwitter account,externalsaid. During his career he collaborated with musicians including Kurt Cobain, PJ Harvey, Isobel Campbell and Moby. Last year, he was in hospital for months after contracting Covid, and was put into a medically-induced coma. No cause of death has been given. A statement said: ""Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland. ""A beloved singer, songwriter, author, and musician he was 57 and is survived by his wife Shelley [Brien]."" Born in Washington state in 1964, Lanegan joined Screaming Trees in the 1980s and went on to produce eight studio albums until the group's split in 2000. The band pioneered a sound that combined 1960s garage rock with 1970s punk - which later became known as grunge. Although they never achieved the mainstream success of contemporaries like Soundgarden and Nirvana, they scored hits in the US with Nearly Lost You in 1992 and All I Know in 1996.

"Mistakes, waste and fraud that led to billions of pounds of Covid loan support being lost were ""unacceptable"", the head of a group of MPs has said. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said taxpayers will be exposed to financial risks for decades. Previous official figures estimated the government is unlikely to recoup up to Â£21bn of Covid loans to business. The Treasury said it rejects the claims made in the PAC report. Ms Hillier said repeated PAC reports had made clear that a ""lack of preparedness and planning, combined with weaknesses in existing systems across government, have led to an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters"". She said this would end up robbing current and future taxpayers of billions of pounds, and that the ""government must be held accountable"". ""It is essential that for as long as we will be paying the costs of Covid-19, which is at least the next 20 years just in some of the loan repayment terms, the Treasury and all of government continue to account specifically for what it has spent in response to the pandemic. ""Crucially this must ensure lessons are learned for when the next big crisis hits - be it climate, health or financial."" But the Treasury rejected the claims in the report, saying that no fraudulent payments have been written off and the Taxpayer Protection Taskforce it has set up is expected to recover up to Â£1bn from fraudulent or incorrect payments. Bounce Back Loan fraud checks called inadequate Men behind largest Covid loan fraud jailed The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme - commonly known as furlough - alone is estimated to have lost Â£5.3bn to fraud and error. That's almost 9% of the total funding distributed through the programme. The estimated loss to fraud and error across all Covid-19 response measures is not known but is expected to be at least Â£15bn across the schemes and loans implemented by various government departments. In September, spending watchdog the National Audit Office said the government had spent Â£261bn on 374 measures in response to the pandemic. These measures are expected to cost a total of about Â£370bn over their lifetime. That same month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that a provision of nearly Â£21bn had been made for defaults under loan schemes for companies, such as the Covid bounce-back loan policy. The PAC said the Treasury should state what it has learned from the Covid response and what it is doing to collect lessons across government departments. It should also find out how much money has been lost in error and to fraudsters, how much of this will be recovered and how much it will cost to recover it, the committee added. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Our Covid support schemes were rolled out at a time of national crisis, protecting millions of jobs and businesses when they needed it most. ""Thanks to the speed and scale of our intervention, the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at the fastest rate in the G7."" They argued that the ""cost of inaction"" could have had a big impact on jobs and livelihoods.
