"A confidence vote, a promise to stand down, and thousands of miles travelled - it's been a quiet week for the prime minister. Theresa May's week was governed by numbers, as she calculated she wouldn't get her Brexit deal through Parliament for now. She then had to bank on more than half of Tory MPs' support in Wednesday's confidence vote. And with 103 days until we're supposed to leave the EU, she'll hope to find 320 votes to back her deal in time. Over the weekend, Downing Street had insisted that the vote on the prime minister's deal with the European Union would go ahead as planned on Tuesday. But by Monday, defeat was looming. Mrs May needs 320 votes to win a vote in the Commons. Ordinarily she has the support of 326 MPs if we include all Conservatives and Democratic Unionist Party MPs. However, the DUP have said they won't back the deal in its current form, meaning she'd be 4 MPs short. What's more, there are said to be perhaps 90 or so Tory rebels who won't support it, leaving maybe 226 MPs. Mrs May would have had to bank on significant support from opposition MPs, and with that looking extremely unlikely, she decided to postpone the vote. May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal With the Brexit vote cancelled, Mrs May travelled across Europe seeking concessions from EU leaders over the issue of the Irish border. On Tuesday alone, she covered almost 1,200 miles and spent more than four hours flying from London to Amsterdam, then to Berlin and Brussels, before flying home again. Along the way, she got stuck in a car, posed for several awkward photos and failed to get any concessions from the European Union on the Irish backstop. On Wednesday morning, Sir Graham Brady announced he had received enough letters - 48 - to trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May's leadership. The prime minister spent the day rallying her supporters in Westminster, making several concessions - including that she wouldn't stay as leader at the 2022 election. In the end,  she won the confidence vote by 200 votes to 117, or 63%. This was a considerably better ratio than Margaret Thatcher in 1990, who won just 55% of the vote when challenged by Michael Heseltine, and Iain Duncan Smith in 2003, who won just 45%. However, she did worse proportionally than John Major in 1995, He found it increasingly difficult to govern after John Redwood's challenge. Theresa May survives confidence vote of Tory MPs On Thursday, Mrs May confirmed publicly that she would stand down as leader before the next election. Thursday was her 883rd day as prime minister. If we were to rank all leaders since 1900, she would be placed 5th from bottom - above only Bonar Law, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Anthony Eden and Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Mrs May hasn't yet given a leaving date, although some predict she'll quit soon after we leave the EU - currently scheduled for 29 March 2019 (at which point she would still be 5th from bottom). If she manages to stay until 25 May 2019, she'll overtake Gordon Brown, who managed 1,049 days in office. However, the next election is not, in theory, scheduled until June 2022, five years after the previous one (according to the Fixed Term Parliament act). If she stayed until just before that election, she'd also leapfrog Chamberlain, Callaghan, Balfour and Heath, making her the 13th longest serving prime minister since 1900. Will giving a time limit help or hinder the PM? Back in Brussels, Theresa May told the media on Friday lunchtime that she'd had a ""robust discussion"" with Jean-Claude Juncker over the deal, and did her best to reassure the media that if a backstop was triggered, it would just be a temporary move. However, she admitted there is ""work still to do"" with more talks to find the assurances that the UK Parliament needs. But how long does she have left to persuade MPs? We're set to leave the EU on 29 March, giving us 103 days after today. However, Parliament is currently only due to sit for a maximum of 57 of those days: Parliament very rarely sits at weekends, and is off for Christmas between 21 December and 6 January. There's also set to be a February recess between 15 and 24 February, although it's unclear if that will go ahead. Downing Street has said that the vote will have happened by Monday 21 January, in just 38 days' time. A week is a long time in politics - but for Theresa May, this week has probably seemed longer than most.

"It was a tough diplomatic test for Theresa May (3rd R) Led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the other 27 leaders spent almost an hour last night asking Theresa May questions. What reassurances did she seek on the Irish backstop? How did she intend to get the Brexit deal through parliament? What was her vision for the future relationship between the UK and the EU? A diplomatic summary of the meeting seen by the BBC said her answers were ""not really clear"". ""Bad"" and ""pretty bad"" is how it was described by some usually-optimistic diplomats. The lack of precision made the EU wary of offering anything too detailed in the written summit conclusions. More Brexit assurances possible, says May Ireland added wording about the backstop being a Europe-wide issue, not just an Irish one. The backstop is described as an insurance policy to keep the Northern Ireland border open, as it is now. The Northern Ireland border: Now the trickiest Brexit issue to resolve There was no support for Paragraph Five of the draft document, which committed the EU to explore other options to assist the UK. That came as a surprise to the British government, which had secretly helped to draft the summit statement. But European diplomats said that David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership, before the UK's 2016 Brexit vote, played on the leaders' minds - why offer anything that would instantly be ripped apart, or wouldn't work? And why do it now, when a parliamentary vote is still weeks away? Brexit: A really simple guide How could another Brexit referendum work? Brexit summit reaction - as it happened Others fear the focus on tweaking the backstop is preventing the UK from preparing for the negotiations over its new partnership with the EU, storing up bigger problems for the future. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker : ""We were not dancing... she thought that I did criticise her"" In the middle of all of this, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described the situation in the UK as ""nebulous"". The television cameras captured a miffed-looking Theresa May saying to him something that looked like ""You called me nebulous. Yes, me! Nebulous!"" He later clarified that he had meant the picture in the House of Commons was ""foggy"". But it's not hard to detect another dig at the prime minister's expense - that she has failed to create a consensus around her Brexit deal. This video can not be played The moment Theresa May challenged the EU's Juncker Yet Theresa May's mission to Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from her 27 fellow leaders confirming - reconfirming, really - that the Irish backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then the EU would use its ""best endeavours"" to negotiate a trade deal, which would mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly. The EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them. But it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute. The problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics. And they certainly wouldn't fit on the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to Mrs May's Brexit deal.

"Holidaymakers will have to apply for an electronic permit to travel to the EU Britons will have to pay â¬7 (Â£6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, as a consequence of Brexit. The European Commission has confirmed that while UK travellerswill not need a visa,external, they will need to apply for and buy another document. It is called an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) and although not launched yet, is expected to come into force in 2021. The travel requirement is not just for the UK but for many non-EU countries. Citizens of EU countries - which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU. But anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia. Nationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa. However, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list. So it isintroducing the ETIAS,external- an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is ""way cheaper"".

How might Brexit affect my European holiday? Under the Brexit deal,,externalEU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020. After this period ends, the European Commissionhas offered,externalvisa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return. But although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal. The form - which the EU describes as a ""necessary and small procedural step"" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says. The details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions. UK passports - which is the only document currently needed for EU travel - will be blue and the EU reference will disappear after Brexit Most people will find out if their application has been successful within minutes, the EU says, with more than 95% of applications approved automatically. Applications can also be denied or take up to four weeks to process. If successful, the ETIAS will last for three years and allow an unlimited number of entries. The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It is not known what rules will apply to EU tourists coming to the UK, butaccording to the EU and UK's political declaration,,externalboth sides will aim to provide ""visa-free travel for short-term visits"". TheEuropean Commission previously said,externalthe EU's offer of visa-free travel to the UK was ""entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states"". The proposal - which will come into force on 29 March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit - must be adopted by the EU Parliament and European Council before it can come into force. The UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives - allowing people to stay for a maximum of six months. But they are not allowed to work, study or settle. The news could also lead to a renewed surge in applications for Irish passports by British citizens. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will retain visa-free travel benefits after Brexit, no matter the outcome of the UK's negotiations with the EU. UK residents are entitled to an Irish passport if their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland, while most Northern Ireland citizens are entitled to an Irish passport if they wish. Earlier in 2018,it was reportedthat Irish passport applications by UK citizens were booming. EU says no to May on renegotiating deal What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal?

"When you've got an unusual name, there's often a caution around AutoCorrect When a colleague told me my name autocorrected to Dorito and they were seconds away from calling me a tortilla chip in an email, I honestly didn't know what to say. Our names are a key part of our identity so it can be incredibly frustrating when someone gets it wrong at work. At least this occasion was better than when people have mispronounced my name as ""Dirty"" or misspelt it as ""Druhti"", but not knowing what to reply bothered me for days. That's because getting a name wrong makes for somewhat awkward conversation for all involved. Do you tell them or do you let it slide?  What if they're someone who still doesn't get it right after several months and several corrections? Do you now need to change your name by deed poll? Nana Marfo's nickname was not his preferred choice but one bestowed upon him by colleagues I'm clearly not the only one who's facing challenges. When Nana Marfo worked in the civil service, he unwillingly became the subject of an informal name change. He said he already stood out as he has a tracheostomy and while some colleagues were able to call him by the right name, others called him ""Nandos"". He tried to correct the misnomer for three years. ""But one day a client came to our department and started calling me 'Nandos'. When I asked why he called me that, he said that's how my colleague had pronounced my name on the initial visit. At that point I was beyond the point of trying to correct people, and since then have been nicknamed 'Nandos',"" he says. Nana felt he had to let it go. ""I didn't feel this situation was something higher management could correct."" Emails are also dangerous territory. Nefra Germain used to work in the corporate world. She said people would continually get her first name and surname mixed up in emails despite the fact she would sign off with her given name. ""It's like people's brains can't process a name that is unusual so they have to find a way to normalise it and even correct you,"" she says. 'I'm Bilal, so please don't call me Billy' 'That is not how you say my name' So how should you deal with these professional mishaps? Binna Kandola is an author and business psychologist who's had his own fair share of mix-ups. ""I was speaking recently at a conference in Las Vegas and the person who introduced me called me Pina Colada. ""I got up and said: 'My name's Binna Kandola. Pina Colada's my father.' I like to think it made a point to the guy who introduced me. Sometimes humour is the best approach."" Binna Kandola has been called a variety of names, including Benji, Fred and Mr Tandoori He suggests that the minute someone gets your name wrong, correct them straight away and also get teammates to reinforce and support you when in meetings by saying your name correctly each time it is mispronounced. He also says that one-off mistakes should be apologised for, corrections made and everyone should attempt to move on. Sorrel Shalet is the head of people at Smart Energy GB. ""When I introduce myself I often get 'that's OK' as a response. They think I've said that 'I'm sorry'. ""Usually it doesn't bother me too much, but sometimes I tell the person, to help pronounce it correctly, 'My name rhymes with coral.' Using a familiar rhyming word usually does the trick. ""If someone keeps getting your name wrong in the workplace, I would speak to them about it. It's likely they haven't realised their mistake."" And although Nana didn't feel comfortable doing so, Sorrel adds that you could also ""ask your manager or someone from the HR team to raise it informally with them on your behalf"". Montserrat Peidro-Insa's name has been transmogrified into ""Monster Rat"" on occasion Montserrat Peidro-Insa's name may be common in Catalonia but that hasn't stopped her from being called some peculiar aberrations. ""The worst example of that confusion was when a customer in the US thought my name was Monster Rat. He still calls me that without even blinking. ""For some reason Japanese people have no issue with my name. I must admit the funniest ones always come from English-speaking nationalities, especially Americans and Brits."" That's certainly my experience too. What's also frustrating is it's often British or American people who get my name wrong or will mix me up with other Asian women in the office. As well as being annoying,a recent poll by The Guardian,externalinvestigating racial bias in the UK suggested that 57% of people from an ethnic minority background felt they had to work harder to succeed in Britain because of their ethnicity, whilevarious global studiesreveal that some ethnic minorities have had to ""whiten"" their CVs, using techniques such as anglicising their names, in a bid to succeed. Adam or Mohamed - who gets the job? Whether your name is easy to pronounce or not, or not particularly unusual in your country, it seems everyone has a story of being called the wrong name at some point. But how do you reclaim your name, when, let's face it, it could lead to mortal embarrassment? After Simon Hewett told a colleague she got his name wrong, she avoided him Toronto-based Simon Hewett went for the direct approach. ""I had a colleague call me Steve for five years. One day I got in the elevator and it was just the two of us. She said, 'Morning Steve' and I just looked around. ""I then said, 'You know my name is Simon right?' She looked stunned, laughed it off and got off at the next floor. She proceeded to avoid me after that."" Correct someone the moment they get your name wrong Get teammates to reinforce and support you when in meetings by saying your name correctly Ask people how their name should be pronounced - let them guide you Apologise when you get it wrong Binna Kandola admits it's not an easy subject to broach. ""People think [this naming issue] is trivial. If you complain about it, people think the problem is you - that you don't have a sense of humour... you are seen as a troublemaker."" But he says when people consistently get your name wrong, they are ""robbing you of a key part of your identity"". ""That's them saying to you that you don't matter in my world and I can't even be bothered to give you the attention to spell your name right."" He says that how organisations deal with such situations shows what the culture of that organisation is like. ""People need to understand the impact these issues have. There's an education that needs to take place."" This video can not be played The wrong Guy: BBC's best/worst interview? Since this article was prompted by an autocorrect error, I decided to get in touch with Dean Hachamovitch, an inventor on the Microsoft patent for AutoCorrect, to see what he thinks about the technology ""ease maker"" he unleashed? He demystified AutoCorrect slightly: ""AutoCorrect tends to respect capitalised words."" He wasn't sure how to explain the Dorito mix-up though, but did say, ""I'm not sure what there is to do but apologise abjectly, especially if you've called someone a Dorito.""

"One possible way to break the political stalemate over Brexit, could be to offer the public a new vote on European Union (EU) membership. Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, haschallenged the next prime minister - either Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson - to hold another referendum, saying Labour will campaign for ""Remain"". With the UK due to leave the EU on 31 October, how could another referendum work? Organising another public vote would take a minimum of 22 weeks, according to experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London (UCL). This would consist of at least 12 weeks to pass the legislation required to hold a referendum, plus a further 10 weeks to organise the campaign and hold the vote itself. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know The border blocking Brexit Can the next PM force through a no-deal Brexit? A government cannot just decide to hold a referendum. Instead, a majority of MPs and Lords would need to agree and vote through the rules of another public vote. Parliament could copy over large chunks of the legislation that led to the 2016 referendum to speed things up: ""This could be done very quickly in theory,"" says Alan Renwick, deputy director at the Constitution Unit. Mr Renwick estimates this approach could take about 11 weeks - much shorter then the seven months it took last time. But that assumes things go smoothly. If there was a lot of disagreement amongst MPs, it could take much longer to pass the legislation. Potential flashpoints could be over the wording of the referendum question, the number of options on the ballot paper and the voting system. If the legislation was successfully passed, official campaign groups would have to be selected. This would be done by the Electoral Commission. It also needs to assess the referendum question, provide information to voters about how to take part and ensure enough counting officers are available around the country. Once that's out the way, there's the campaign - which usually lasts four weeks - and then the vote itself. All of this would take a minimum of 10 weeks - from passing the legislation to holding the vote,as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000,external. The Electoral Commission says existing law stipulates this is a rigid period that cannot be shortened. Justine Greening, a former Conservative minister, favours another referendum On a 22-week timetable (allowing for legislation and a campaign), it would take until at least mid-December to hold another vote - and that's if the process started now. That means, if Parliament was determined to hold another public vote, it would need to ask the EU to extend the 31 October Brexit deadline. If the EU agreed, it would be the third Brexit extension. But it's not unheard of for countries to hold referendums on much tighter timescales. Four years ago,Greece organised a referendum in just over a week, in which voters rejected the terms of an international bailout following the country's debt crisis. However, Alan Renwick says that if referendums are organised too hastily, it can give the impression that ""normal procedure is not being followed"" and that voters may see the eventual result as illegitimate. A referendum similar to Greece's timescale, for example, would not allow enough time to organise postal votes and assess the question on the ballot paper.

"Kirby tries on a black dress Some people take window-shopping to the next level - you could call it fantasy shopping - because as the pound plummets, the middle is squeezed and politics goes into meltdown, it's fun to pretend to have money. Sue Elliott-Nicholls is an arch exponent of the fantasist's art. I love a posh shop. I love the smell, the lighting, the shimmery floors, the beautiful assistants that join in while I giddily slip a Cartier eternity ring on my finger, waft some Â£300 perfume around, snuggle up in the Â£4,000 armchair and ruminate over the benefits of the Â£550 Chloe sunglasses. Obviously I have no intention of ever buying any of those things, I just like to pretend. In these grey times of austerity - or is post-austerity? - we all need a little golden sparkle in our day, don't we? I'm not alone - there are many of us out there. Tehya, 21, fills up her virtual shopping cart with thousands of pounds' worth of designer bags that Carrie Bradshaw would be proud to tuck under her arm. They're in her cart, on her own computer, in her own home. IT'S LIKE SHE OWNS THEM. ""I could look at bags for hours,"" says Tehya. ""I do it online. I put loads of stuff in my basket, keep it there for a few days and then I empty my basket and start again a few days later."" Tehya also fantasy shops for real bags Kirby, 33, fills up her basket with houses. ""I go on estate agents' websites and think 'Oh! Where am I going to move to?' And then I put them in reverse price order,"" Kirby says, with a mischievous smile. Not bad for someone who's renting a room in her friend's flat. ""I have a friend who actually buys expensive clothes online and then returns them,"" says Kirby. ""The money gets put back on her PayPal, so she has loads of money on her PayPal that she doesn't think about. Then when she needs to buy something she has loads of money on her PayPal account. She sees it as savings."" Listen to Sue Elliott-Nicholls and her friends discussing fantasy shopping on Woman's Hour on Thursday 13 December at 10:00 Orclick here to listen online It was reported this summer that nearly one in 10 British adults buys outfits online, takes a cheeky photo wearing them in their own homes, or a chosen location (even on the beach) and then sends them back. The pictures are posted on social media, often with the Outfit Of The Day (#OOTD) hashtag. I know this is supposed to be a problem, but come on - it's genius. The clothing industry has always chewed us fashion victims up and then spat us out again. Now the worm gets a little turn. This way you get to almost own the outfit. Personally, I prefer a real shop to a virtual one. I love the interactive experience. It's like visiting a stately home, but you can actually lie on Queen Elizabeth's bed and light the fire in the grate. ""Exactly,"" agrees Kirby. ""It's an interactive art installation, where you can try on all the pieces."" Oooh, Givenchy (with Gucci trainers) All the thought, love and work that has gone into designing that Â£300 cushion, the materials responsibly sourced from a Tibetan mountainside, the hand-stitching done by a craftswoman in the Scottish Highlands wearing fingerless gloves - what good is it if no-one sees it? And I love the assistants. They are beautiful, and they make you feel beautiful too. ""They're model-like,"" says my friend Di, another fantasy shopper. ""And they're very complimentary."" Well-groomed and carefully picked for their ability to play the game, I love the whole cast: the beautiful young girl exuding cool chic, the motherly older woman who knows best, the slightly camp best friend. ""Ooooh,"" I cooed in Selfridges as I eyed up my Givenchy frock in the (extremely flattering) mirror. ""These would look good with some Gucci trainers wouldn't they?"" Next thing I knew someone had gone skipping off to get me a pair. Nothing is too much trouble. I tell my mate Tracy about the rapport I felt with the beautiful young assistant helping me decide on a silk shirt last week - I know he really liked me. But Tracey won't have it and pulls me back down to Earth. ""He's schmoozing you because he might have a sale, because in the back of his head he's thinking, 'I might as well give her the schmooze, she just might have Â£900.'"" Tracy takes a selfie in a leopard print I can't believe that can be true. I ask Tehya, who used to work in a high-end luxury shop (selling bags of course). Do they not like me at all? Do they just view me as a potential cash cow? Do they judge me? Surely not. ""No, I think you actually enjoy having someone to talk to for a bit,"" Tehya reassures me. ""Because it's better than just standing around, which is a lot of what retail work is. And you can't actually tell who is faking and who is going to buy stuff - you think you can make a quick assumption as they walk in the door, but sometimes people will just randomly spend thousands of pounds."" We fantasy shoppers hold a great assistant in very high regard, let me tell you. ""There's nothing nicer than going into the changing room and having the attention of the sales assistant,"" agrees Wendy, who works in fashion. ""Advising you, getting extra sizes, sometimes even getting you a glass of champagne!"" ""She got champagne?"" Kirby is incensed. ""I only ever got that in wedding dress shops."" I cast Kirby a respectful glance. I have thought about wedding dress shopping, but Kirby has actually done it. ""Me and my friend would take it in turns to be the bridesmaid and the bride,"" she says. ""It can be a bit awkward, because they ask you loads of questions, like the name of your fiancÃ© and stuff - so when they call you a few weeks later, you just don't answer."" Wendy likes fantasy shopping - but then feels bad afterwards A certain amount of Stanislavsky technique is often helpful when fantasy shopping. You need a persona and a back story - and really believe it. Kirby's alter ego is the daughter of an African diplomat: he's in meetings and has let her loose on the West End with his card. My friend Di plays the wife of a record producer: friends with Victoria Beckham, three successful grown-up children, with a house in Bloomsbury, London, and another one in Paris. Me? I'm just me but with endless amounts of fictional cash to spend - oh yes and a Huguenot pile in Spitalfields for when I'm perusing the soft furnishings. Personally I am happy to leave these shops empty-handed - it's all good, clean free fun. Wendy, though, she doesn't feel so great. ""It's like leaving a spa after having a treatment, you're all relaxed and then you have to get yourself home, and it almost undoes the good that it's done."" I ask Kirby how she feels when she's spewed back into the real world, on to the cold grey pavements. ""Oh that's easy,"" she says. ""I go into Selfridge's late afternoon, try on all the fancy things, then go down on to the food court and buy half-price cupcakes in a fancy yellow bag, so I leave with a cupcake and a bag."" I would like to raise a hurrah for us fantasy shoppers. Far from being delusional fakers, I think we actually do some good. Exercising our creative muscles with improvised role-play, appreciating the lovely things someone has created, and alleviating the boredom of the heavenly shop assistants who, as Wendy points out, ""like us, want to believe"". Two brothers on the autistic spectrum were looking for work when one had the idea of opening a comic shop. It turned out to be an inspired choice.

"Sajed Choudry died after a ""large-scale disturbance"" in a Blackburn street A man who had his ears sliced off in a street attack has died. Sajed Choudry also suffered a fractured skull in what police said was a ""large-scale disturbance"" on Rhyl Avenue in Blackburn on the night of 27 November. The 43-year-old father of four had his ears reattached in hospital but died on Thursday, Lancashire Police said. A 13-year old boy and three men - Rafaqat Ali, 38, Fazal Ilahi, 62, Sadaqat Ali, 36, from Blackburn - were earlier charged with attempted murder. They are due to appear at Preston Crown Court on 17 December. A post-mortem examination is due to be held to establish Mr Choudry's cause of death. A 24-year-old man was also seriously injured during the disturbance and was recovering, police said. Mr Choudry's family has asked for their privacy to be respected.

"Children displaced by recent fighting in the port city Fighting has resumed on the fringes of Yemen's port city of Hudaydah, according to residents, raising fears for a newly agreed truce. The ceasefire for the port was only agreed between the government and rebels at talks in Sweden on Thursday. It is hoped Hudaydah, occupied by Houthi rebels, can be used to bring in supplies for starving millions. Yemen's devastating civil war has left at least 6,600 civilians dead and has created a huge humanitarian crisis. Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition are ranged against Houthi rebels. Iran is accused of giving military backing to the rebels, something it denies. Residents speaking to international news agencies said they heard shell and gunfire in an eastern district of Hudaydah. A resident in the south of the city also reported hearing artillery fire. A Houthi-run TV station said coalition war planes had hit Ras Isa, a port north of Hudaydah that was also part of the truce agreement. The truce, brokered by the United Nations, provided for the withdrawal of both warring parties from Hudaydah within days. They would be replaced by what the UN called local forces. The deal also stipulates that international monitors should be deployed. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that the agreement should be the trigger for ending nearly four years of civil war. Why the battle for Hudaydah matters Why is there a war in Yemen? Leaders of the government and Houthi delegations shook hands in public after the truce was agreed. The Stockholm talks were the first in two years between the Houthis and the Yemeni government. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The World Health Organization warned in October that about 10,000 new suspected cases of cholera were now being reported every week. Why Hudaydah matters Yemen crisis: The battle for Hudaydah.

"The former prime minister can see a clear path to another referendum When the party of government is conducting something akin to a political civil - or perhaps that should be uncivil - war, the main party of opposition will seem united by comparison. Certainly Theresa May's deal has succeeded in bringing her opponents together to denounce it. But according to the former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, the position of both frontbenches on Brexit is ""weird"". He believes Theresa May is wasting time seeking to resuscitate a deal that he has pronounced as dead. And there is the spectacle of the current Labour leader holding back from tabling a confidence motion in a government he wants to remove. More about that laterâ¦ Tony Blair now puts the likelihood of a new referendum at ""above the 50% mark"". He revealed that he had been speaking to Labour MPs who represent Leave areas in recent weeks. He's been trying to reassure them that giving people a final say wouldn't  lead to Brexit-backing voters call time on their parliamentary careers. His argument is that a referendum would be framed as a regretful consequence of a gridlocked parliament. But their fears are not the only, indeed, not the main, barrier to gaining a new referendum. Labour's official policy is to call for a general election. And, if that doesn't happen, to keep all options on the table - including campaigning for a ""public vote"". This just about kept the party united at its annual conference in the autumn, But now the strains are beginning to show. Again there is unity around calling on Theresa May to bring her deal to Parliament next week rather than waiting until January. Beyond that, the parliamentary party's apparent solidity begins to fracture. There have been tensions at the top of the party over the issue MPs who back  Tony Blair's position on a referendum  - such as Chuka Umunna - have called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a motion of no confidence in the government. The calculation is that it would fail because the DUP (on this issue at least) would back the Conservatives. That would then tick the policy box - Labour has asked for an election, hasn't got it, and now it can move on to at the very least discussing the option of a new referendum. But because it wouldn't succeed in bringing the government down, Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to table a formal vote of confidence next week. He is also not enthusiastic about confronting the prospect of a new referendum as a consequence. Instead, we may well see a non-binding censure motion being tabled if Theresa May indeed delays the vote on her deal. So, political damage could be inflicted on the Prime Minister without it rebounding and causing a problem for the Opposition leadership. But as Tony Blair's  former spin doctor Alastair Campbell - a leading advocate for a new referendum - warned his fellow campaigners: ""it may be time to face up to the fact that Labour under Jeremy Corbyn will do everything to make sure a People's Vote won't happen"". Certainly - from a different perspective - that is Labour leaver Kate Hoey's view of Jeremy Corbyn's position too. She and he were both Eurosceptic rebels through the Blair and Brown years. And while the option of a ""public vote"" is Labour policy, I understand behind the scenes in the shadow cabinet the issue is proving highly contentious. People's Vote campaigners want Labour to come on board and quickly I am told that party chairman Ian Lavery and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon have been arguing strongly against committing the party to a referendum - even further down the line. Jon Trickett and - perhaps unsurprisingly, given his public statements - the shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner take a similar view. The shadow education secretary Angela Rayner was never seen as a staunch opponent of the idea but did suggest another referendum could be seen as ""undermining democracy"" on BBC's Question Time. The shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said at Labour's conference - without clearing it with his party leader - that Remain should be an option if there were a new referendum. But I am told privately he has been quite cautious about when to commit to a new vote - and whether it could be won. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell's relatively warm language towards the referendum option in recent weeks - even agreeing that under certain circumstances it could become ""inevitable"" - has led to tensions with the leader's office. Many younger activists in Momentum - the movement John McDonnell and ally Jon Lansman set up  - support the position of ""remain and reform"" the EU and the left-wing Another Europe Is Possible - along with unions such as the GMB and TSSA - want a new vote. There are those in Labour's ranks who think there is a ""third way"" between rejecting the May deal and signing up to a new vote. The chair of the Commons Brexit committee, Hilary Benn, favours a 'Norway Plus' option - staying economically close to the EU but outside its political structures. This video can not be played Tony Blair tells Today the EU would help the UK remain if it was ""prepared to think again"" This video can not be played Rayner: New referendum 'undermines democracy' He wants Parliament to be able to vote on this option but I am told that Jeremy Corbyn does not want to embrace this policy, which would involve staying inside the single market. Tony Blair's prediction is this: He doesn't necessarily think that the current Labour leadership will ever embrace a new popular vote. But if Parliament rejects every other option, he believes Labour MPs will be faced with a stark choice between extending Article 50 and backing a new referendum, or leaving with no deal. Under these circumstances, he argues, an ""overwhelming"" number of Labour MPs would opt for a new vote - and could cite party policy as cover. Hilary Benn isn't so sure. He also thinks there is a danger that Parliament rejects all options - including his favourite, Norway. But that this wouldn't necessarily lead to a new referendum. ""All of the options have real and genuine difficulties,"" he toldRadio 4's 'Political Thinking' podcast. ""All of the options have real and genuine difficulties. It may be that the prime minister decides 'well, I'm taking my deal to the country.'"" Well that, in its own way, really would be a People's Vote.

"A major stadium in Los Angeles has confirmed that it uses facial recognition tech during sport and music events, to spot known troublemakers. The Rose Bowl told news siteGizmodo,externalthat it used the tech ""inside and outside"" the stadium gates. It made the statement after an article inRolling Stone,externalalleged that Taylor Swift fans were scanned at a pop concert in an effort to spot stalkers. However, the companies involved have been reluctant to talk. According to Rolling Stone, visitors to a Taylor Swift concert at the Rose Bowl were encouraged to visit a pop-up booth playing behind-the-scenes footage of the pop star. The booth allegedly recorded fans and compared their pictures to a database of Swift's known stalkers. The claims were made by the chief technology officer of a company called Oak View Group. He told Rolling Stone he had been invited to see the technology in action. However, the article did not name the company responsible. The BBC's Dave Lee has tried to contact Oak View Group and Taylor Swift's representatives, but neither has responded to his questions. But the Rose Bowl has confirmed it does use facial recognition at some events to enhance security. It says the use of the tech is clearly signposted at events. However, it has not offered any clarity about the alleged Taylor Swift pop-up booth. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Witnesses say people quickly fell ill after eating rice following a consecration ceremony Eleven people have died and dozens more have fallen ill after eating rice at a temple in India, police say. About 70 people have been admitted to hospital after eating the food following a ceremony in the southern state of Karnataka. Police told BBC Hindi that 11 patients are in a critical condition. Two people have reportedly been arrested following the incident, and one health official told local media that the food may have been poisoned. ""We were offered tomato rice [which] was smelling,"" one person who attended the ceremony told reporters. ""All those who threw it away are fine,"" they added. ""Those who ate [it] started vomiting and complained of stomach pain."" The incident happened at the Maramma temple in the Chamarajanagar district on Friday, where a special event was taking place. The rice was reportedly served as a religious offering to the congregation as they left the temple. ""Today was the consecration ceremony here,"" another witness said, before adding that many people had travelled from neighbouring villages to attend the event. Some have expressed shock at the news on social media, including former Indian Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda. ""Families who have lost their lives in the disaster should have the strength and courage to endure the pain,"" he wrote in a tweet.

" On an ancient monument near Republique, fresh graffiti scars the old grey stone - its garish scrawl a slash of anger above the pigeons serenely scratching beneath the arch: “Down with caviar, long live the kebab!”  A lone shout in a breadcrumb-trail of slogans, marking the path of protesters through Paris last weekend. This boulevard of the French capital became, for a few hours that day, an urban battlefield. Under vast posters showing the latest releases, lines of riot police and armoured vehicles filed past the grand old Rex cinema.  In front of them, protesters pulled together barricades from street furniture, as trees were set alight and tear gas filled the air. “Franck”, who wouldn't give his real name, was among the protesters on Saturday.  A construction worker from the Calais region, he says he supports the protests, and came to Paris with four of his friends to join them. They were carrying gas masks and other protective gear. Franck was prepared for trouble - his friends, he says, were looking for it.  By the time they arrived on the boulevard near Republique, they were part of a group of more than 100 people. “They were overturning cars, breaking shop windows, they set fire to anything they could,” he says.  “I’d never seen anything like it.  It was anarchy, total chaos.  It was war. Everything was on fire - bins, cars, the protective hoarding around the shops. “The police charged us - the atmosphere was very tense.  And the protesters, we all felt like we were in it together.” French protests have often seemed like a dance between demonstrators and police - direct action has a long and cherished history here.  But these weekly confrontations between people and state are different. Not led by any union or political party, the “yellow vest” protests have unleashed the worst civil disorder Paris has seen for decades. Four people have been killed, many hundreds injured and billions of euros of damage inflicted on the country’s urban centres. The French government at one point warned of “serious violence” and “fears for democracy and its institutions”, with at least one protest spokesman calling on people to march on the Elysee Palace, the home of the president. There is a difference between legitimate protest and unacceptable violence, the government has repeated, time after time. And yet the power of this movement lies, not in the violence at its margins, but in the quiet support of what polls suggest is more than half the country for its basic aims. Protesters demonstrate on their knees against rising costs of living in Lille President Emmanuel Macron came to power vowing to face down protesters and drive through long-postponed economic reforms. For the first 18 months of his presidency, that’s exactly what he did - forcing through changes in the labour law against a backdrop of noisy public protests, and bulldozing past broad, union-led demonstrations on railway reform. This current crisis erupted - not over a flagship issue - but over a fiscal detail in the budget for next year, a routine rise in eco-taxes on fuel.  It wasn’t even a policy that the current government had made.  The commitment to annual tax rises on fuel - and especially diesel - in order to fund eco-friendly projects had been part of the previous government’s legacy to Macron. But it was enough to spark a small local rebellion - a handful of motorists who started displaying their regulation hi-vis jackets, or gilets jaunes, in the windscreens of their cars and posting their actions on Facebook. French President Emmanuel Macron (C) in Paris Now a movement created on social media, with no recognised leadership, has forced President Macron into concessions that were unthinkable a few weeks ago.  How? Because this is not a confrontation about fuel taxes, or any one issue. It’s about power. It’s no accident that cars were the spark that ignited this anger.  Not needing one has become a status symbol in France. Those in city centres have a wealth of public transport to choose from, but you need to be rich enough to live in the centre of Paris or Marseille or Bordeaux, and most people are not. “Economic growth happens in big globalised cities, but the working classes no longer live there,” says Christophe Guilluy, an independent researcher specialising in human geography.  “That’s a major change.  For the first time in history, they don’t live where wealth and jobs are created. They live in a ‘peripheral France’, characterised by weak economic growth, high unemployment and high anxiety.” “This economic model creates enormous wealth,” he continues. “But it creates it in a concentrated and unequal way. Since the 1980s, what we are seeing is a weakening of all categories of the middle class.” Tower block in la Cite des 4000 in La Courneuve in the Paris suburbs Outside the ring roads that encircle Paris, and other major French cities, you will find the suburbs and satellite towns where workers like Nouria Benatia live.  And the gap between the world she works in, and the one she can afford to live in, is growing. She commutes into central Paris every day to work as a receptionist in a smart hotel just off the Champs-Elysees.  After this month’s violent protests in the capital, she says the hotel has emptied and bookings have nose-dived. But she has little sympathy for business owners here. “To be honest, I still have the same salary, so what does it change for me if the business is working or not?” she says.  “I [still] have to go outside Paris to live, and come in to work every day. If the protests were more peaceful, maybe I’d join them.” Protesters block a road leading to the Frontignan oil depot Without a car, those in France who have been priced out of the big cities would struggle to get to work, take their children to school and even to shop for groceries. Petrol prices here are roughly the same as in Germany or the UK - and French diesel prices generally lie somewhere in between its two neighbours. But there is a more general sense of unfairness - a feeling that the struggling middle class are being asked to shoulder more than their fair share of the burden, while France’s millionaires have seen their top rate of tax slashed.  And the pain was felt especially keenly this year, because rises in the global oil price had already made fuel more expensive. In September this year, the government announced its planned increase in the eco-taxes levied on petrol and, particularly, on diesel. Shortly afterwards, the first motorists began showing off their hi-vis jackets in the windscreens of their cars, and Jacline Mouraud, a hypnotherapist from Brittany, published a video on social media saying that motorists were being “hunted”. French protester Jacline Mouraud Months earlier, Priscillia Ludosky, the manager of an online cosmetics company from just outside Paris, had launched a petition on the website Change.org calling for petrol prices to be lowered.  After the announcement on tax rises, it really began to take off, quickly gathering a million signatures - but still, she says, there’s been no response from the government. “We are not understood, we are not heard, our opinions are not sought on the big decisions,” she explains.  “I get the impression that when the president speaks to people in the street, he’s completely detached from reality.” Priscillia Ludosky (C) and Eric Drouet (R) Then, in October, truck driver Eric Drouet, another initiator of the movement, suggested on Facebook the idea of a national blockage, calling on protesters around the country to block roads in their area on 17 November, obstructing and slowing traffic in order to get the government’s attention. About 290,000 people took part. The gilets jaunes movement had begun. “The movement started around a tax rise,” says Christophe Guilluy, “but I think it’s simply a pretext, in the same way that Brexit is not fundamentally a confrontation with Europe, but first and foremost a way for people to say ‘we exist’. “In France, people are using the gilets jaunes as a way to say ‘we exist’ to the elites, to the political class, to those who have forgotten about them for the past 20 years, for the simple reason that they no longer live in the same place.” A map of the planned protests to take place on 17 November, collated by the group 'Blocage 17 Novembre' A Christmas tree overlooks the motorway toll station at La Ciotat, 45 minutes’ drive outside Marseille, its tinsel and baubles catching the light from braziers flaring in the drizzle.  The protesters here, as on other blockades across France, are settling in for Christmas.  Their tents are well stocked with food and drink from local well-wishers, and the noise from supporters honking their horns as they pass along the road frequently drowns out conversation. More than a dozen people stand around in their hi-vis jackets, well wrapped up  in hats and gloves against the cold.  Many protest sites, like this one, have developed into semi-permanent camps, snaking along the roadside, with plenty of cover from the elements, and supplies of basic necessities stacked neatly on wooden pallets. Many are 24-hour operations, and more often than not, there are small rivalries and animated discussions over who should speak for the group. Antonin Olles is a retired technology teacher.  He says social media has played a key role in creating this movement, and restoring to people here a role in the national debate. “The government wasn’t aware of the power of social media in giving a voice to people who weren’t being heard,” he says, beneath the ear-splitting blares of passing lorries.  “Not only does it let people air their grievances, it also lets them communicate with people who feel the same way. These people don’t often get to speak to the TV or the newspapers.  It’s a way for them to mobilise; to show they exist.” Antonin Olles Some have questioned whether the movement was helped by a change toFacebook’s algorithms. Posts from companies and the media became less prominent, with individual contributions given a boost.  But, as with other social media uprisings, the roots of this one run deep. Guilluy says France is no longer just looking at an economic or a social crisis, but a democratic one: “You have here groups that have not been represented for a very long time by the big political parties.  Those who join this movement are those that vote least, the most disengaged from public life. They wanted to have their voice heard, but they haven’t had a way to do it.” Olles thinks that politicians, union leaders and other representatives have all been discounted. “People ask themselves - how can this person stand up for me if they don’t know what my life is like?  They are relocating everything from villages to big cities - there are fewer local schools, fewer local doctors or hospitals.  One woman needed a helicopter ambulance to take her hospital in time to give birth.  It’s no wonder people feel like they’re being abandoned.” The irony, for Emmanuel Macron, is that he came to power promising to rebuild trust in politics, especially among those struggling to thrive in the new, globalised economy.  This is the last chance, he told me on the campaign trail last year - if he was to fail, next time it would be Marine Le Pen. The reforms he promised were designed, he said, to create wealth in order that it could be shared with those who needed it most. It was a policy that aimed to liberalise and protect, but many here feel that the social protection for workers has fallen short compared with the liberal reforms enjoyed by businesses. (From L) French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, French President Emmanuel Macron and French Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy meet with representatives of trade unions President Macron pushed through reforms where previous presidents had feared to tread - reducing the power of the unions in workplace relations, ending the special benefits enjoyed by railway workers, and making it easier for companies to hire and fire staff. He also ended the wealth tax on all assets apart from property, meaning a 70% cut in the tax for France’s millionaires. It was meant to boost investment in the economy, but it was seen by many poorer voters as further proof that this former banker-turned-president was still primarily a friend of business, not of the squeezed working and middle class. Winners and losers in France's 2018-2019 budgetSource: Institut des Politiques Publiques France’s Public Policy Institute recently published a review of who had gained and lost under Macron’s presidency so far. It found that the buying power of the poorest in society had slightly shrunk, while those in the economic middle had slightly gained. But the biggest winners were the richest 1%. This sense of unfairness emerges time and again in the graffiti that has appeared on walls and monuments in Paris.  Much of it calls for the resignation of Macron, or simply the “fall of the regime”.  On the Republic’s famous monument at Republique, someone has changed the revolutionary right of “universal suffrage” to read “universal suffering”. Graffiti reads: ""The people want the fall of the regime"" If the roots of protesters’ frustration lie in the big economic shifts of the 1980s, how far did Macron himself encourage it to bloom into open opposition? “In the last election, many people voted to change their situation and they still find themselves here, so they’ve started to get frustrated,” says protester Antonin Olles.  “They’ve realised that those who govern them don’t know what real life is like - for them, poverty is just a set of numbers.” Despite his warnings against populist nationalism, there have been times when President Macron seemed unaware of the tensions swirling beneath the surface of French society, leading to criticism that he’s aloof and out of touch. At a public event at the Elysee Palace earlier this year, he told a 25-year-old gardener who complained of not finding work that he would easily find a job if he applied to hotels, restaurants or construction sites.  “[If] I crossed the street, I’d find you one,” the president told him.  “So go ahead.” After four weeks of national protest, he addressed the nation in a bid to satisfy demonstrators and drain the movement of momentum.  What he offered was the most significant climb-down of his presidency so far - a monthly bonus of 100 euros for those on the minimum wage, an end to tax and social charges on overtime and workers’ annual bonuses, and a freeze in some pension charges. Protestors take notes as they watch French President Emmanuel Macron's speech on TV on 10 December 2018 There was also an admission that he had sometimes got things wrong. “I know some of the things I’ve said have hurt you,” he said - but there was no formal apology and no change in the government’s economic course.   Further reforms planned for next year - on pensions and unemployment insurance - are still set to go ahead. Instead, the president’s response was to look for solutions at the local level.  He announced an unprecedented national debate - on the environment, immigration, decentralisation and political disengagement.  He also said he wanted to meet France’s mayors “region by region” to build the basis of a “new contract with the nation”. La Penne-sur-Huveaune's town hall The town hall at La Penne-sur-Huveaune, 20 minutes’ drive from La Ciotat, is painted salmon pink. Three huge French flags hang from the poles above the entrance. Dangling from one of them is a hi-vis motorist’s jacket, a gilet jaune. Christine Capdeville is the Communist mayor of La Penne-sur-Huveaune.  When I ask her what she thinks of President Macron’s solution to the crisis, she laughs. Mayor of La Penne-sur-Huveaune, Christine Capdeville “President Macron has ignored us from the moment he came to power,” she says. “And now, all of a sudden, he wants us to come to his rescue! “Can I be honest with you,” she asks. The idea of a national consultation is “absolute rubbish. We’re going to get a piece of paper asking for our grievances, and that’s it. Then everything will carry on just like before.” The call has gone out for another day of national protest - the fifth consecutive weekend for the gilets jaunes, or “Act 5” as it’s being called.  Franck is already planning to come back to Paris with his friends to see more of the action. The violence he saw last week near Republique will stay with him for the rest of his life, he says.  But he liked the atmosphere: “Everyone is together, we are all one, a very good team.  It’s not every day you see that.” That sense of unity among the protesters is what has given the movement its energy, and its power. Sylvie and Christophe arrived on the Champs-Elysees last Saturday by 09:00.  I met them walking up the near-empty boulevard towards the Arc de Triomphe with a group of friends. “She’s far left,” Christophe told me, “and I’m far-right - and we’re here together for the gilets jaunes!” “That’s what Macron doesn’t like,” he continued. “That we’re united.  He’s brought back solidarity among the French.  He’s turned everyone against him.  We’re united in combat - at least for now.  After that, who knows?” Student Sylvie “Our strength is that we’re apolitical,” Sylvie said. “Maybe later when there are new presidential elections, we’ll put together a leaflet, but for the moment we don’t need a leader - that’s our strength.” Are you scared there might be violence here today, I asked her? “No,” she replied.  “We have nothing left to lose.” President Macron won last year’s election by cannibalising France’s traditional centre-right and centre-left parties.  It deepened splits within the remaining opposition - and has helped keep the political opposition in check ever since. Now, that divided opposition has been replaced by a social movement that has also united people from left and right, in the same way that Macron did - along with many of those who are disillusioned with traditional politics altogether. Bruno Bonnell is an MP and founder member of the president’s party, La Republique En Marche. He says the gilets jaunes could emerge as the new opposition to Emmanuel Macron. MP Bruno Bonnell “This [movement] looks like ours did originally,” he said in the lobby of the National Assembly.  “I remember En Marche when people were saying we had no programme and we didn’t know where we were going.  We were debating in bars and cafes, trying to reinvent the world. “This movement is more about resistance, it’s populist like the Five Star movement or Podemos, but if they gather effectively with leaders and representatives, then we’ll finally face a clearer opposition.” He says he had visited protest sites many times to ask, specifically, what demonstrators wanted, but that every proposal he made was rejected. “We are now beyond that.  It’s a political conversation, not a conversation about money or compassion.” Some protesters see a future as a political party.  But so far, diversity has been the movement’s appeal - the right of each of its 10,000 members to speak only for themselves.  Distrust of representatives is so strong that even the few spokespeople to emerge have come under heavy criticism, even death threats. But without a leader, or a cohesive agenda, what future does this movement have? “The leader ought to be the president of France,” Anthony Joubert, one of the founders of the movement, says.  “It’s he who has to understand us.  He should be spending his time listening, instead of creating a situation where restaurants can charge 15 euros for a bottle of water.  As things stand the gilets jaunes are leading ourselves.  We are an assembly.  We are a national assembly.” Back at the barricade at La Ciotat, Antonin Olles has gravitated towards the makeshift barbecue as some of the protesters watch a few small piles of sardines crisp on the coals. There is talk about the next protest - some in La Ciotat say they’re planning to demonstrate here, rather than make the trip up to Paris. Protesters cook sardines at the tollbooth between La Ciotat and Aubagne Many have cautioned against dismissing this movement too quickly, even if the level of protest and violence in the capital falls. “The absence of a complete eruption last Saturday doesn’t mean the protest is easing,” cautioned the daily Le Figaro earlier this week.  “[The president] won’t win over the country by pulling out his cheque-book or flaunting his intellect, he needs to open his heart.” “We want a second French revolution,” Olles says.  “We want to show the rest of Europe that the people have some power.” France was seen from the outside as having avoided a populist revolution 18 months ago - but the election of Emmanuel Macron simply papered over France’s problems.  Fixing them will take a whole lot more. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.14542212
"The bedroom was empty when a large rock crashed through the rear wall A large rock which fell from a cliff came crashing into the bedroom of a seafront flat. The occupant of the first-floor flat, in Hastings, East Sussex, was not at home when two boulders weighing several tonnes tumbled into a building on Thursday. One caused damage to the room, while the other landed on the flat roof of a ground floor shop in White Rock. Fire crews evacuated the building and it was deemed structurally unsafe. Hastings Borough Council said the tenant of the flat had been found alternative accommodation along with three people from another flat, and officials were arranging for the cliff to be surveyed. Spokesman Kevin Boorman said letters had been delivered to about 35 other properties advising residents that their homes may not be safe, and that they should move out. They will be put up by the council this weekend but must find their own accommodation from Monday. Members of the public have been urged to avoid the cliff top.

"Baby Benedicte's mother, who had Ebola, died during childbirth A baby girl who was diagnosed with Ebola when she was only six days old has survived, health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have confirmed. Baby Benedicte's mother was infected with Ebola and died during childbirth. Benedicte showed symptoms only days later and it has taken five weeks of round-the-clock treatment to keep her alive. Her dad and aunt took her home on Wednesday. ""Her father, Thomas, was very emotionalâ¦ she is his first baby,"" a health ministry spokeswoman told the BBC. Ebola is a deadly infection that causes severe fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and internal and external bleeding. About half of those infected die, butbabies are even less likely to survive. During this outbreak, there have been 27 cases of Ebola in children yet to reach their first birthday and 21 have died. Tales of survival, like Benedicte's, are rare. She was born on 31 October 2018 and was cared for at the Ebola Treatment Center in Beni, the city hardest hit by the outbreak in DR Congo. She is the youngest patient for whom doctors and volunteers there have cared. The little girl has become known as the ""miracle of Beni"". This video can not be played The current outbreak is the deadliest since Ebola was discovered in 1976 It is a viral illness that kills around 50% of the people it infects Initial symptoms include sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - internal and external bleeding Ebola infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope People are infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus, which can be for up to seven weeks after they recover Ebola basics: What you need to know The Ebola outbreak in the country is now the second largest in history. The latest figures,externalshow there have been 515 cases and 303 deaths. Since October,there have been around 33 people diagnosed every week,externaland children and women have been disproportionately affected. The World Health Organization says the situation in the country is ""concerning"" and there remains a ""very high risk"" of the outbreak spreading further. Ebola virus infects humans through close contact with infected animals It has been able to use new tools that have not been available in previous outbreaks. Nearly 45,000 people have been given an Ebola vaccine and for the first time multiple experimental Ebola drugs are being trialled in the midst of an outbreak. But efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by conflict in the region with more than one million people displaced from their homes and refugees moving to neighbouring countries. Armed groups have made it challenging for healthcare workers to do the basics of managing an outbreak, including tracing people who may have come into contact with infected individuals. And health officials are also trying to deal with three separate outbreaks of polio, as well as outbreaks of cholera and malaria.

"Shares in Johnson & Johnson plunged more than 10% on Friday, after Reuters reported that the US pharmaceutical giant had known about asbestos tainting its talcum powder for decades. The report comes as the company faces thousands of lawsuits claiming that its talc products caused cancer. Reuters' review of documents found the company was aware of trace amounts of asbestos since at least 1971. J&J lawyers said: ""Johnson & Johnson's baby powder is safe and asbestos-free. ""The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory. Simply put, the Reuters story is an absurd conspiracy theory."" Attorney Peter Bicks told Reuters in an email. ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" Reuters reviewed Johnson & Johnson documents produced as part of the trials, many of which had been shielded from view by court orders. The documents revealed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s the firm's internal tests sometimes found small amounts of asbestos in its raw talc and finished powders. Most of the firm's tests did not find asbestos, and it did not disclose the tests that did to regulators, Reuters found. Mr Bicks said the tests cited by Reuters article were ""outlier"" results. In court, the firm has argued that some of the documents referred to industrial talc products. The investor reaction wiped 10% off the firm's market value at one point, making it the biggest loser on the Dow. Legal cases against Johnson & Johnson have had mixed results. In July, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $4.7bn (Â£3.6bn)in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer. The verdict marked the largest payout the firm has faced over the allegations. The firm is appealing against the decision.

"The Met Office has issued a number of weather warnings Heavy snow, blizzards and treacherous conditions are expected to cause disruption across Scotland. The Met Office issuedan amber warning,externalfor snow in the Highlands, Grampian, Central, Tayside, Strathclyde and Fife from 09:00 on Saturday. There is also an amber warning for ice covering much of Scotland and northern parts of England from 10:00 on Saturday to 06:00 on Sunday. Drivers are being warned about the risk of rare ""freezing rain"". The Met Office said that normally warnings for ice indicated slow formation over a number of hours, but Saturday's ice will come from freezing rain which can see ice forming instantly on contact with surfaces. Black ice may affect bus, train and air travel and dangerous driving conditions are likely to lead to road crashes, road closures and longer journey times. The snow is expected to cause some vehicles and passengers to be stranded and delays and cancellations to rail travel are likely. Forecasters said 5-10cm (2-4in) was likely to fall widely in the warning zone, with some areas seeing 20cm (8in), and perhaps as much as 40cm (16in) over higher ground. The amber warning is in place until 08:00 on Sunday. The snow will clear from the west by Sunday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""As rain bands associated with the area of low pressure run into cold air, a mixture of snow and freezing rain is expected. ""As heavy, freezing rain moves in during Saturday morning, it'll lead to rapid formation of ice. Treacherous conditions are expected on roads and pavements."" Weather warnings explained How to drive in snow and icy weather She added: ""The ice and snow bring the risk of public transport disruption and very difficult conditions on the roads and pavements. Strong to gale force south easterly winds will also lead to drifting and blizzards over high ground. The public are advised to be prepared."" Temperatures will range between 0C and 2C.

"The former prime minister can see a clear path to another referendum When the party of government is conducting something akin to a political civil - or perhaps that should be uncivil - war, the main party of opposition will seem united by comparison. Certainly Theresa May's deal has succeeded in bringing her opponents together to denounce it. But according to the former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, the position of both frontbenches on Brexit is ""weird"". He believes Theresa May is wasting time seeking to resuscitate a deal that he has pronounced as dead. And there is the spectacle of the current Labour leader holding back from tabling a confidence motion in a government he wants to remove. More about that laterâ¦ Tony Blair now puts the likelihood of a new referendum at ""above the 50% mark"". He revealed that he had been speaking to Labour MPs who represent Leave areas in recent weeks. He's been trying to reassure them that giving people a final say wouldn't  lead to Brexit-backing voters call time on their parliamentary careers. His argument is that a referendum would be framed as a regretful consequence of a gridlocked parliament. But their fears are not the only, indeed, not the main, barrier to gaining a new referendum. Labour's official policy is to call for a general election. And, if that doesn't happen, to keep all options on the table - including campaigning for a ""public vote"". This just about kept the party united at its annual conference in the autumn, But now the strains are beginning to show. Again there is unity around calling on Theresa May to bring her deal to Parliament next week rather than waiting until January. Beyond that, the parliamentary party's apparent solidity begins to fracture. There have been tensions at the top of the party over the issue MPs who back  Tony Blair's position on a referendum  - such as Chuka Umunna - have called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a motion of no confidence in the government. The calculation is that it would fail because the DUP (on this issue at least) would back the Conservatives. That would then tick the policy box - Labour has asked for an election, hasn't got it, and now it can move on to at the very least discussing the option of a new referendum. But because it wouldn't succeed in bringing the government down, Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to table a formal vote of confidence next week. He is also not enthusiastic about confronting the prospect of a new referendum as a consequence. Instead, we may well see a non-binding censure motion being tabled if Theresa May indeed delays the vote on her deal. So, political damage could be inflicted on the Prime Minister without it rebounding and causing a problem for the Opposition leadership. But as Tony Blair's  former spin doctor Alastair Campbell - a leading advocate for a new referendum - warned his fellow campaigners: ""it may be time to face up to the fact that Labour under Jeremy Corbyn will do everything to make sure a People's Vote won't happen"". Certainly - from a different perspective - that is Labour leaver Kate Hoey's view of Jeremy Corbyn's position too. She and he were both Eurosceptic rebels through the Blair and Brown years. And while the option of a ""public vote"" is Labour policy, I understand behind the scenes in the shadow cabinet the issue is proving highly contentious. People's Vote campaigners want Labour to come on board and quickly I am told that party chairman Ian Lavery and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon have been arguing strongly against committing the party to a referendum - even further down the line. Jon Trickett and - perhaps unsurprisingly, given his public statements - the shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner take a similar view. The shadow education secretary Angela Rayner was never seen as a staunch opponent of the idea but did suggest another referendum could be seen as ""undermining democracy"" on BBC's Question Time. The shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said at Labour's conference - without clearing it with his party leader - that Remain should be an option if there were a new referendum. But I am told privately he has been quite cautious about when to commit to a new vote - and whether it could be won. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell's relatively warm language towards the referendum option in recent weeks - even agreeing that under certain circumstances it could become ""inevitable"" - has led to tensions with the leader's office. Many younger activists in Momentum - the movement John McDonnell and ally Jon Lansman set up  - support the position of ""remain and reform"" the EU and the left-wing Another Europe Is Possible - along with unions such as the GMB and TSSA - want a new vote. There are those in Labour's ranks who think there is a ""third way"" between rejecting the May deal and signing up to a new vote. The chair of the Commons Brexit committee, Hilary Benn, favours a 'Norway Plus' option - staying economically close to the EU but outside its political structures. This video can not be played Tony Blair tells Today the EU would help the UK remain if it was ""prepared to think again"" This video can not be played Rayner: New referendum 'undermines democracy' He wants Parliament to be able to vote on this option but I am told that Jeremy Corbyn does not want to embrace this policy, which would involve staying inside the single market. Tony Blair's prediction is this: He doesn't necessarily think that the current Labour leadership will ever embrace a new popular vote. But if Parliament rejects every other option, he believes Labour MPs will be faced with a stark choice between extending Article 50 and backing a new referendum, or leaving with no deal. Under these circumstances, he argues, an ""overwhelming"" number of Labour MPs would opt for a new vote - and could cite party policy as cover. Hilary Benn isn't so sure. He also thinks there is a danger that Parliament rejects all options - including his favourite, Norway. But that this wouldn't necessarily lead to a new referendum. ""All of the options have real and genuine difficulties,"" he toldRadio 4's 'Political Thinking' podcast. ""All of the options have real and genuine difficulties. It may be that the prime minister decides 'well, I'm taking my deal to the country.'"" Well that, in its own way, really would be a People's Vote.

"One possible way to break the political stalemate over Brexit, could be to offer the public a new vote on European Union (EU) membership. Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, haschallenged the next prime minister - either Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson - to hold another referendum, saying Labour will campaign for ""Remain"". With the UK due to leave the EU on 31 October, how could another referendum work? Organising another public vote would take a minimum of 22 weeks, according to experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London (UCL). This would consist of at least 12 weeks to pass the legislation required to hold a referendum, plus a further 10 weeks to organise the campaign and hold the vote itself. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know The border blocking Brexit Can the next PM force through a no-deal Brexit? A government cannot just decide to hold a referendum. Instead, a majority of MPs and Lords would need to agree and vote through the rules of another public vote. Parliament could copy over large chunks of the legislation that led to the 2016 referendum to speed things up: ""This could be done very quickly in theory,"" says Alan Renwick, deputy director at the Constitution Unit. Mr Renwick estimates this approach could take about 11 weeks - much shorter then the seven months it took last time. But that assumes things go smoothly. If there was a lot of disagreement amongst MPs, it could take much longer to pass the legislation. Potential flashpoints could be over the wording of the referendum question, the number of options on the ballot paper and the voting system. If the legislation was successfully passed, official campaign groups would have to be selected. This would be done by the Electoral Commission. It also needs to assess the referendum question, provide information to voters about how to take part and ensure enough counting officers are available around the country. Once that's out the way, there's the campaign - which usually lasts four weeks - and then the vote itself. All of this would take a minimum of 10 weeks - from passing the legislation to holding the vote,as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000,external. The Electoral Commission says existing law stipulates this is a rigid period that cannot be shortened. Justine Greening, a former Conservative minister, favours another referendum On a 22-week timetable (allowing for legislation and a campaign), it would take until at least mid-December to hold another vote - and that's if the process started now. That means, if Parliament was determined to hold another public vote, it would need to ask the EU to extend the 31 October Brexit deadline. If the EU agreed, it would be the third Brexit extension. But it's not unheard of for countries to hold referendums on much tighter timescales. Four years ago,Greece organised a referendum in just over a week, in which voters rejected the terms of an international bailout following the country's debt crisis. However, Alan Renwick says that if referendums are organised too hastily, it can give the impression that ""normal procedure is not being followed"" and that voters may see the eventual result as illegitimate. A referendum similar to Greece's timescale, for example, would not allow enough time to organise postal votes and assess the question on the ballot paper.

"It was a tough diplomatic test for Theresa May (3rd R) Led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the other 27 leaders spent almost an hour last night asking Theresa May questions. What reassurances did she seek on the Irish backstop? How did she intend to get the Brexit deal through parliament? What was her vision for the future relationship between the UK and the EU? A diplomatic summary of the meeting seen by the BBC said her answers were ""not really clear"". ""Bad"" and ""pretty bad"" is how it was described by some usually-optimistic diplomats. The lack of precision made the EU wary of offering anything too detailed in the written summit conclusions. More Brexit assurances possible, says May Ireland added wording about the backstop being a Europe-wide issue, not just an Irish one. The backstop is described as an insurance policy to keep the Northern Ireland border open, as it is now. The Northern Ireland border: Now the trickiest Brexit issue to resolve There was no support for Paragraph Five of the draft document, which committed the EU to explore other options to assist the UK. That came as a surprise to the British government, which had secretly helped to draft the summit statement. But European diplomats said that David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership, before the UK's 2016 Brexit vote, played on the leaders' minds - why offer anything that would instantly be ripped apart, or wouldn't work? And why do it now, when a parliamentary vote is still weeks away? Brexit: A really simple guide How could another Brexit referendum work? Brexit summit reaction - as it happened Others fear the focus on tweaking the backstop is preventing the UK from preparing for the negotiations over its new partnership with the EU, storing up bigger problems for the future. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker : ""We were not dancing... she thought that I did criticise her"" In the middle of all of this, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described the situation in the UK as ""nebulous"". The television cameras captured a miffed-looking Theresa May saying to him something that looked like ""You called me nebulous. Yes, me! Nebulous!"" He later clarified that he had meant the picture in the House of Commons was ""foggy"". But it's not hard to detect another dig at the prime minister's expense - that she has failed to create a consensus around her Brexit deal. This video can not be played The moment Theresa May challenged the EU's Juncker Yet Theresa May's mission to Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from her 27 fellow leaders confirming - reconfirming, really - that the Irish backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then the EU would use its ""best endeavours"" to negotiate a trade deal, which would mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly. The EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them. But it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute. The problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics. And they certainly wouldn't fit on the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to Mrs May's Brexit deal.

This does not mean that over the course of the next few weeks EU leaders won't find a sprinkle of sugar to sweeten the pill. But there has been no hard evidence today that will emerge. With her leadership under daily attack now, she simply might not have the time to wait.

"It was a tough diplomatic test for Theresa May (3rd R) Led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the other 27 leaders spent almost an hour last night asking Theresa May questions. What reassurances did she seek on the Irish backstop? How did she intend to get the Brexit deal through parliament? What was her vision for the future relationship between the UK and the EU? A diplomatic summary of the meeting seen by the BBC said her answers were ""not really clear"". ""Bad"" and ""pretty bad"" is how it was described by some usually-optimistic diplomats. The lack of precision made the EU wary of offering anything too detailed in the written summit conclusions. More Brexit assurances possible, says May Ireland added wording about the backstop being a Europe-wide issue, not just an Irish one. The backstop is described as an insurance policy to keep the Northern Ireland border open, as it is now. The Northern Ireland border: Now the trickiest Brexit issue to resolve There was no support for Paragraph Five of the draft document, which committed the EU to explore other options to assist the UK. That came as a surprise to the British government, which had secretly helped to draft the summit statement. But European diplomats said that David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership, before the UK's 2016 Brexit vote, played on the leaders' minds - why offer anything that would instantly be ripped apart, or wouldn't work? And why do it now, when a parliamentary vote is still weeks away? Brexit: A really simple guide How could another Brexit referendum work? Brexit summit reaction - as it happened Others fear the focus on tweaking the backstop is preventing the UK from preparing for the negotiations over its new partnership with the EU, storing up bigger problems for the future. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker : ""We were not dancing... she thought that I did criticise her"" In the middle of all of this, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described the situation in the UK as ""nebulous"". The television cameras captured a miffed-looking Theresa May saying to him something that looked like ""You called me nebulous. Yes, me! Nebulous!"" He later clarified that he had meant the picture in the House of Commons was ""foggy"". But it's not hard to detect another dig at the prime minister's expense - that she has failed to create a consensus around her Brexit deal. This video can not be played The moment Theresa May challenged the EU's Juncker Yet Theresa May's mission to Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from her 27 fellow leaders confirming - reconfirming, really - that the Irish backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then the EU would use its ""best endeavours"" to negotiate a trade deal, which would mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly. The EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them. But it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute. The problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics. And they certainly wouldn't fit on the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to Mrs May's Brexit deal.

"It's a bitter cold, grey morning in Brussels. And there is very, very little for Number 10 to be pleased about. If this meeting was meant to provide Theresa May with the beginnings of an escape route from her Brexit conundrum, the signs are nothing less than awful. At one of her most vulnerable political moments, Number 10 was hopeful at least of an indication of a potential solution to the most intense of a long list of Brexit problems - the controversial so-called backstop, designed to guarantee there would be no hard Irish border. EU says no to May on renegotiating deal Brexit: Does Brussels blink? Q&A: The Irish border 'backstop' But right now, that's simply not on offer. EU leaders made it plain that their warnings that their divorce deal with Britain was not up for negotiation were real. Requests for change to ease the politics at Westminster were not fulfilled, with key phrases from a more accommodating draft of the European Council conclusions gone by midnight. This has been a bleak 48 hours for the prime minister. In order to fend off MPs who wanted to oust her, she had to promise thatshe would leave office before the next general electionand she promised that she could get extra legal guarantees from the EU on the backstop issue. But leader after leader arriving at the summit on Friday made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of allowing her to fulfil that second promise. And that's not just because the deal itself has been concluded for a couple of weeks and they don't want to reopen it but because they just don't believe the prime minister's personal reassurances last night that she can get an amended version of the agreement through Parliament. It's not that EU leaders don't want to be friendly but they don't have faith in the government and Theresa May's ability to get Parliament on side. The rejection gives succour perhaps to those in government who want their critics to accept that the prime minister's deal may be, genuinely, as good as it gets. But that's a sliver of hope, in a situation that is looking grim all round. The prime minister will no doubt say that she will keep arguing for more reassurance. It's a message that we are, by now, all extremely familiar with. And yes, it is true, that she has been underestimated many times. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. One official once described the Brexit process as continually building more road ahead of Theresa May, to give her more time and space to navigate the political path. But with the EU's flat ""no"" on Thursday night and Parliament's rejection, they might be all out of new Tarmac. This isSalzburg 2.0, when after months of being told a pick-and-mix approach to the EU was impossible, the prime minister insisted on pushing on, and presenting her Chequers plan to her fellow leaders. But guess what? As they said they would, they said ""no"", leaving her frustrated, embarrassed and without a plan. That's what's happened in the last week - on fast forward. She said she could get more guarantees from the EU. They have said no, leaving the UK, again, without a clear plan. Her many critics will ask - when does determination to achieve what seems impossible become a dangerous delusion? May: I won't lead Tories into election How May lived to fight another day.

"This video can not be played A quiet word in your ear...but what did Theresa May say to EU's Juncker? Theresa May's bid to make her Brexit deal more acceptable to MPs has suffered a blow after EU leaders said it was ""not open for renegotiation"". She wanted legal assurances on the Irish backstop and had warned the deal itself was ""at risk"" over the issue. But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be clarifications but no renegotiation. Labour says MPs must vote on the deal next week and it was ""unacceptable"" for it to be pushed back to January. ""This is becoming a farce,"" said Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer. ""The prime minister pulled this important vote last week on the basis that she was going to get meaningful changes to her Brexit deal, She has obviously not."" On Thursday evening, Mr Juncker urged the UK to set out more clearly what it wants, adding that the European Commission will publish information on 19 December on its preparations, should the UK leave the EU without a deal in place.

Pooled video footage from the summit on Friday showed Mrs May and Mr Juncker engaged in what appeared to be a tense exchange, following his comments. The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said the EU's response was unsurprising and Mrs May must not ""roll over as has happened previously"". ""The EU are doing what they always do,"" said the party's leader Arlene Foster. ""The key question is whether the prime minister will stand up to them."" Allow Twitter content?

But Cabinet minister David Lidington described the meeting as a ""welcome first step"" in showing that the EU was committed ""to negotiate a trade deal with the UK speedily"".

Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK May: I won't lead Conservatives into next election Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? She then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her and was hoping to address their concerns about the controversial ""backstop"" plan in the withdrawal agreement. Critics say the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. Conservative MPs have demanded changes to make it clear that it could not last forever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own.

Indeed, it is the only deal capable of getting through my Parliament,"" she said. Mrs May urged EU leaders to work with her to ""change the perception"" of the controversial backstop plan.

BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its ""best endeavours"" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet. But he said Ireland had requested that the European Council conclusions be toughened up and a paragraph which suggested further work would be done to reassure the UK was removed because ""there was no support"" for it. Downing Street has confirmed MPs will not now vote on Mrs May's deal before Christmas, and said the vote would happen ""as soon as possible in January"". Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told the BBC: ""It is as plain as a pikestaff that this will never get through the House of Commons... the prime minister, I'm afraid, is completely boxed in."" The Labour former PM Tony Blair told the BBC he believed a majority of MPs in the Commons would back another referendum on Brexit, if Parliament could not agree on another way forward: ""I think that will happen if it is clear that there is no majority for any one form of Brexit,"" he told Radio 4's Today.

And this brings an end to our live coverage of the afternoon's press conferences marking the end of the event. Scroll down to catch up on what's happened and what's been said. Thanks for joining us. Adam FlemingBrussels reporter Theresa Mayâs mission to
Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from
her 27 fellow leaders confirming â reconfirming, really â that the Irish
backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then
the EU would use their âbest endeavoursâ to negotiate a trade deal which would

This afternoon has seen press conferences held by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, European Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as other EU leaders. Here's what we learned from their statements, and the reaction that came afterwards: Theresa May  Jean-Claude Juncker  Donald Tusk  German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  DUP leader Arlene Foster EU Commission chief Juncker explained what he meant by his controversial ""nebulous"" remark in relation to Brexit. Theresa May challenged him about it, as seen in a video tweeted earlier. Their tete-a-tete caused a huge media stir. Here is his explanation. This video can not be played Juncker explains 'nebulous' remark The Independent's political sketch writer Tom Peck has a few words to say about that exchange between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker earlier. It took the beak-readers several hours to work out exactly what Theresa May had been saying, when she narrowed her sparrow eyes and stared with terrifying singularity into the damp soul of Jean Claude-Juncker.  And when they did, Google analytics reported a sudden surge in searches for the meaning of the word 'nebulous'.  'You called me nebulous', she had said. And he, roughly 12 hours after he had stood behind a lectern in front of a bank of live television cameras and called her nebulous, replied, âNo I didnât'.  We can only conclude that Mr Juncker, evidently like so many others, doesnât quite know what nebulous means. Because if heâd seen the same Google search results as everybody else, thereâs frankly no way he would have dared deny it.  You can read the rest of his piecehere,external. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has called on Theresa May to ""stand up"" and not ""roll over"" to EU leaders during Brexit talks. She was speaking after Mrs May met with European Union leaders in Brussels. Mrs May wants legal assurances on the Irish backstop to help the deal get through Parliament, after she delayed a Commons vote in anticipation of defeat. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be clarifications but no renegotiation. Read more here. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker was filmed enthusiastically ruffling the hair of a woman at the summit today. BBC colleagues in Brussels managed to identify her as Pernilla SjÃ¶lin, deputy head of protocol at the European Commission. So she is part of Mr Juncker's large team. Here's some more from the Taoiseach, speaking about Theresa May's agreement.  There were suggestions, some of them perhaps made sense, others would be difficult. One is that we would commit to a particular date to have the future relationship treaty, the trade deal.  We can commit to our best endeavours and say we will work towards a target date. It is not possible to say that we will definitely meet that date. The future relationship treaty will be more complicated, it will have to be ratified by 28 member parliaments.  Mr Varadkar said they would begin negotiations on the future as soon as possible once the withdrawal treaty was dealt with. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Irish premier says he's ""very satisfied"" with the summit conclusions on Brexit which made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be renegotiated. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: As Europe we reaffirmed our commitment for the need for a backstop. An open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can't be a backdoor to the single market.  That's why European countries also very strongly support backstop. It is not just an Irish issue, it is very much a European issue as well. It is very much a case of in the European Union being one-for-all and all-for-one.  European Council President Donald Tusk ruled out reopening negotiations on the UK withdrawal deal. ""I have no mandate to organise further negotiations, no mandate to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,"" he told the news conference. But he said: ""Iâm always at Prime Minister Mayâs disposal"" and ""it's my pleasure to be in contact with the prime minister on all relevant issues"". ""Yesterday's conclusions are quite clear I think and we have to treat it as a good sign that we are ready to
reconfirm our assurances and goodwill and good faith when comes to the so-called backstop."" Mr Juncker is asked about THAT chat with Mrs May again. He does a little jig on the stage but then says they ""weren't dancing"". He then went on to say this: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Tusk says the EU has treated Theresa May ""with much greater empathy and respect than some British MPs, for sure"". Mr Juncker adds: ""She's a good friend of ours. We have the highest respect for the British prime minister."" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz - current EU Council president - says that Brexit talks had ""overshadowed"" all other business at the Brussels summit. He says: ""The last few days have been useful to discuss certain questions with Theresa May and create some more clarity. ""There will be a vote in the British Parliament in January and the deal that was negotiated is a good deal for both sides. We hope that this deal will find support in both parliaments eventually.""  Mr Juncker acknowledges there is deep mistrust in the Commons of the EU's position. He wants to make clear how keen they are to get on with trade talks - which in theory could mean backstop not needed. He says he won't respond to those attacks from Westminster, but adds: ""although I would like to do it"". Following their conversation which was videoed this morning, which appeared to be rather heated, Mr Juncker stresses that Mrs May is his ""friend"".  Allow Twitter content?

"Holidaymakers will have to apply for an electronic permit to travel to the EU Britons will have to pay â¬7 (Â£6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, as a consequence of Brexit. The European Commission has confirmed that while UK travellerswill not need a visa,external, they will need to apply for and buy another document. It is called an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) and although not launched yet, is expected to come into force in 2021. The travel requirement is not just for the UK but for many non-EU countries. Citizens of EU countries - which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU. But anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia. Nationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa. However, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list. So it isintroducing the ETIAS,external- an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is ""way cheaper"".

How might Brexit affect my European holiday? Under the Brexit deal,,externalEU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020. After this period ends, the European Commissionhas offered,externalvisa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return. But although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal. The form - which the EU describes as a ""necessary and small procedural step"" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says. The details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions. UK passports - which is the only document currently needed for EU travel - will be blue and the EU reference will disappear after Brexit Most people will find out if their application has been successful within minutes, the EU says, with more than 95% of applications approved automatically. Applications can also be denied or take up to four weeks to process. If successful, the ETIAS will last for three years and allow an unlimited number of entries. The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It is not known what rules will apply to EU tourists coming to the UK, butaccording to the EU and UK's political declaration,,externalboth sides will aim to provide ""visa-free travel for short-term visits"". TheEuropean Commission previously said,externalthe EU's offer of visa-free travel to the UK was ""entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states"". The proposal - which will come into force on 29 March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit - must be adopted by the EU Parliament and European Council before it can come into force. The UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives - allowing people to stay for a maximum of six months. But they are not allowed to work, study or settle. The news could also lead to a renewed surge in applications for Irish passports by British citizens.

"Holidaymakers will have to apply for an electronic permit to travel to the EU Britons will have to pay â¬7 (Â£6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, as a consequence of Brexit. The European Commission has confirmed that while UK travellerswill not need a visa,external, they will need to apply for and buy another document. It is called an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) and although not launched yet, is expected to come into force in 2021. The travel requirement is not just for the UK but for many non-EU countries. Citizens of EU countries - which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU. But anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia. Nationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa. However, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list. So it isintroducing the ETIAS,external- an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is ""way cheaper"".

How might Brexit affect my European holiday? Under the Brexit deal,,externalEU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020. After this period ends, the European Commissionhas offered,externalvisa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return. But although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal. The form - which the EU describes as a ""necessary and small procedural step"" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says. The details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions. UK passports - which is the only document currently needed for EU travel - will be blue and the EU reference will disappear after Brexit Most people will find out if their application has been successful within minutes, the EU says, with more than 95% of applications approved automatically. Applications can also be denied or take up to four weeks to process. If successful, the ETIAS will last for three years and allow an unlimited number of entries. The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It is not known what rules will apply to EU tourists coming to the UK, butaccording to the EU and UK's political declaration,,externalboth sides will aim to provide ""visa-free travel for short-term visits"". TheEuropean Commission previously said,externalthe EU's offer of visa-free travel to the UK was ""entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states"". The proposal - which will come into force on 29 March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit - must be adopted by the EU Parliament and European Council before it can come into force. The UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives - allowing people to stay for a maximum of six months. But they are not allowed to work, study or settle. The news could also lead to a renewed surge in applications for Irish passports by British citizens.

"Baby Benedicte's mother, who had Ebola, died during childbirth A baby girl who was diagnosed with Ebola when she was only six days old has survived, health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have confirmed. Baby Benedicte's mother was infected with Ebola and died during childbirth. Benedicte showed symptoms only days later and it has taken five weeks of round-the-clock treatment to keep her alive. Her dad and aunt took her home on Wednesday. ""Her father, Thomas, was very emotionalâ¦ she is his first baby,"" a health ministry spokeswoman told the BBC. Ebola is a deadly infection that causes severe fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and internal and external bleeding. About half of those infected die, butbabies are even less likely to survive. During this outbreak, there have been 27 cases of Ebola in children yet to reach their first birthday and 21 have died. Tales of survival, like Benedicte's, are rare. She was born on 31 October 2018 and was cared for at the Ebola Treatment Center in Beni, the city hardest hit by the outbreak in DR Congo. She is the youngest patient for whom doctors and volunteers there have cared. The little girl has become known as the ""miracle of Beni"". This video can not be played The current outbreak is the deadliest since Ebola was discovered in 1976 It is a viral illness that kills around 50% of the people it infects Initial symptoms include sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - internal and external bleeding Ebola infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope People are infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus, which can be for up to seven weeks after they recover Ebola basics: What you need to know The Ebola outbreak in the country is now the second largest in history. The latest figures,externalshow there have been 515 cases and 303 deaths. Since October,there have been around 33 people diagnosed every week,externaland children and women have been disproportionately affected. The World Health Organization says the situation in the country is ""concerning"" and there remains a ""very high risk"" of the outbreak spreading further. Ebola virus infects humans through close contact with infected animals It has been able to use new tools that have not been available in previous outbreaks. Nearly 45,000 people have been given an Ebola vaccine and for the first time multiple experimental Ebola drugs are being trialled in the midst of an outbreak. But efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by conflict in the region with more than one million people displaced from their homes and refugees moving to neighbouring countries. Armed groups have made it challenging for healthcare workers to do the basics of managing an outbreak, including tracing people who may have come into contact with infected individuals. And health officials are also trying to deal with three separate outbreaks of polio, as well as outbreaks of cholera and malaria. Surrounding countries are preparing for cases spilling over the border. Uganda has already begun vaccinating health care workers and South Sudan is set to start.

"The EU's two-day summit in Brussels has concluded If we're leaving with a Brexit deal this is it, Theresa May tells media However, PM says there is still ""work to do"" to reassure MPs that the deal agreed with the EU ""is possible"" EC president Donald Tusk has ""no mandate to organise any further negotiations"" but is ""always at Theresa Mayâs disposal"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel says EU sees backstop as an ""insurance policy"" only; ""no renegotiation"" of Brexit agreement European Council President Jean-Claude Juncker says EU is keen to get on with trade talks - which in theory could mean backstop not needed French President Emmanuel Macron stresses that ""there is one deal, the only one possible"" on Brexit Chris Lansdown, Lauren Turner and Laurence Peter The two-day EU summit is over, bringing to a close a busy week for UK Prime Minister Theresa May. And this brings an end to our live coverage of the afternoon's press conferences marking the end of the event. Scroll down to catch up on what's happened and what's been said. Thanks for joining us. Adam FlemingBrussels reporter Theresa Mayâs mission to
Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from
her 27 fellow leaders confirming â reconfirming, really â that the Irish
backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then
the EU would use their âbest endeavoursâ to negotiate a trade deal which would
mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say
British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the
independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt
Brussels was moving too slowly. The EU dropped a commitment to look
for further ways to help the UK, which means there wonât be a formal process to
find them. But it doesnât mean the search
couldnât happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute. The problem is that these
commitments are unlikely to impress Mrs Mayâs harshest critics. And they certainly wouldnât fit on
the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to her Brexit deal. This afternoon has seen press conferences held by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, European Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as other EU leaders. Here's what we learned from their statements, and the reaction that came afterwards: Theresa May  Jean-Claude Juncker  Donald Tusk  German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  DUP leader Arlene Foster EU Commission chief Juncker explained what he meant by his controversial ""nebulous"" remark in relation to Brexit. Theresa May challenged him about it, as seen in a video tweeted earlier. Their tete-a-tete caused a huge media stir. Here is his explanation. This video can not be played Juncker explains 'nebulous' remark The Independent's political sketch writer Tom Peck has a few words to say about that exchange between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker earlier. It took the beak-readers several hours to work out exactly what Theresa May had been saying, when she narrowed her sparrow eyes and stared with terrifying singularity into the damp soul of Jean Claude-Juncker.  And when they did, Google analytics reported a sudden surge in searches for the meaning of the word 'nebulous'.  'You called me nebulous', she had said. And he, roughly 12 hours after he had stood behind a lectern in front of a bank of live television cameras and called her nebulous, replied, âNo I didnât'.  We can only conclude that Mr Juncker, evidently like so many others, doesnât quite know what nebulous means. Because if heâd seen the same Google search results as everybody else, thereâs frankly no way he would have dared deny it.  You can read the rest of his piecehere,external. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has called on Theresa May to ""stand up"" and not ""roll over"" to EU leaders during Brexit talks. She was speaking after Mrs May met with European Union leaders in Brussels. Mrs May wants legal assurances on the Irish backstop to help the deal get through Parliament, after she delayed a Commons vote in anticipation of defeat. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be clarifications but no renegotiation. Read more here. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker was filmed enthusiastically ruffling the hair of a woman at the summit today. BBC colleagues in Brussels managed to identify her as Pernilla SjÃ¶lin, deputy head of protocol at the European Commission. So she is part of Mr Juncker's large team. Here's some more from the Taoiseach, speaking about Theresa May's agreement.  There were suggestions, some of them perhaps made sense, others would be difficult. One is that we would commit to a particular date to have the future relationship treaty, the trade deal.  We can commit to our best endeavours and say we will work towards a target date. It is not possible to say that we will definitely meet that date. The future relationship treaty will be more complicated, it will have to be ratified by 28 member parliaments.  Mr Varadkar said they would begin negotiations on the future as soon as possible once the withdrawal treaty was dealt with. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Irish premier says he's ""very satisfied"" with the summit conclusions on Brexit which made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be renegotiated. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: As Europe we reaffirmed our commitment for the need for a backstop. An open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can't be a backdoor to the single market.  That's why European countries also very strongly support backstop. It is not just an Irish issue, it is very much a European issue as well. It is very much a case of in the European Union being one-for-all and all-for-one.  European Council President Donald Tusk ruled out reopening negotiations on the UK withdrawal deal. ""I have no mandate to organise further negotiations, no mandate to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,"" he told the news conference. But he said: ""Iâm always at Prime Minister Mayâs disposal"" and ""it's my pleasure to be in contact with the prime minister on all relevant issues"". ""Yesterday's conclusions are quite clear I think and we have to treat it as a good sign that we are ready to
reconfirm our assurances and goodwill and good faith when comes to the so-called backstop."" Mr Juncker is asked about THAT chat with Mrs May again. He does a little jig on the stage but then says they ""weren't dancing"". He then went on to say this: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Tusk says the EU has treated Theresa May ""with much greater empathy and respect than some British MPs, for sure"". Mr Juncker adds: ""She's a good friend of ours. We have the highest respect for the British prime minister."" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz - current EU Council president - says that Brexit talks had ""overshadowed"" all other business at the Brussels summit. He says: ""The last few days have been useful to discuss certain questions with Theresa May and create some more clarity. ""There will be a vote in the British Parliament in January and the deal that was negotiated is a good deal for both sides. We hope that this deal will find support in both parliaments eventually.""  Mr Juncker acknowledges there is deep mistrust in the Commons of the EU's position. He wants to make clear how keen they are to get on with trade talks - which in theory could mean backstop not needed. He says he won't respond to those attacks from Westminster, but adds: ""although I would like to do it"". Following their conversation which was videoed this morning, which appeared to be rather heated, Mr Juncker stresses that Mrs May is his ""friend"".  Allow Twitter content?

"An independent review of breast screening in England has found that confusion and misunderstanding were behind an announcement in May that hundreds of thousands of women had missed out on final scans. Jeremy Hunt, then health secretary, said that450,000 women aged 68-71 were affected because of a computer error. But there was ""no incident"", the report said - just ""unacceptable"" confusion. Charities criticised the distress and anxiety caused to many women. The review,externalsaid the confusion stemmed from a document written in 2013 which said women should be invited for screening ""within 36 months of their previous screening, until they reach the age of 71"" . But this document was based on a misunderstanding of how the programme was being delivered in practice by local screening units, who understood the upper age limit for screening to be 70. The review said ministers and public health officials did not realise the document was not consistent with past policy. As a result, ""women were wrongly told they had missed a screening invitation"", the report authors said. ""In short, there was no incident and ministers were incorrectly advised,"" it adds. But Breast Cancer Now called it a ""system failure"" and said clarity on the age limits for breast screening was urgently needed. The review was co-chaired by Lynda Thomas, from Macmillan, and Prof Martin Gore, from Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, with Peter Wyman, from the Care Quality Commission. They concluded that no one person or body was to blame for the confusion, but said Public Health England was too slow to work out what was going on and how to respond in May. ""This led to a public announcement which not only overstated the scale of the incident and the possible implications, but inaccurately reported its cause,"" the report said. Breast screening 'more harmful than good' Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? The report said the breast screening programme now needed ""a re-set"" and the Department of Health, Public Health England and NHS England should agree on a clear and specific definition of the ages when women would be invited for screening. The report says NHS England has now invited up to 67,000 women for a catch-up final screening. Report author Lynda Thomas said the incident had caused anxiety to thousands of women. ""It is completely unacceptable that there was confusion about what the breast screening programme should have been delivering. There needs to be clarity and importantly women need clear information about what they should be able to expect."" Prof Gore said the NHS breast screening programme was one of the best in the world but its systems and processes needed to be updated. ""It is essential that Public Health England as a matter of urgency works with the women they contacted and have been diagnosed with breast cancer, their families and their healthcare professionals to find out whether they were harmed by any errors in the breast screening programme and are given the support they need."" Lady Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: ""After months of uncertainty, it is totally unacceptable - and extremely concerning - to learn that hundreds of thousands of women have been unnecessarily caused such significant distress. ""This has been nothing short of a system failure, precipitated by a lack of clear ownership and strong leadership of a world-leading programme. ""It highlights a continued inability, amid structural confusion, to monitor what is happening in the screening service.""

"J Hus has been sentenced to eight months in jail after admitting carrying a knife in a public place. The 23-year-old rapper was caught with the blade after police stopped a car near the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, on 21 June. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard J Hus - real name Momodou Jallow - ""fully accepted his actions were careless"". Judge Sandy Canavan said she would be failing in her duty if she did not jail him. She told the rapper he was a ""role model to many"" but ""failed"" to leave his past behind him. She added: ""This, in such a young life, is the fourth occasion when you have gone out armed with a knife."" The court heard J Hus, of Baldwin Drive, Peterborough, was in his car with his girlfriend - who was driving - when they were stopped by police officers after they smelt cannabis. J Hus was arrested near to Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford They spoke to the rapper and asked whether he had anything he shouldn't - which is when he revealed he had a 10cm folding knife. He was arrested and when officers asked why he was carrying the weapon, he replied: ""You know, it's Westfield."" The court heard he said he had been shopping at Westfield and indicated his ""face was known"". Henry Blaxland, defending, read out a letter to Judge Canavan on behalf of the rapper. J Hus said he was sorry and he ""fully accepted his actions were careless"". He told the court his decision to carry a knife was ""ill advised"" and ""utterly stupid"", adding: ""I was not in the right state of mind."" ""I'm deeply sorry and regret my foolish actions."" One of the rapper's last performances before his arrest was at Parklife in Manchester on 10 June Mr Blaxland said the defendant's arrest has proved to be a ""watershed moment"". He told the judge it had ""huge consequences"" to his performance schedule and the rapper knows ""he has a responsibility"" to others. He said the defendant had been seeing a therapist and has mild PTSD from previously being stabbed himself. Mr Blaxland told the court J Hus had found himself relatively isolated because of his fame. He said he may have been drawn back to Newham, in east London - which is where he grew up - ""like a moth to a flame"". By Steve Holden, Newsbeat entertainment reporter at Snaresbrook Crown Court ""As the judge gave her closing statement, J Hus sat with his head down and arms crossed in the dock. ""Wearing a black T-shirt and dark jeans, she asked him to stand up as she passed the sentence. ""He showed no emotion and said nothing after hearing it. ""His friends and family in the public gallery also remained silent as he picked up his coat and left the dock to begin his jail term.""

"An independent review of breast screening in England has found that confusion and misunderstanding were behind an announcement in May that hundreds of thousands of women had missed out on final scans. Jeremy Hunt, then health secretary, said that450,000 women aged 68-71 were affected because of a computer error. But there was ""no incident"", the report said - just ""unacceptable"" confusion. Charities criticised the distress and anxiety caused to many women. The review,externalsaid the confusion stemmed from a document written in 2013 which said women should be invited for screening ""within 36 months of their previous screening, until they reach the age of 71"" . But this document was based on a misunderstanding of how the programme was being delivered in practice by local screening units, who understood the upper age limit for screening to be 70. The review said ministers and public health officials did not realise the document was not consistent with past policy. As a result, ""women were wrongly told they had missed a screening invitation"", the report authors said. ""In short, there was no incident and ministers were incorrectly advised,"" it adds. But Breast Cancer Now called it a ""system failure"" and said clarity on the age limits for breast screening was urgently needed. The review was co-chaired by Lynda Thomas, from Macmillan, and Prof Martin Gore, from Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, with Peter Wyman, from the Care Quality Commission. They concluded that no one person or body was to blame for the confusion, but said Public Health England was too slow to work out what was going on and how to respond in May. ""This led to a public announcement which not only overstated the scale of the incident and the possible implications, but inaccurately reported its cause,"" the report said. Breast screening 'more harmful than good' Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? The report said the breast screening programme now needed ""a re-set"" and the Department of Health, Public Health England and NHS England should agree on a clear and specific definition of the ages when women would be invited for screening. The report says NHS England has now invited up to 67,000 women for a catch-up final screening. Report author Lynda Thomas said the incident had caused anxiety to thousands of women. ""It is completely unacceptable that there was confusion about what the breast screening programme should have been delivering. There needs to be clarity and importantly women need clear information about what they should be able to expect."" Prof Gore said the NHS breast screening programme was one of the best in the world but its systems and processes needed to be updated. ""It is essential that Public Health England as a matter of urgency works with the women they contacted and have been diagnosed with breast cancer, their families and their healthcare professionals to find out whether they were harmed by any errors in the breast screening programme and are given the support they need."" Lady Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: ""After months of uncertainty, it is totally unacceptable - and extremely concerning - to learn that hundreds of thousands of women have been unnecessarily caused such significant distress. ""This has been nothing short of a system failure, precipitated by a lack of clear ownership and strong leadership of a world-leading programme. ""It highlights a continued inability, amid structural confusion, to monitor what is happening in the screening service.""

"Roy Wood wrote ""I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday"", which he performed with his band Wizzard A van belonging to former Wizzard singer Roy Wood's band has been returned, along with an estimated Â£100,000-worth of equipment inside. The Roy Wood Rock 'n' Roll Band had their instruments taken when the vehicle was stolen in a ram-raid on a warehouse in Leeds on Thursday. Wood - who wrote ""I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday"" - had to cancel that night's ""Rockmas"" gig in Hull. West Yorkshire Police said the van and equipment were found in East Ardsley. Wood said the van had contained ""about Â£100,000 of gear, with PA equipment, three or four guitars, and Marshall amps"". He said the band had cancelled a show at Hull City Hall and hoped to reschedule. Latest news from across Yorkshire Roy Wood performing on Top of the Pops in the 1970s Birmingham-born musician Wood, who now lives in Derbyshire, is currently on tour with his Rock 'n' Roll Band.

"This video can not be played A quiet word in your ear...but what did Theresa May say to EU's Juncker? Theresa May's bid to make her Brexit deal more acceptable to MPs has suffered a blow after EU leaders said it was ""not open for renegotiation"". She wanted legal assurances on the Irish backstop and had warned the deal itself was ""at risk"" over the issue. But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be clarifications but no renegotiation. Labour says MPs must vote on the deal next week and it was ""unacceptable"" for it to be pushed back to January. ""This is becoming a farce,"" said Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer. ""The prime minister pulled this important vote last week on the basis that she was going to get meaningful changes to her Brexit deal, She has obviously not."" On Thursday evening, Mr Juncker urged the UK to set out more clearly what it wants, adding that the European Commission will publish information on 19 December on its preparations, should the UK leave the EU without a deal in place. Live: EU summit reaction Brexit: Does Brussels blink? UK travellers to pay â¬7 to visit EU after Brexit Stand up to EU, Foster urges May New Brexit poll logical outcome - Blair ""Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want, and so we would like within a few weeks our UK friends to set out their expectations for us, because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications,"" he said. Pooled video footage from the summit on Friday showed Mrs May and Mr Juncker engaged in what appeared to be a tense exchange, following his comments. The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said the EU's response was unsurprising and Mrs May must not ""roll over as has happened previously"". ""The EU are doing what they always do,"" said the party's leader Arlene Foster. ""The key question is whether the prime minister will stand up to them."" Allow Twitter content?

But Cabinet minister David Lidington described the meeting as a ""welcome first step"" in showing that the EU was committed ""to negotiate a trade deal with the UK speedily"". Mrs May travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders after delaying Tuesday's Commons vote on the deal, in anticipation of a heavy defeat. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK May: I won't lead Conservatives into next election Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? She then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her and was hoping to address their concerns about the controversial ""backstop"" plan in the withdrawal agreement. Critics say the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. Conservative MPs have demanded changes to make it clear that it could not last forever, and the UK could terminate the arrangement on its own. If this meeting was meant to provide Theresa May with the beginnings of an escape route from her Brexit conundrum, the signs are nothing less than awful. At one of her most vulnerable political moments, Number 10 was hopeful at least of an indication of a potential solution to the most intense of a long list of Brexit problems - the controversial so-called backstop, designed to guarantee there would be no hard Irish border. But right now, that's simply not on offer. EU leaders made it plain that their warnings - that their divorce deal with Britain was not up for negotiation - were real. Read more from Laura In comments released by Downing Street on Thursday, Mrs May urged EU leaders to help her ""get this deal over the line"" and said she firmly believed it could get through the Commons, saying: ""There is a majority in my Parliament who want to leave with a deal so with the right assurances this deal can be passed. Indeed, it is the only deal capable of getting through my Parliament,"" she said. Mrs May urged EU leaders to work with her to ""change the perception"" of the controversial backstop plan. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: A really simple guide But European Council president Donald Tusk said the withdrawal agreement was ""not open for renegotiation"" although he stressed the backstop was ""an insurance policy"", saying it was the EU's ""firm determination"" to work ""speedily"" on alternative arrangements. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its ""best endeavours"" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet. But he said Ireland had requested that the European Council conclusions be toughened up and a paragraph which suggested further work would be done to reassure the UK was removed because ""there was no support"" for it. Downing Street has confirmed MPs will not now vote on Mrs May's deal before Christmas, and said the vote would happen ""as soon as possible in January"". Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told the BBC: ""It is as plain as a pikestaff that this will never get through the House of Commons... the prime minister, I'm afraid, is completely boxed in."" The Labour former PM Tony Blair told the BBC he believed a majority of MPs in the Commons would back another referendum on Brexit, if Parliament could not agree on another way forward: ""I think that will happen if it is clear that there is no majority for any one form of Brexit,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""We have had 30 months of negotiation and let's be clear - we are in crisis mode on this.""

Speaking after he was sentenced to prison for campaign finance and fraud crimes, Michael Cohen told ABC News: ""He directed me to make the payments."" ""Nothing at the Trump organisation was ever done unless it was run through Mr Trump,"" he said. The president has denied ever asking Cohen to make illegal payments. ""He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday, suggesting Cohen had pleaded guilty ""to embarrass the president"". Allow Twitter content?

Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? Cohen, 52, was sentenced to three years on Wednesday and must report to prison by 6 March. He admitted to lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In addition to the jail term, he was also ordered to forfeit nearly $2m (Â£1.6m). He is the first of Mr Trump's inner circle to be jailed following Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He was asked in the ABC News interview about money paid to two women,externalto keep quiet about alleged affairs with the then-presidential candidate. Mr Trump ""was very concerned about how this would affect the election"", Cohen said. The purpose of the payments had been to ""help [Trump] and his campaign"", he added. Allow Twitter content?

""People of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying,"" Cohen continued. ""The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds."" The sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and the Mueller investigation. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments regarding the two women, porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. He confessed to making a $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels and arranging for a $150,000 payment to Ms McDougal. Prosecutors argued successfully that these payments amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Under US law, an individual donation cannot exceed $2,700. The payment to Ms McDougal was made by American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, to suppress her allegations of an affair with Mr Trump. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced it had reached a deal with AMI to avoid prosecution if the company admitted it made the $150,000 payment ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign"" and to ""ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations"" ahead of the 2016 election. AMI has agreed to continue co-operating with investigators. Mr Trump has acknowledged both payments were made despite denying having actual affairs, and has called them a private transaction unrelated to his election campaign. Cohen's other convictions, for tax evasion and bank fraud, are unrelated to the president. Cohen also admitted to making false statements to Congress about a property deal Mr Trump was looking into in Moscow in the run-up to the 2016 election.

"Viktorija Sokolova was reported missing the day before her body was discovered on a park bench A boy who lured a 14-year-old girl to a park and inflicted ""incomprehensible"" violence upon her has been found guilty of murder and rape. Viktorija Sokolova's head was ""smashed in"" with a hammer-like object in a ""sustained and ferocious"" attack. Her lifeless, partially clothed body was found dumped on a bench in Wolverhampton's West Park the next day. The 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, denied murder but was convicted after a three-week trial. Jurors at Wolverhampton Crown Court unanimously found the defendant guilty of murder and rape, but were directed to clear him of a further charge of sexual penetration of a corpse. Lithuanian-born Viktorija went to the park late at night on 11 April after her killer contacted her via Facebook Messenger, the court heard. Once there, the pair met at a pavilion referred to as the ""black house"", where Viktorija was struck over the head at least 21 times, causing multiple fractures to her skull and spine. The boy raped her and dragged her 150m across the park, where he left her draped over a bench. Police said the assault was so violent they found three of the schoolgirl's teeth and an earring, ripped from her ear, in the blood-spattered pavilion. Parents deny hand in girl's park death Park murder accused boy opts out of testifying Park death teen 'had head smashed in' A dog walker found Viktorija's body the next morning, initially mistaking it for a blow-up doll left in the park as a ""prank"". The court heard her killer had claimed the pair had consensual sex and she was ""alive and well"" when he left to go home. But he was caught on CCTV as he attempted to cover up what he had done by hiding clothing and hurling his victim's phone towards a lake. Viktorija's body was found by a dog walker in West Park in Wolverhampton in April The ""forensically aware"" murderer hid the mobile phone he used to contact Viktorija behind a wardrobe, police said. In the hours after the killing, he used his brother's phone to search ""how to delete your Facebook account permanently"" and also filmed himself scrolling through the Notes app on his iPhone as he prepared to delete evidence. The recording was of such high quality, detectives were able to use the clip to match a fingerprint left on the screen to the defendant's. Despite the mobile phone evidence, the boy's barristers had suggested Viktorija's parents may have played a part in her death, after it emerged microscopic traces of her stepfather's semen were found in her underwear. But the pair were eliminated from police inquiries at an early stage, and forensic experts suggested the transfer of her stepfather's DNA was via innocent means. This video can not be played CCTV shows Viktorija Sokolova's last hours alive Justice Jeremy Baker warned the teenager, who will be sentenced on 22 February, there was ""only one sentence"" he could impose. The judge said he was ""obviously concerned as to the extreme nature of the offences in this case"" and has ordered a pre-sentence psychiatric report. This video can not be played Viktorija's mother said there were ""no other kids like her"" During his defence Viktorija's killer declined to take the witness stand - claiming to be suffering from learning difficulties. But his barristers accused her mother, Karolina Valantiniene, and stepfather, Saidas Valantinas, of murdering the teenager. Mr Valantinas said he had no idea why his DNA was on her clothing and said the defence's argument was ""unreasonable"", ""unsubstantiated"", and ""rude"". The court also heard about his ""turbulent"" relationship with Viktorija, who was sent to live with her father in Northern Ireland for two months because she repeatedly ran away. Jurors were told there was also a physical altercation between Viktorija and her mother the Sunday before her murder. During the trial, Ms Valantiniene said, the murderer never looked at her, ""maybe because of him feeling ashamed"". ""This is beyond comprehension that something like that has happened to us,"" she said. ""I keep asking God why and for what this happened to us."" Det Insp Caroline Corfield said there was ""nothing"" in the defendant's background to suggest he would ""commit a seriously violent act, let alone the inexplicable levels of violence involved in Viktorija's murder"". The pair had been friends, she said, emphasising her killer was not a ""faceless person"" she met online.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it' Theresa May has said it is still possible to get the assurances MPs need to back her Brexit deal, despite EU leaders ruling out any renegotiation. At a summit in Brussels, the UK PM said there was ""work to do"" but talks on ""further clarification"" would continue. She admitted a ""robust"" discussion with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, after he complained about ""nebulous and imprecise debate"". Labour said the withdrawal deal was now ""dead in the water"". The UK prime minister travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders after delaying Tuesday's Commons vote on the deal, in anticipation of a heavy defeat. She then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her. Kuenssberg: An issue of trust Theresa May's week in charts May at the EU summit, as it happened How could another Brexit referendum work? Many of them are concerned that the controversial ""backstop"" plan in the withdrawal agreement Mrs May has negotiated, which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland, would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. Nigel Farage told a Leave Means Leave rally on Friday it was time for Brexit supporters to prepare for another referendum Brexit supporters wait for the speeches at the Leave Means Leave rally in London Elsewhere on Friday, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told a Leave Means Leave rally in London it was time for Brexit supporters to prepare for the possibility of another referendum. Mr Farage added the treatment of Mrs May in Brussels this week had been a ""shaming moment"" for both the UK and the EU and that the PM's Brexit deal was now ""dead"". Labour MP Kate Hoey and Wetherspoons chairman Tim Martin were among the other speakers at the rally. This video can not be played A quiet word in your ear...but what did Theresa May say to EU's Juncker? After Mrs May addressed EU leaders at the summit on Thursday evening, Mr Juncker urged further clarity from the UK. He said: ""Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want... because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise."" Video footage of the two on Friday morning captured a tense exchange, apparently about his remarks, although the exact words were not audible. Asked about what she had said to him, Mrs May told reporters: ""I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker - I think that's the sort of discussion you're able to have when you have developed a working relationship and you work well together. ""And what came out of that was his clarity that actually he'd been talking - when he used that particular phrase - he'd been talking about a general level of debate."" This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker: ""We were not dancing...she thought that I did criticise her"" At a later press conference, Mr Juncker described Mrs May as a ""good friend"" who he admired as a ""woman of courage"". He said he hadn't realised nebulous was a word in English and he had been referring, not to her, but to the ""overall state of the debate in Britain"". He said: ""I can't see where the British parliament is heading. That's why I was saying that it was nebulous - foggy in English - I was not addressing her."" He also said: ""We have to bring down the temperature"" of the debate amid ""attacks coming from Westminster against Europe and the European Commission"". Various EU leaders, including European Council President Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker and Irish PM Leo Varadkar, reiterated on Thursday that there could be no renegotiation of the withdrawal deal. And a paragraph which had appeared in the draft conclusions at the start of the summit, saying that the EU ""stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided"" did not appear in the final conclusions. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? But Mrs May said that, despite reports that the EU was unwilling to consider further clarification, she had talked to Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker and others that morning which ""have shown that further clarification and discussion following the council's conclusions is in fact possible"". She also welcomed commitments by other EU leaders to try to get a new trade deal in place ""speedily"" so that the backstop would not be needed and said that, as formal conclusions from the summit, they had ""legal status"". But she added: ""There is work to be done. It is clear we can look at this issue of further clarification. We will be working expeditiously over the coming days to seek those further assurances I believe MPs will need."" BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its ""best endeavours"" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May's Brexit deal is dead in the water. The prime minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal. ""Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the prime minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control."" And Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told the BBC: ""It is as plain as a pikestaff that this will never get through the House of Commons... the prime minister, I'm afraid, is completely boxed in."" The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said she must deliver ""legally binding changes"" to the withdrawal agreement if she wants her deal to get through Parliament. Its leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister ""has made commitments"" to the DUP and ""knows what she has to deliver on"". Meanwhile, the UK and Switzerland have provisionally agreed to keep their current trading rules after Brexit, the first of 40 existing EU trade deals with other countries the UK hopes to adopt. The agreement, which will replicate the EU's current arrangement with Switzerland as closely as possible, is due to come into place at the end of 2020 when the Brexit transition phase ends. But it could come into force at the end of March if the UK leaves with no deal. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming Theresa May's mission to Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from her 27 fellow leaders confirming - reconfirming, really - that the Irish backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then the EU would use its ""best endeavours"" to negotiate a trade deal, which would mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly. The EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them. But it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute. The problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics. And they certainly wouldn't fit on the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to Mrs May's Brexit deal. Read Adam's full analysis How could another Brexit referendum work?

"This video can not be played Cohen walked free from court - but will have to report to jail in March US President Donald Trump's former lawyer insists Mr Trump knew making hush money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign was wrong. Speaking after he was sentenced to prison for campaign finance and fraud crimes, Michael Cohen told ABC News: ""He directed me to make the payments."" ""Nothing at the Trump organisation was ever done unless it was run through Mr Trump,"" he said. The president has denied ever asking Cohen to make illegal payments. ""He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday, suggesting Cohen had pleaded guilty ""to embarrass the president"". Allow Twitter content?

Cohen, 52, was sentenced to three years on Wednesday and must report to prison by 6 March. He admitted to lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In addition to the jail term, he was also ordered to forfeit nearly $2m (Â£1.6m). He is the first of Mr Trump's inner circle to be jailed following Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He was asked in the ABC News interview about money paid to two women,externalto keep quiet about alleged affairs with the then-presidential candidate.

""People of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying,"" Cohen continued. ""The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds."" The sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and the Mueller investigation. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments regarding the two women, porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. He confessed to making a $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels and arranging for a $150,000 payment to Ms McDougal. Prosecutors argued successfully that these payments amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Under US law, an individual donation cannot exceed $2,700. The payment to Ms McDougal was made by American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, to suppress her allegations of an affair with Mr Trump. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced it had reached a deal with AMI to avoid prosecution if the company admitted it made the $150,000 payment ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign"" and to ""ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations"" ahead of the 2016 election. AMI has agreed to continue co-operating with investigators. Mr Trump has acknowledged both payments were made despite denying having actual affairs, and has called them a private transaction unrelated to his election campaign. Cohen's other convictions, for tax evasion and bank fraud, are unrelated to the president. Cohen also admitted to making false statements to Congress about a property deal Mr Trump was looking into in Moscow in the run-up to the 2016 election.

"This video can not be played Demolition teams dismantle the bridge's toll booth The M4 into south Wales is facing nightly closures as work to dismantle the toll booths on the Prince of Wales bridge takes place to prepare for the Severn toll removal. The bridge was scheduled to be closed westbound overnight on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The toll has been in place since the first crossing opened in 1966, but will be removed on Monday. Collector Deborah Hitchins said: ""I'll miss welcoming the world to Wales."" She is being made redundant - one of 100 toll collectors affected - as the charge, currently Â£5.60 for cars, is being scrapped after the bridges returned to public ownership last year. How the Severn Bridge Was Built Bridging the divide Test your Severn Bridge knowledge ""Work isn't just a job...

""The tolling staff are a close-knit bunch of people. I will miss pulling on my hi-viz to play Frogger to cross the lanes to get into my allocated booth."" Fellow collector Darren Moore has had drivers jokingly asked him for fast food during his 12 years collecting tolls and has also been flashed by kilt-wearing Scottish rugby fans heading to Wales. ""I'm sad I'm losing my job but I understand that the Â£5.60 toll has been expensive for commuters,"" said Mr Moore.

The closure of the Prince of Wales Bridge westbound between Monmouthshire and South Gloucestershire was scheduled for 20:00 GMT on Friday and Saturday until 06:00 the following day. Motorists will be diverted around the original M48 Severn Bridge. The M4 bridge will then close at 19:00 on Sunday and reopen toll free before Monday's rush hour - at a time yet to be confirmed - but with a 50mph speed restriction on temporary narrow lanes. Traffic will be able to free flow through the current toll plaza area when the booths are removed Shortly after the M4 bridge reopens on Monday, the M48 original Severn crossing will shut westbound until Wednesday for the tolls to be dismantled. Further work will be carried out in 2019 to return both routes to a three-lane motorway with the usual 70mph speed limit. About 25 million journeys a year are made across the two bridges and it is estimated the abolition of the tolls will give a Â£100m boost to the Welsh economy and a Â£1,400 annual boost to commuters.

And this brings an end to our live coverage of the afternoon's press conferences marking the end of the event. Scroll down to catch up on what's happened and what's been said. Thanks for joining us. Adam FlemingBrussels reporter Theresa Mayâs mission to
Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from
her 27 fellow leaders confirming â reconfirming, really â that the Irish
backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then
the EU would use their âbest endeavoursâ to negotiate a trade deal which would

commitments are unlikely to impress Mrs Mayâs harshest critics. And they certainly wouldnât fit on
the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to her Brexit deal. This afternoon has seen press conferences held by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, European Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, as well as other EU leaders. Here's what we learned from their statements, and the reaction that came afterwards: Theresa May  Jean-Claude Juncker  Donald Tusk  German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn  DUP leader Arlene Foster EU Commission chief Juncker explained what he meant by his controversial ""nebulous"" remark in relation to Brexit. Theresa May challenged him about it, as seen in a video tweeted earlier. Their tete-a-tete caused a huge media stir. Here is his explanation. This video can not be played Juncker explains 'nebulous' remark The Independent's political sketch writer Tom Peck has a few words to say about that exchange between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker earlier. It took the beak-readers several hours to work out exactly what Theresa May had been saying, when she narrowed her sparrow eyes and stared with terrifying singularity into the damp soul of Jean Claude-Juncker.  And when they did, Google analytics reported a sudden surge in searches for the meaning of the word 'nebulous'.  'You called me nebulous', she had said. And he, roughly 12 hours after he had stood behind a lectern in front of a bank of live television cameras and called her nebulous, replied, âNo I didnât'.  We can only conclude that Mr Juncker, evidently like so many others, doesnât quite know what nebulous means. Because if heâd seen the same Google search results as everybody else, thereâs frankly no way he would have dared deny it.  You can read the rest of his piecehere,external. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has called on Theresa May to ""stand up"" and not ""roll over"" to EU leaders during Brexit talks. She was speaking after Mrs May met with European Union leaders in Brussels. Mrs May wants legal assurances on the Irish backstop to help the deal get through Parliament, after she delayed a Commons vote in anticipation of defeat. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said there could be clarifications but no renegotiation. Read more here. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker was filmed enthusiastically ruffling the hair of a woman at the summit today. BBC colleagues in Brussels managed to identify her as Pernilla SjÃ¶lin, deputy head of protocol at the European Commission. So she is part of Mr Juncker's large team. Here's some more from the Taoiseach, speaking about Theresa May's agreement.  There were suggestions, some of them perhaps made sense, others would be difficult. One is that we would commit to a particular date to have the future relationship treaty, the trade deal.  We can commit to our best endeavours and say we will work towards a target date. It is not possible to say that we will definitely meet that date. The future relationship treaty will be more complicated, it will have to be ratified by 28 member parliaments.  Mr Varadkar said they would begin negotiations on the future as soon as possible once the withdrawal treaty was dealt with. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Irish premier says he's ""very satisfied"" with the summit conclusions on Brexit which made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be renegotiated. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: As Europe we reaffirmed our commitment for the need for a backstop. An open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can't be a backdoor to the single market.  That's why European countries also very strongly support backstop. It is not just an Irish issue, it is very much a European issue as well. It is very much a case of in the European Union being one-for-all and all-for-one.  European Council President Donald Tusk ruled out reopening negotiations on the UK withdrawal deal. ""I have no mandate to organise further negotiations, no mandate to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,"" he told the news conference. But he said: ""Iâm always at Prime Minister Mayâs disposal"" and ""it's my pleasure to be in contact with the prime minister on all relevant issues"". ""Yesterday's conclusions are quite clear I think and we have to treat it as a good sign that we are ready to
reconfirm our assurances and goodwill and good faith when comes to the so-called backstop."" Mr Juncker is asked about THAT chat with Mrs May again.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz - current EU Council president - says that Brexit talks had ""overshadowed"" all other business at the Brussels summit.

"Holidaymakers will have to apply for an electronic permit to travel to the EU Britons will have to pay â¬7 (Â£6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, as a consequence of Brexit. The European Commission has confirmed that while UK travellerswill not need a visa,external, they will need to apply for and buy another document. It is called an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) and although not launched yet, is expected to come into force in 2021. The travel requirement is not just for the UK but for many non-EU countries. Citizens of EU countries - which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU. But anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia. Nationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa. However, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list. So it isintroducing the ETIAS,external- an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is ""way cheaper"".

It is not a visa but a travel requirement for anyone on that list of 61 non-EU countries who are coming to the EU for business, tourism, medical or transit-related reasons for up to 90 days. The EU says the ETIAS system will ""to strengthen security checks on those persons who travel visa-free to the EU"". Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit vote: What could happen next? How might Brexit affect my European holiday? Under the Brexit deal,,externalEU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020. After this period ends, the European Commissionhas offered,externalvisa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return. But although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal. The form - which the EU describes as a ""necessary and small procedural step"" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says. The details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions. UK passports - which is the only document currently needed for EU travel - will be blue and the EU reference will disappear after Brexit Most people will find out if their application has been successful within minutes, the EU says, with more than 95% of applications approved automatically. Applications can also be denied or take up to four weeks to process. If successful, the ETIAS will last for three years and allow an unlimited number of entries. The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It is not known what rules will apply to EU tourists coming to the UK, butaccording to the EU and UK's political declaration,,externalboth sides will aim to provide ""visa-free travel for short-term visits"". TheEuropean Commission previously said,externalthe EU's offer of visa-free travel to the UK was ""entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states"". The proposal - which will come into force on 29 March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit - must be adopted by the EU Parliament and European Council before it can come into force. The UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives - allowing people to stay for a maximum of six months. But they are not allowed to work, study or settle. The news could also lead to a renewed surge in applications for Irish passports by British citizens. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will retain visa-free travel benefits after Brexit, no matter the outcome of the UK's negotiations with the EU. UK residents are entitled to an Irish passport if their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland, while most Northern Ireland citizens are entitled to an Irish passport if they wish. Earlier in 2018,it was reportedthat Irish passport applications by UK citizens were booming. EU says no to May on renegotiating deal What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal?

"A police investigation has been launched after a man died after falling from a town's Christmas tree. The alarm was raised in the early hours of Friday when the injured man was found in Kirkcaldy by people leaving a nearby nightclub, Kitty's. The man, who has not yet been identified by police, was taken to hospital but later died. A police cordon has been put up around the 12ft (3.6m) fir tree, which is located outside Kirkcaldy Town House. Mario Caira, the nightclub's director, saw the man fall from the tree on to the grassy area below. He said: ""He'd climbed the tree, he was up in the tree holding on to the top. ""When he fell I thought he was actually winded. ""I went over to check on the guy and when he wasn't coming round I phoned an ambulance. ""Our condolences go to him and his family."" Mr Caira said the man, reported to be a tree surgeon in his 50s, appeared to be by himself and had not been in Kitty's that night. He believes the man's death was a freak accident, adding: ""I'm not medically trained in terms of what happened when he fell but I reckon you could do that a thousands of times and you would walk away."" Neil Crooks, convener of the Kirkcaldy area committee on Fife Council, said: ""This is a tragic thing to happen at this time of year. Our thoughts are with his family."" Another councillor, Alistair Cameron, said: ""I was very sad to hear about this tragic news this morning especially given the circumstances."" Police Scotland said the death was not being treated as suspicious. Enquiries are continuing, and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.

"The French president lays a flower at a monument for the victims in Strasbourg A fourth victim has died following the gun attack on the Christmas market in the French city of Strasbourg, the Paris prosecutor's office has said. He was named as Italian journalist Antonio Megalizzi by Italy's PM. The suspect in Tuesday's attack, Cherif Chekatt, was shot dead by a police patrol after he opened fire from a doorway on Thursday evening. The Christmas market reopened to the public on Friday and was visited by President Emmanuel Macron. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte tweeted (in Italian) his profound sorrow for the death of Antonio Megalizzi, saying the journalist had a passion for his profession. Allow Twitter content?

French media say a fifth victim is brain dead following the attack and 11 others remain wounded, four of whom are in hospital. The attack had locked down the city, with more than 700 police and soldiers hunting the gunman. Chekatt, 29, had a string of criminal convictions in France and Germany and had become a radical Islamist in jail. What we know so far Who are the victims? By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Strasbourg Signs of normal life are returning to the centre of Strasbourg, now the manhunt is over. As security officials allowed the Christmas Markets to reopen, small groups filtered in. But the city that promotes itself as the capital of Christmas doesn't feel like that just yet, as the big festive crowds that Strasbourg is famous for have not yet returned. Traders say the fear factor appears to have put off many tourists, but they're relieved that they are back in business and that the city has moved on quickly. Allow Twitter content?

On his visit, President Macron thanked members of the security forces. He laid a flower at a monument to the victims. Mr Macron also walked through the streets around the market, shaking hands and talking to members of the public. Three kilometres (two miles) south in Neudorf, investigators are attempting to retrace the steps that Cherif Chekatt may have taken as he hid for 48 hours. The investigation will also look at what mistakes were made in police surveillance methods after the suspect was released from prison and added to a security watch list of those monitored for extremist behaviour. After an appeal for witnesses, the security forces received 800 calls from the public and quickly focused their search on the Neudorf area, where Chekatt was last seen after the attack, France's anti-terror prosecutor, RÃ©my Heitz, said on Friday. As a result of two significant reports, an extensive police operation involving a helicopter was launched on Thursday evening at 19:30 local time (18:30 GMT). At 21:00, officers in a police car noticed a man, whose description matched that of the suspect, walking down rue du Lazaret, Mr Heitz said. The man noticed the police car and tried to enter a building at number 74, but could not get in. The officers identified themselves, and the man turned around, pointing a gun - similar to the one used in Tuesday's attack - and fired in their direction, hitting their car, he said. Two of the three officers fired back several times and killed the suspect. He was identified through his fingerprints and declared dead at 21:05. The officers found an old gun, still loaded, some ammunition and a knife on his body. Mr Macron earlier thanked security forces in a tweet, vowing that the country's commitment against terrorism is ""total."" Seven people have been arrested in connection with the attack: Cherif Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers, as well as three other people close to him, Mr Heitz said. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT), a man opened fire close to the famed Christmas market. Mr Heitz said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after jumping into a taxi, Mr Heitz said. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker told the taxi driver he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him near the police station in Neudorf. When he got out of the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping. Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services. He was on the ""fiche S"" watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. Bullet holes could be seen in the door where Chekatt had been hiding before he died He had 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and had spent considerable time in prison as a result. Strasbourg shooting: Face to face with gunman The Islamic State group's self-styled news agency, Amaq, on Thursday said that Chekatt was ""an Islamic State soldier"" who had ""carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries"" fighting its militants in Syria and Iraq. The other three fatalities were: Kamal Naghchband, a garage mechanic originally from Afghanistan. The father of three died in hospital. He had been visiting the market with his family and was shot in the head, his cousin told the AFP news agency Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But many issues are not yet settled and negotiators were preparing to work well past the official close of the conference on Friday evening. Most ministers here believe the strength or weakness of the final outcome is still in the balance. Among the key issues not yet decided is the question of loss and damage. This issue has bedevilled climate negotiations for many years as developing countries seek recognition and compensation for the damages caused by rising temperatures. The idea of being legally liable for causing climate change has long been rejected by richer nations, who fear huge bills well into the future. US, Saudis and Russia block climate report Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' Climate change is 'shrinking winter' At these talks, the question of loss and damage only features as a footnote in the text at present, something that has irritated developing countries. But many observers believed that overall, some progress is being made. ""It was never going to be great, not least because the US is playing a laggard role, but I think we can get a decent outcome, if it's framed in the right way,"" said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Earlier, the former president of the Maldives, and now their lead negotiator, Mohamed Nasheed, made an impassioned plea for urgent progress on cutting carbon. Mohamed Nasheed is an influential figure in the UN climate process ""It's just madness for us to allow global CO2 levels (in the atmosphere) to go beyond 450 parts per million, and temperatures to shoot past 1.5 degrees,"" he told a press briefing on Thursday. ""That can still be prevented. If we come together on the basis of the emergency facing us, we can do it. ""Every country at this summit will have hell to pay if we don't."" Representatives from 196 states are here trying to sort out some very tricky questions pertaining to the rulebook of the Paris agreement which comes into force in 2020. These are the regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing. It sounds easy but it is very technical. At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions. However some progress is being seen in shaping the rules. ""Some of the text that is key to the rulebook, in terms of the transparency of countries reporting their mitigating actions are pretty strong. It is better than it was a week ago,"" said one senior negotiator. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But there are significant holdups. Poorer countries want some ""flexibility"" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice. ""The rulebook right now hangs in the balance, because you need all countries on board and you need to support developing countries,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. ""Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules, and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it, when you don't have a clear signal from developed countries that they are going to provide that support it just brings a lot of uncertainty."" There's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this yearproduced a critical reporton how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century. The decision to welcomethis report was rejected amid controversyearlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report. When consensus couldn't be found, the text about the IPCC was dropped - much to the surprise of a majority of countries. There is a determination here to ensure that at the end of this meeting a ""COP decision"" will recognise the IPCC. ""There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,"" said Mohamed Nasheed. ""We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage."" There is a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency. In the light of the IPPC report many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive. Right now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as ""grossly insufficient"" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country. It is not just the negotiators and ministers here who want to see progress on cutting carbon. Business is looking for a signal from this meeting about the future. ""Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,"" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola. ""So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster."" Poland holds the COP presidency but there is a lot of concern among delegates that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting. Most people want to see a strong rulebook, a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive. While some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich and not the poor. ""I think the presidency is too honed in with the what the high-emitting countries are looking for right now and that could lead to a weak outcome here,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. ""Often in these talks when it's quite complex, and you don't have clear leadership, that's when countries like Saudi Arabia can come in and just wreak havoc. That's why we need the ministers from EU to come and work with poor nations to drive that home to counterbalance what the Saudis and the Poles are doing here."" For the more than 20,000 people attending these talks, the end can't come quick enough. Most have been here for around two weeks. Officially, it is all due to finish on Friday evening. But the expectation is that it will be Saturday at the earliest. Some are worried that it could go into Sunday, but most delegates have flights to catch on that date so the pressure will be on to finish by then. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to scientific studies. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says theWest's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive.Update your browser to have a go! All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator,click to launch the interactive content,external. Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to aUniversity of Oxford study.,external However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment. The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel. Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News. Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said. ""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land. Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference. Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases. For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles. Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' Climate change is 'shrinking winter' University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, andThomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland,,externallooked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet. The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based onserving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA),externalandhealthy diet portion sizes from BUPA,external. The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are oftenlower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurantsand what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods. The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. TheEuropean Environment Agency,externalestimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile. Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from theCommittee on Climate Change,external, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator. The Carbon Neutral Calculator is no longer online, but themethodology behind it can still be accessed,external. The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based onfigures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes,externaland uses up 65 litres. Only ""blue water"", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.

"Rachel Johnston collapsed after being discharged from hospital A disabled woman died after having all her teeth removed by a dentist at an NHS trust criticised for its ""drastic"" full extractions from other vulnerable patients. Rachel Johnston underwent the operation after it was deemed necessary because of severe tooth decay. But she collapsed hours after being discharged and spent days on a life-support machine in hospital, before her devastated family were told medics could not do any more to save her. The procedure was carried out by the community dental service in Worcestershire. Two more families have told the BBC of their concerns with the service after their sons had the same ""extreme"" treatment without their knowledge. In both cases, they were expecting their sons, who have learning disabilities, to have a small number of teeth removed but were left shocked when they emerged from the operating theatre with no teeth left. Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, which runs the dental service, insisted it followed the correct procedures for vulnerable patients, while three clinical commissioning groups are investigating Ms Johnston's death. Campaigners have said they are often told of poor communication between disabled patients and their families, and that dentists should intervene earlier to avoid taking out every tooth in a person's mouth. ""There should never be a situation where such extreme treatment comes as a surprise,"" said Sarah Coleman, from Mencap. Diana Johnston says she wants to know why her daughter Rachel died A passion for singing 1980s pop star Shakin' Stevens and the computer-animated film Ice Age helped make Ms Johnston, 49, the life and soul of Pirton Grange Care Home. But a lifetime of dental problems meant the Johnston family were told earlier this year a ""full dental clearance"" - the removal of all her teeth - may be needed. ""I asked if they could take a few out at a time - it seemed like a big operation - but was told they only wanted to put her under the general anaesthetic once,"" said her mother Diana Johnston, from Evesham. On 26 October, her daughter, who suffered brain damage after contracting meningitis as a baby, was anaesthetised at Kidderminster Hospital for the removal of all her teeth. Ms Johnston's temperature dropped during the procedure but after coming round she was in high spirits, her mother said, and was discharged four hours later. The following day, care home staff phoned her mother to say she was very unwell. ""She was bleeding quite a bit and her tongue had swollen right up. But she was just lying there. It was like there was no life."" The following day she was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties. Her daughter was put on a life support machine but her family was eventually told there was nothing more doctors could do for her. She died on 13 November, 10 days after the machine was turned off. A coroner is investigating. ""She was so strong - she contracted meningitis at six weeks old and doctors said if she makes it to 10 you'll have the biggest bonus,"" said Mrs Johnston. ""Well she got 39 more years. She fought everything that was thrown at her, which makes what happened even more difficult."" Nora Ashmore says she was shocked to find her son Kelvin had had all his teeth taken out Nora Ashmore's son Kelvin had suffered tooth decay after years of problems brushing his teeth. ""He'd bite down on the toothbrush, it was very difficult,"" said Mrs Ashmore. Three years ago, aged 32, he had to go to Worcestershire Royal Hospital to have some decayed teeth removed. ""I had to sign a form for them to do what was necessary,"" his mother recalled. ""When he went into recovery, there was a lot of blood [around his mouth]. I thought it seemed a lot for a few teeth."" Mrs Ashmore said a man and woman then told her all her son's teeth had been taken out. ""I said 'pardon?' I couldn't believe what they were saying. I was so shocked."" Mrs Ashmore said she felt the procedure was ""so radical, so drastic"". ""If they'd have said beforehand 'we think this is the best way forward', I might have understood. ""It's something we've tried to forget. You think 'they must know best'."" 'The screeching drill, the burnt flesh - my dental nightmare' 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth' NHS dental patients 'face 90-mile trip', union claims It is a situation familiar to Debbie and Jon Perry. Their son, in his 30s, also had all his teeth taken out by the trust around the same time as Kelvin. They said they were expecting him to have a deep clean, some fillings and a few extractions. ""We signed some documents but they didn't tell us they were going to take all his teeth,"" said Mrs Perry. ""We were very shocked,"" her husband added. ""He was very distressed. He was looking at us, like, 'what have they done?'"" ""It's affected him a lot. He's got no confidence now, doesn't want to go out on days out, holidays, anything,"" said Mrs Perry. There are many reasons, including behavioural problems that affect teeth brushing, gastric reflux, and some chromosomal disorders. The NHS runscommunity dental services,externalaround the UK to look after people who find going to the dentist difficult. Dentists must obtain informed consent before carrying out treatment but some patients do not have the mental capacity to do this. A dentist will assess the patient's capacity in line with principles set out in the Mental Capacity Act (England) 2005, said Charlotte Waite, who chairs the British Dental Association's England Community Dental Services Committee. ""Where patients do not have this capacity, the dentist may provide treatment in the patient's best interest,"" she said. ""The legislation states that dentists should provide treatment that is the 'least restrictive of the patient's rights and freedom of action'."" It is not always possible to complete a full examination of a patient's teeth before they undergo anaesthetic. ""In those cases, the dentist should usually discuss the potential possibilities with all the appropriate people involved in making a decision that's in the best interest of the patient,"" said Ms Waite. Rachel Johnston was put under anaesthetic at Kidderminster Hospital Decisions sometimes have to be made in the treatment room because dentists do not want to pause a procedure while a patient is under anaesthetic, a spokesman for Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust said. Dentists do not want to risk patients being anaesthetised several times, so in some cases decide to remove non-restorable teeth to avoid this, said Rod Smith, Associate Medical Director for Specialist Primary Care. ""The consent process is clear that fillings would be done if the teeth are restorable, with extractions carried out if not, and that ultimately the aim is to render the patient dentally fit at the end of the procedure,"" he added. ""The feedback we receive across our community dental service is very positive but we will always listen to patients and families to see if there is more we can do to ensure their experience is a positive one."" In the case of Ms Johnston's death, a spokesperson for the three Worcestershire CCGs said: ""Whilst it would not be appropriate for us to discuss the details of any specific case, we can confirm that all relevant agencies are committed to work together to share the facts and review the circumstances leading up to a recent case of the death of a person with a learning disability."" 'My life was turned upside down by cancelled operations' Kidnapped woman stuffed in own car boot Should homeless people have to live in a box? ""Sadly, it is very common for there to be a lack of communication between healthcare professionals and people with a learning disability and their families,"" Sarah Coleman, Mencap's health policy officer, said. ""More must be done to ensure people with a learning disability can access good quality dental care as soon as they need it, before we reach the point where multiple teeth need to be extracted. ""People with a learning disability deserve the same quality of treatment and care as anyone else, and it's simply not good enough when they don't get it. ""Making a best interest decision on a matter such as whether to give a general anaesthetic, or to remove teeth, is extremely serious and requires careful consideration.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I think it is right that the party feels the party would prefer to go into that election with a new leader"" Theresa May has survived a no confidence vote from her own MPs, but at the price of putting a time limit on her premiership. The prime ministertold MPs she will not lead the party into the next general election - scheduled for 2022 -but would stay on in the meantime to deliver Brexit. Mrs May's pledge may have helped secure her immediate future - she can't be challenged in the same way by MPs for a year - but the long term is far from certain. Does her concession strengthen her hand for the difficult months ahead or is a swift departure now inevitable? And how did other prime ministers in similar situations fare? This video can not be played David Cameron told James Landale he would not be running for a third term David Cameron was approaching the end of his first term as prime minister when he decided to announce he would not be running for a third. What he said:Speaking to the BBC's James Landale in his kitchenas the 2015 general election approached, Mr Cameron said: ""I think I'm standing for a full second term... the third term is not something I'm contemplating."" Why did he say it?He was asked if he would be serving the full five years if he won the election. His answer? ""Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many."" He didn't want to go on forever, but his announcement shocked many of his MPs and led to some accusations of arrogance from the opposition. What happened next?The Conservative party won the 2015 election with a 12-seat majority, leaving behind its coalition government with the Lib Dems. But come the morning after the EU referendum in 2016, Mr Cameron resigned over the result - having called the referendum and campaigned for Remain. So how long did he last?Between announcing his intentions and resigning, Mr Cameron lasted one year and three months. Tony Blair left Downing Street for the last time on 27 June 2007 Labour prime minister Tony Blair had been leading the country for nine years when he announced his plan to pass on the baton. What he said:In September 2006,Mr Blair said,external: ""The next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader... but I am not going to set a precise date now."" Why did he say it?His announcement was long-awaited by many in the party, having revealed in 2005 he would fight the election but then step down after a full term. This led to growing animosity in Labour, as there had long been a rumour his eventual successor - then-Chancellor Gordon Brown - had been promised a chance at the top job at an earlier date. In 2006, Mr Brown's supporters acted in what became known asthe ""curry house conspiracy""- a coup to remove Mr Blair and install the chancellor as prime minister. The plotters, reportedly masterminded by then defence minister Tom Watson, had met over a biryani at a Wolverhampton curry house. There they discussed Mr Blair's future, before circulating a missive calling for him to quit. The letter leaked to the press and led to several of the plotters' resignations - but it did pile the pressure on Mr Blair to come up with a date. What happened next?The BBC's political editor at the time, Nick Robinson, said there was still a lot of ""poison"" emanating from Labour MPs - and allies of Mr Blair and Mr Brown were continuing to fight behind the scenes. So how long did he last?Heresigned,externalnine monthslater on 27 June 2007. Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah at the Labour Party conference The May 2010 general election resulted in a hung parliament. Before the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition finally formed, Labour and the Lib Dems were in talks about a possible deal. What he said:Less than a week after the election, Gordon Brown announced he would stand down as Labour leader in September of that year. Mr Brown's announcement was seen as a desperate attempt by some to shore up a potential coalition. The PM said Britain had a ""parliamentary and not presidential system"" and said there was a ""progressive majority"" of voters. He said if the national interest could be best served by a coalition between the Lib Dems and Labour he would ""discharge that duty to form that government"". But he had also failed to return a Labour majority to the Commons. What happened next?Just a day later, it was clear his attempts hadn't worked and the Lib Dems would be choosing the Conservatives as their coalition partners. Standing outside No 10, he said he had ""loved the job"" and, accepting his fate, wished the next prime minister well. So how long did he last?One day. History suggests Mrs May will struggle to stay until her self-declared departure date. Dr Matthias Dilling, a lecturer in politics from Oxford University, said she would not be able to prevent potential successors vying for the Tory leadership. ""Usually I would say it is probably difficult to stay on as long as she has announced,"" he said. ""But what is helping her now is that 'prime minister' is not a particularly appealing job for people to take over at the moment."" However, if Mrs May manages to get her Brexit plan through Parliament and the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, the picture could change rapidly. How much longer she survives after that date ""depends on the type of Brexit we're having"", Dr Dilling said. ""That's quite difficult to predict."" In the meantime, she faces potential successors plotting takeover plans and recruiting allies. Dr Dilling said the PM could counter this by identifying credible contenders and getting them on side. But that might not be possible untilthe pack of potential candidatesnarrows, he said. A number of potential successors are being discussed in Westminster, including Boris Johnson, Amber Rudd and Dominic Raab Lance Price, who was a special adviser to Mr Blair during his premiership, said it was important Mrs May found a candidate who could continue her Brexit strategy. Mr Price said in the past leaders would claim to be ""above the fray"" in order to avoid (at least public) involvement in choosing a successor. ""She's got too much at stake for that,"" he said. ""Until Brexit is sorted, her position is strengthened. As soon as it's sorted, she is then the lame duck prime minister."" She must build up a successor herself, he explained, but not so soon that they become a rival. The psychological impact on the prime minister and her team will also be difficult to handle, Mr Price said. ""Under normal circumstances that would be pretty soul destroying. ""But she is living day by day, hour by hour. And she is used to being rebuffed constantly. ""She's never had a honeymoon period as a prime minister. So she's not a normal prime minister in that respect."" Brexit battles: Theresa May's many fights. Video, 00:03:34Brexit battles: Theresa May's many fights Who could replace Theresa May as leader?

"The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours A US passenger plane travelling from Seattle to Dallas was forced to turn back hours into its flight because a human heart had been left on board. Southwest Airlines says the organ was flown to Seattle from California, where it was to be processed at a hospital to have a valve recovered for future use. But it was never unloaded and its absence was not noticed until the plane was almost half-way to Dallas. The heart itself had not been intended for a specific patient. Details of the incident, which occurred on Sunday, were revealed in media reports on Thursday. Flight emergency info 'played in error' Plane diverted after 15 minutes by 'disruptive' passenger Flight attendant falls from plane Passengers were said to have been shocked when the captain told them about the cargo and why the flight was turning back. Some used their smartphones to investigate the length of time that a heart can be stored before it is no longer viable for a transplant operation - typically between four and six hours, according to experts. The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours. A doctor who was among the passengers but not involved in the shipment of the organ, told the Seattle Times newspaper that the incident was a ""horrific story of gross negligence"". Following the flight's return to Seattle,the heart was taken to a donor health centre for tissue storage,externaland was said to have been received within the required time frame, the newspaper added. In a statement, Southwest Airlines said the heart reached its intended destination ""within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer"". A spokeswoman for Sierra Donor Services, the nonprofit that organised the donation, said that the heart will now be processed so that its valves can be used for life-saving procedures, but added that these ""won't be available for implant for quite some time"". Monica Johnson, Sierra Donor Services' executive director, said the donor's family had been notified of the travel delay. ""They are relieved their loved one's heart valves were received and will be able to help others,"" she said. After the plane returned to Seattle it was taken out of service due to a mechanical issue that Southwest says was unrelated to the heart mishap.

"Many people could get faster speeds but are not, Ofcom has found One in seven homes could be paying more than they need to for broadband and could get faster services for the same or less money, Ofcom has said. New research suggests that half of UK homes have not taken up faster services even though they are available. Ofcom has launcheda campaign dubbed Boost Your Broadband,externalto let people know about what options are available. It follows years of effort to ensure that fast internet reaches as much of the country as possible. A website to accompany the campaign will allow people to check what broadband they can receive in their area, as well as providing independent information on how to get the best deal. The regulator also announced proposals to force broadband and mobile firms to tell customers about their best available deal, both when their deals are coming to an end, and every year after that if they don't change them. It also plans to investigate broadband firms' pricing practices to examine why some customers pay more than others. It is particularly keen to look at introductory offers that run out. It estimates that customers who take a landline and broadband service together are paying an average of 19% more once their discounted deal has expired. It is currently reviewing how mobile operators charge their customers for handsets when bundled with airtime in a single contract. Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, said: ""We're concerned that many loyal broadband customers aren't getting the best deal they could. So we're reviewing broadband pricing practices and ensuring customers get clear, accurate information from their provider about the best deals they offer."" Katie Milligan, a manager at Openreach, which provides much of the UK's broadband network said: ""More than 17 million homes and businesses could order a better service over our network today, but haven't yet."" ""That means they're missing out on more reliable connections that would allow them to work from home more effectively, access entertainment and use multiple smart devices around the house, all at the same time and without interruption."" She urged consumers to get in touch with their providers to find out what deals they could get. Ofcom's findings are borne out byearlier research carried out by price comparison service uSwitch,which found that more than a third of those living on streets with slow broadband had access to much faster services. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at uSwitch welcomed Ofcom's plans to intervene. ""Historically in telecoms, not enough has been done to put the power back into consumers' hands. If customers are given the right tools, there is a real chance to improve households' experience of services that are now critical in their day-to-day lives."" ""As our slowest street data brought to life, consumers are getting very different outcomes from the broadband market - and in many cases, this is simply due to a lack of awareness about the better services available to them."" Could light bring us superfast mobile broadband indoors? Broadband customers to get automatic compensation Matthew Howett, founder of research firm Assembly, thinks the reason many do not upgrade is a combination of apathy and contentment with the service they have. ""I think fundamentally most households are generally satisfied with the speeds they are getting, and find their needs are met although, of course, this changes when you introduce larger families, multiple streams of HDTV, and online gaming. ""All of these more bandwidth-intense services will push up a household's requirements. The other thing to consider is the complexity faced when choosing a broadband package. ""While there are many good tools to help consumers shop around for the best deal, different contract durations, introductory tariffs, and added extras make changing package or supplier a daunting prospect for some.""

"French special forces secure the area where Chekatt was shot French police have shot dead the man who attacked Strasbourg's Christmas market on Tuesday, the interior minister has said. A police unit came across Cherif Chekatt in a Strasbourg street and shot him after he opened fire. Three people have died following the shooting at the market and several more were seriously injured. Chekatt, 29, had a string of criminal convictions in France and Germany and had become a radical Islamist in jail. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said three police officers had spotted a man matching Chekatt's description on rue du Lazaret, in the Neudorf area of Strasbourg at 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT). What we know so far Who are the victims? As the police moved to stop him, the suspect turned round and opened fire. They fired back and ""neutralised"" the attacker, said Mr Castaner, who later went to the scene. French President Emmanuel Macron thanked security forces in a tweet and vowed: ""Our commitment against terrorism is total."" Hundreds of French police and security forces had been searching for Chekatt. A large police operation had taken place in Neudorf earlier on Thursday, but ended apparently without results. Five people have been arrested in connection with the attack. They include Cherif Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers. Strasbourg mayor Roland Ries said that finding Chekatt meant the worried people of his city would now be able to return to a normal life. Mr Castaner thanked security forces in a tweet: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT), a man opened fire close to the famed Christmas market near place KlÃ©ber, which attracts thousands of visitors. France's anti-terror prosecutor, RÃ©my Heitz, said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after jumping into a taxi, Mr Heitz said. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker told the taxi driver he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him near the police station in Neudorf. When he got out of the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping. Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services. He was the subject of a ""fiche S"", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. He had 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and had spent considerable time in prison as a result. Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home. Strasbourg shooting: Face to face with gunman A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition. The Islamic State group's self-styled news agency, Amaq, on Thursday said that Chekatt was ""an Islamic State soldier"" who had ""carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries"" fighting its militants in Syria and Iraq. Three people died in Tuesday's attack, according to a new toll from the local prÃ©fecture on Thursday. One of the five seriously injured in this attack has been declared brain-dead, said the Paris prosecutor's office on Thursday. The death of Kamal Naghchband, a garage mechanic originally from Afghanistan, was announced on Thursday. The father of three died in hospital. His mosque announced his funeral would take place after Friday prayers. He had been visiting the market with his family and was shot in the head, his cousin told AFP news agency.

"An Army recruitment drive has faced ""significant problems"" - including a website that cost three times its budget and was 52 months late, a National Audit Office report has found. Outsourcing giant Capita was awarded the Â£495m contract for Army recruitment in 2012 - but has failed to hit soldier recruitment targets every year since. Capita admitted it had ""underestimated the complexity"" of the project. The Army said it had ""put in place a plan to address the challenges"". Capita delays made me give up my Army dream The NAO found the initial delay to the Â£113m website was caused by the Ministry of Defence, which failed to meet its contractual obligations to provide the IT infrastructure to host Capita's recruitment software. The Army passed responsibility for developing the whole system to Capita in 2014, but ""due to the complexity of the Army's requirements, system development was delayed even further"", the report said. And despite the website being finished in November 2017, the Army estimates there were 13,000 fewer applications between November 2017 and March 2018 than in the same period the previous year. Army recruitment system 'unacceptable' Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers' Labour vows to curb defence outsourcing Capita has consistently missed the Army's recruitment targets, with the total shortfall ranging from 21% to 45%, the NAO said. The Commons Defence Committee was told in October that the Army currently has 77,000 fully trained troops, compared with a target of 82,500. The Army and Capita have introduced some ""significant changes"" in the last year, but none have resulted in enough soldiers being recruited, according to the NAO. This video can not be played An Army recruitment advert, which focuses on men being allowed to show their emotions The report found it can take as long as 321 days for recruits to go from starting an application to beginning basic training, and that many drop out of the process while waiting. A total of 47% of applicants dropped out of the process voluntarily in 2017/18, and both the Army and Capita believe the length of the process is a significant factor in this, the report said. It added the project will not achieve its planned savings of Â£267m for the MoD. Capita - whose 10-year contract continues until 2022 - said it had overhauled the ""governance"" on its contract and there were already improvements. Nia Griffith MP, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said the Conservatives' ""ideological obsession with outsourcing"" had ""driven up costs and resulted in the failure to recruit enough personnel to the Army"".

"The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours A US passenger plane travelling from Seattle to Dallas was forced to turn back hours into its flight because a human heart had been left on board. Southwest Airlines says the organ was flown to Seattle from California, where it was to be processed at a hospital to have a valve recovered for future use. But it was never unloaded and its absence was not noticed until the plane was almost half-way to Dallas. The heart itself had not been intended for a specific patient. Details of the incident, which occurred on Sunday, were revealed in media reports on Thursday. Flight emergency info 'played in error' Plane diverted after 15 minutes by 'disruptive' passenger Flight attendant falls from plane Passengers were said to have been shocked when the captain told them about the cargo and why the flight was turning back. Some used their smartphones to investigate the length of time that a heart can be stored before it is no longer viable for a transplant operation - typically between four and six hours, according to experts. The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours. A doctor who was among the passengers but not involved in the shipment of the organ, told the Seattle Times newspaper that the incident was a ""horrific story of gross negligence"". Following the flight's return to Seattle,the heart was taken to a donor health centre for tissue storage,externaland was said to have been received within the required time frame, the newspaper added. In a statement, Southwest Airlines said the heart reached its intended destination ""within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer"". A spokeswoman for Sierra Donor Services, the nonprofit that organised the donation, said that the heart will now be processed so that its valves can be used for life-saving procedures, but added that these ""won't be available for implant for quite some time"". Monica Johnson, Sierra Donor Services' executive director, said the donor's family had been notified of the travel delay. ""They are relieved their loved one's heart valves were received and will be able to help others,"" she said. After the plane returned to Seattle it was taken out of service due to a mechanical issue that Southwest says was unrelated to the heart mishap.

"Travellers at some UK airports are barely being offered one US dollar for each of their pounds, following a month of Brexit uncertainty. Those exchanging pounds at the UK's biggest airport, Heathrow, are finding as little as $1.05 coming back across the counter. Since 16 April the pound has fallen by 11.77% against the US dollar. In places, sterling buys less than a euro, with tourists being offered just 92 cents for every pound. Against the dollar, the pound is now at its weakest since April 2017, although it has recovered slightly since Theresa May won her vote of confidence. In March 2008 the pound was briefly worth more than $2.00. While there are some other factors behind the drop in the pound's value, such as the receding chances of an interest rate rise, most experts accept that the politics of Brexit are chiefly to blame. ""Over the last couple of months... we've seen several developments in Brexit negotiations, MP resignations and more recently a leadership challenge which have all sparked significant turbulence for the pound,"" said Ian Strafford-Taylor, the chief executive of currency traders FairFx. Pound falls after Brexit vote delayed How to make the most of your travel cash Changing money at a port or airport is the most expensive way of doing so, and there are usually much cheaper deals online. The best deal on offer on Friday was $1.23 for one pound. Tourist rates are also more expensive than official exchange rates, as they take into account the costs of providing bureaux de change. But the weakness of the pound leaves anyone thinking of going abroad next year with a dilemma: Should they buy their currency now, or wait, in the hope that the pound will recover? ""It's impossible to predict how foreign exchange rates will change in future, especially with volatility around Brexit and other economic events,"" said Nathan Best, UK commercial director at Travelex. ""The best customers can do is keep an eye on rates and convert at a rate they feel comfortable with. One option for customers who are wary of foreign currency volatility is to split their currency purchases to reduce risk. Customers can choose to buy some of their currency before their trip with a preferred rate, and then buy the remaining currency closer to, or during, the trip."" Top tips to help you get the most from your travel cash Shop around for a rate:There are lots of comparison websites available to find out the best rates, both online and on the high street. Avoid buying cash at the airport:If you need some currency to take with you, Emma Grimster from Travel Supermarket says ""you could end up throwing away money"" if you don't plan ahead - particularly if you get your cash from the airport. Use an overseas travel card:Getting a travel credit card that doesn't charge any transaction fees to get cash out of an overseas cash machine is the cheapest way of getting currency, according to analysis from Money Saving Expert. Use a pre-paid travel card:Many providers allow you to load a card with money before you travel, locking-in an exchange rate. Such cards include FairFX, Revolut and WeSwap. Buy half now and half later:If you think the pound may go up or down significantly before your holiday, Helen Saxon of the website Money Saving Expert says you can always hedge your bets. ""If you've bought half now and the rate goes down i.e. you get less dollars to the pound, then at least you've got half at the higher rate, and similarly if the rate goes up, again you're getting half at the higher rate."" Know your charges:It's not exactly the most exciting bit about going on holiday, but being clued up about the charges involved with withdrawing from an ATM in another country is the best way to avoid any surprise fees. Consider the cost of living:Attempting to book a holiday, but not feeling super confident with the changing rates? Emma Grimster says you should think carefully about what board you choose when staying at a hotel. For example, all-inclusive may be a better choice - depending on the country you're visiting.

"The UK's advertising watchdog has said it will ban ""gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence"". The Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP) said harmful stereotypes in adverts ""contribute to how people see themselves and their role in society"", and can hold some people back. The ban will cover men struggling with household chores or girls being less academic than boys. The rules come into force in June 2019. The change follows areview of gender stereotyping in adverts by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)- the organisation that administers the UK Advertising Codes, written by CAP. An advert for baby formula Aptamil was accused of reinforcing gender stereotypes The review found that ""harmful stereotypes can restrict the choices, aspirations and opportunities of children, young people and adults"" and that these stereotypes can be ""reinforced by some advertising, which plays a part in unequal gender outcomes"". As a result some people could be held back from ""fulfilling their potential, or from aspiring to certain jobs and industries, bringing costs for individuals and the economy"", it added. Ella Smillie, a policy expert at CAP, told the BBC: ""There is nothing in our new guidance to suggest that ads can't feature people carrying out gender-typical roles. ""The issue would be if in that depiction it suggested that that's the only option available to that gender and never carried out by someone of another gender. ""So for example if you had a woman doing the cleaning, we wouldn't anticipate a problem. But if you had an advert with a man creating lots of mess and putting his feet up while a woman cleaned up around him, and it was very clear that she was the only person that did that at home, that's the kind of thing that could be a problem."" An Asda Christmas ad - in which a mother was shown doing most of the preparations - also attracted complaints CAP highlighted other examples that could be ""problematic"", including: Situations that depict a man or a woman failing to succeed at something  because of their gender, such as a man's inability to change nappies or a woman's inability to park a car Adverts that belittle a man for carrying out stereotypically ""female"" tasks The CAP also said that adverts that emphasised the contrast between a boy's stereotypical personality, for example, being ""daring"", with a girl's stereotypical personality, for example, being ""caring"", needed to be ""handled with care"". Under the new rules, gender stereotypes would not be banned ""outright"", the committees said, because the evidence did not show that the use of gender stereotypes was always ""problematic"". CAP's director Shahriar Coupal, said: ""Harmful gender stereotypes have no place in UK advertisements. ""Nearly all advertisers know this, but for those that don't, our new rule calls time on stereotypes that hold back people and society."" The watchdog already has rules in place which ban adverts that include gender stereotypes on grounds of ""objectification, inappropriate sexualisation and depiction of unhealthily thin body images"".

"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to scientific studies. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says theWest's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive.Update your browser to have a go! All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator,click to launch the interactive content,external. Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to aUniversity of Oxford study.,external However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment. The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel. Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News. Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said. ""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land. Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference. Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases. For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles. Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' Climate change is 'shrinking winter' University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, andThomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland,,externallooked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet. The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based onserving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA),externalandhealthy diet portion sizes from BUPA,external. The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are oftenlower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurantsand what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods. The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits.

"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to scientific studies. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says theWest's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive.Update your browser to have a go! All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator,click to launch the interactive content,external. Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to aUniversity of Oxford study.,external However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment. The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel. Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. ""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News. Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said. ""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land. Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference. Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases. For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles. Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.

"On a handful of university campuses around the UK, a new weapon in the battle against cheating is being quietly tested. Many students know that cutting and pasting content can get them into trouble for plagiarism. Universities are already checking work that looks suspicious, to see if it has been copied from elsewhere on the web. But there is growing concern that buying essays for cash is being normalised on social media platforms. BBC Trending investigations into the promotion of cheating by You Tube stars have led to thousands of videos being taken down and a tightening of precautions by the video platform. Now software is being developed using what is called ""forensic linguistics"". This analyses the composition of a document including vocabulary, punctuation and format. BBC exposes huge scale of online cheating ads YouTube stars paid to sell cheating Unis demand ban on essay-writing firms It is a technique that has been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States to piece together profiles of criminal suspects. ""It's like an arms race,"" says Dr Irene Glendinning, from Coventry University. ""We knew students were plagiarising so we now have sophisticated tools to detect it, so the next thing was ghostwriting and the tools don't detect that."" That is because work written from scratch, to order, can't be checked against other published text. Coventry is one of the UK universities informally testing the potential of software using forensic linguistics and machine learning. A sample of a student's work can be compared to anything submitted which rings alarm bells with the tutor. ""What it will allow us to do is shortcut the detection process to flag up the type of work that is suspicious, so then an expert academic can look at that work."" It could also help provide some evidence to form the basis of a conversation with a student. Once the system is in full operational use, Dr Glendinning believes it could prove to be a powerful deterrent. At the moment it is not illegal to set up a company writing essays, dissertations or other assignments for students. The companies simply post a disclaimer on their website telling students their products are intended for reference or a guide. Their aggressive marketing tactics, emailing and messaging students directly,  leave little doubt this is a lucrative global business. As well as widespread use of  sponsorship of young vloggers and other social influencers, some are also going on to city centre campuses with leaflets that imply they are from student support services. But students may also fear being wrongly accused, when they simply might have started working harder. The new software is being developed by the tech company Turnitin, whose vice-president Bill Loller accepts it can never be a complete substitute for human judgement. He insists the new programme will be able to take account of the progress made by students. Coventry students union campaigners stop students to warn against cheating ""We're not interested in the paper you submitted as a first year versus a fourth year, they're vastly different,  or not worried about how you write for different disciplines. ""How you write for economics can be vastly different from English literature - that's OK. But if within a genre and within a reasonable amount of time we start to see differences, that's when we flag something."" In the end any software, however sophisticated, can only give academics an indication of the likelihood that there is something they should investigate further. But Dr Glendinning also thinks there needs to be a wider cultural change in an era where so many students will have grown up using the internet as their encyclopedia. ""A lot of schools don't teach anything about intellectual property rights, don't teach students about plagiarism, so when they come to university they have to be re-educated."" This is why some are now calling for legislation to make essay writing services illegal, because that could send a powerful signal to students. It could be harder than it sounds, because proving a company knew and deliberately intended its work to be used to cheat would be difficult. There has only been one prosecution so far - in New Zealand, where the provision or advertising of cheating services has been illegal since 2011. Similar legislation is making its way through the Irish parliament this winter. If you want to find out more about our investigationdownload the Trending podcast- from the BBC World Service.

"With Theresa May on the ropes, Jeremy Corbyn is coming under pressure from other opposition parties - and some of his own MPs - to finish her off with the knockout blow of a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons. Unlike the vote she has just survived this would give all 650 MPs - not just 317 Conservatives - a say over whether she should remain in power. A no-confidence vote - won by a single vote - was how Margaret Thatcher removed Labour from power in 1979, triggering a general election that she won. The rules have changed since then. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act,  if a majority of MPs backed a no-confidence motion, it would start a countdown which would lead to an early election, if no successor government was able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days. PM joining EU summit after surviving vote Corbyn urged to call no-confidence vote Kuenssberg: Tories at war over Brexit More than one way to sack a government The Labour leadership's main aim has always been to force an election, which it believes Mr Corbyn will win. ""We're fully prepared to bring a no-confidence vote when we know we can win,"" said Labour chairman Ian Lavery ina video message on Facebook,external, but, he added, doing so too soon would ""serve only to strengthen Theresa May"". The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs the Tories rely on for a majority, have promised to support the government in a confidence motion. They want to give her time to seek changes to her EU withdrawal deal. But their support is not tied to Mrs May personally and they would not back her if she sought to press ahead with her deal without ditching the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" clause, which they object to. The People's Vote campaign is urging Jeremy Corbyn to back a referendum Mr Corbyn has been accused of ""cowardice"" and of failing to provide proper opposition by the SNP, the Lib Dems and others, for apparently sitting on the sidelines as the Conservative Party tears itself to pieces over Brexit. But Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, has warned that the Labour leader should not be ""bounced"" into holding a no-confidence vote by ""those who have little or no interest in seeing Labour elected"". Mr Corbyn has said he has no confidence in the government but will wait for an ""appropriate"" time to strike. Those pushing for a no-confidence vote as soon as possible are mostly advocates of a further EU referendum - and their best, possibly their only, hope of getting one is if Labour gets behind it. They include the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, a small group of Conservatives and MPs from Labour's pro-EU ""moderate"" wing like Chuka Umunna and Margaret Beckett, who are not natural allies of Mr Corbyn. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Tom Watson are alsoreported to be in the ""just get on with it"" camp,external. Mr Corbyn bowed to pressure from his own party members at this year's Labour conference - the majority of whom, polls suggest, want another referendum. The party leadership said it would consider supporting another referendum if it fails in its bid to get a general election. So the strategy of those pushing Mr Corbyn for a no-confidence vote depends, to some extent, on that vote failing. They are threatening to do this - but it would be largely symbolic, without Labour's backing. Any MP can table a motion of no confidence but it is unlikely to be given Parliamentary time without the support of a major party - and it would stand very little chance of success without the backing of the main opposition party. Some are arguing for a vote next Monday, when Mrs May makes a statement to the Commons on Thursday's EU summit. But it is more likely to be in the New Year when MPs finally get a vote on Mrs May's deal with the EU, which she is widely expected to lose. Some in the pro-referendum camp fear this will be too late to get a referendum together. And some - such as Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts - have suggested this would suit Mr Corbyn, who, she said, might be ""comfortable"" with a no-deal Brexit. John McDonnell: No majority for a no-deal Brexit They are adamant that this is the last thing they want. They say they want to win an election and then delay Brexit so they can go to Brussels and get a better deal that would see the UK being part of a customs union with the EU. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said Labour is ready to work with Theresa May on alternatives to prevent a no-deal Brexit. ""The easiest thing for any opposition to do in these circumstances is to warm your hands as the Conservatives self-immolate,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But you can't do that, not when the issues are so big for the future of the country."" He urged the prime minister to hold a series of votes in Parliament on different scenarios, including no-deal, to establish what MPs were willing to accept. ""I think there's an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons against no-deal,"" he said. ""Let's establish that once and for all and use parliamentary mechanisms to narrow that option away. Then let's get a proper debate going.""

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Amazon delivers millions of packages every day Amazon has teamed up with police in the US in an effort to stop thieves who steal parcels left outside homes. Officers in New Jersey are planting dummy boxes fitted with GPS trackers, coupled with hidden doorbell cameras, at homes around the city of Jersey. The homes selected for the experiment were chosen using the city's own crime statistics combined with mapping data of theft locations supplied by Amazon. One box was stolen three minutes after it was ""delivered"". Having parcels left outside is convenient for many but is also a risk Amazon told AP: ""We appreciate the increased effort by local law enforcement to tackle package theft and remain committed to assisting however we can."" The US Postal Service expects to deliver about 900 million packages in the run-up to Christmas. Last year, Amazon launched a service called Amazon Key that allowed homeowners with smart locks to let couriers open their doors via an app and leave parcels inside. While that may be a step too far for many, there are other ways to protect deliveries: Have them delivered to a workplace or a friend who is home during the day Insist that deliveries must be signed for Install cameras that will give police some video evidence Use a service that provides a storage box drivers can unlock by entering a code on a keypad Amazon also provides lockers for people to pick up parcels in locations such as shopping centres, convenience stores, airports, train stations and universities.
