"Richard Gnodde said the company remained committed to its London head office Goldman Sachs has said it will close its operations in Russia, becoming the first Wall Street bank to pull out of the country in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Money transfer giant Western Union has also said it will suspend operations in Russia and Belarus. The firms join a rush of global brands halting operations in Russia. Earlier on Thursday, the owner of Uniqlo made a U-turn and decided to suspend operations in the country. Operating in Moscow has been increasingly difficult for Western financial institutions and other firms amid international sanctions against Russia. More than 330 firms have withdrawn or significantly curtailed operations in the country in recent days, according to Yale researchers, who have been tracking the corporate response. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs said it would be ""winding down"" its business in Russia rather than leaving immediately. The bank said it was doing so ""in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements"". At the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs' total credit exposure in Russia was $650m (Â£496m). Later Thursday, fellow Wall Street giant JP Morgan Chase also said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"", with activities focused on taking care of staff and helping global clients manage risk and close out obligations. Meanwhile Western Union said it ""stands with the world in condemning the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine"". ""Ultimately, in light of the ongoing tragic impact of Russia's prolonged assault on Ukraine, we have arrived at the decision to suspend our operations in Russia and Belarus,"" the company said. The action is a further blow to flows of money in Russia. Western Union provides international money transfer and payments services in more than 200 countries and 130 currencies. In an interview with the BBC published today, Ukrainain Central Bank Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko had called on Western Union to ""cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks."" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Earlier on Thursday, Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing said it had decided to change its stance on continuing trading in Russia. It said it was faced with ""operational challenges"" due to the ""worsening of the conflict situation"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week it had said it would keep its Russian shops open, saying that clothing is a ""necessity of life"". But in its latest statement, it said Uniqlo could ""no longer proceed"" in Russia. ""Uniqlo has made everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia,"" it said. ""However, we have recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation. For this reason, we will temporarily suspend our operations."" Why the world is waging economic war on Russia Ukraine war is economic catastrophe, warns World Bank Among the latest wave of companies to call a halt to trading or pull back from investing in Russia, Rio Tinto became the first major mining company to cut ties with Russian businesses, while Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles. The world's biggest insurance broker, New York-listed Marsh McLennan, also announced it would exit Russia on Thursday. Ownership of its Russian businesses will be transferred to local management that will be independently operated, the group said. Japanese firm Hitachi said it wouldstop exports and cease most operations,externalin Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar moves by US companies such as Caterpillar. ""We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,"" a Hitachi spokesperson said. Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorovhad been urging the suspension,external. Entertainment giant Sony, which had already stopped releasing films in Russia, suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. McDonald's said on Tuesday,externalthat it wouldtemporarily close its 847 Russian outlets. The fast food giant has said that the move, which includes continuing to pay its 62,000 staff and restaurant employees in Russia, will cost about $50m (Â£38m) a month. ""This is a really challenging and complex situation for a global company like us,"" said chief financial officer Kevin Ozan. A number of other US food retailers, including Starbucks, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co, have said they will stop some or all business in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Meanwhile Burger King has suspended all of its corporate support, marketing and investment in Russia. But as its Russian outlets are fully franchised, many will remain open as they are managed by local franchisees. On Thursday, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported that the Russian government had put together a list of about 60 foreign companies that could be nationalised in response to the suspension of operations. It said firms including Apple, Ikea, Microsoft, IBM, Shell, McDonald's, Porsche, Toyota and H&M could have their accounts and assets seized, and ""external management"" brought in,BBC News Moscow producer Will Vernon said.,external It is unclear how the nationalised companies would be able to sell the products associated with those firms. In response to Western sanctions,Russia has imposed export bans on a string of productsuntil the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. Meanwhile in the UK, the CBI business lobby group called for government support as Western economies cope with the repercussions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The CBI said it ""fully supports"" the sanctions that have been placed on Russia ""despite their cost"". But its director general Tony Danker said the UK government must help businesses cope with the fallout such as rising energy costs and inflation as well as any impact on investment. He said the UK and other countries ""now need to confront the economic consequences of unwinding from Russia"". The CBI wants the government to ""fast-track progress on some of the big policy issues and help firms invest"". Mr Danker called for an acceleration of renewable energy and government support on energy bills, especially for energy intensive industries. He also asked for the UK government ""to stand behind domestic oil and gas in our energy transition"" while the country should also ""identify new trading partners"" for minerals and other commodities, and enhance cyber security.

"Russia has banned exports of auto equipment Russia has hit back at western sanctions for invading Ukraine by imposing export bans on a string of products until the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. The economy ministry said further measures could include restricting foreign ships from Russian ports. It said: ""These measures are a logical response to those imposed on Russia."" The ministry added that the bans on countries that have ""committed unfriendly actions"" were ""aimed at ensuring uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the economy"". The export ban includes more than 200 products. The measures will last until the end of the year. Western governments have imposed a string of sanctions on Russia, notably on buying oil, and against billionaire oligarchs seen as close to President Vladimir Putin. About 48 countries will be affected, including the US and in the EU. The order said that export exemptions can be made for Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and for members of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the ban would include exports of goods made by foreign companies operating in Russia. Items include cars, railway carriages, and containers. It comes as Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev warned that assets owned by western companies that have pulled out of Russia could be nationalised. Firms have been leaving en masse or halting investment, including industrial and mining giants such as Caterpillar and Rio Tinto, Starbucks, Sony, Unilever and Goldman Sachs. On Wednesday, Moscow approved legislation that took the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country. And in a statement on Thursday Mr Medvedev said: ""The Russian government is already working on measures, which include bankruptcy and nationalisation of the property of foreign organisations. ""Foreign companies should understand that returning to our market will be difficult."" He accused foreign investors of creating ""panic"" for ordinary Russians who could now lose their livelihoods. According to the most recent figures, Russia is the UK's nineteenth largest trading partner, with trade between the two nations totalling Â£15.9bn over a year from the end of September 2020. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It's an impressive-sounding list, but how much harm will these counter-sanctions actually cause? The bulk of what western nations buy from Russia is made up of raw materials. Oil and gas, of course, but also metals like aluminium and nickel, not to mention potash and phosphates, widely used in fertilisers. The conflict has already pushed the prices of these goods sharply upwards, amid fears supplies could be disrupted - and if they remain high, that will cause economic pain, particularly in Europe. But a ban on the sale of railway cars and locomotives from Russia is unlikely to cause much hardship. Nor will restrictions on the sale of agricultural machinery, for example. These products are exported - but mainly to countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan. The inclusion of vehicles on the list is a problem for the likes of Stellantis - the owner of Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen. It had been planning to export vans made in Russia to Europe and other parts of the world. But overall, the impact of the counter-sanctions looks more symbolic than significant. Restrictions on exports of raw materials on the other hand - if Russia were to introduce them - could have a much more dramatic effect. After Britain banned Russian-operated ships from its ports last week a retaliatory proposal to restrict foreign ships from entering Russian ports could also come into force. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that there would be ""negative consequences"" for the world's food markets due to the West's sanctions because Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers. ""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said.

"Chelsea's next game at Stamford Bridge is on Sunday when Newcastle are the visitors in the Premier League The future of European champions Chelsea is uncertain after sanctions were placed on Russian owner Roman Abramovich on Thursday. The billionaire has been in charge since 2003 but had his attempts to sell the club halted by the UK government, which has frozen his assets. What does it mean for Chelsea's fans, players and staff? BBC Sport explains how the situation will affect those associated with the club. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game"" Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The government believes the billionaire has had a ""close relationship for decades"" with Russia's president Vladimir Putin, links Abramovich has always denied. Watch: The Football News Show - Chelsea special The Sports Desk: Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football? Like the rest of his assets, Chelsea would have been frozen but a special licence granted by the government allows the Stamford Bridge club to keep operating. Yes. The special licence issued by the government allows the men's and women's teams to fulfil their fixtures for the rest of this season as normal. Chelsea's menwon away at Norwichin the Premier League on Thursday while Chelsea's womenwere victorious at West Hamin the Women's Super League at the same time. Chelsea's club shop has closed after club owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government Season-ticket holders will still be able to attend games at Stamford Bridge as normal, while match tickets sold before 10 March will be honoured. But beyond that, supporters cannot buy any new tickets to watch Chelsea. Tickets were due to go on sale for the FA Cup quarter-final tie at Middlesbrough on 19 March buta post on the club's official website,externalon Thursday confirmed that would no longer happen as planned. The club is also unable to sell any merchandise, with the club shop at Stamford Bridge closing on Thursday morning. BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: All the licence says is that anyone who purchased season tickets before 10 March, and makes payments in regular instalments, can ""continue to make those payments"". No mention has been made about future seasons. The government's special licence allows Chelsea to pay the wages of all employees, including players and coaching staff. The licence is in place until 31 May, so covers the Blues for the rest of the season and the Treasury has the right to vary, revoke or suspend it at any time. Antonio Rudiger's future at Chelsea is uncertain with his contract expiring in the summer While the sanctions are in place, Chelsea are effectively under a transfer ban and are unable to buy or sell players. They are also unable to negotiate new contracts for the players they currently own, so leaves an uncertain future for those whose current deals expire in the summer. That applies to Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta, and Andreas Christensen, although the latter two have been linked with a move to Barcelona. Rudiger was believed to be close to a new deal but current developments leave the defender in a limbo situation. BBC Sport's Simon Stone: It's the same situation for both Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes - nobody has any idea how this will affect them yet. They have got contracts, no-one is saying they won't get paid. However, this is a time of great change. Does it make the club more vulnerable to an approach for either manager from a rival team? Things are likely to change significantly at the club. Tuchel said the future was uncertain, though he washappy to remain as managerwhen giving his reaction to Thursday's developments after Chelsea's game at Norwich later on the same day. Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes coach the men's and women's teams respectively BBC Sport's Emma Sanders: Hayes, who has been at the club for a decade, signed a long-term contract in July and had her eye on chasing a first Champions League title with Chelsea. She is extremely well supported within the club and has earned the respect from those high up, having won 10 major trophies during her time in charge. Hayes was also among the exclusive list of trustees to whom Abramovich attempted to give 'stewardship' of Chelsea at the end of last month. Her commitment to the club has never been questioned so fans will no doubt be monitoring the situation cautiously. This video can not be played The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea? BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan: Chelsea were put up for sale on 2 March and there are understood to be plenty of interested parties, despite Abramovich being sanctioned. The UK government is open to considering a further addition to the special licence to allow a sale to proceed. Those working on the deal on behalf of Abramovich were always told that proceeds from the sale would go to a fund for victims of the war in Ukraine. This was made clear when Abramovich put the club up for sale last week. It is understood that the Â£1.5bn loan from Abramovich will not be deducted from the price. Abramovich had instructed American investment firm Raine Group to seek Â£3bn for the club, but finance experts believe that an already inflated price could drop further given the current uncertainty around Chelsea. Raine Group has temporarily halted the sale process while it seeks answers from the government. How quickly the club can be sold once a buyer has been found depends on the government receiving assurances that the proceeds would not go to Abramovich, but securing those assurances could take time. Chelsea's men's side won the Champions League last season while the women's team were runners-up BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: All we've had from Uefa at this stage is that it is ""seeking further clarification on the matter"" before it comments further. What Uefa is presumably trying to establish is what happens if Chelsea make it through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, and can't sell any tickets. Chelsea's men's side are away to Championship side Middlesbrough in the quarter-finals on 19 March (17:15 GMT), which will be shown live on BBC One. If they win that then they will play at Wembley in the semi-finals on the weekend 16-17 April. It is unclear at this stage how the the restrictions would impact FA Cup ticket sales if they progressed to Wembley. BBC senior sports news reporter Laura Scott: The government has set a limit of Â£20,000 per team per match for travel to and from matches. BBC Sport understands the club considers the Â£20,000 cap to be too low to allow it to operate normally, and this is a pressing matter given next week the men's team travel to Lille in the Champions League. Within hours of the announcement that Abramovich had been sanctioned by the UK government, Chelsea' main shirt sponsors suspended their Â£40m-a-year deal with the club. Mobile network provider Three had been Chelsea's official partner since 2020. It is unclear whether any of Chelsea's other sponsorship deals are at risk at this stage. In 2016, the London clubsigned a new kit deal with US sportswear giants Nike.At the time it was reported to be worth Â£60m a season for the next 15 years, but the club did not confirm any cash figures. In May 2021, Chelsea named global hotel search platform Trivago as the club's official training wear partner in a multi-year partnership. Chelsea also have a number of other official partners. If Chelsea are unable to pay their bills they could go into administration and face a nine-point deduction. Financial journalist Kieran Maguire: In the short term, it's to a large extent business as usual. Chelsea will be able to pay wages due at the end of March and will have other overheads. Chelsea's wage bill is round about Â£28m a month. We don't know how much cash they have in the bank. The most recent accounts we have are from June 2021 when there was Â£16m in the bank. Abramovich has been injecting money into Chelsea on a regular basis over recent years and presumably that won't be able to continue. The concern might be what happens if Chelsea's cash reserves are insufficient to pay their wage bill - but presumably the government and Premier League, who have been working on this, will have been looking at it to try to minimise disruption on a club level.

"UK food prices will rise as a result of the war in Ukraine, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned. Some 30% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia and exports will stop during the conflict, it says. In addition, the price of gas - which is used to heat greenhouses and to make fertiliser - has soared. The union has written to the government to call for urgent action to help UK farmers produce enough food to keep supermarkets stocked and affordable. ""The government must act now, with a clear signal that food security is a priority for the nation,"" the NFU said. Its letter warned that disruption to food production, supply chains and the availability and affordability of food in the shopscould last for years.,external Earlier this week, the boss of one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies, Yara International, warned thatthe war in Ukraine would deliver a shock to the global supply and cost of food. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors has also warned that the increase in fuel prices will lead topeople paying more for food in shops and restaurants. NFU president Minette Batters said the government must work with farmers to address food supply issues NFU president Minette Batters told the BBC that the rising cost of producing fruit, vegetables and meat could cause farmers to make less at a time when the nation needs more. ""I think the whole world has got to recognise that this is not something we've faced before, we are going to see wheat price inflation levels that have never happened,"" she said. ""The real danger is that farmers contract, they decide not to invest, they hold back from planting, and we produce less food,"" she said. Ms Batters said the shortage of crops would also affect meat production as farmers need it to feed their livestock. The cost of producing a chicken was 50% higher than it was a year ago but farmers were absorbing much of these costs, she said. UK feed wheat prices are already 39% up on March 2021 at Â£279.40 a tonne, according to theAgriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB),external Russia and Ukraine produce 80% of the world's sunflower oil exports and 20% of corn exports, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Another factor affecting food production in the UK is that Ukrainian workers have accounted for 60% of recruits under the UK's Seasonal Workers Scheme, the NFU said. These workers carry out essential roles such as planting, picking, packing and grading fresh produce. The NFU is asking the government to release an additional 10,000 visas under the Seasonal Workers Scheme, in addition to the 30,000 already granted. Farmer Dan Wallis says he will be growing more wheat Dan Wallis, who runs Rookery Farms in Newbury, Berkshire, said he decided this week to sow spring wheat on land that was not due to be planted on until next autumn. ""Given the current crisis in Ukraine the demand for food is ever increasing,"" he told the BBC. ""There's going to be a shortage of wheat and barley, predominantly wheat, so today we are planting spring wheat into some fallow land which should have remained fallow until next autumn. ""I made the decision in the last week or 10 days - it's the right thing to do."" This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries The Environment Secretary, George Eustice, told MPs that in early January he had set up teams to make contingency plans for the UK's food security. He told the House of Commons that he would attend a special meeting of the G7 group of the world's largest economies to discuss the issues further on Friday. Commons Leader Mark Spencer said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was ""across the threats that we face"". ""There is no prospect of food shortages at any point in the future, and Defra are working with Treasury to try and make sure that that continues to be the case,"" he said.

"A volunteer from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group paints a heart on the National Covid Memorial Wall opposite the Palace of Westminster in central London The draft terms of reference for the UK public inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic have been published. It will look at preparedness, the public health response, the health and care sector response and the economic response, the Cabinet Office said. The probe will play a key role in ""learning lessons"" from the pandemic and for the future, it said. The inquiry is due to start in the spring. The terms of reference werepublished,externalafter a consultation with inquiry chairwoman and former High Court judge Baroness Hallett, and with ministers in the devolved nations. Representatives of the inquiry will travel to towns and cities across the UK in the coming weeks to meet with people impacted by the pandemic and hear their views on what should be investigated. The Scottish government has already published the terms of reference for itsown Covid-19 inquiry, to be led by Judge Lady Poole. The UK-wide inquiry proposes examining a broad range of issues including: the UK's preparedness for the pandemic the use of lockdowns and other 'non-pharmaceutical' interventions such as social distancing and the use of face coverings the management of the pandemic in hospitals and care homes the procurement and provision of equipment like personal protective equipment and ventilators support for businesses and jobs, including the furlough scheme, as well as benefits and sick pay. The inquiry aims to produce ""a factual, narrative account"" covering decision-making at all levels of government and the response of the health and care sector as well as identifying the ""lessons to be learned"". The draft document said the inquiry would ""produce its reports (including interim reports) and any recommendations in a timely manner"". In the UK, more than 162,000 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. The Cabinet Office said the UK-wide inquiry would ""reflect the importance of understanding the experiences of those most affected by the pandemic"" such as bereaved families and examine any ""disparities"" in the impact of the pandemic and the government's response. It said there would now be a further public consultation led by Baroness Hallett to consider any changes to the terms before they are finalised. Baroness Hallett said she would open the public consultation into the scope of the inquiry, which will run until 7 April. In a statement, she reiterated it was independent and urged people across the UK to share their views on what it should cover, especially those ""who have been bereaved, experienced hardship or suffered other harm"". Ex-judge to chair Covid pandemic inquiry When will the UK's Covid public inquiry happen? Judge appointed to lead Scottish Covid-19 inquiry Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said the publication was a ""huge step forward"" and the organisation looked forward to contributing to the consultation on the terms. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said there was much the NHS did well during the pandemic but: ""It is right the inquiry looks at areas where there were major challenges - such as infection prevention and control, access to PPE, testing, and robust epidemiological modelling."" He said trust leaders welcomed the inquiry covering ""the nation's preparedness, initial capacity, and resilience ahead of, and during the pandemic, and the important focus on inequalities"". Emma Norris, director of research at the Institute for Government think tank,said on Twitter,externalthe inquiry's ""huge remit"" had ""likely implications for the length and timeliness of the inquiry"", adding: ""A wide scope usually means a longer inquiry."" To avoid a lengthy inquiry, she said a large team would be needed to probe different issues concurrently, but that the mention of interim reports was ""positive"". Barrister and Covid lockdown regulations expert Adam Wagner also said on first look, the draft terms of reference appeared to be ""very wide"". In aTwitter thread,external, he said they failed to mention explicitly the policing of the pandemic, the government's hotel quarantine policy for people arriving in the UK from abroad and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human rights. He said these elements would ""hopefully"" be covered by the items ""the use of lockdowns"" and ""travel and borders"". As the terms stand, he predicted it would be ""a massive, long and difficult"" inquiry with ""many strands and elements"". Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight. A report by MPs onthe Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committeelast October said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures. It said the government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection. The MPs said this led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives. A report byspending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) last Novemberfound ministers were not properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption.

"Roman Abramovich has owned Premier League club Chelsea since 2003 Roman Abramovich's attempt to sell Chelsea has been halted after the oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Russianput the European champions up for saleafter thethreat of sanctions was raised in Parliament. The freezing of Abramovich's assets,which include Chelsea, means the club cannot sell further match tickets. The move is intended to stop Abramovich making money from Chelsea. The government has issued a special licence that will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket-holders to attend matches. Chelsea have said they ""intend to engage in discussions"" with the government and will seek amendments to the special licence to ""allow the club to operate as normal as possible"". What do sanctions mean for Chelsea? All your questions answered Watch: The Football News Show - Chelsea special Meanwhile, Chelsea's shirt sponsor, telecommunications company Three, has requested that the Blues ""temporarily suspend"" its deal with the club. Three has asked for ""the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice"". The company added: ""We recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. ""However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do."" Chelsea will be unable to buy or sell players, or offer new contracts, while the sanctions are imposed on Abramovich. Chelsea-owned players who are on loan at other clubs will be able to continue to play for those clubs. The London club's merchandise shop has also been shut. ""Once you start digging down into what this could do - yes, they can play their games but will they even be able [to]?"" former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told the BBC World Football podcast. ""Massive amounts of questions but yes, it's not hyperbole to say the future of the club is in serious danger."" Reaction and analysis to Abramovich's sale of Chelsea being halted Listen: Football Daily podcast on Abramovich sanctions The government is open to considering a further addition to the special licence which will allow the sale of the club. A condition for that to happen would be that Abramovich - one of Russia's richest people who is believed to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin - receives no funds. He has previously said that proceeds of any sale would be donated to victims of war. On Wednesday, there were 20 credible parties looking at a potential Chelsea takeover and interest in buying the club has not been dented, despite Abramovich being sanctioned. However, the American investment firm - Raine Group - handling the sale has temporarily halted their efforts after the shock of the news and the confusion caused by what happens next. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the government is ""committed to protecting"" the club. ""Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities,""she tweeted.,external ""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended."" Dorries later told BBC Sport: ""Abramovich has links to Putin, who is mounting a barbaric and evil attack against the people of Ukraine. ""We in this department stand with the people of Ukraine and I'm afraid sanctions have consequences. Abramovich's actions have consequences too."" This video can not be played The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea? Chelsea are able to pay the wages of all employees, including players and coaching staff They can pay ""reasonable"" costs of travel to and from fixtures but not exceeding Â£20,000 per game per team They can pay ""reasonable"" costs towards hosting home fixtures, not exceeding Â£500,000 per fixture per team Fans who bought season tickets or individual match tickets before 10 March 2022 can attend games Rights-holding broadcasters can broadcast any fixture involving the club The sanctions were imposed on a day that both Chelsea's men's and women's teams were in action, with theBlues winning at Norwich in the Premier League, and alsoat West Ham in the WSL. During Chelsea's 3-1 win at Carrow Road travelling fans chanted Abramovich's name. The Premier League said that it will ""work with the club and the government to ensure the season will proceed as planned and in line with the government's intention"". The Chelsea Supporters' Trust has called for the government ""to minimise the uncertainty"" and to include fans ""in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts"". As a result of the sanctions, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee will hear from Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston, Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham and the Premier League's chief policy and corporate affairs officer Helen MacNamara on Tuesday. Committee chair Julian Knight said the hearing would ""explore issues around the role of Russian money in our national game and will examine the government's approach to financial sanctions targeted at specific individuals and its general policy on sporting sanctions and boycotts"". Knight added: ""This morning's announcement that Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the government and emerging details of the likely effect on one of the country's biggest football clubs illustrates the deep and wide-ranging impact such measures will have on sport in this country."" Since his purchase of the club in 2003, Chelsea have been transformed, setting the template for how much finance was needed to compete at the top end of English football. In total, Abramovich has loaned the club more than Â£1.5bn, which has helped to bring great success. Under Abramovich's ownership, the club have won every major trophy possible - including the Champions League twice, both the Premier League and FA Cup five times, the Europa League twice and the League Cup three times. In February, they won their first Club World Cup. They have also won the Women's Super League title four times, the Women's FA Cup on three occasions and picked up the Women's League Cup twice in the past eight years. Financial journalist Kieran Maguire told the BBC: ""In the short term, it's to a large extent business as usual. Chelsea will be able to pay wages due at the end of March and will have other overheads. ""Chelsea's wage bill is round about Â£28m a month. We don't know how much cash they have in the bank. The most recent accounts we have are from June 2021 when there was Â£16m in the bank. Abramovich has been injecting money into Chelsea on a regular basis over recent years and presumably that won't be able to continue. ""The concern might be what happens if Chelsea's cash reserves are insufficient to pay their wage bill - but presumably the government and Premier League, who have been working on this, will have been looking at it to try to minimise disruption on a club level."" Simon Stone, BBC Sport football reporter There is no template for dealing with this type of situation and football's authorities are scrambling to work out the finer points. For Chelsea, some elements are straightforward - and tricky. They cannot offer new contracts - so the futures of Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and skipper Cesar Azpilicueta are uncertain. The loan of Saul Niguez will not be turned into a permanent deal. Chelsea cannot sell the numerous players they have on loan, including Armando Broja, who has impressed so much at Southampton. Presumably numerous younger players they would have given contracts to now will not get them. But what about the detail? Can Chelsea sell tickets to their own fans for away games given they as a club do not benefit? What will happen to the FA Cup semi-final - if they get there - when receipts are split between clubs? Can Premier League clubs like Brentford - who were part-way through selling their away allocation for their trip to Stamford Bridge on 2 April - still do so, or do they have to stop? And as for the Â£20,000 limit on expenses for away games, Chelsea have matches next week at Lille and Middlesbrough. Both would cost substantially more than Â£20,000. Can individuals make contributions or will Chelsea have to reduce the cost with a less expensive form of accommodation for Thomas Tuchel's side? Clearly, the sale of the club needs to happen quickly if there is not to be a major impact. But that is in the hands of the government. Roman Abramovich's funding meant Chelsea emerged from the financial impact of Covid-19 relatively unaffected - that is unlikely to be the case this time. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game"" BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Like all the Russian billionaires who still run businesses in their motherland, Roman Abramovich has had to remain on good terms with President Putin, even though he no longer spends much time in the country. This is what led to him being sanctioned, with the UK government saying he is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who has had a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. One example given of that is the contracts he received in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. More specifically on Ukraine and the Russian army, the UK government claims one of Mr Abramovich's companies, Evraz Plc, may ""potentially"" have been involved in providing steel which ""may have been used in the production of tanks"".

"""We're here to destroy the enemy brigades,"" says Johnny Dragan (left) The commander called himself Johnny Dragan, and he smoked each cigarette as fiercely as if it was going to be his last. Dragan was strengthening a blocking position at a strategic crossroads north-west of Kyiv. If the Russians broke through, Dragan and his men would have to stop them. Behind him was a dual carriageway heading straight to Kyiv. Off-duty soldiers were eating and resting at a restaurant on the crossroads that Dragan had taken over as his headquarters. The food was hearty, and they stacked their rifles in neat conical piles next to their tables. Outside, the active shift was working during another bitterly cold day, with the snow settling on their shoulders. A tank was in position. A deadly-looking artillery piece was positioned to fire directly, over open sights, at anything coming down the road that Dragan decided was a threat. ""We're here to destroy the enemy brigades,"" he said. ""The occupiers who've come to our country - and are heading our way."" A builder's lorry was lowering slabs of reinforced concrete with the crane it had used until a fortnight or so back to deliver housebuilding supplies. Destruction not construction has been happening since. It felt more urgent near the frontline today. Ukrainian troops inside and outside Kyiv are reinforcing checkpoints into barricades. Dragan's men were close to Hostomel, a small and strategically important town. Fighting has not stopped there since the first morning of the war, when Russia airborne troops came in by helicopter to seize a cargo airport as a bridgehead. Tanya says Hostomel ""used to be such a lovely place to live"" but now there is ""no house, no street and no town"" We picked up Tanya and Ivan, a couple in their 60s who had been walking for three hours to get out of Hostomel. It took 13 days, they said, to gather the courage to leave their freezing cellar. Tanya described what they had seen on the first day of the war before they fled underground. ""When our guys blew up the bridge, we saw tanks and a car with the soldiers ahead of the column, but our guys did not let them goâ¦ The bridge was blown up and the car and everything was destroyed."" When they emerged at dawn after nearly two terrifying weeks to walk towards Kyiv, about 20 miles (32km) away, everything had changed. Tanya wept a little as she remembered how it had been in Hostomel. ""It used to be such a lovely place to live. But when we came up this morning there was no house, no street and no town."" Some destroyed buildings north-west of Kyiv are still smouldering Many villages nearby, not just their home, are in ruins. In buildings that are still burning a few traces of old lives are left; smouldering kitchens where families must have eaten, argued and loved. Dogs scavenge for food, waiting close to the rubble for owners who abandoned them. Russian tactical and military blunders, plus well-organised and determined resistance, have bought the Ukrainians time to beef up for whatever comes next. That is not going to last indefinitely. The barrage of international sanctions against Russia shows no sign of forcing President Vladimir Putin to change his mind. His public utterances reinforce what seems to be his determination to finish the job of crushing Ukrainian independence, which he tells the Russian people is a necessary step to protect themselves and their nation. It is hard to overstate the gravity of the crisis caused by the invasion, and the years of tension that led to it. It is deadly serious because of Russia and the  Nato countries' radically different views of the security and orientation of states that used to be firmly in the orbit of the Soviet Union. The parties to the wider conflict, above and beyond the war in Ukraine, are armed with nuclear weapons that could destroy all of us. The chances that this war could somehow go nuclear are very low, despite Mr Putin's decision to increase the level of readiness of part of his arsenal. But wars generate confusion and misperception, and the dangers of escalation are ever-present. A local hospital that has been treating the wounded Ukrainian soldiers is being abandoned Like most people who grew up in the Cold War, I cannot forget the relief I felt when it ended, and the joy of turning on the television on 9 November 1989 and seeing Germans dancing on the Berlin Wall. It is hard to believe that more than 30 years later I have spent the day reporting on the Russian push into Ukraine, and the results of a failure by all concerned to build security that would stop Europe going back to its old ways. A couple of miles from the Russians in Hostomel, Ukrainians were preparing to abandon a hospital that has been treating the wounded. They had been evacuated further away from the fighting, and the hospital director Dr Valerii Zukin was supervising staff wrapping sensitive medical equipment with bales of clingfilm. Beds were waiting to be picked up and trucked out. My ship is sinking, Dr Zukin told me, and I am the captain so I will be the last to leave. His voice rose as he said Ukrainians did not want food aid. Instead, they wanted weapons and a no-fly zone enforced by Nato. ""The Russians understand only the language of the power. I would like to use the words of the former Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, who said it was impossible to negotiate with the man who came to kill you."" It was a lonely and tense drive through the snow until we saw the suburbs of Kyiv. Ukrainian troops were dug into the woods, waiting.

"The scene in Melitopol. ""We have not stopped protesting,"" one resident said In the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol on Monday, the mayor Ivan Federov sat down at his desk to send out his daily Facebook update. He told his followers that the Russian forces occupying the city had now taken control of the city's communications network, so they needed to be wary of what they heard on TV and the radio. How many people would see his warning, he didn't know. Melitopol's internet connection had also all but disappeared, making it nearly impossible to reach people inside by WhatsApp or Telegram call, or stay connected for more than a few minutes. The ordinary phone lines were no longer an option, Federov told the BBC, when the Telegram app finally connected. ""We cannot use,"" he said. ""Too easy for the Russians to listen in."" When the invading forces took control of Melitopol a week ago they ransacked the mayor's offices, Federov said, exiling his team to another location where they are attempting to continue running their city. ""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,"" Federov said emphatically. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help."" The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed he is liberating historically Russian lands and speakers from a Nazi regime. But in Melitopol and a string of other mainly-Russian speaking southern and eastern cities, his forces have found themselves treated as occupiers. Russian military vehicles are seen on the street in Kherson, south-eastern Ukraine ""There are protests in Melitopol every day,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, 33, who before the invasion helped run her family business of electronics stores. ""At some point the Russian army started shooting at us and one man got shot but we have not stopped protesting,"" Kovaliova said. ""We are not afraid to protest because we are together. We are afraid to walk alone at night, but we are not afraid to protest."" About 5,000 people gathered in Melitopol's central square on Tuesday, Federov reckoned, despite the shooting last week, which wounded a man in the leg. Videos have surfaced showing protests in occupied and part-occupied cities and towns across the region - Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov. The BBC reached residents and local mayors to try to understand the situation inside. ""I don't know how to count the number of people protesting, I thought it was 2,000 at least,"" said Yunona, a 29-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Kherson. ""One of our friends was beaten and taken by the Russian soldiers and people got so angry they chased the occupiers down the street and took him back."" The Russian troops in Kherson looked young and uncertain, said Olha, a 63-year-old English teacher. ""We go to the protests every day and they are close to us but they look afraid,"" she said. ""We are all just waiting for the Ukrainian army to kick them out."" Berdyansk in the south-east has also seen protestors take to the streets Reports of serious violence against Ukrainian protesters have been limited, for the most part Russian forces seem to be tensely watching. But some local mayors were facing a dilemma - how much to encourage their citizens to take to the streets. ""Our people need to protest but they also need to save their lives,"" said Federov, the Melitopol mayor. ""I have asked them - please do not go near the Russian soldiers, go around them."" Vadym Gaev, the mayor of Novopskov, a town near Donbas, told the BBC there had been daily protests but they had stopped three days ago when Russian soldiers shot three protestors - non-fatally - and beat another. Gaev said the Russian troops told an intermediary they had authorisation to shoot protesters, so there should be no more protests. Novopskov appeared to be an example of a strange and uneasy scenario playing out in some parts of Ukraine, where local Ukrainian officials were continuing to function in some form but Russian military forces were in control. In the occupied city of Starobilsk, nearby, mayor Yana Litvinova was also working remotely, she said. ""A new 'administration' has been appointed. The only thing we know is that it is going around government buildings and asking people to co-operate, and they are refusing."" This video can not be played President Zelensky: We will not give up, and we will not lose Gaev and his team left town when Russia seized Novopskov, in order to keep his administration running - a move he said had divided residents, some of whom accused him of a betrayal while others said they were grateful he was still able to work. Two residents of Kherson told the BBC they thought the mayor there had betrayed the city by co-operating with Russian forces - an accusation circulating in Telegram chat groups. Two others said he was simply doing what he could to ensure the city kept running. The mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhayev, told the BBC: ""If I had betrayed the city would I still be here? I am in the office every day, working with my team to keep things running."" The priority was to restart food production and get people back to work, Kolykhayev said. ""We are running out of food and there is no aid coming in, it's just not happening,"" he said. ""So we are telling everyone in the city: make any food you can make, manufacture anything you can manufacture."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground SYMBOL:Why has 'Z' become a Russian pro-war sign? RUSSIA MOTHERS:'How do I get my soldier son back?' EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Most residents who spoke to the BBC from the occupied cities said food was fast running out. ""Shops are almost empty. You can buy the things that are left but very few things are left,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, the electronics shop owner from Melitopol. ""Pharmacies are empty and my mother can't buy her heart medicine."" Kovaliova said that two Russian trucks with humanitarian markings came into the city centre last week and attempted to hand out food, but they also brought a film crew. Nearly everyone refused, she said. ""Later we saw on it on TV. Russia has taken over the TV towers here so we only have one Russian channel being shown now and it was showing people taking the food and saying how thankful they are to the Russian humanitarian convoy."" Maxim, a 22-year-old piano teacher in the city, also described the supposed humanitarian convoy. ""They were filming and people said actors arrived to take the food,"" he said. Yunona, the IT worker in Kherson, said she saw the same thing there, and Ukrainian media reported on the phenomenon in Berdyansk. Ivan Federov, the mayor of Melitopol, said he had heard about these 'humanitarian convoys' too. But there were ""no real Russian trucks and no real Russian food,"" he said. ""They could open humanitarian corridors at any time to allow food and medicine in, but they do not want to. We know, we have tried."" On Tuesday afternoon, as usual, Federov put out his daily Facebook update, appealing to anyone in the city who could afford it to pay their utility bills and congratulating Ukraine's women on International Women's Day. ""I'm sure the war will end soon and we will celebrate all our holidays in a peaceful, Ukrainian Melitopol,"" he said. Svitlana Libet contributed to this report Are you in Ukraine? Is your family?

"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich sanctioned by UK government Abramovich assets frozen but Premier League club can operate under special licence; proposed sale halted Chelsea club shop must close, no more match tickets can be sold Get involved #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply). Harry De Cosemo, Tom Mallows and Luke Reddy Well, that's it for our dedicated coverage on Chelsea and Roman Abramovich. There will be more news and updates on ourfootball section.Here's a round-up of some key points:  READ MORE on the Abramovich sanctions here Under Abramovich's ownership, the club have won every major trophy possible - including the Champions League twice, both the Premier League and FA Cup five times, the Europa League twice and the League Cup three times. In February, they won their first Club World Cup. They have also won the Women's Super League title four times, the Women's FA Cup on three occasions and picked up the Women's League Cup twice in the past eight years. Pat NevinFormer Chelsea winger on BBC World Football Podcast The vast majority of big-name players will not be overly concerned. They will get a contract somewhere else if the club cannot continue to pay them what they pay them. They'll be disappointed but are they shaking in their boots? No. They may lose players who will be out of contract this summer. Players will panic the day the wages don't arrive in the account. We will see if that happens. Pat NevinFormer Chelsea winger on BBC World Football podcast Once you start digging down into what this could do - yes they can play their games but will they even be able? It's not hyperbole to say the future of the club is in serious danger. You are in different circumstances now. Sanctions can mean a few things and be updated by the government of the day. people who tell you they know exactly what will happen, don't believe them, because they don't know. I can't say 'everything will be ok'. There is a valuable asset there long term. It would be stupid for the government to drive it into administration or liquidation. That doesn't make any sense. I've listened to Chelsea fans online. It's ranged from people railing saying it's the end of their world to 'hey wasn't it a great ride'. I think the club will survive. Will it look the same after all this is over, no I don't think that will be the case.  Chelsea's men's teamtravel to Norwich tonight, kick off at Carrow Road is at 19:30 GMT. They also travel to Lille for the Champions League last 16 second leg next week (all times GMT).  Chelsea Womenare also in action this evening. They travel to West Ham in the WSL with kick off at 19:45. They also take on Birmingham in the Women's FA Cup quarter-final later this month. Pat NevinFormer Chelsea winger on BBC World Football Podcast You can have a full recovery. Say if you sell it to another businessman or conglomerate, that's fine. If they get lucky they could co on very well. I wrote a piece for the Chelsea website last week saying Abramovich has one more job to do, sell the club. He shouldn't sell it to the biggest offer but the best offer, to the right people. The website didn't cut any of it. It all went through but that sticks with you, it is going to have to be sold, whether by Abramovich or anyone else.  The temptation will be to sell it to the biggest bidder if it is government owned within these sanctions. As a Chelsea fan you want it sold to someone you can trust to take it forward. Pat NevinFormer Chelsea winger on BBC World Football Podcast It is quite shocking for any Chelsea fan out there, all around the world. We are in unchartered water. The usual caveat - it's only football and what is happening in Ukraine is more important. But the football side, what will happen to the club now? No one knows. I can tell you something, it's very serious. I heard someone say recently the wage bill is Â£28m a week. Where will you get that if you can't trade? If this carries on for a period of time, it's strange looking to see how the club is viable in its current form. It's minute-to-minute and I can promise you now, that club doesn't know what is going to happen today, tomorrow or in a couple of days time. Chelsea Chelsea began the season as one of the favourites for the Premier League, but currently find themselves in third place 16 points behind leaders Manchester City, albeit with games in hand. They have already lifted two trophies this season, though.A 1-0 victoryover Brazilian side Palmeiras last month secured the Club World Cup and meant the Blues have now won every possible trophy under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. They won the Uefa Super Cup in August. The London club missed out on another trophy a fortnight ago when they suffered apenalty shootout defeatto Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley. Thomas Tuchel's side hold a 2-0 lead over Lille going into their last 16 second leg in France next week. They then take on Championship side Middlesbrough in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on 19 March. Alistair MagowanBBC Sport Buying Chelsea is still of interest to more than 10 parties
despite owner Roman Abramovich being sanctioned. It is understood that although the news took many investors by
surprise and there is confusion about what happens next, there is still plenty
of desire to purchase the club. There is also confusion from those close to negotiations about the
potential of a future Chelsea sale where none of the proceeds go to the Russian
billionaire. The UK government is open to considering a further
addition to the special licence to allow a sale to proceed. Those working on the deal on behalf of Abramovich were always told
that proceeds from the sale would go to a war fund for victims of the war in
Ukraine. This was made clear when Abramovich put the club up for sale last
week. It is understood that the Â£1.5bn loan from Abramovich will not be
deducted from the price. Abramovich had instructed American investment firm Raine Group to
seek Â£3bn for the club, but finance experts believe that an already inflated
price could drop further given the current uncertainty around Chelsea. In case you missed it earlier, this is what Chelsea have said after the UK government announced sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich: Chelsea Football Club has been
advised that its owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK
Government. By virtue of his
100 per cent ownership of Chelsea FC plc and affiliated entities, Chelsea FC
would normally be subject to the same sanctions regime as Mr Abramovich.
However, the UK Government has issued a general licence that permits Chelsea FC
to continue certain activities.
We will fulfil our menâs and womenâs team fixtures today against Norwich and
West Ham, respectively, and intend to engage in discussions with the UK
Government regarding the scope of the licence. This will include seeking
permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the club to operate
as normal as possible. We will also be seeking guidance from the UK Government
on the impact of these measures on the Chelsea Foundation and its important
work in our communities.
The club will update further when it is appropriate. Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground Chelsea announced that tickets willnot go on sale for the FA Cup game at Middlesbrough,externalnext week, as expected. Under the terms of the licence, no new tickets can be bought. Season ticket holders can attend home matches. Crystal Palace Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira has been speaking ahead of his side's clash with Manchester City on Monday. He was asked about Chelsea, Roman Abramovich and his on-loan midfielder Conor Gallager. ""Like everyone else. I donât know if
itâs surprising or not. Obviously the shock, what will be the consequences be?
I donât know. I donât want to go into detail or comment more as I donât know
much more about it. ""Something you canât take away is the
impact on the Premier League and the success [Abramovich] had with Chelsea."" On Gallagher:""We didnât talk about it at all. His
focus is to finish the season well and finish as well as he started. We spoke
this morning about the tactical approach and the game we have on Monday. We
always said we will sit down at the end of the season with Chelsea and Conor
and see what will be next.""   Simon StoneBBC Sport In the wake of the sanctions taken by the Government against Roman Abramovich, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is bound to be asked about non-football matters at Carrow Road tonight. Pep Guardiola was in the same situation with Manchester City and its Financial Fair Play issues and has also spoken about Catalan indepedence in the past, in addition to the coronavirus outbreak and the invasion of Ukraine. He acknowledges managers have to cover a wide range of topics and need to understand their clubs. ""During COVID-19 we are asked to
talk like doctors,"" he said. ""We are the face of the club, we are here every three days and you ask whatever you want, talking about subjects we donât know and we donât have an hour to
have a lesson. ""I can talk about my club, but itâs difficult talking about other
situations, like the one at Chelsea. I canât be in the position at Chelsea, it
must be uncomfortable."" Simon StoneBBC Sport Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has just done his press conference looking ahead to his side's Premier League trip to Crystal Palace on Monday. Naturally, he was asked about Chelsea. Guardiola said he didn't feel as though he had enough information to offer an opinion. However, he does feel some sympathy for Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel. ""It is a difficult position
for Thomas Tuchel and the players,"" said Guardiola. ""Itâs uncomfortable."" Here's a round-up of some key points:  READ MORE on the Abramovich sanctions here Laura ScottBBC Sport senior news reporter BBC Sport understands Chelsea feel there are a number of sticking points in
the licence, and the club will be seeking a number of amendments to allow it to
continue operating normally. Itâs
understood these relate to the Â£20k travel costs and Â£500k home match hosting
costs. The club is still working out what the ramifications of the
licence will be. Lucy
Powell MP, Labourâs Shadow Culture Secretary,commenting on the implications for
Chelsea FC and English football of sanctioning Roman Abramovich, said: âWeâve long
called for tough sanctions on those linked to the Putin regime including
Abramovich. Football clubs are vital cultural and community assets and this
will clearly have a huge impact on Chelsea. The government must set out how it
is working with the Premier League to protect the future of the club. âThe government needs to bring forward the
recommendations in the fan led review of football, including the fit and proper
persons test, so fans and communities can have confidence that the game isn't
just a toy for oligarchs.â Simon StoneBBC Sport Brentford have halted sales of tickets for their Premier
League away game at Chelsea on 2 April. The Bees have been allocated 3,000 tickets for the match at
Stamford Bridge. They have already sold a first batch of tickets and a
further number were due to go back on sale at 14:00 GMT today. However, given the uncertainty around the sales process now
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned, Brentford are seeking
clarification about the selling the remainder. Brentford say they have a contractual commitment to sell all
3,000 tickets and âwill do everything in our powerâ to make sure they are
distributed. BBC Radio 5 Live Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries confirmed the government could alter the terms of the licence to allow Chelsea to be sold. ""So we could apply for
a special licence for Chelsea to be sold, but Roman Abramovich cannot benefit
from the proceeds of that sale,"" she said. Asked how long the sanctions could last, Dorries added: ""That I canât answer.â BBC Radio 5 Live Here is more from Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries on how the government has attempted to sanction Roman Abramovich while still protecting English football. âIf it sells tickets and it sells merchandise,
Abramovich who owns the club, will benefit. That canât happen. Our focus
was on protecting the club and the national game, and the fans, that was our
focus and we think weâve done that by the licence measures that weâve put in
place.â Asked about the negative impact the sanctions could have on Chelsea's revenues, Dorries added: âWell sanctions have consequences and thatâs a fact. âAbramovich has links to Putin
who is mounting a barbaric and evil attack against the people of Ukraine. This
government, we in this department, stand with the people of Ukraine. ""As Iâve
said, Iâm afraid sanctions have consequences. Abramovichâs actions have
consequences too.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999917
"The UK, EU, and US governments have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with devastating sanctions against the billionaire businessmen perceived to be in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. Mr Putin has warned his allies for many years they should protect themselves against such measures, particularly as relations soured with the US and EU countries after the annexation of Crimea. But while some of those closest to him took his advice and remained invested in Russia, others kept their money in palatial properties overseas and football clubs, and their companies remained listed on foreign stock exchanges. They now find themselves scrambling to hold on to their assets amid the most comprehensive economic penalties imposed in the modern era. Here's what we know about some of them. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Said to be one of Mr Putin's favourite oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov is also one of the richest, worth an estimated $17.6bn, according toForbes,external. A former professional fencer, the EU describes him as a ""businessman-official"" who helps the president solve his business problems. Born in Uzbekistan while it was still part of the Soviet Union, he runs USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate that involves mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. TheEU announced sanctions against him,externalon 28 February, and theUS,externalandUK,externalhave followed suit. He has called the sanctions unfair and said all the allegations against him were false. Igor Sechin, left, with Vladimir Putin in 2017 USM Holdings appears to be hoping to avoid EU sanctions as he owns just under 50% of the shares. His superyacht Dilbar, named after his mother, is undergoing a refit in Hamburg and is at risk of being seized. In the UK, his main visible investments are in property. In London he owns Beechwood House, a Â£65m country house with grounds in the heart of the city, and just outside London in Surrey, he owns a Tudor mansion, Sutton Place. Both have been frozen by UK authorities. His business partner Farhad Moshiri owns Everton, and Mr Usmanov's companies USM, MegaFon and Yota have been key sponsors at the club, with suggestions his involvement was even closer. Everton suspended the sponsorship deal last week, and Mr Moshiri quit as a USM board member. SANCTIONED BY: UK, EU One of the most high-profile Russian billionaires because of the phenomenal success of his football club Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich was sanctioned later than some others, possibly because he is less obviously influential than other Putin allies. How influential he is in the Kremlin is much debated. Some suggest he is merely tolerated by Mr Putin, butthe UK believes the two are close,externaland that Mr Abramovich has made money out of the relationship, being awarded lucrative contracts for the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, for example. Mr Abramovich strongly denies having close ties to Mr Putin or the Kremlin, butÂ the UK portion ofÂ hisÂ estimated $12.4bn fortuneÂ isÂ now frozen. Just before the UK sanctions were announced, he put Chelsea up for sale for Â£3bn. His Â£150m house in London's Kensington Palace Gardens in London was also reportedly up for sale. Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s and was one of the original oligarchs during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. His biggest break was buying the oil company Sibneft at a knockdown price. His assets include the third-longest yacht in the world, Eclipse, which recently left the British Virgin Isles, heading east across the Atlantic. His otherÂ mega-yacht, Solaris, is in the Mediterranean. He had started to withdraw from the UK in recent years. In 2018 he decided not to apply to renew his UK visa, and has instead been using his newly acquired Israeli passport to visit London. And while he used to go to every Chelsea home game, in recent years he was rarely seen at Stamford Bridge - and now he is banned from entering the UK. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK When President Putin came to power, Oleg Deripaska was immensely rich, his wealth peaking at about $28bn - but he is now thought to be worth a mere$3bn,external. Oleg Deripaska, right, with Mr Putin in 2017 He fought his way to a fortune in the 1990s, coming out on top in a vicious battle for the aluminium industry. The US said he was involved in money laundering, bribery, extortion and racketeering, and reported allegations that he had ""ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group"". He denies the allegations. He suffered badly in the 2008 financial crisis and needed Mr Putin to bail him out. In 2009, President Putin humiliated him by suggesting publicly that he had stolen a pen. Since then, he seems to have worked himself back into favour and was described in the Mueller report - a US investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election - as being ""closely aligned"" with the president. When it announced its sanctions, the UK also described him as closely associated with Mr Putin. He founded a green energy and metals company, En+ Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but  reduced his stake in it to below 50% when he was subjected toUS sanctions in 2018,external. At the time, one of Mr Deripaska's companies, Basic Element, released a statement calling the sanctions ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd"". He owns a vast art deco property, Hamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey, which he has been trying to sell for Â£18m but has now been taken off the market. He also owns a yacht, Clio, which was recently seen in the Maldives. Unlike many sanctioned oligarchs Mr Deripaska has been vocal about his view on the war, taking to social media to call for peace. ""Negotiations need to start as soon as possible!"" he wrote. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Igor Sechin's connections to Vladimir Putin run long and deep, according to the EU which announced sanctions against himon 28 February,external. He is said to be one of Mr Putin's most trusted and closest advisors, as well as a personal friend, and the two are thought to be in daily contact. His progress was made through ruthlessly pushing aside opponents - his nickname in the Russian press is Darth Vader. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 described him as ""so shadowy that it was joked he may not actually exist but rather was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman, invented by the Kremlin to instil fear"". The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014, which he called ""totally unjustified and illegal"". They announced newsanctions against him on 24 February,external. Mr Sechin has spent his career alternating between jobs in politics and business, sometimes holding senior jobs in both at the same time. When Putin was prime minister, he was a deputy prime minister, and now runs the state oil giant Rosneft. Mr Sechin worked with Mr Putin in the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s, and is widely believed to have been in the much-feared intelligence service, the KGB, although has never openly admitted it. Based in Russia, no-one knows how much money Mr Sechin has, but the French have seized a yacht called Amore Vero that was linked to him after his second wife Olga Sechina kept posting photographs of herself on board. They have since divorced. Beyond that there is little sign he has substantial wealth overseas that could be easily uncovered, and it may be hard to track down and freeze any more of his assets. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK Alexey Miller is another old friend of Vladimir Putin's. Something of a grey man, he too has built his career on loyalty to the president, starting when he was Mr Putin's deputy on the foreign relations committee of the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. Alexey Miller, right, with Mr Putin in February this year He has run the immensely powerful state-owned gas company Gazprom since 2001, but it was a surprise appointment and it is widely assumed that he is just carrying out the orders of his old boss. The US ambassador to Moscow in 2009 described Gazprom as ""inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt"". Mr Miller was not sanctioned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but when he wasadded to the list in the US in 2018,external, he said he was proud. ""Not being included in the first list. I even had some doubts - maybe something is wrong? But I am finally included. This means we are doing everything right,"" he said. He does not appear to have easily traceable assets outside Russia and there is no information about his net worth. SANCTIONED BY: EU, UK The EU describes Pyotr Aven (pictured on the left) as one of President Putin's closest oligarchs, and Mikhail Fridman as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. Together the two men created Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. The Mueller report said Mr Aven met with Putin in the Kremlin about four times a year, saying he ""understood any suggestions or critiques Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow through"". They were warned by Mr Putin in 2016 to protect their interests from future sanctions. This week the pair stood down from the London-headquartered LetterOne investment group they founded almost 10 years ago because their shares werefrozen by EU sanctions on 28 February,external. Mr Aven also stood down as a trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The two businessmen said they would ""contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them"". Mr Fridman, thought to be wortharound $12bn,external, lives in London in a house next to Lord's Cricket Ground and also owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, that he paid Â£65m for in 2016. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"" but would not criticise the Kremlin directly saying to do so could put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of employees at risk.

"Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He isone of seven oligarchs to be hit with fresh sanctions,external, including asset freezes and travel bans. The list also includes billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska, both seen as allies of Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""there can be no safe havens"" for those who have supported the invasion. Live: Latest developments in Ukraine war Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Chelsea FC cannot sell any more tickets for games, its merchandise shop will be closed, and it will be unable to buy or sell players on the transfer market. The government said it would issue a special licence that allows fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches. Ministers have come under pressure to sanction Mr Abramovich, whosaid he had made the ""difficult decision"" to sell Chelsea FCearlier this month. The football club is among the assets frozen as part of the sanctions against Mr Abramovich and its sale has now been stalled. Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016 But the BBC understands the government would consider allowing Mr Abramovich to apply for a special licence to sell the club, providing he can prove he would not benefit from the sale. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. The government says Mr Abramovich, who has an estimated net worth of Â£9.4bn, is ""one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin"". Mr Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for Â£9.87bn in 2005. He is believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than Â£150m. While the sanctions against him throw Chelsea's future in doubt, ministers sought to reassure the club it would not be ""unnecessarily harmed"". In a tweet,external, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said holding those who have ""enabled the Putin regime to account"" was the priority. Tuchel criticises fans' Abramovich chants Abramovich says he will sell Chelsea Abramovich sanctions halt Chelsea sale ""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,"" she wrote. When asked if being unable to sell tickets and merchandise would hit Chelsea's finances, the culture secretary said: ""Sanctions have consequences and that's a fact."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed support for the government's actions but said Chelsea fans were ""completely innocent"" and that it was important to ensure the club was not ""sold off in a fire sale"". This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game"" Telecommunications company Three, said it would temporarily suspend its sponsorship of the club and would ""request the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice"". Chelsea has enjoyed major success since Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 for Â£140m, winning major titles including the Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup. The club's fans were heard chanting Mr Abramovich's name during a match against Norwich on Thursday evening. Mr Abramovich has previously said that proceeds of the club's sale would be donated to victims of war. On Wednesday, there were 20 credible interested parties looking at a potential Chelsea takeover, includingBritish businessman Nick Candy. Analysis from BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Like all the Russian billionaires who still run businesses in their motherland, Roman Abramovich has had to remain on good terms with President Putin, even though he no longer spends much time in the country. This is what led to him being sanctioned, with the UK government saying he is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who had has a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. One example given of that is the contracts he received in the run up to the FIFA 2018 World Cup. More specifically on Ukraine and the Russian army, the UK government claims one of Mr Abramovich's companies, Evraz Plc, may ""potentially"" have been involved in providing steel which ""may have been used in the production of tanks"". It is probably now too late for Roman Abramovich to recover his position and he may find himself being sanctioned by the US and the EU as well. Like many Russian businessmen he is now likely to turn to China. The UK and its western allies have been ratcheting up sanctions against individuals and companies linked to President Putin since the invasion of Ukraine was launched on 24 February. The government said Thursday's sanctions against ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"" were part of the UK's ""efforts to isolate Putin and those around him"". Among those sanctioned wasOleg Deripaska, a leading industrialist who has had links with British politicians. Once one of the richest men linked to President Putin, Mr Deripaska made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries, including EN+ Group, and has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK. Media reports have named Mr Deripaska as the owner of a property on Belgrave Square, one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods. His net worth is now an estimated Â£2bn, according to the Foreign Office, and he has beensubject to US sanctions since 2018,external. Unlike other Russian oligarchs, who have remained silent on the war in Ukraine so far, Mr Deripaska has called for ""peace as soon as possible""in a tweet,external. Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Igor Sechinis another wealthy businessman who is said to have deep ties to President Putin. Named Putin's right-hand man by the UK, Mr Sechin worked with the president when he was mayor in St Petersburg in the 1990s. Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company, and has been sanctioned by the US and EU. In its statement,external, the government said the four others sanctioned included: Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB bank. He ""has long supported Kremlin objectives"" through the bank, which has already been sanctioned by the UK Alexei Miller, CEO of energy company Gazprom. An ally of Mr Putin from his St Petersburg days, he is ""one of the most important executives supporting the Russian government"" Nikolai Tokarev, president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft, He served with Mr Putin as a KGB officer in Dresden in East Germany in the 1980s and the pair have ""remained closely associated ever since"" Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of the board of directors of Bank Rossiya. Sanctioned by the UK, IS ""widely considered to be the Kremlin's private bank"" The UK has now sanctioned 18 oligarchs since the invasion of Ukraine began, a Downing Street spokesperson said. In addition to President Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and four Belarusian generals, 23 high-profile Russian oligarchs were now on the UK's sanctions list, the spokesperson said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government had targeted the oligarchs to ""ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine"". She said: ""With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression. ""The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the sanctions were the ""right decision"" but ""should not have taken the government weeks"". ""Too few oligarchs linked to Putin's rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government,"" Mr Lammy said. The government has been accused of moving slower than western allies the US and the EU in its sanctioning of individuals linked to President Putin. The government'sEconomic Crime Bill, which is expected to become law later this month, is designed to harden and quicken these sanctions. The government says the bill will also stop wealthy Russians using the City of London for money laundering and hiding gains linked to organised crime.

White House officials hosted a private Zoom briefing for about 30 influential TikTok creators to keep them informed of the latest US messaging regarding Ukraine, according to the Washington Post. The briefing was conducted by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and National Security Council adviser Matt Miller. Several of the social media stars have since gone on to post about Ukraine. The topic included the US ""strategic goals in the region"", according to the Post, such as how the US would respond to a Russian nuclear escalation and how US aid dollars are being spent to help Ukraine. TikTok has been widely embraced by the Biden administration as a way to reach younger Americans who get much of their news from social media. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Olha Svyripa was woken up at 05:30 on 24 February to what she described as ""the warmest hug I ever had from my husband"". ""He said 'please wake up, it's begun'."" Two hours later, she was crammed into a small van with her husband, her best friend and four strangers, to begin what turned into an 18-hour journey from Kyiv to the relative safety of Rivne, in the west of Ukraine. ""We packed the most important stuff - documents, laptops, chargers. My husband filled my backpack with books and said: 'It might be heavy but will protect you in case of shelling'."" Olha's laptop was important because she, like many Ukrainians, wanted to carry on working despite the complete upheaval of her life and the dreadful circumstances she found herself in. Read more about Olha's story here. File photo: An estimated 2.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Russian invasion on 24 February Guatemala has received its first arrivals on Friday of Ukrainian refugees, according to a Reuters report. Eight Ukrainians were the first to arrive in the Central American country for ""humanitarian reasons"". A further 10 Ukrainians were expected to arrive later in the day, Reuters quoted officials as saying. It is unclear how many may have arrived privately to Guatemala since the Russian attacks onUkraine began. Guatemala announced its decision to throw open its doors to Ukrainian war refugees on 6 March, when President Alejandro Giammattei said they would be ""assured refuge"" in the country. It is now slightly past 06:00 in Kyiv, and air raid sirens have blared across more than 15 regions and multiple cities in Ukraine, BBC Ukrainian has reported. They have sounded in the capital Kyiv, along with key cities like Odesa in the south, Sumy in the north, Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south-east. The aftermath of shelling in Sumy More humanitarian corridors have been agreed for the embattled northeastern city of Sumy on Saturday morning, said Sumy Regional Military Administration Dmitry Zhyvytsky in a post on Telegram. According to Zhyvytsky, evacuation efforts starting at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) will see vehicles departing from six destinations around the region. All of the convoys are headed to the central city of Poltava, and are expected to arrive between 13:00 to 14:00. As Ukraine enters its 17th day under Russian invasion, Nato has said that it will be sending troops to Norway on Monday 14 March. Some 30,000 troops, 200 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 nations are expected to take part in the Cold Response 2022 exercise, the largest exercise involving Nato troops this year. Starting on 14 March, the manoeuvres will enable western nations to hone their combat skills in Norway's cold climate, including in the Arctic, on the ground, at sea and in the skies. The exercise will be held a few hundred kilometres from the Russian border. While it was planned long before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, it now has added significance because of the war. Norway's Defence Minister Odd Roger Enoksen said: ""This exercise is extremely important for the security of Norway and its allies. We will practice an allied reinforcement of Norway"". The exercise is expected to come to an end on 1 April. With fierce fighting in cities along Ukraineâs south coast, the key city of Odesa is preparing its defences. Russian landing craft have been seen off the coast, and several aircraft have been reportedly shot down. Odesa is seen as an important target, both strategic and symbolic. The BBC has obtained footage of the volunteers preparing to defend the city, just 50km (30 miles) from the border with Moldova. This video can not be played Ukraine: Preparing to defend Odesa The Chernobyl power plant, photographed three days after the 1986 meltdown Ukraine has told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that technicians have begun efforts to restore the external power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said the site currently occupied by Russian troops was taken off the power grid. They later claimed that the Russians were preparing a ""terrorist attack"" that had been thwarted. Ukraine told the IAEA, the UN's nuclear energy watchdog, that work on Thursday evening successfully prepared one section, but that failures persist due to damage in other places. The agency said the work was continuing ""despite the difficult situation outside"" the former Soviet power plant, the site of a nuclear disaster in 1986. Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, is now firmly in the sights of the Russian army. Moscow's troops invaded from the nearby Crimea peninsula and have had more success in taking territory in this region than Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine. And now reports from the city indicate that Russian forces have started to shell the city again. As the Russians work their way west towards the city people are starting to flee and the hospitals are filling with the injured. But Anastasia has decided to stay, sending her one-year-old daughter and her mother away to safety. ""I'm a mum of my baby. But I have to help because I know how to do it,"" the former army captain told the BBC. Ukrainian forces have, for more than a week now, defended the city. But Governor Vitaliy Kim warns this is not a time to celebrate prematurely. ""We are winning this fight, but not this war,"" he says. Read more about the defence of Mykolaiv here.  Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has said his country could host negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Bulgarian media quoted President Radev saying that ""Bulgaria can legitmately claim to be a place for such talks, but this should be done in coordination with the European Union."" Radev added: ""We are members of the EU and we should strive for a unified European solution, a unified European approach."" On Friday, UK Minister of State for Europe and North America James Cleverly was in Bulgaria to discuss with his counterparts the crisis in Ukraine. Cleverly said the UK and Bulgaria - as Nato allies - oppose Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine. He added that Bulgaria was ""one of the first countries to close its skies to Russian aeroplanes"". Photos taken by Reuters apparently show a drone that has been rigged to drop petrol-filled bottles onto invading Russian troops. The four-blade device was apparently developed by the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces. Its use comes about two weeks after the government called for private owners to donate their drones to be outfitted for military purposes. It's unclear how the petrol in the Molotov cocktail bottle of Chernihivske beer - seen in the photo - is meant to be ignited. But the pictures show that as it falls, the bottle stays upright, in an apparent effort to keep the liquid from pouring out as it drops onto its target. Read more about Molotov cocktails in Ukrainehere The bottle stays upright after being released by the drone Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign.

The deputy prime minister said that shelling had prevented evacuations from Mariupol, where a maternity hospital was bombed this week, and the capital Kyiv. But she said some planned evacuations had been successful, including 1,000 people who were escorted from the village of Vorzel in the Kyiv region. Vereshchuk said that there will be a further attempt to evacuate people from Mariupol on Saturday. ""Tomorrow we will do it again in front of the whole world"", she said. She added a humanitarian cargo should be delivered to Mariupol, and on the way back people will have the opportunity of being evacuated. Several attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol failed earlier this week after agreements for temporary pauses in fighting were broken. Ukrainian families are grieving the deaths of the country's fallen soldiers. The bodies of the first victims of the Ukraine-Russia war are being laid to rest. The BBC's Fergal Keane reports. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ukrainians grieve for their fallen soldiers In the last half hour, air raid sirens have gone off in the capital city and in Zhytomyr, to its west, warning residents to seek shelter underground. Reporters on the ground in Kyiv report heavy shelling currently being heard. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine as the Russian invasion enters its 17th day.  Civilians living near the Zaporizhzhia plant have fled to other parts of Ukraine The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom, said Russian officials have tried to enter and take full control of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom's chief, Petro Kotin, said Russian forces had told Ukrainian staff at the plant that it now belonged to Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear company. In a televised interview, Kotin said 10 officials from Rosatom - including two senior engineers - unsuccessfully attempted to enter the plant and take control of operations. He added: ""On the territory [of the plant] there are around 500 Russian soldiers with automatic weapons â¦ our staff are in an extremely bad psychological state."" Kotin said on Friday that the radioactive material at the Chernobyl nuclear plant is still safely housed in storage, but warned that the plant remains disconnected from IAEA monitoring systems. The head of Instagram says that Russia's decision to block the social media platform means that tens of millions of Russians will on Monday lose access to the site and app. ""On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia,"" tweeted Adam Mosseri. ""This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong."" Russia made the move on Friday after Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said that it would temporarily suspend its own rules to allow for violent threats against Russian troops. Meta's head of global affairs said earlier today that the company's changes on speech in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will only apply in Ukraine itself and were temporary.

The image of heavily-pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied as she descended rubble-strewn steps, was widely shared amid outrage at the attack, which killed three people. She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika. Mariana became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Mariana was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. Read more about Mariana's story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Richard Gnodde said the company remained committed to its London head office Goldman Sachs has said it will close its operations in Russia, becoming the first Wall Street bank to pull out of the country in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Money transfer giant Western Union has also said it will suspend operations in Russia and Belarus. The firms join a rush of global brands halting operations in Russia. Earlier on Thursday, the owner of Uniqlo made a U-turn and decided to suspend operations in the country. Operating in Moscow has been increasingly difficult for Western financial institutions and other firms amid international sanctions against Russia. More than 330 firms have withdrawn or significantly curtailed operations in the country in recent days, according to Yale researchers, who have been tracking the corporate response. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs said it would be ""winding down"" its business in Russia rather than leaving immediately. The bank said it was doing so ""in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements"". At the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs' total credit exposure in Russia was $650m (Â£496m). Later Thursday, fellow Wall Street giant JP Morgan Chase also said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"", with activities focused on taking care of staff and helping global clients manage risk and close out obligations. Meanwhile Western Union said it ""stands with the world in condemning the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine"". ""Ultimately, in light of the ongoing tragic impact of Russia's prolonged assault on Ukraine, we have arrived at the decision to suspend our operations in Russia and Belarus,"" the company said. The action is a further blow to flows of money in Russia. Western Union provides international money transfer and payments services in more than 200 countries and 130 currencies. In an interview with the BBC published today, Ukrainain Central Bank Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko had called on Western Union to ""cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks."" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Earlier on Thursday, Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing said it had decided to change its stance on continuing trading in Russia. It said it was faced with ""operational challenges"" due to the ""worsening of the conflict situation"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week it had said it would keep its Russian shops open, saying that clothing is a ""necessity of life"". But in its latest statement, it said Uniqlo could ""no longer proceed"" in Russia. ""Uniqlo has made everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia,"" it said. ""However, we have recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation. For this reason, we will temporarily suspend our operations."" Why the world is waging economic war on Russia Ukraine war is economic catastrophe, warns World Bank Among the latest wave of companies to call a halt to trading or pull back from investing in Russia, Rio Tinto became the first major mining company to cut ties with Russian businesses, while Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles. The world's biggest insurance broker, New York-listed Marsh McLennan, also announced it would exit Russia on Thursday. Ownership of its Russian businesses will be transferred to local management that will be independently operated, the group said. Japanese firm Hitachi said it wouldstop exports and cease most operations,externalin Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar moves by US companies such as Caterpillar. ""We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,"" a Hitachi spokesperson said. Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorovhad been urging the suspension,external. Entertainment giant Sony, which had already stopped releasing films in Russia, suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. McDonald's said on Tuesday,externalthat it wouldtemporarily close its 847 Russian outlets. The fast food giant has said that the move, which includes continuing to pay its 62,000 staff and restaurant employees in Russia, will cost about $50m (Â£38m) a month. ""This is a really challenging and complex situation for a global company like us,"" said chief financial officer Kevin Ozan. A number of other US food retailers, including Starbucks, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co, have said they will stop some or all business in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Meanwhile Burger King has suspended all of its corporate support, marketing and investment in Russia. But as its Russian outlets are fully franchised, many will remain open as they are managed by local franchisees. On Thursday, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported that the Russian government had put together a list of about 60 foreign companies that could be nationalised in response to the suspension of operations. It said firms including Apple, Ikea, Microsoft, IBM, Shell, McDonald's, Porsche, Toyota and H&M could have their accounts and assets seized, and ""external management"" brought in,BBC News Moscow producer Will Vernon said.,external It is unclear how the nationalised companies would be able to sell the products associated with those firms. In response to Western sanctions,Russia has imposed export bans on a string of productsuntil the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. Meanwhile in the UK, the CBI business lobby group called for government support as Western economies cope with the repercussions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The CBI said it ""fully supports"" the sanctions that have been placed on Russia ""despite their cost"". But its director general Tony Danker said the UK government must help businesses cope with the fallout such as rising energy costs and inflation as well as any impact on investment. He said the UK and other countries ""now need to confront the economic consequences of unwinding from Russia"". The CBI wants the government to ""fast-track progress on some of the big policy issues and help firms invest"". Mr Danker called for an acceleration of renewable energy and government support on energy bills, especially for energy intensive industries. He also asked for the UK government ""to stand behind domestic oil and gas in our energy transition"" while the country should also ""identify new trading partners"" for minerals and other commodities, and enhance cyber security.

"The largest private suppliers of children's homes and foster care places in England, Wales and Scotland make excessive profits, says a watchdog. The UK has ""sleepwalked"" into a system where some vulnerable children do not get good care, says a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report. However, private providers say some of their services can cost less than their council equivalents. The CMA study into children's social care was launched a year ago. It found large private sector providers of fostering services and children's homes appeared to be making higher profits in England and Wales than would be expected in a well-functioning market. This suggests councils are paying more than they should, particularly for fostering, the report found. The researchers found prices and profits of the largest private providers were materially higher than would be expected if the market was working well. Data on 15 large providers from 2016 to 2020 showed steady operating profit margins averaging 22.6%, and costs rising from Â£2,977 to Â£3,830 over the period, says the report. Overall there is a shortage of appropriate places for looked-after children, leading to some not getting the care they need, being placed far from schools and friends or separated from their siblings, says the CMA. The authors are particularly concerned about the financial stability of some children's homes in England and Wales which are financed through private equity firms with high levels of debt. ""It is important to manage the risk of children's homes providers going bust and local authorities having to pick up the pieces,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. The report also recommends a warning system to assess the financial health of the hardest to replace private providers, and greater efforts to bring foster care in-house. It notes that the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales are already moving away from the model of for-profit provision in children's social care. The CMA says a well-functioning market should generate returns to investors of up to 6%, but the largest children's home providers make about double that. Forensic accountant Vivek Kotecha, of the Balanced Economy Project, has done similar research and says such excess profits would be better spent by councils on more services for children. ""It could have paid for better staff wages, or it could have just funded more children who need care, or at the borderline of potentially needing care or extra help. So I think it affects children, the ones in care, but it also affects the ones who could be in care or need to be in care, but aren't receiving it."" However, in a briefing paper issued ahead of the report, the Independent Children's Homes Association says the high costs highlighted are outliers which do not reflect those in the sector generally, where profits are more modest. The association quotes University of Kent research suggesting that private provision, particularly for children with complex needs, is often cheaper than that provided by councils. The BBC spoke to Hampshire County Council's assistant director of children's services Suzanne Smith, who runs the team which finds foster care or children's home places for young people who can no longer remain with their families. The team struggles to find suitable placements, the costs keep growing and they feel there is more picking and choosing by independent providers about which child they will take. Hampshire County Council has eight of its own children's homes, which cost more than Â£3,000 a week per child. But the council says independent providers can charge anywhere between Â£3,500 a week to more than Â£10,000 for each child, depending on the complexity of their needs. Unlike in council homes, children can sometimes be asked to leave private homes with only a few hours' notice. ""Unfortunately, it drives towards profit generation as opposed to the outcomes for the child,"" says Ms Smith. ""What we'd really like to see is a diverse market where you've got providers who can make profit, but those profits are reasonable, and then shared accountability around the outcomes for the children."" Londoner Kim Emenike, 24, who went into foster care at seven when her mum died of cancer, says she too often felt like a pay cheque rather than a human being. By the time she was 13, Kim says the relationship with the foster family had broken down, with little support or love, while the council did the bare minimum. ""It's like a tick box exercise,"" she said. Kim Emenike says she had little support or love from her foster family However, Kim stayed with them for another five years, fearing a shortage of foster places would mean she could be sent out of the area, away from friends and school. She felt she was with her foster family just ""because someone wants to get paid"" and it was cost-effective for the council to keep her there. Kim wants to see the care system reformed to be less profit-driven. ""I'm just someone who needed someone to care, someone to love me and someone to just be my cheerleader. ""You've got to do it because you have the heart for it - not because you get paid for it."" The Department for Education said an ongoingindependent review of children's social carewould address radical reform of the system. An official said the department was also ""taking forward urgent reforms to address pressures in social care"", including Â£259m to help councils provide high quality safe homes for the most vulnerable children.

"Waitrose stopped using disposable cups in 2018 A return of Waitrose's popular free coffee for loyalty card members will be trialled in some stores. The free hot drink for members of the myWaitrose scheme was scrapped at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. But boss Dame Sharon White told the BBC's Amol Rajan she was looking at potential ways to bring it back. It comes as John Lewis restored its annual staff bonus after sales bounced back in 2021, but it warned customers would see higher prices this year. Dame Sharon told the Amol Rajan Interviews: ""Coffee we're actually looking at because one of the things we haven't been able to do with Covid is actually is to have the coffee offer. ""So we're going to be experimenting in a few stores how we do that safely."" The free beverages were originally collected by customers using self-service machines and disposable cups.But in 2018 Waitrose asked customers to bring their own reusable cups. Dame Sharon, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said a previous offer of a free newspaper had ended. But it would be replaced with personalised offers such as a voucher or access to new products, she said. Supermarkets remove Russian vodka from shelves John Lewis ends 'Never Knowingly Undersold' pledge John Lewisscrapped staff bonuses last year for the first time since 1953after seeing heavy losses in the pandemic. But they're back after John Lewis sales hit a record Â£4.9bn and Waitrose revenues rose 1% to Â£7.5bn. The retailer will now give its around 80,000 staff a bonus of 3% this year, equivalent to one-and-a-half weeks' pay, and increase wages by 2%. This is on top of a pledge to paythe real living wage. Dame Sharon said the Ukraine conflict and rising inflation meant passing some price rises on to customers was unavoidable. She told the PA news agency: ""As far as we can, we're trying to absorb the cost pressures... not all of these pressures are absorbable. ""The cost of living pressures are real - real for our partners and customers and we're doing everything we can in our power to try to limit the impact."" Meanwhile, rival Marks & Spencer has announced its chief executive will step down after six years in the role. Steve Rowe, who joined M&S aged 15, will leave his full time job on 5 July but has agreed to stay on as an adviser to the new leadership for up to 12 months. A statement from the company,externalcredited Mr Rowe with reviving M&S food and doubling clothing and home online sales. Company chairman Archie Norman said Mr Rowe had lived and breathed M&S and put his heart and soul into the job. ""He will be much missed and goes with our huge affection and best wishes,"" he said. Mr Rowe said: ""A piece of my heart will always remain with the M&S family... I'm proud that I am leaving a very strong team who will lead it into the next growth phase. I wish them every success."" John Lewis executive director Pippa Wicks said price rises at department stores had so far been ""small"" and only affected certain products, but did not specify which. James Bailey, executive director at Waitrose, said it had also put up some prices as food inflation ran at 3-4% across the UK. Even before the war in Ukraine, the cost of living in the UK was rising at its fastest rate in 30 years as fuel and energy bills soared. But the conflict is worsening inflation, prompting warnings the UKfaces its biggest income squeeze in nearly 50 years. John Lewis said sales at its department stores had climbed 8% in the 12 months to 29 January, and its losses shrank to Â£26m from Â£517m in the previous year, when lockdown closures rocked its business. Dame Sharon said the group had made a ""good start"" to a tough five-year restructuring plan but warned it was ""only one year through"". Even before the pandemic the retailer had been hit hard by the shift to online shopping, and last year announced store closures and almost 2,500 job cuts. John Lewis Partnership boss Dame Sharon White Since then, the group has been trying to bolster it business by investing more in John Lewis shops and online shopping, and cutting costs elsewhere. ""Looking ahead, we see continued uncertainty from global events, affecting the economic environment, our customers, partners and society. As inflation and energy prices rise, our customers face higher living costs. ""While this creates uncertainties as we look ahead, we remain focused on investing significantly in our Partnership Plan to transform and grow our business."" The group, which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain, recently said it would ditch its ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" promise to customers, which began in 1925. The pledge means the retailer matches prices on branded products with national retailers, but not online-only sales. However, John Lewis said it was becoming less relevant as shopping moved increasingly online. The group has also said it will remove any products made in Russia from Waitrose and John Lewis in response to the conflict in Ukraine.

"With fuel prices in Northern Ireland hitting record-breaking levels, car-reliant businesses and their employees are feeling the pressures. Prices have soared sincethe Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday diesel was most expensive in Craigavon where it has hit 186.9p per litre, according to data collected the Consumer Council. Some filling stations in Belfast and Carrickfergus have reportedly run out of diesel. Meanwhile, the highest petrol price was found in Londonderry at 170.9p per litre. In parts of Northern Ireland there is evidence some petrol stations offering the lowest prices have also struggled to meet demand. It is believed customers are filling their tanks with cheaper fuel in anticipation of further rises. Motorists in the Republic of Ireland have been queuing at some petrol stations asa cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel came into effect. One fuel retailer said motorists from Northern Ireland were crossing the border to take advantage of the cuts, which has seen his prices fall by nearly 15 cents. But in Omeath, County Louth, another town near the border, it has remained quiet despite a similar fall in fuel prices. Fuel prices in other places near the border have remained mixed with stations offering higher and lower prices. ""We have to wait until Saturday before we can buy a load at the lower price,"" fuel retailer Terry Hughes said. ""It's going to take until then before we see the price reductions appear because everybody has a certain amount of stock in their tanks at the higher duty price."" In Northern Ireland, business owners have been speaking to BBC News NI about their concerns around fuel prices. Emily Magrath runs Caremark Belfast and North Down, which has 400 staff caring for about 700 vulnerable people. Her staff rely on being able to drive between patients' homes to provide that care. Mrs Magrath said: ""(A typical client like) Mrs Jones could need four calls a day, seven days a week, so if a care worker is doing morning, lunch and tea, they could be going to nine or 10 houses, three times a day. ""We're all making decisions at the minute not to turn our heating on or to use public transport but care workers can't do that, because Mrs Jones has been contracted four calls a day, seven days a week, so a care worker can't just decide they won't call with her."" For care workers, higher outgoings means less change in their pockets. Mrs Magrath explained: ""Our staff are paid a higher rate of pay, their mileage is included in their pay, but with higher fuel costs, there'll be less take home pay. ""One of our staff has recommended an app which tells the lowest petrol price in the area that they're working in."" Mrs Magrath says many have left the sector altogether. ""A rise in petrol prices is on top of the challenges that we're facing in terms of Covid - staff recruitment, getting staff into the sector, and in terms of staff retention, unfortunately staff have left this sector, and really good staff, because they've been so burnt out by what Covid has brought."" In a bid to retain staff, Caremark has made some changes to how staff operate. ""We're looking at all our runs and making sure they're really geographically close together so we wouldn't have care workers travelling from Bangor to Newtownards, we'd keep everyone in the same town,"" Mrs Magrath said. ""We've also started walking runs, so we've looked at runs that can be walked around, we're encouraging staff not to take their cars and to walk, and we're doing more of that in the coming weeks."" Christine Chambers runs a mobile nail and beauty business in Greater Belfast. She told BBC News NI that due to the increase in fuel prices, she is paying almost double for diesel than she normally would have, to travel to all of her clients. ""I've noticed a massive difference in diesel prices,"" Ms Chambers said. ""Some days I could be going from Crumlin Road to Lisburn and then to Rathcoole, and I do try to fix the appointments to one particular area but sometimes I can't. ""From the increase, now I'm thinking 'is it worth my while going that far? Am I going to have to refuse some clients and keep it more local?' ""Because I'll end up working for pennies or turning clients away."" Ms Chambers said she had considered putting her prices up but feels people are already struggling financially since the pandemic and due to the soaring cost of living. ""Before the pandemic I had regular customers who visited me every two weeks but now it's every four, because it's not want any more, it's a luxury,"" she said. ""If things keep going this way I'm going to have to start asking people to travel to me and I know I'd lose customers. ""A lot of my clients are elderly, don't drive, or they're single mums trying to manage. ""So I would lose 80% of my income and I could end up having to close my doors, which I don't want to happen."" Driving instructors who use their vehicles almost daily are having to fill their cars with fuel more often Oliver Quinn, a driving instructor from County Tyrone, says like many others, it is costing a lot more to fill the tank in his car.

"Richard Gnodde said the company remained committed to its London head office Goldman Sachs has said it will close its operations in Russia, becoming the first Wall Street bank to pull out of the country in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Money transfer giant Western Union has also said it will suspend operations in Russia and Belarus. The firms join a rush of global brands halting operations in Russia. Earlier on Thursday, the owner of Uniqlo made a U-turn and decided to suspend operations in the country. Operating in Moscow has been increasingly difficult for Western financial institutions and other firms amid international sanctions against Russia. More than 330 firms have withdrawn or significantly curtailed operations in the country in recent days, according to Yale researchers, who have been tracking the corporate response. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs said it would be ""winding down"" its business in Russia rather than leaving immediately. The bank said it was doing so ""in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements"". At the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs' total credit exposure in Russia was $650m (Â£496m). Later Thursday, fellow Wall Street giant JP Morgan Chase also said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"", with activities focused on taking care of staff and helping global clients manage risk and close out obligations. Meanwhile Western Union said it ""stands with the world in condemning the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine"". ""Ultimately, in light of the ongoing tragic impact of Russia's prolonged assault on Ukraine, we have arrived at the decision to suspend our operations in Russia and Belarus,"" the company said. The action is a further blow to flows of money in Russia. Western Union provides international money transfer and payments services in more than 200 countries and 130 currencies. In an interview with the BBC published today, Ukrainain Central Bank Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko had called on Western Union to ""cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks."" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Earlier on Thursday, Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing said it had decided to change its stance on continuing trading in Russia. It said it was faced with ""operational challenges"" due to the ""worsening of the conflict situation"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week it had said it would keep its Russian shops open, saying that clothing is a ""necessity of life"". But in its latest statement, it said Uniqlo could ""no longer proceed"" in Russia. ""Uniqlo has made everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia,"" it said. ""However, we have recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation. For this reason, we will temporarily suspend our operations."" Why the world is waging economic war on Russia Ukraine war is economic catastrophe, warns World Bank Among the latest wave of companies to call a halt to trading or pull back from investing in Russia, Rio Tinto became the first major mining company to cut ties with Russian businesses, while Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of gaming consoles. The world's biggest insurance broker, New York-listed Marsh McLennan, also announced it would exit Russia on Thursday. Ownership of its Russian businesses will be transferred to local management that will be independently operated, the group said. Japanese firm Hitachi said it wouldstop exports and cease most operations,externalin Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar moves by US companies such as Caterpillar. ""We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,"" a Hitachi spokesperson said. Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorovhad been urging the suspension,external. Entertainment giant Sony, which had already stopped releasing films in Russia, suspended the launch of racing game ""Gran Turismo 7"". Food companies Nestle, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have halted investment in Russia, but said they would continue providing essentials. McDonald's said on Tuesday,externalthat it wouldtemporarily close its 847 Russian outlets. The fast food giant has said that the move, which includes continuing to pay its 62,000 staff and restaurant employees in Russia, will cost about $50m (Â£38m) a month. ""This is a really challenging and complex situation for a global company like us,"" said chief financial officer Kevin Ozan. A number of other US food retailers, including Starbucks, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co, have said they will stop some or all business in Russia following the Ukraine invasion. Meanwhile Burger King has suspended all of its corporate support, marketing and investment in Russia. But as its Russian outlets are fully franchised, many will remain open as they are managed by local franchisees. On Thursday, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported that the Russian government had put together a list of about 60 foreign companies that could be nationalised in response to the suspension of operations. It said firms including Apple, Ikea, Microsoft, IBM, Shell, McDonald's, Porsche, Toyota and H&M could have their accounts and assets seized, and ""external management"" brought in,BBC News Moscow producer Will Vernon said.,external It is unclear how the nationalised companies would be able to sell the products associated with those firms. In response to Western sanctions,Russia has imposed export bans on a string of productsuntil the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. Meanwhile in the UK, the CBI business lobby group called for government support as Western economies cope with the repercussions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The CBI said it ""fully supports"" the sanctions that have been placed on Russia ""despite their cost"". But its director general Tony Danker said the UK government must help businesses cope with the fallout such as rising energy costs and inflation as well as any impact on investment. He said the UK and other countries ""now need to confront the economic consequences of unwinding from Russia"". The CBI wants the government to ""fast-track progress on some of the big policy issues and help firms invest"". Mr Danker called for an acceleration of renewable energy and government support on energy bills, especially for energy intensive industries. He also asked for the UK government ""to stand behind domestic oil and gas in our energy transition"" while the country should also ""identify new trading partners"" for minerals and other commodities, and enhance cyber security.

"Russia has banned exports of auto equipment Russia has hit back at western sanctions for invading Ukraine by imposing export bans on a string of products until the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. The economy ministry said further measures could include restricting foreign ships from Russian ports. It said: ""These measures are a logical response to those imposed on Russia."" The ministry added that the bans on countries that have ""committed unfriendly actions"" were ""aimed at ensuring uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the economy"". The export ban includes more than 200 products. The measures will last until the end of the year. Western governments have imposed a string of sanctions on Russia, notably on buying oil, and against billionaire oligarchs seen as close to President Vladimir Putin. About 48 countries will be affected, including the US and in the EU. The order said that export exemptions can be made for Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and for members of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the ban would include exports of goods made by foreign companies operating in Russia. Items include cars, railway carriages, and containers. It comes as Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev warned that assets owned by western companies that have pulled out of Russia could be nationalised. Firms have been leaving en masse or halting investment, including industrial and mining giants such as Caterpillar and Rio Tinto, Starbucks, Sony, Unilever and Goldman Sachs. On Wednesday, Moscow approved legislation that took the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country. And in a statement on Thursday Mr Medvedev said: ""The Russian government is already working on measures, which include bankruptcy and nationalisation of the property of foreign organisations. ""Foreign companies should understand that returning to our market will be difficult."" He accused foreign investors of creating ""panic"" for ordinary Russians who could now lose their livelihoods. According to the most recent figures, Russia is the UK's nineteenth largest trading partner, with trade between the two nations totalling Â£15.9bn over a year from the end of September 2020. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It's an impressive-sounding list, but how much harm will these counter-sanctions actually cause? The bulk of what western nations buy from Russia is made up of raw materials. Oil and gas, of course, but also metals like aluminium and nickel, not to mention potash and phosphates, widely used in fertilisers. The conflict has already pushed the prices of these goods sharply upwards, amid fears supplies could be disrupted - and if they remain high, that will cause economic pain, particularly in Europe. But a ban on the sale of railway cars and locomotives from Russia is unlikely to cause much hardship. Nor will restrictions on the sale of agricultural machinery, for example. These products are exported - but mainly to countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan. The inclusion of vehicles on the list is a problem for the likes of Stellantis - the owner of Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen. It had been planning to export vans made in Russia to Europe and other parts of the world. But overall, the impact of the counter-sanctions looks more symbolic than significant. Restrictions on exports of raw materials on the other hand - if Russia were to introduce them - could have a much more dramatic effect. After Britain banned Russian-operated ships from its ports last week a retaliatory proposal to restrict foreign ships from entering Russian ports could also come into force. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that there would be ""negative consequences"" for the world's food markets due to the West's sanctions because Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers. ""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said.

"This has, on nearly all measures, been the most difficult winter for the NHS in a generation. Services have been overhauled, but patients have still had to wait longer for treatment and care has suffered as a result. Can we expect the pressures to start easing soon? Dr Wesley Vernon still needs more surgery Retired doctor Wesley Vernon was told he needed to have cataract surgery on both his eyes in late 2019. Combined with his Parkinson's disease, his failing eyesight was having a major impact on his day-to-day life. But before he could get treated, the NHS cancelled all routine treatments to cope with the first wave of Covid. By the time services resumed in late spring 2020 a huge backlog had started building and he found himself pushed further and further back on the waiting list. His eyesight worsened and he started to have falls and accidents. He finally had the first cataract done last October - after two years of waiting - but has still not had his other eye operated on. He is now desperate. ""I want to make the most of the time I have before my Parkinson's get worse."" Dr Vernon's story is not unique. More than 6 million people in England are on a waiting list for hospital treatment - that's one in nine of the population. Over 300,000 of them have waited over a year as the NHS has struggled to cope with the demands of dealing with Covid alongside its normal workload. Since the start of the pandemic, nearly 750,000 patients with Covid have been admitted to hospital. At points, the number of admissions has been four times higher than what would normally be seen for all types of respiratory illnesses combined. It has put huge strain on the service. Even this winter - with the Omicron wave proving milder than many feared - the numbers were still double. As a result, hospitals have seen waiting times deteriorate across the board - not just for non-urgent work like cataracts. Wherever you look, delays worsened - in A&E, across ambulances services and in cancer care too. Performance in recent months has been at its worst level since modern-day targets were introduced in the early 2000s. Although it is fair to say the last decade has been a story of declining performance, winter coupled with the complications of Covid has exacerbated that trend. This is not unique to England. As has been documented by the BBC's NHS Tracker project, other parts of the UK have been struggling too.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department.

Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020. If you can't see the look-up, click here. Perhaps one of the clearest examples of how the system has struggled can be seen with what is happening when patients need to get admitted to a ward. These are the sickest patients, but instead of being found a bed quickly, increasing numbers have spent hours waiting on trolleys and in cubicles because there is no spaces on the wards. This puts patients at risk. Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Katherine Henderson says staff have been finding it ""harder and harder"" to look after patients. ""There is a shortage of beds which is leading to delays and dangerous crowding. Every metric shows performance continues to deteriorate. With no light at the end of the tunnel, morale is very low."" There are many complex factors that are playing a role in this - staff shortages, a lack of care in the community, which means patients discharge from hospital is delayed, and the fact that running hospitals has become more difficult because of the infection control measures needed to combat Covid. To cope, the NHS has overhauled services. Hospital sites have been reconfigured and the way services work has been overhauled. Covid-free sites have been set up and planned surgery moved to different locations. One model being increasingly used is surgery hubs, whereby hospitals share resources. This has been pioneered by a number of areas, including Epsom Hospital in Surrey. It acts as a regional hub for orthopaedic treatments, such as hip and knee surgery, for south west London and the nearby suburbs. Staff from other hospitals work at the hub and patients come from all over the region to get their treatment. At one point, the hub was operating on patients every day of the week. Other steps are also being taken. For example, follow-up appointments post-surgery are no longer being done in-person routinely and pre-operation assessments are, where possible, done at the same time as a patient is diagnosed, reducing the need for repeat visits. This has proved particularly successful for operations such as cataract surgery, which is normally straightforward and does not require overnight stays. The waiting times in this area of the country are returning to normal. Paul Ursell has helped pioneer changes to the way cataract surgery is organised Ophthalmic surgeon Paul Ursell says: ""We've broken down some of those barriers - we've had to. Waiting for treatments such as cataract surgery has a huge effect on people - they can get depressed, they are more likely to fall, they stop going out and lose their confidence."" The success Epsom has had offers hope to Dr Vernon and others that as the model gets adopted elsewhere the backlogs will be tackled. It is a huge challenge that will take time though. Ministers have warned the numbers waiting for treatmentare likely to grow before they start falling. It could be March 2023 before the trend reverses, they have warned. Winter maybe ending, but for the NHS the hard work continues. Data analysis by Christine Jeavans and additional reporting by Chloe Hayward How many cases are there in your area?

"Oil prices rose on Thursday amid confusion over whether major producers would help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia. The United Arab Emirates had appeared to push members of the Opec producer group to raise output, only for the UAE's energy minister to quash hopes. The oil price rose more than 5%, after a 17% fall on Wednesday. ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement,"" said analyst Stephen Innes. US President Joe Biden and other leaders have pledged to try to ease the price pressures for households. Officials from the US have been in talks with oil producers aimed at boosting supply. ""We favour production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaibasaid in a statement,externaltweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington. But the energy minister Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said later that the Gulf state remained committed to the existing Opec monthly output agreement, which fixes how much crude is produced by member countries. Oil prices have jumped more than 30% since 24 February, touching $139 (Â£105) a barrel at one point this week.  The oil price had fallen back to about $106 a barrel at one point on Wednesday, but by Thursday morning it was trading at around $116. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? On Tuesday, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck issued an ""urgent appeal"" to Opec oil producers to increase output ""to create relief on the market"". Saudi Arabia-led Opec and an extended group of oil producers called Opec+ - which includes Russia - have agreed to avoid a price war and keep control over the market. Mr Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, said: ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement as we are in an unprecedented situation."" Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said: ""We think it will be challenging for Opec+ to boost production in this environment."" Worries about oil and gas supplies have led to soaring domestic heating bills and fuel prices at the pump. Both petrol and diesel prices hit new records in the UK on Wednesday, according to the RAC motoring group. Unleaded petrol was 159.57p a litre on average, while diesel was 167.37p. By Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent Despite the mixed messages coming out from the UAE, there is a broad consensus within Opec+ that there is no immediate need to boost oil production faster. So, even if the UAE tries to convince other members to increase production during the next meeting, it will be difficult to find many backers. While Abu Dhabi is a prominent member of Opec+, Riyadh and Moscow are the leaders of the pack and they are the ones who call the shots. Any decision to increase supplies will essentially boil down to Saudi Arabia. While the UAE is keen to increase production, it is very unlikely that it will break ranks and pump more oil unilaterally.  Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have maintained a neutral stance during the course of this war, and the former would be unwilling to take any decision related to Opec+ that the Russians would oppose. Opec+ has attributed the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and maintained that there is no shortage of supplies in the market. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""A tank of petrol is now almost Â£88 while diesel has now gone over Â£92. Diesel unfortunately appears to be on a clear path to Â£1.70 a litre. ""As this is an average price, drivers will be seeing some unbelievably high prices on forecourts as retailers pass on their increased wholesale costs."" Energy prices have been soaring for more than a year amid a rapid rebound in demand for oil, which had collapsed during the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine added new price pressures, as sanctions make it hard for the country - typically the producer of about 7% of global supplies -  to find buyers for its oil. The US and Canada have also announced bans on Russian oil imports, while the UK said it would phase them out by the end of the year. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic national reserves, but that move is not enough to respond to the recent run-up in prices. The agency said on Wednesday that oil reserves may be tapped further. ""If there's a need, if our governments decide so, we can bring more oil to the markets, as one part of the response,"" said IEA chief Faith Birol.

"Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows that ""the era of complacency"" is over, the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned in a speech in Washington DC. Addressing a think tank, Ms Truss said aggression, such as that shown by Vladimir Putin, can never again be allowed to ""grow unchecked"". She also called for more defence spending and an end to dependence on ""hostile and authoritarian states"". The West has reacted to Russia's invasion with a range of sanctions. On Tuesday, the US and UK announced a ban on Russian oil, while the EU said it would end its reliance on Russian gas. The same governments have frozen the assets of wealthy Russians believed to have links with Mr Putin. In a tweet,,externalBoris Johnson said he had spoken to Ukraine's President Zelensky, and that the UK would tighten sanctions to ""impose the maximum economic cost on Russia"" and increase military support to Ukraine. West hits Russia with oil bans and gas curbs Giving the Makins lecture to the Atlantic Council think tank, Ms Truss said countries need to introduce further sanctions - including banning Russia completely from using the international payment system, Swift and freezing all Russian banking assets. She said all countries needed to go further on financing their defence capabilities, arguing that spending 2% of GDP was be a minimum target and that during the Cold War countries were spending upwards of 5%. The foreign secretary also used her speech to argue that the war in Ukraine is  a ""paradigm shift"" comparable with the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States. She urged the West to ""rise to his moment"" by increasing pressure on the Russian president. ""How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era. ""We must start with the principle that the only thing aggressors understand is strengthâ¦ and we must start by working together to stop Putin's offensive in Ukraine."" ""We want a situation where they can't access their funds, they can't clear their payments, their trade can't flow, their ships can't dock and their planes can't land,"" she added. More than two million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia invaded Ukraine Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Ms Truss warned there would be ""terrible implications for European and global security"" if Mr Putin were not stopped in Ukraine. Responding to Ms Truss' comments, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the invasion of Ukraine ""marked the final end of the post-cold war era"". He criticised the Conservatives for ""isolating Britain on the world stage"" and said it was time ""to bring Britain back to the table and deepen ties with our European partners"".

"EU leaders meeting on Thursday in Versailles focused on rethinking defence in Europe and how to move away from Russian energy The opulent Palace of Versailles was designed by the kings of France to impress the outside world, yet by the time of the French Revolution it had turned into a glaring symbol of royal failure. Now EU leaders who are here for a two-day summit hope to project an image of unity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. That's easy when they discuss the big picture. But some details up for debate are clearly divisive amongst member states: such as energy prices impacted by the war, EU common defence plans and the enlargement of the bloc to include Ukraine. Yet the bureaucratic, often bickering behemoth that is the EU has already been transformed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Let's take a step back to get some perspective: Germany is re-booting its military after decades of squeamishness due to the country's role in World War Two The EU has slapped unprecedented financial sanctions on Russia, despite costs to European businesses The EU's Temporary Protection Directive has been used for the first time to help Ukrainian refugees work and live in the bloc- a divisive topic during the 2015 migrant crisis Brussels is buying and supplying weapons for the first time ever to a country at war The Energy Transition - so often put on a backburner by EU countries - promises to be a revolution with new plans to reduce heavy reliance on Russian gas EU outliers Poland and Hungary, in Brussels' bad books for years, are back in the fold as a result of the current crisis Brussels' cooperation and co-ordination with Nato and the US are smoother and closer than they've been in a long time Is this a temporary blip, or are we looking at a Brussels rebirth; an EU 2.0? The EU was already aware - certainly after the 2016 Brexit vote, if not before - that it needed some serious self-improvement. The bloc was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2012 ""for over six decades contributing to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe"". EU member states have sent defensive weapons to Ukraine but face demands for greater support But in the eyes of many Europeans, Brussels became seen as a home for neo-liberalism, rather than liberalism. A promoter of trade deals prioritising big business, and a maker of dirty migrant deals (with Turkey, for example) to keep refugees from reaching EU shores. A bloc that, along with many national governments, was perceived as helping banks instead of families after the 2008 economic crisis. An entity, decades after the Second World War, that had lost its vision, mission and recognition as a force for peace in Europe. Populism, nationalism and illiberalism became familiar faces in European politics, as voters looked for ""a better fit"". EU countries fell out over migration, eurozone reform and more. Conspiracy theories flourished, as trust in Brussels and traditional politicians waned. ""Strongman"" leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orban, Turkey's Recep Erdogan, America's Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin were increasingly admired. Then, in 2020, the Covid pandemic prompted a reset. After an unedifying start, Brussels was perceived as working in the public interest. Member states seemed more united, opinion polls were approving. The EU's Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell, has appealed to EU leaders to display the same drive and resolve shown in face of Covid when dealing with the Russia-Ukraine crisis and resulting challenges. This war on European soil has refocused EU minds as to what the bloc could - or should - stand for. Vladimir Putin's assault on Ukraine is also seen by the EU majority as a geopolitical attack on European security as a whole. But this two-day informal summit could well expose cracks in this new-found EU unity. All EU leaders fret about rising energy costs and the impact back home of Russia sanctions and possible counter sanctions. But they disagree on what to do about it. Some call for an EU-wide solution - that is, new funds from Brussels. Others, like Germany and the Netherlands, say no. Emmanuel Macron is the host of the summit, since France currently holds the rotating EU presidency. He's long been a champion of a stronger, more independent Europe, weaning itself off food, technology and energy imports and building up its own defence force to work alongside Nato. But the prospect of a European Army (under French command) remains an unlikely prospect. Instead, EU countries will discuss better co-ordination and the pooling of military resources... while likely arguing over which nations should win the best contracts. As for migration. two million Ukrainians have already fled the country. Depending on how long the misery and violence continue, many more could arrive in the EU. Diplomats I've spoken to predict that funding, housing and relocating millions across different member states could yet prove difficult, longer term. Right now though, the scenes of suffering and loss in Ukraine mean emotions are running high amongst EU leaders. Their debate over whether Ukraine's application for EU membership can be fast-tracked, as a symbol of solidarity, looks to be the most heated Versailles Palace will witness this week.

"Roman Abramovich has owned Premier League club Chelsea since 2003 Roman Abramovich's attempt to sell Chelsea has been halted after the oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Russianput the European champions up for saleafter thethreat of sanctions was raised in Parliament. The freezing of Abramovich's assets,which include Chelsea, means the club cannot sell further match tickets. The move is intended to stop Abramovich making money from Chelsea. The government has issued a special licence that will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket-holders to attend matches. Chelsea have said they ""intend to engage in discussions"" with the government and will seek amendments to the special licence to ""allow the club to operate as normal as possible"". What do sanctions mean for Chelsea? All your questions answered Watch: The Football News Show - Chelsea special Meanwhile, Chelsea's shirt sponsor, telecommunications company Three, has requested that the Blues ""temporarily suspend"" its deal with the club. Three has asked for ""the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice"". The company added: ""We recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. ""However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do."" Chelsea will be unable to buy or sell players, or offer new contracts, while the sanctions are imposed on Abramovich. Chelsea-owned players who are on loan at other clubs will be able to continue to play for those clubs. The London club's merchandise shop has also been shut. ""Once you start digging down into what this could do - yes, they can play their games but will they even be able [to]?"" former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told the BBC World Football podcast. ""Massive amounts of questions but yes, it's not hyperbole to say the future of the club is in serious danger."" Reaction and analysis to Abramovich's sale of Chelsea being halted Listen: Football Daily podcast on Abramovich sanctions The government is open to considering a further addition to the special licence which will allow the sale of the club. A condition for that to happen would be that Abramovich - one of Russia's richest people who is believed to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin - receives no funds. He has previously said that proceeds of any sale would be donated to victims of war. On Wednesday, there were 20 credible parties looking at a potential Chelsea takeover and interest in buying the club has not been dented, despite Abramovich being sanctioned. However, the American investment firm - Raine Group - handling the sale has temporarily halted their efforts after the shock of the news and the confusion caused by what happens next. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the government is ""committed to protecting"" the club. ""Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities,""she tweeted.,external ""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended."" Dorries later told BBC Sport: ""Abramovich has links to Putin, who is mounting a barbaric and evil attack against the people of Ukraine. ""We in this department stand with the people of Ukraine and I'm afraid sanctions have consequences. Abramovich's actions have consequences too."" This video can not be played The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea? Chelsea are able to pay the wages of all employees, including players and coaching staff They can pay ""reasonable"" costs of travel to and from fixtures but not exceeding Â£20,000 per game per team They can pay ""reasonable"" costs towards hosting home fixtures, not exceeding Â£500,000 per fixture per team Fans who bought season tickets or individual match tickets before 10 March 2022 can attend games Rights-holding broadcasters can broadcast any fixture involving the club The sanctions were imposed on a day that both Chelsea's men's and women's teams were in action, with theBlues winning at Norwich in the Premier League, and alsoat West Ham in the WSL. During Chelsea's 3-1 win at Carrow Road travelling fans chanted Abramovich's name. The Premier League said that it will ""work with the club and the government to ensure the season will proceed as planned and in line with the government's intention"". The Chelsea Supporters' Trust has called for the government ""to minimise the uncertainty"" and to include fans ""in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts"". As a result of the sanctions, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee will hear from Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston, Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham and the Premier League's chief policy and corporate affairs officer Helen MacNamara on Tuesday. Committee chair Julian Knight said the hearing would ""explore issues around the role of Russian money in our national game and will examine the government's approach to financial sanctions targeted at specific individuals and its general policy on sporting sanctions and boycotts"". Knight added: ""This morning's announcement that Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the government and emerging details of the likely effect on one of the country's biggest football clubs illustrates the deep and wide-ranging impact such measures will have on sport in this country."" Since his purchase of the club in 2003, Chelsea have been transformed, setting the template for how much finance was needed to compete at the top end of English football. In total, Abramovich has loaned the club more than Â£1.5bn, which has helped to bring great success. Under Abramovich's ownership, the club have won every major trophy possible - including the Champions League twice, both the Premier League and FA Cup five times, the Europa League twice and the League Cup three times. In February, they won their first Club World Cup. They have also won the Women's Super League title four times, the Women's FA Cup on three occasions and picked up the Women's League Cup twice in the past eight years. Financial journalist Kieran Maguire told the BBC: ""In the short term, it's to a large extent business as usual. Chelsea will be able to pay wages due at the end of March and will have other overheads. ""Chelsea's wage bill is round about Â£28m a month. We don't know how much cash they have in the bank. The most recent accounts we have are from June 2021 when there was Â£16m in the bank. Abramovich has been injecting money into Chelsea on a regular basis over recent years and presumably that won't be able to continue. ""The concern might be what happens if Chelsea's cash reserves are insufficient to pay their wage bill - but presumably the government and Premier League, who have been working on this, will have been looking at it to try to minimise disruption on a club level."" Simon Stone, BBC Sport football reporter There is no template for dealing with this type of situation and football's authorities are scrambling to work out the finer points. For Chelsea, some elements are straightforward - and tricky. They cannot offer new contracts - so the futures of Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and skipper Cesar Azpilicueta are uncertain. The loan of Saul Niguez will not be turned into a permanent deal. Chelsea cannot sell the numerous players they have on loan, including Armando Broja, who has impressed so much at Southampton. Presumably numerous younger players they would have given contracts to now will not get them. But what about the detail? Can Chelsea sell tickets to their own fans for away games given they as a club do not benefit? What will happen to the FA Cup semi-final - if they get there - when receipts are split between clubs? Can Premier League clubs like Brentford - who were part-way through selling their away allocation for their trip to Stamford Bridge on 2 April - still do so, or do they have to stop? And as for the Â£20,000 limit on expenses for away games, Chelsea have matches next week at Lille and Middlesbrough. Both would cost substantially more than Â£20,000. Can individuals make contributions or will Chelsea have to reduce the cost with a less expensive form of accommodation for Thomas Tuchel's side? Clearly, the sale of the club needs to happen quickly if there is not to be a major impact. But that is in the hands of the government. Roman Abramovich's funding meant Chelsea emerged from the financial impact of Covid-19 relatively unaffected - that is unlikely to be the case this time. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game"" BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Like all the Russian billionaires who still run businesses in their motherland, Roman Abramovich has had to remain on good terms with President Putin, even though he no longer spends much time in the country. This is what led to him being sanctioned, with the UK government saying he is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who has had a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. One example given of that is the contracts he received in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. More specifically on Ukraine and the Russian army, the UK government claims one of Mr Abramovich's companies, Evraz Plc, may ""potentially"" have been involved in providing steel which ""may have been used in the production of tanks"".

"Anyone who travels unlawfully to Ukraine for combat will be investigated on their return to the UK, the Foreign office has said Some military veterans have received cold call approaches about fighting in Ukraine, the BBC understands. Private militias have reportedly been scouring social media to recruit ex-soldiers. Ukraine has previously asked for volunteers to join its International Legion. But the Foreign Office has said anyone who travels unlawfully to Ukraine for combat will be investigated on their return to the UK.

""There are private militias who've been scouring social media for veterans, so these private militias have been trying to recruit."" Steve said he believed the offer of money wasn't genuine, but many of the other contacts he'd received were from other veterans looking to organise groups in the UK before travelling to Ukraine. One veteran said he had been offered money to fight in Ukraine ""I did very well on my second tour of Afghanistan and obviously when you're over there you make a lot of contacts,"" he said. ""The more serious guys are trying to organise it here and go as a group of people that are people you've deployed with, served with, people who know each other's skill set."" However, Steve said he was increasingly concerned for the welfare of both veterans and civilian volunteers. ""A lot of guys want to go out and help, but some are jumping on the bandwagon and have no military experience. Some are veterans, but they've never deployed, so they've never been in combat,"" he said.

A Scottish grandfather, Rab Grady (centre), announced he was fighting alongside the Ukrainians on a video he posted online Despite doing his best to warn others of the dangers, Steve said many veterans would be vulnerable to offers, and the constant talk about going to fight had left his own mind racing.

Will you get good weapons systems? Will you get medical care? There are too many moving parts."" A Scottish grandfather, Rab Grady (centre), announced he was fighting alongside the Ukrainians on a video he posted online Despite doing his best to warn others of the dangers, Steve said many veterans would be vulnerable to offers, and the constant talk about going to fight had left his own mind racing. ""I did take myself off down to the beach early hours one morning,"" he said. ""I needed to get some de-sensitisation away from radio, away from social media, and to just think it through. ""If I think with my brain and not emotion then that tells me I've fought - I've been somewhere and done something - and my priority now is my family."" Don't go to Ukraine, military boss tells Britons Army vet takes medical supplies to Poland border BBC Wales Live has heard from veteran support staff concerned that more vulnerable members of the community could be tempted by approaches. Mark, not his real name, is an agricultural worker with no military experience. But he feels he can contribute to Ukraine's war effort. ""I've spoken to a few people, but not many,"" the 26-year-old said. ""They've all been telling me not to go, that I'm a bit crazy for wanting to go and there are different ways to help, but it feels like the best way to help is by being on the ground. ""I'm ready to book a flight, I've just got bits and bobs to get now and then I'll be over there."" An Army surplus store said it had sold stock that would normally take ""years"" to sell Kirsty, who works in an Army surplus store, said it had almost sold out of its entire stock of combat helmets and vests. ""We've had people ringing up with lists, asking can we donate items. Things like helmets, plate carriers, any proper military protective gear,"" she said. ""We're a very small business, the things people want, we can't just give them away."" Robert McCartney, from charity Beyond the Battlefield, said he'd heard of veterans approaching each other about going out to Ukraine. ""Social media is full of it,"" he said. ""A lot of these guys are saying 'right, I'm on my way - does anybody want to be there?' ""They see themselves as being able to go out there and recreate themselves as soldiers. ""They are approaching the guys who are in responsible positions, who are in relationships."" Mr McCartney raised concerns for some vulnerable veterans. ""One of them came in here last week telling me that he was going on Sunday,"" he said. ""I was able to talk him out of it. He's got an eight-week-old baby and that was his biggest worry, so I was able to play on those worries."" A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""We advise against travel to Ukraine and anyone who travels to conflict zones to engage in unlawful activity, should expect to be investigated upon their return to the UK.""

"Refugees arrive in Poland after fleeing the war in Ukraine The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn) of emergency funding for Ukraine, as it fights against a Russian invasion. It comes as the IMF predicts Ukraine will see a deep recession this year. More than 2m people are estimated to have left the country since the war started two weeks ago. Earlier this week, the World Bank approved a $732m financial package for Ukraine and is planning more economic assistance for the coming months. ""The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,""IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement.,external Ms Georgieva said the money was aimed to meet the country's urgent spending needs and help ease the huge economic impact of the war. ""The tragic loss of life, huge refugee flows, and immense destruction of infrastructure and productive capacity is causing severe human suffering and will lead to a deep recession this year. Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues,"" she added. The funds will be disbursed under IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument. This means it will largely come without conditions that are usually placed on borrower countries. Ukraine bank: Use frozen Russian money to rebuild World Bank approves $723m funding for Ukraine The IMF financing comes on top of a $723m World Bank economic package, which was announced earlier this week. That package was made up of grants and loans, including a $100m pledge from the UK. The World Bank said it was continuing to work on a $3bn package of support for the coming months. It also promised extra help for neighbouring countries that are taking in the estimated 2m refugees - who are mostly women, children and the elderly - fleeing Ukraine.

"Kyrylo Shevchenko, Governor of National Bank of Ukraine, in September 2021 Frozen Russian assets should be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war, the governor of Ukraineâs Central Bank has told the BBC. Kyrylo Shevchenko called for an extensive list of extra sanctions, from cutting card payments to suspending Russian access to the IMF. Every day that sanctions are delayed ""is costing the lives of civilians and children"", he said in an interview. For security reasons, he answered questions sent by email. Mr Shevchenko, governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said that Russia should eventually be made to pay to repair the damage caused during the invasion. âThe need for money will be huge,â he told the BBC. âIt could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries. However a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries.â The government building in Kharkiv, destroyed by Russian missiles. Rebuilding Ukraine will cost billions Much of Russiaâs $630bn of foreign exchange reserves are thought to be held outside the country, and effectively frozen by sanctions in the US, the EU and other places. That would make billions available for reconstruction â if Ukraine is able to access it once the war is over. Extra sanctions Mr Shevchenko welcomed the financial sanctions already imposed by the international community, but said the world should go much further. He called on governments, institutions and companies to impose an extensive list of further financial sanctions, targeting every corner of Russia's economy. He called on: Trading and financial data platforms Refinitiv and Bloomberg to terminate access for Russian and Belarusian clients. US and EU to instruct their banks to sever correspondent relationships with Russian banks. The central banksâ organisation, the Bank for International Settlements, to expel Russia's central bank. The International Monetary Fund to suspend Russia and Belarus from its meetings, block their access to assets issued by the IMF called Special Drawing Rights, âas these funds may be used to finance military action against our country.â Chinaâs UnionPay card payment system (similar to Mastercard and Visa) to stop servicing payment cards issued by Russian banks. Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey and Vietnam to block the Russian payment system, Mir. International money transfer operator Western Union to cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks. âWe already see the effect [of sanctions] on the aggressorâs financial system, but we are still waiting for more to be done. I would like to underline that every day that sanctions are delayed is costing the lives of civilians and children,â Mr Shevchenko said. âThese are the lives of Ukrainians who have chosen the European way and are now defending not only their own country, but also the entire system of values that lies at the core of the Western civilization.â Central bankers normally target inflation. What is clear from the testimony of the Ukraine's version of Andrew Bailey is that in this war they are leaving no stone uncovered in their targeting of the Russian financial system. Every pipeline of cash into the ""aggressor"" has been identified, even as Mr Shevchenko's team tries to keep the cash flowing in the Ukrainian financial system and to its millions of refugees, and even set his country's monetary policy from a bunker. The IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, Western Union, Chinese credit card payment systems, former Soviet nations' use of Russia's payments system, all are the subject of Kyiv's lobbying to subject the Russian financial system to an unprecedented squeeze. Above all, that targeting of Russia's Central Bank, agreed by G7 nations, has disarmed its warchest of foreign exchange reserves and halved the value of the rouble. I asked him if he was worried about the precedent being set here for institutions normally given sovereign immunity. He pauses. ""I can answer from the bottom of my heart. We see that the Central Bank of Russia supports military invasion and thus is also guilty, responsible in deaths of civilians in Ukraine"". Donations Around 11bn hryvnia ($350m, Â£280m) has been paid in to the two special accounts set up by the National Bank of Ukraine to receive donations for the military and for humanitarian causes, Mr Shevchenko told the BBC. The account for the military was set up on 24 February to accept international and local donations in multiple currencies. A similar account for humanitarian purposes was set up on 1 March. Oil embargo Western countries have wrestled with the difficulties of suspending purchases of Russian energy. While the cash Moscow receives for oil and gas exports is a vital lifeline, European governments have decided that they canât live without vital Russian supplies, at least for now. Mr Shevchenko said: âToday we can see that Russia is using its energy resources capacities to put economic pressure on Europe. Energy is also one of the leading narratives in the Russian media. They are using it to misinform the Russian public about the Westâs unwillingness to take tougher measures, out of fear of losing access to Russian oil and gas. Kyrylo Shevchenko, filmed yesterday by NBU staff âWe realise how difficult this decision is for our Western partners. We understand the cost of such a step. But we must work together to find and use all possible tools to stop the killing and the suffering that Russia is increasingly causing in Ukraine.â Keeping going Mr Shevchenko also described some of the challenges of keeping the countryâs financial system running during a war. His staff are working round the clock, he said, many sheltering from bombardment in underground bunkers. But he said electronic payments and ATMs were still working, and cash was being delivered to everywhere but active combat zones. âI can proudly say that Ukrainian banking system remains stable and liquid even under martial law.â âThis is extremely difficult time for every Ukrainian - for the people and the country,â he said. âThe National Bank of Ukraine is doing everything in its power to support Ukraine, its defenders, and the population affected by Russian aggression.â EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas What sanctions could West still impose on Russia?

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a ""huge judgment call"" over whether to borrow more or allow household budgets to be squeezed, new research suggests. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the soaring cost of living and war in Ukraine present fresh challenges ahead of the Spring Statement. Without extra protection, many households will struggle to keep up with bills, it suggests. Inflation rose to its highest level for 30 years last month. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, due to rising energy, fuel and food prices. Inflation, which measures how quickly the cost of living increases over time, is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. As Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine pushes energy costs, fuel and other commodities even higher, the IFS says Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces three big decisions. The first is whether to borrow billions more or allow household incomes to take a bigger hit than at any time since at least the financial crisis. The government has already increased borrowing in recent years to pay for Covid-related measures such as the furlough scheme. Mr Sunak must also weigh whether to allow inflation to impose effective pay cuts on teachers, nurses and other public sector workers - or to spend less than anticipated on other parts of public services, if borrowing is not an option. Public sector workers face an average pay cut of about Â£1,750 once inflation is taken into account, the IFS research says. And as war in Ukraine continues, the chancellor will have to decide whether to allow defence spending to fall over the next three years, or to borrow to boost it. ""At the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak has to make a huge judgment call,"" IFS director Paul Johnson said. ""Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices, which have risen even further in the last two weeks? ""If he doesn't, then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances."" He told the BBC's Today programme that the chancellor will have to borrow ""at least another Â£10bn just to cover half the blow from energy prices"". Mr Johnson warned that rising energy costs look set to continue rather than be a short peak. ""If energy prices are high for three-to-four years, it makes it much harder for the government to support people,"" he said. Rising inflation - which he warned could reach 8% or more this year - is hurting public sector workers. Mr Johnson estimated the Treasury would have to find between Â£1,500-Â£2,000 per worker to make up the impact of inflation on pay. ""They've already suffered big cuts,"" he said. Calls for urgent help over rising household bills Cost of filling diesel family car hits record Â£90 The IFS suggests that if Mr Sunak wants to achieve the same level of protection for households' budgets as he announced earlier this year, he will need to find an extra Â£12bn. While the chancellor might have had little choice in spending billions to protect the economy during the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, Mr Johnson says the chancellor's response to the cost of living crisis will reveal more about how he sees the government's role in protecting consumers from external events. The boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, for example, has said that households are heading for an ""almost inevitable"" rise in energy bills in the autumn. Spikes in wholesale gas prices, which were rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will be passed on to consumers, he warned on Tuesday. A Treasury spokesperson said the government was already providing more than Â£20bn to help people with the cost of living and would continue to monitor the economic impact of the conflict. ""Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine will have a huge impact on lives and livelihoods around the world and the effects will be felt across this country,"" the spokesperson said. ""It is right that we do all we can to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine and work with our allies and partners to impose the most punishing sanctions to inflict maximum and lasting pain on Russia."" The shadow chancellor, Labour MP Rachel Reeves, accused the government of allowing ""the cost of living crisis to spiral out of control since September"". She called on the chancellor to reconsider ""unfair"" National Insurance contributions, which are due to go up in April to fund social care in England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. The Labour party has proposed the introduction of a one-off ""windfall"" tax on oil and gas producers, which would then be used to cut energy costs for consumers.

"Russia has been shelling Ukrainian cities, including Irpin, near the capital Kyiv Russia could be planning a chemical or biological weapon attack in Ukraine - and ""we should all be on the lookout"", the White House has said. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Russia's claims about US biological weapon labs, and chemical weapon development in Ukraine, were preposterous. She called the false claims an ""obvious ploy"" to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked attacks. It comes after Western officials shared similar concerns about fresh attacks. They said they were ""very concerned"" about the risk the war could escalate, and particularly the possibility of Russia using non-conventional weapons. This most likely refers to chemical weapons although the term also covers tactical (small-scale) nuclear weapons, biological weapons and dirty bombs. ""We've got good reason to be concerned,"" said one Western official. They said this was partly because of what had been seen in other places where Russia has been engaged - notably Syria where chemical weapons were used by its allies. Ms Psaki said: ""We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them - it's a clear pattern."" Earlier on Wednesday, the UK Ministry of Defencesaid in a tweet,externalthat Russia had usedthermobaric rocketsin Ukraine. These rockets are also known as vacuum bombs because they suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. This makes them more devastating than conventional explosives of a similar size, and can have a terrible impact on people caught in their blast radius. In a subsequent update, the ministry said it was likely ""experienced mercenaries"" from Russian private military companies associated with the Kremlin were deploying to fight in Ukraine. The update added Russian mercenaries have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Africa and the Middle East, including in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic.

The fears around chemical weapon use were borne from Russian claims potentially ""setting the scene"" for some kind of ""false flag"" claim, Western officials said. In atweet,external, the Russian Embassy referred to claims that ""recently found documents"" showed components of biological weapons were made in Ukrainian laboratories - with funding from the US Department of Defense. The US dismissed the claims, saying it was the ""kind of disinformation operation we've seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries"". Russian officials and media have also claimed in recent days that Ukraine was planning to build a so-called dirty bomb - which disperses radioactive material. Meanwhile Russia's foreign minister has claimed Ukraine had been seeking nuclear weapons. Some believe Moscow is pushing these claims to come up with a justification for its own public about why it invaded Ukraine. But Western officials also fear they could be used as the basis for a ""false flag"" event. For example, Russia could claim any dispersal of non-conventional weapons came from Ukrainian facilities or troops, or they were used first by Ukraine. That could justify, for Moscow, the subsequent use of non-conventional weapons by Russia. The Western official said similar stories had come from Russia before their use in Syria. There were ""other indications as well"", they said - likely referring to some kind of intelligence. ""It's a serious concern for us."" Russia's ally, the Assad government, used chemical weapons in Syria on multiple occasions against civilians. Russia is also accused of using nerve agents - a type of chemical weapon - in attempted assassinations like that ofSergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018and against opposition figureAlexei Navalny in Russia in 2020. The global watchdog that oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention - the OPCW - describesa chemical weapon as a chemical used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.,external Their use is banned under international humanitarian law regardless of a valid military target because their effects are indiscriminate by nature and designed to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.

"Waitrose stopped using disposable cups in 2018 A return of Waitrose's popular free coffee for loyalty card members will be trialled in some stores. The free hot drink for members of the myWaitrose scheme was scrapped at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. But boss Dame Sharon White told the BBC's Amol Rajan she was looking at potential ways to bring it back. It comes as John Lewis restored its annual staff bonus after sales bounced back in 2021, but it warned customers would see higher prices this year. Dame Sharon told the Amol Rajan Interviews: ""Coffee we're actually looking at because one of the things we haven't been able to do with Covid is actually is to have the coffee offer. ""So we're going to be experimenting in a few stores how we do that safely."" The free beverages were originally collected by customers using self-service machines and disposable cups.But in 2018 Waitrose asked customers to bring their own reusable cups. Dame Sharon, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said a previous offer of a free newspaper had ended. But it would be replaced with personalised offers such as a voucher or access to new products, she said. Supermarkets remove Russian vodka from shelves John Lewis ends 'Never Knowingly Undersold' pledge John Lewisscrapped staff bonuses last year for the first time since 1953after seeing heavy losses in the pandemic. But they're back after John Lewis sales hit a record Â£4.9bn and Waitrose revenues rose 1% to Â£7.5bn. The retailer will now give its around 80,000 staff a bonus of 3% this year, equivalent to one-and-a-half weeks' pay, and increase wages by 2%. This is on top of a pledge to paythe real living wage. Dame Sharon said the Ukraine conflict and rising inflation meant passing some price rises on to customers was unavoidable. She told the PA news agency: ""As far as we can, we're trying to absorb the cost pressures... not all of these pressures are absorbable. ""The cost of living pressures are real - real for our partners and customers and we're doing everything we can in our power to try to limit the impact."" Meanwhile, rival Marks & Spencer has announced its chief executive will step down after six years in the role. Steve Rowe, who joined M&S aged 15, will leave his full time job on 5 July but has agreed to stay on as an adviser to the new leadership for up to 12 months. A statement from the company,externalcredited Mr Rowe with reviving M&S food and doubling clothing and home online sales. Company chairman Archie Norman said Mr Rowe had lived and breathed M&S and put his heart and soul into the job. ""He will be much missed and goes with our huge affection and best wishes,"" he said. Mr Rowe said: ""A piece of my heart will always remain with the M&S family... I'm proud that I am leaving a very strong team who will lead it into the next growth phase. I wish them every success."" John Lewis executive director Pippa Wicks said price rises at department stores had so far been ""small"" and only affected certain products, but did not specify which. James Bailey, executive director at Waitrose, said it had also put up some prices as food inflation ran at 3-4% across the UK. Even before the war in Ukraine, the cost of living in the UK was rising at its fastest rate in 30 years as fuel and energy bills soared. But the conflict is worsening inflation, prompting warnings the UKfaces its biggest income squeeze in nearly 50 years. John Lewis said sales at its department stores had climbed 8% in the 12 months to 29 January, and its losses shrank to Â£26m from Â£517m in the previous year, when lockdown closures rocked its business. Dame Sharon said the group had made a ""good start"" to a tough five-year restructuring plan but warned it was ""only one year through"". Even before the pandemic the retailer had been hit hard by the shift to online shopping, and last year announced store closures and almost 2,500 job cuts. John Lewis Partnership boss Dame Sharon White Since then, the group has been trying to bolster it business by investing more in John Lewis shops and online shopping, and cutting costs elsewhere. ""Looking ahead, we see continued uncertainty from global events, affecting the economic environment, our customers, partners and society. As inflation and energy prices rise, our customers face higher living costs. ""While this creates uncertainties as we look ahead, we remain focused on investing significantly in our Partnership Plan to transform and grow our business."" The group, which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain, recently said it would ditch its ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" promise to customers, which began in 1925. The pledge means the retailer matches prices on branded products with national retailers, but not online-only sales. However, John Lewis said it was becoming less relevant as shopping moved increasingly online. The group has also said it will remove any products made in Russia from Waitrose and John Lewis in response to the conflict in Ukraine.

"A series of failures contributed to a rail crash in Aberdeenshire which claimed three lives, an investigation has found. A report said the train hit a landslide near Stonehaven in August 2020 after heavy rain in an area where a drainage system had been incorrectly installed. Investigators also highlighted problems with operational procedures in dealing with the effects of severe weather. Train drivers' union Aslef said it was a ""damning"" report. ""The failures identified are so bad that we believe this must be a watershed moment in the way we ensure the safety of passengers and staff,"" general secretary Mick Whelan added. Driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died when the train derailed on 12 August 2020. Six other people were injured when the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow service hit washed-out debris at Carmont, south of Stonehaven. The train was returning towards Aberdeen due to the railway being blocked further down the line. This video can not be played Animation reconstructs moment of Stonehaven train derailment The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) made 20 safety recommendations in itsreport,externalon the crash. They include better management of civil engineering projects, improved response to extreme rainfall, and better understanding of the additional risk associated with older trains. And they noted that there were only nine people on the train due to pandemic restrictions. ""With normal passenger numbers, the casualty toll would almost certainly have been significantly higher,"" the report said. The train hit debris in heavy rain A drainage system was installed in 2011 and 2012 bynow-collapsed contractor Carillion- but it was not in accordance with the design. Had it been constructed correctly, it was ""highly likely to have safely accommodated the flow of surface water"" on the day of the crash, the report concluded. More than 5cm (2in) of rain fell on the site of the crash between 06:00 and 09:00 - close to the average for the whole of August in this part of Scotland. The train derailed because it struck debris that had washed out of a drainage trench, the report said. It was travelling at about 73mph - below the limit of 75mph. Mr McCullough, the driver, had been told to proceed at normal speed. Derailment driver was told 'normal speed fine' Climate change impact on railways 'accelerating' Three dead after passenger train derails Investigators found no evidence Network Rail carried out any inspection of the upper parts of the drainage system between when it viewed the completed work in 2013 and the accident. They said that, had Network Rail been aware of the differences between the design and the installation, the risk could have been recognised and action taken. The RAIB said it found evidence that the Scotland route control team was under ""severe workload pressure"" on the morning of the crash, due to the volume of weather-related events. The investigation also found that controllers had not been given sufficient guidance or training to enable them to effectively manage complex situations of the type encountered. Although Network Rail had taken some steps towards implementing modern technology to help monitor weather conditions and better inform operational decision makers, its capability had not been ""fully exploited"" before the accident at Carmont. The RAIB concluded that, despite an awareness of the threat, Network Rail had not sufficiently recognised that its existing measures did not fully address the risk from extreme rainfall events. A train built to modern standards would have had design features intended to minimise damage in a collision or derailment. The train involved in the Carmont derailment had been recently refurbished but it was designed and constructed before these standards came into force. It is ""more likely than not"" that there would have been a better outcome to the crash if the train had complied with modern standards, the RAIB concluded. Transport Secretary Jenny Gilruth later told MSPs a steering group had been set up to examine the safety of older trains. Scottish Labour MSP, Neil Bibby, said the Aslef union was calling for high speed train (HST) rolling stock to be phased out by August next year and asked the minister when they would be withdrawn from service. Ms Gilruth said the rail network was currently quite reliant on HSTs, but added: ""We will come to looking at a date in the future which we may be able to remove some of these trains from service."" Donald Dinnie, Christopher Stuchbury and Brett McCullough died Simon French, the chief inspector of rail accidents, said the industry owed it to everyone affected by the tragedy to learn safety lessons for the future. ""It's important for all of us in the rail industry not to dismiss this truly harrowing accident as a one-off event,"" he added. ""The railway industry needs to think through the implications of severe weather on its infrastructure, whilst also looking to the behaviour of trains should they derail after striking obstructions such as washouts and landslips."" Neil Stuchbury, whose father Christopher Stuchbury died in the crash, said the conditions on the day had been ""unusual"" but ""were not at all unforeseen"". ""The tools, know-how, and processes were available to prevent this but were not properly implemented,"" he said. Mr Stuchbury said the report showed that ""a catalogue of errors and oversights"" were responsible for the crash. Relatives of conductor Donald Dinnie added: ""Whilst losing a loved one in these dreadful circumstances has been totally devastating, we also reflect that this accident happened at a time when the early stages of the pandemic saw fewer people travelling."" The derailment happened near Stonehaven in August 2020 ScotRail chief operating officer Ian McConnell said the report was ""very sober reading"". Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said: ""This report makes clear that there are fundamental lessons to be learnt by Network Rail and the wider industry. ""As well as expressing our deep sorrow and regret at the loss of the lives of Christopher Stuchbury, Donald Dinnie and Brett McCullough, it's important that we acknowledge it should not have taken this tragic accident to highlight those lessons. ""We must do better and we are utterly committed to that."" The RMT union called for a safety summit involving governments, Network Rail and operators to ""ensure this type of tragedy can never happen again"". The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: ""A joint investigation into the deaths by Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road is ongoing and once complete will be fully considered. ""The families will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments. ""Our thoughts are with the families of Donald Dinnie, Brett McCullough and Christopher Stuchbury at this time.""

"The largest private suppliers of children's homes and foster care places in England, Wales and Scotland make excessive profits, says a watchdog. The UK has ""sleepwalked"" into a system where some vulnerable children do not get good care, says a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report. However, private providers say some of their services can cost less than their council equivalents. The CMA study into children's social care was launched a year ago. It found large private sector providers of fostering services and children's homes appeared to be making higher profits in England and Wales than would be expected in a well-functioning market. This suggests councils are paying more than they should, particularly for fostering, the report found. The researchers found prices and profits of the largest private providers were materially higher than would be expected if the market was working well. Data on 15 large providers from 2016 to 2020 showed steady operating profit margins averaging 22.6%, and costs rising from Â£2,977 to Â£3,830 over the period, says the report. Overall there is a shortage of appropriate places for looked-after children, leading to some not getting the care they need, being placed far from schools and friends or separated from their siblings, says the CMA. The authors are particularly concerned about the financial stability of some children's homes in England and Wales which are financed through private equity firms with high levels of debt. ""It is important to manage the risk of children's homes providers going bust and local authorities having to pick up the pieces,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. The report also recommends a warning system to assess the financial health of the hardest to replace private providers, and greater efforts to bring foster care in-house. It notes that the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales are already moving away from the model of for-profit provision in children's social care. The CMA says a well-functioning market should generate returns to investors of up to 6%, but the largest children's home providers make about double that. Forensic accountant Vivek Kotecha, of the Balanced Economy Project, has done similar research and says such excess profits would be better spent by councils on more services for children. ""It could have paid for better staff wages, or it could have just funded more children who need care, or at the borderline of potentially needing care or extra help. So I think it affects children, the ones in care, but it also affects the ones who could be in care or need to be in care, but aren't receiving it."" However, in a briefing paper issued ahead of the report, the Independent Children's Homes Association says the high costs highlighted are outliers which do not reflect those in the sector generally, where profits are more modest. The association quotes University of Kent research suggesting that private provision, particularly for children with complex needs, is often cheaper than that provided by councils. The BBC spoke to Hampshire County Council's assistant director of children's services Suzanne Smith, who runs the team which finds foster care or children's home places for young people who can no longer remain with their families. The team struggles to find suitable placements, the costs keep growing and they feel there is more picking and choosing by independent providers about which child they will take. Hampshire County Council has eight of its own children's homes, which cost more than Â£3,000 a week per child. But the council says independent providers can charge anywhere between Â£3,500 a week to more than Â£10,000 for each child, depending on the complexity of their needs. Unlike in council homes, children can sometimes be asked to leave private homes with only a few hours' notice. ""Unfortunately, it drives towards profit generation as opposed to the outcomes for the child,"" says Ms Smith. ""What we'd really like to see is a diverse market where you've got providers who can make profit, but those profits are reasonable, and then shared accountability around the outcomes for the children."" Londoner Kim Emenike, 24, who went into foster care at seven when her mum died of cancer, says she too often felt like a pay cheque rather than a human being. By the time she was 13, Kim says the relationship with the foster family had broken down, with little support or love, while the council did the bare minimum. ""It's like a tick box exercise,"" she said. Kim Emenike says she had little support or love from her foster family However, Kim stayed with them for another five years, fearing a shortage of foster places would mean she could be sent out of the area, away from friends and school. She felt she was with her foster family just ""because someone wants to get paid"" and it was cost-effective for the council to keep her there. Kim wants to see the care system reformed to be less profit-driven. ""I'm just someone who needed someone to care, someone to love me and someone to just be my cheerleader. ""You've got to do it because you have the heart for it - not because you get paid for it."" The Department for Education said an ongoingindependent review of children's social carewould address radical reform of the system. An official said the department was also ""taking forward urgent reforms to address pressures in social care"", including Â£259m to help councils provide high quality safe homes for the most vulnerable children.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a ""huge judgment call"" over whether to borrow more or allow household budgets to be squeezed, new research suggests. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the soaring cost of living and war in Ukraine present fresh challenges ahead of the Spring Statement. Without extra protection, many households will struggle to keep up with bills, it suggests. Inflation rose to its highest level for 30 years last month. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, due to rising energy, fuel and food prices. Inflation, which measures how quickly the cost of living increases over time, is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. As Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine pushes energy costs, fuel and other commodities even higher, the IFS says Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces three big decisions. The first is whether to borrow billions more or allow household incomes to take a bigger hit than at any time since at least the financial crisis. The government has already increased borrowing in recent years to pay for Covid-related measures such as the furlough scheme. Mr Sunak must also weigh whether to allow inflation to impose effective pay cuts on teachers, nurses and other public sector workers - or to spend less than anticipated on other parts of public services, if borrowing is not an option. Public sector workers face an average pay cut of about Â£1,750 once inflation is taken into account, the IFS research says. And as war in Ukraine continues, the chancellor will have to decide whether to allow defence spending to fall over the next three years, or to borrow to boost it. ""At the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak has to make a huge judgment call,"" IFS director Paul Johnson said. ""Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices, which have risen even further in the last two weeks? ""If he doesn't, then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances."" He told the BBC's Today programme that the chancellor will have to borrow ""at least another Â£10bn just to cover half the blow from energy prices"". Mr Johnson warned that rising energy costs look set to continue rather than be a short peak. ""If energy prices are high for three-to-four years, it makes it much harder for the government to support people,"" he said. Rising inflation - which he warned could reach 8% or more this year - is hurting public sector workers. Mr Johnson estimated the Treasury would have to find between Â£1,500-Â£2,000 per worker to make up the impact of inflation on pay. ""They've already suffered big cuts,"" he said. Calls for urgent help over rising household bills Cost of filling diesel family car hits record Â£90 The IFS suggests that if Mr Sunak wants to achieve the same level of protection for households' budgets as he announced earlier this year, he will need to find an extra Â£12bn. While the chancellor might have had little choice in spending billions to protect the economy during the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, Mr Johnson says the chancellor's response to the cost of living crisis will reveal more about how he sees the government's role in protecting consumers from external events. The boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, for example, has said that households are heading for an ""almost inevitable"" rise in energy bills in the autumn. Spikes in wholesale gas prices, which were rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will be passed on to consumers, he warned on Tuesday. A Treasury spokesperson said the government was already providing more than Â£20bn to help people with the cost of living and would continue to monitor the economic impact of the conflict. ""Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine will have a huge impact on lives and livelihoods around the world and the effects will be felt across this country,"" the spokesperson said. ""It is right that we do all we can to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine and work with our allies and partners to impose the most punishing sanctions to inflict maximum and lasting pain on Russia."" The shadow chancellor, Labour MP Rachel Reeves, accused the government of allowing ""the cost of living crisis to spiral out of control since September"". She called on the chancellor to reconsider ""unfair"" National Insurance contributions, which are due to go up in April to fund social care in England and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. The Labour party has proposed the introduction of a one-off ""windfall"" tax on oil and gas producers, which would then be used to cut energy costs for consumers.

"Russia has been shelling Ukrainian cities, including Irpin, near the capital Kyiv Russia could be planning a chemical or biological weapon attack in Ukraine - and ""we should all be on the lookout"", the White House has said. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Russia's claims about US biological weapon labs, and chemical weapon development in Ukraine, were preposterous. She called the false claims an ""obvious ploy"" to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked attacks. It comes after Western officials shared similar concerns about fresh attacks. They said they were ""very concerned"" about the risk the war could escalate, and particularly the possibility of Russia using non-conventional weapons. This most likely refers to chemical weapons although the term also covers tactical (small-scale) nuclear weapons, biological weapons and dirty bombs. ""We've got good reason to be concerned,"" said one Western official. They said this was partly because of what had been seen in other places where Russia has been engaged - notably Syria where chemical weapons were used by its allies. Ms Psaki said: ""We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them - it's a clear pattern."" Earlier on Wednesday, the UK Ministry of Defencesaid in a tweet,externalthat Russia had usedthermobaric rocketsin Ukraine. These rockets are also known as vacuum bombs because they suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. This makes them more devastating than conventional explosives of a similar size, and can have a terrible impact on people caught in their blast radius. In a subsequent update, the ministry said it was likely ""experienced mercenaries"" from Russian private military companies associated with the Kremlin were deploying to fight in Ukraine. The update added Russian mercenaries have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Africa and the Middle East, including in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic.

The fears around chemical weapon use were borne from Russian claims potentially ""setting the scene"" for some kind of ""false flag"" claim, Western officials said. In atweet,external, the Russian Embassy referred to claims that ""recently found documents"" showed components of biological weapons were made in Ukrainian laboratories - with funding from the US Department of Defense. The US dismissed the claims, saying it was the ""kind of disinformation operation we've seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries"". Russian officials and media have also claimed in recent days that Ukraine was planning to build a so-called dirty bomb - which disperses radioactive material. Meanwhile Russia's foreign minister has claimed Ukraine had been seeking nuclear weapons. Some believe Moscow is pushing these claims to come up with a justification for its own public about why it invaded Ukraine. But Western officials also fear they could be used as the basis for a ""false flag"" event. For example, Russia could claim any dispersal of non-conventional weapons came from Ukrainian facilities or troops, or they were used first by Ukraine. That could justify, for Moscow, the subsequent use of non-conventional weapons by Russia. The Western official said similar stories had come from Russia before their use in Syria. There were ""other indications as well"", they said - likely referring to some kind of intelligence. ""It's a serious concern for us."" Russia's ally, the Assad government, used chemical weapons in Syria on multiple occasions against civilians. Russia is also accused of using nerve agents - a type of chemical weapon - in attempted assassinations like that ofSergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018and against opposition figureAlexei Navalny in Russia in 2020. The global watchdog that oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention - the OPCW - describesa chemical weapon as a chemical used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.,external Their use is banned under international humanitarian law regardless of a valid military target because their effects are indiscriminate by nature and designed to cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.

"Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He isone of seven oligarchs to be hit with fresh sanctions,external, including asset freezes and travel bans. The list also includes billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska, both seen as allies of Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""there can be no safe havens"" for those who have supported the invasion. Live: Latest developments in Ukraine war Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Chelsea FC cannot sell any more tickets for games, its merchandise shop will be closed, and it will be unable to buy or sell players on the transfer market.

Ministers have come under pressure to sanction Mr Abramovich, whosaid he had made the ""difficult decision"" to sell Chelsea FCearlier this month. The football club is among the assets frozen as part of the sanctions against Mr Abramovich and its sale has now been stalled. Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016 But the BBC understands the government would consider allowing Mr Abramovich to apply for a special licence to sell the club, providing he can prove he would not benefit from the sale. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. The government says Mr Abramovich, who has an estimated net worth of Â£9.4bn, is ""one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin"". Mr Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for Â£9.87bn in 2005. He is believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than Â£150m. While the sanctions against him throw Chelsea's future in doubt, ministers sought to reassure the club it would not be ""unnecessarily harmed"". In a tweet,external, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said holding those who have ""enabled the Putin regime to account"" was the priority. Tuchel criticises fans' Abramovich chants Abramovich says he will sell Chelsea Abramovich sanctions halt Chelsea sale ""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,"" she wrote. When asked if being unable to sell tickets and merchandise would hit Chelsea's finances, the culture secretary said: ""Sanctions have consequences and that's a fact."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed support for the government's actions but said Chelsea fans were ""completely innocent"" and that it was important to ensure the club was not ""sold off in a fire sale"". This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game"" Telecommunications company Three, said it would temporarily suspend its sponsorship of the club and would ""request the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice"". Chelsea has enjoyed major success since Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 for Â£140m, winning major titles including the Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup. The club's fans were heard chanting Mr Abramovich's name during a match against Norwich on Thursday evening. Mr Abramovich has previously said that proceeds of the club's sale would be donated to victims of war. On Wednesday, there were 20 credible interested parties looking at a potential Chelsea takeover, includingBritish businessman Nick Candy. Analysis from BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Like all the Russian billionaires who still run businesses in their motherland, Roman Abramovich has had to remain on good terms with President Putin, even though he no longer spends much time in the country. This is what led to him being sanctioned, with the UK government saying he is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who had has a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. One example given of that is the contracts he received in the run up to the FIFA 2018 World Cup. More specifically on Ukraine and the Russian army, the UK government claims one of Mr Abramovich's companies, Evraz Plc, may ""potentially"" have been involved in providing steel which ""may have been used in the production of tanks"". It is probably now too late for Roman Abramovich to recover his position and he may find himself being sanctioned by the US and the EU as well. Like many Russian businessmen he is now likely to turn to China. The UK and its western allies have been ratcheting up sanctions against individuals and companies linked to President Putin since the invasion of Ukraine was launched on 24 February. The government said Thursday's sanctions against ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"" were part of the UK's ""efforts to isolate Putin and those around him"". Among those sanctioned wasOleg Deripaska, a leading industrialist who has had links with British politicians. Once one of the richest men linked to President Putin, Mr Deripaska made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries, including EN+ Group, and has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK. Media reports have named Mr Deripaska as the owner of a property on Belgrave Square, one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods. His net worth is now an estimated Â£2bn, according to the Foreign Office, and he has beensubject to US sanctions since 2018,external. Unlike other Russian oligarchs, who have remained silent on the war in Ukraine so far, Mr Deripaska has called for ""peace as soon as possible""in a tweet,external. Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Igor Sechinis another wealthy businessman who is said to have deep ties to President Putin. Named Putin's right-hand man by the UK, Mr Sechin worked with the president when he was mayor in St Petersburg in the 1990s. Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company, and has been sanctioned by the US and EU. In its statement,external, the government said the four others sanctioned included: Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB bank. He ""has long supported Kremlin objectives"" through the bank, which has already been sanctioned by the UK Alexei Miller, CEO of energy company Gazprom. An ally of Mr Putin from his St Petersburg days, he is ""one of the most important executives supporting the Russian government"" Nikolai Tokarev, president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft, He served with Mr Putin as a KGB officer in Dresden in East Germany in the 1980s and the pair have ""remained closely associated ever since"" Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of the board of directors of Bank Rossiya. Sanctioned by the UK, IS ""widely considered to be the Kremlin's private bank"" The UK has now sanctioned 18 oligarchs since the invasion of Ukraine began, a Downing Street spokesperson said. In addition to President Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and four Belarusian generals, 23 high-profile Russian oligarchs were now on the UK's sanctions list, the spokesperson said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government had targeted the oligarchs to ""ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine"". She said: ""With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression. ""The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the sanctions were the ""right decision"" but ""should not have taken the government weeks"". ""Too few oligarchs linked to Putin's rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government,"" Mr Lammy said. The government has been accused of moving slower than western allies the US and the EU in its sanctioning of individuals linked to President Putin. The government'sEconomic Crime Bill, which is expected to become law later this month, is designed to harden and quicken these sanctions. The government says the bill will also stop wealthy Russians using the City of London for money laundering and hiding gains linked to organised crime.

"Refugees arrive in Poland after fleeing the war in Ukraine The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn) of emergency funding for Ukraine, as it fights against a Russian invasion. It comes as the IMF predicts Ukraine will see a deep recession this year. More than 2m people are estimated to have left the country since the war started two weeks ago. Earlier this week, the World Bank approved a $732m financial package for Ukraine and is planning more economic assistance for the coming months. ""The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,""IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement.,external Ms Georgieva said the money was aimed to meet the country's urgent spending needs and help ease the huge economic impact of the war. ""The tragic loss of life, huge refugee flows, and immense destruction of infrastructure and productive capacity is causing severe human suffering and will lead to a deep recession this year. Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues,"" she added. The funds will be disbursed under IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument. This means it will largely come without conditions that are usually placed on borrower countries. Ukraine bank: Use frozen Russian money to rebuild World Bank approves $723m funding for Ukraine The IMF financing comes on top of a $723m World Bank economic package, which was announced earlier this week. That package was made up of grants and loans, including a $100m pledge from the UK. The World Bank said it was continuing to work on a $3bn package of support for the coming months. It also promised extra help for neighbouring countries that are taking in the estimated 2m refugees - who are mostly women, children and the elderly - fleeing Ukraine. In recent days Ukraine's government has taken other steps to support its war-torn economy.

"Kyrylo Shevchenko, Governor of National Bank of Ukraine, in September 2021 Frozen Russian assets should be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war, the governor of Ukraineâs Central Bank has told the BBC. Kyrylo Shevchenko called for an extensive list of extra sanctions, from cutting card payments to suspending Russian access to the IMF. Every day that sanctions are delayed ""is costing the lives of civilians and children"", he said in an interview. For security reasons, he answered questions sent by email. Mr Shevchenko, governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said that Russia should eventually be made to pay to repair the damage caused during the invasion. âThe need for money will be huge,â he told the BBC. âIt could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries. However a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries.â The government building in Kharkiv, destroyed by Russian missiles. Rebuilding Ukraine will cost billions Much of Russiaâs $630bn of foreign exchange reserves are thought to be held outside the country, and effectively frozen by sanctions in the US, the EU and other places. That would make billions available for reconstruction â if Ukraine is able to access it once the war is over. Extra sanctions Mr Shevchenko welcomed the financial sanctions already imposed by the international community, but said the world should go much further. He called on governments, institutions and companies to impose an extensive list of further financial sanctions, targeting every corner of Russia's economy. He called on: Trading and financial data platforms Refinitiv and Bloomberg to terminate access for Russian and Belarusian clients. US and EU to instruct their banks to sever correspondent relationships with Russian banks. The central banksâ organisation, the Bank for International Settlements, to expel Russia's central bank. The International Monetary Fund to suspend Russia and Belarus from its meetings, block their access to assets issued by the IMF called Special Drawing Rights, âas these funds may be used to finance military action against our country.â Chinaâs UnionPay card payment system (similar to Mastercard and Visa) to stop servicing payment cards issued by Russian banks. Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey and Vietnam to block the Russian payment system, Mir. International money transfer operator Western Union to cease deliveries of cash to Russian and Belarusian banks. âWe already see the effect [of sanctions] on the aggressorâs financial system, but we are still waiting for more to be done. I would like to underline that every day that sanctions are delayed is costing the lives of civilians and children,â Mr Shevchenko said. âThese are the lives of Ukrainians who have chosen the European way and are now defending not only their own country, but also the entire system of values that lies at the core of the Western civilization.â Central bankers normally target inflation. What is clear from the testimony of the Ukraine's version of Andrew Bailey is that in this war they are leaving no stone uncovered in their targeting of the Russian financial system. Every pipeline of cash into the ""aggressor"" has been identified, even as Mr Shevchenko's team tries to keep the cash flowing in the Ukrainian financial system and to its millions of refugees, and even set his country's monetary policy from a bunker. The IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, Western Union, Chinese credit card payment systems, former Soviet nations' use of Russia's payments system, all are the subject of Kyiv's lobbying to subject the Russian financial system to an unprecedented squeeze. Above all, that targeting of Russia's Central Bank, agreed by G7 nations, has disarmed its warchest of foreign exchange reserves and halved the value of the rouble. I asked him if he was worried about the precedent being set here for institutions normally given sovereign immunity. He pauses. ""I can answer from the bottom of my heart. We see that the Central Bank of Russia supports military invasion and thus is also guilty, responsible in deaths of civilians in Ukraine"". Donations Around 11bn hryvnia ($350m, Â£280m) has been paid in to the two special accounts set up by the National Bank of Ukraine to receive donations for the military and for humanitarian causes, Mr Shevchenko told the BBC. The account for the military was set up on 24 February to accept international and local donations in multiple currencies. A similar account for humanitarian purposes was set up on 1 March. Oil embargo Western countries have wrestled with the difficulties of suspending purchases of Russian energy. While the cash Moscow receives for oil and gas exports is a vital lifeline, European governments have decided that they canât live without vital Russian supplies, at least for now. Mr Shevchenko said: âToday we can see that Russia is using its energy resources capacities to put economic pressure on Europe. Energy is also one of the leading narratives in the Russian media. They are using it to misinform the Russian public about the Westâs unwillingness to take tougher measures, out of fear of losing access to Russian oil and gas. Kyrylo Shevchenko, filmed yesterday by NBU staff âWe realise how difficult this decision is for our Western partners. We understand the cost of such a step. But we must work together to find and use all possible tools to stop the killing and the suffering that Russia is increasingly causing in Ukraine.â Keeping going Mr Shevchenko also described some of the challenges of keeping the countryâs financial system running during a war. His staff are working round the clock, he said, many sheltering from bombardment in underground bunkers. But he said electronic payments and ATMs were still working, and cash was being delivered to everywhere but active combat zones. âI can proudly say that Ukrainian banking system remains stable and liquid even under martial law.â âThis is extremely difficult time for every Ukrainian - for the people and the country,â he said. âThe National Bank of Ukraine is doing everything in its power to support Ukraine, its defenders, and the population affected by Russian aggression.â EU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gas What sanctions could West still impose on Russia?

"EU leaders meeting on Thursday in Versailles focused on rethinking defence in Europe and how to move away from Russian energy The opulent Palace of Versailles was designed by the kings of France to impress the outside world, yet by the time of the French Revolution it had turned into a glaring symbol of royal failure. Now EU leaders who are here for a two-day summit hope to project an image of unity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. That's easy when they discuss the big picture. But some details up for debate are clearly divisive amongst member states: such as energy prices impacted by the war, EU common defence plans and the enlargement of the bloc to include Ukraine. Yet the bureaucratic, often bickering behemoth that is the EU has already been transformed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Let's take a step back to get some perspective: Germany is re-booting its military after decades of squeamishness due to the country's role in World War Two The EU has slapped unprecedented financial sanctions on Russia, despite costs to European businesses The EU's Temporary Protection Directive has been used for the first time to help Ukrainian refugees work and live in the bloc- a divisive topic during the 2015 migrant crisis Brussels is buying and supplying weapons for the first time ever to a country at war The Energy Transition - so often put on a backburner by EU countries - promises to be a revolution with new plans to reduce heavy reliance on Russian gas EU outliers Poland and Hungary, in Brussels' bad books for years, are back in the fold as a result of the current crisis Brussels' cooperation and co-ordination with Nato and the US are smoother and closer than they've been in a long time Is this a temporary blip, or are we looking at a Brussels rebirth; an EU 2.0? The EU was already aware - certainly after the 2016 Brexit vote, if not before - that it needed some serious self-improvement. The bloc was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize back in 2012 ""for over six decades contributing to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe"". EU member states have sent defensive weapons to Ukraine but face demands for greater support But in the eyes of many Europeans, Brussels became seen as a home for neo-liberalism, rather than liberalism. A promoter of trade deals prioritising big business, and a maker of dirty migrant deals (with Turkey, for example) to keep refugees from reaching EU shores. A bloc that, along with many national governments, was perceived as helping banks instead of families after the 2008 economic crisis. An entity, decades after the Second World War, that had lost its vision, mission and recognition as a force for peace in Europe. Populism, nationalism and illiberalism became familiar faces in European politics, as voters looked for ""a better fit"". EU countries fell out over migration, eurozone reform and more. Conspiracy theories flourished, as trust in Brussels and traditional politicians waned. ""Strongman"" leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orban, Turkey's Recep Erdogan, America's Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin were increasingly admired. Then, in 2020, the Covid pandemic prompted a reset. After an unedifying start, Brussels was perceived as working in the public interest. Member states seemed more united, opinion polls were approving. The EU's Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell, has appealed to EU leaders to display the same drive and resolve shown in face of Covid when dealing with the Russia-Ukraine crisis and resulting challenges. This war on European soil has refocused EU minds as to what the bloc could - or should - stand for. Vladimir Putin's assault on Ukraine is also seen by the EU majority as a geopolitical attack on European security as a whole. But this two-day informal summit could well expose cracks in this new-found EU unity. All EU leaders fret about rising energy costs and the impact back home of Russia sanctions and possible counter sanctions. But they disagree on what to do about it. Some call for an EU-wide solution - that is, new funds from Brussels. Others, like Germany and the Netherlands, say no. Emmanuel Macron is the host of the summit, since France currently holds the rotating EU presidency. He's long been a champion of a stronger, more independent Europe, weaning itself off food, technology and energy imports and building up its own defence force to work alongside Nato. But the prospect of a European Army (under French command) remains an unlikely prospect. Instead, EU countries will discuss better co-ordination and the pooling of military resources... while likely arguing over which nations should win the best contracts. As for migration. two million Ukrainians have already fled the country. Depending on how long the misery and violence continue, many more could arrive in the EU. Diplomats I've spoken to predict that funding, housing and relocating millions across different member states could yet prove difficult, longer term. Right now though, the scenes of suffering and loss in Ukraine mean emotions are running high amongst EU leaders. Their debate over whether Ukraine's application for EU membership can be fast-tracked, as a symbol of solidarity, looks to be the most heated Versailles Palace will witness this week.

"Oil prices rose on Thursday amid confusion over whether major producers would help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia. The United Arab Emirates had appeared to push members of the Opec producer group to raise output, only for the UAE's energy minister to quash hopes. The oil price rose more than 5%, after a 17% fall on Wednesday. ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement,"" said analyst Stephen Innes. US President Joe Biden and other leaders have pledged to try to ease the price pressures for households. Officials from the US have been in talks with oil producers aimed at boosting supply. ""We favour production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaibasaid in a statement,externaltweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington. But the energy minister Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said later that the Gulf state remained committed to the existing Opec monthly output agreement, which fixes how much crude is produced by member countries. Oil prices have jumped more than 30% since 24 February, touching $139 (Â£105) a barrel at one point this week.  The oil price had fallen back to about $106 a barrel at one point on Wednesday, but by Thursday morning it was trading at around $116. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? On Tuesday, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck issued an ""urgent appeal"" to Opec oil producers to increase output ""to create relief on the market"". Saudi Arabia-led Opec and an extended group of oil producers called Opec+ - which includes Russia - have agreed to avoid a price war and keep control over the market. Mr Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management, said: ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement as we are in an unprecedented situation."" Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said: ""We think it will be challenging for Opec+ to boost production in this environment."" Worries about oil and gas supplies have led to soaring domestic heating bills and fuel prices at the pump. Both petrol and diesel prices hit new records in the UK on Wednesday, according to the RAC motoring group. Unleaded petrol was 159.57p a litre on average, while diesel was 167.37p. By Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent Despite the mixed messages coming out from the UAE, there is a broad consensus within Opec+ that there is no immediate need to boost oil production faster. So, even if the UAE tries to convince other members to increase production during the next meeting, it will be difficult to find many backers. While Abu Dhabi is a prominent member of Opec+, Riyadh and Moscow are the leaders of the pack and they are the ones who call the shots. Any decision to increase supplies will essentially boil down to Saudi Arabia. While the UAE is keen to increase production, it is very unlikely that it will break ranks and pump more oil unilaterally.  Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have maintained a neutral stance during the course of this war, and the former would be unwilling to take any decision related to Opec+ that the Russians would oppose. Opec+ has attributed the recent rise in prices to market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and maintained that there is no shortage of supplies in the market. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""A tank of petrol is now almost Â£88 while diesel has now gone over Â£92. Diesel unfortunately appears to be on a clear path to Â£1.70 a litre. ""As this is an average price, drivers will be seeing some unbelievably high prices on forecourts as retailers pass on their increased wholesale costs."" Energy prices have been soaring for more than a year amid a rapid rebound in demand for oil, which had collapsed during the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine added new price pressures, as sanctions make it hard for the country - typically the producer of about 7% of global supplies -  to find buyers for its oil. The US and Canada have also announced bans on Russian oil imports, while the UK said it would phase them out by the end of the year. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic national reserves, but that move is not enough to respond to the recent run-up in prices. The agency said on Wednesday that oil reserves may be tapped further. ""If there's a need, if our governments decide so, we can bring more oil to the markets, as one part of the response,"" said IEA chief Faith Birol.

White House officials hosted a private Zoom briefing for about 30 influential TikTok creators to keep them informed of the latest US messaging regarding Ukraine, according to the Washington Post. The briefing was conducted by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and National Security Council adviser Matt Miller. Several of the social media stars have since gone on to post about Ukraine. The topic included the US ""strategic goals in the region"", according to the Post, such as how the US would respond to a Russian nuclear escalation and how US aid dollars are being spent to help Ukraine. TikTok has been widely embraced by the Biden administration as a way to reach younger Americans who get much of their news from social media. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Olha Svyripa was woken up at 05:30 on 24 February to what she described as ""the warmest hug I ever had from my husband"". ""He said 'please wake up, it's begun'."" Two hours later, she was crammed into a small van with her husband, her best friend and four strangers, to begin what turned into an 18-hour journey from Kyiv to the relative safety of Rivne, in the west of Ukraine. ""We packed the most important stuff - documents, laptops, chargers. My husband filled my backpack with books and said: 'It might be heavy but will protect you in case of shelling'."" Olha's laptop was important because she, like many Ukrainians, wanted to carry on working despite the complete upheaval of her life and the dreadful circumstances she found herself in. Read more about Olha's story here. File photo: An estimated 2.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Russian invasion on 24 February Guatemala has received its first arrivals on Friday of Ukrainian refugees, according to a Reuters report. Eight Ukrainians were the first to arrive in the Central American country for ""humanitarian reasons"". A further 10 Ukrainians were expected to arrive later in the day, Reuters quoted officials as saying. It is unclear how many may have arrived privately to Guatemala since the Russian attacks onUkraine began. Guatemala announced its decision to throw open its doors to Ukrainian war refugees on 6 March, when President Alejandro Giammattei said they would be ""assured refuge"" in the country. It is now slightly past 06:00 in Kyiv, and air raid sirens have blared across more than 15 regions and multiple cities in Ukraine, BBC Ukrainian has reported. They have sounded in the capital Kyiv, along with key cities like Odesa in the south, Sumy in the north, Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south-east. The aftermath of shelling in Sumy More humanitarian corridors have been agreed for the embattled northeastern city of Sumy on Saturday morning, said Sumy Regional Military Administration Dmitry Zhyvytsky in a post on Telegram. According to Zhyvytsky, evacuation efforts starting at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) will see vehicles departing from six destinations around the region. All of the convoys are headed to the central city of Poltava, and are expected to arrive between 13:00 to 14:00. As Ukraine enters its 17th day under Russian invasion, Nato has said that it will be sending troops to Norway on Monday 14 March. Some 30,000 troops, 200 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 nations are expected to take part in the Cold Response 2022 exercise, the largest exercise involving Nato troops this year. Starting on 14 March, the manoeuvres will enable western nations to hone their combat skills in Norway's cold climate, including in the Arctic, on the ground, at sea and in the skies. The exercise will be held a few hundred kilometres from the Russian border. While it was planned long before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, it now has added significance because of the war. Norway's Defence Minister Odd Roger Enoksen said: ""This exercise is extremely important for the security of Norway and its allies. We will practice an allied reinforcement of Norway"". The exercise is expected to come to an end on 1 April. With fierce fighting in cities along Ukraineâs south coast, the key city of Odesa is preparing its defences. Russian landing craft have been seen off the coast, and several aircraft have been reportedly shot down. Odesa is seen as an important target, both strategic and symbolic. The BBC has obtained footage of the volunteers preparing to defend the city, just 50km (30 miles) from the border with Moldova. This video can not be played Ukraine: Preparing to defend Odesa The Chernobyl power plant, photographed three days after the 1986 meltdown Ukraine has told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that technicians have begun efforts to restore the external power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said the site currently occupied by Russian troops was taken off the power grid. They later claimed that the Russians were preparing a ""terrorist attack"" that had been thwarted. Ukraine told the IAEA, the UN's nuclear energy watchdog, that work on Thursday evening successfully prepared one section, but that failures persist due to damage in other places. The agency said the work was continuing ""despite the difficult situation outside"" the former Soviet power plant, the site of a nuclear disaster in 1986. Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, is now firmly in the sights of the Russian army. Moscow's troops invaded from the nearby Crimea peninsula and have had more success in taking territory in this region than Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine. And now reports from the city indicate that Russian forces have started to shell the city again. As the Russians work their way west towards the city people are starting to flee and the hospitals are filling with the injured. But Anastasia has decided to stay, sending her one-year-old daughter and her mother away to safety. ""I'm a mum of my baby. But I have to help because I know how to do it,"" the former army captain told the BBC. Ukrainian forces have, for more than a week now, defended the city. But Governor Vitaliy Kim warns this is not a time to celebrate prematurely. ""We are winning this fight, but not this war,"" he says. Read more about the defence of Mykolaiv here.  Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has said his country could host negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Bulgarian media quoted President Radev saying that ""Bulgaria can legitmately claim to be a place for such talks, but this should be done in coordination with the European Union."" Radev added: ""We are members of the EU and we should strive for a unified European solution, a unified European approach."" On Friday, UK Minister of State for Europe and North America James Cleverly was in Bulgaria to discuss with his counterparts the crisis in Ukraine. Cleverly said the UK and Bulgaria - as Nato allies - oppose Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine. He added that Bulgaria was ""one of the first countries to close its skies to Russian aeroplanes"". Photos taken by Reuters apparently show a drone that has been rigged to drop petrol-filled bottles onto invading Russian troops. The four-blade device was apparently developed by the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces. Its use comes about two weeks after the government called for private owners to donate their drones to be outfitted for military purposes. It's unclear how the petrol in the Molotov cocktail bottle of Chernihivske beer - seen in the photo - is meant to be ignited. But the pictures show that as it falls, the bottle stays upright, in an apparent effort to keep the liquid from pouring out as it drops onto its target. Read more about Molotov cocktails in Ukrainehere The bottle stays upright after being released by the drone Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign. Read more of our investigation here. Earlier on we reported on a video address given by Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The deputy prime minister said that shelling had prevented evacuations from Mariupol, where a maternity hospital was bombed this week, and the capital Kyiv. But she said some planned evacuations had been successful, including 1,000 people who were escorted from the village of Vorzel in the Kyiv region. Vereshchuk said that there will be a further attempt to evacuate people from Mariupol on Saturday. ""Tomorrow we will do it again in front of the whole world"", she said. She added a humanitarian cargo should be delivered to Mariupol, and on the way back people will have the opportunity of being evacuated. Several attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol failed earlier this week after agreements for temporary pauses in fighting were broken. Ukrainian families are grieving the deaths of the country's fallen soldiers. The bodies of the first victims of the Ukraine-Russia war are being laid to rest. The BBC's Fergal Keane reports. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ukrainians grieve for their fallen soldiers In the last half hour, air raid sirens have gone off in the capital city and in Zhytomyr, to its west, warning residents to seek shelter underground. Reporters on the ground in Kyiv report heavy shelling currently being heard. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine as the Russian invasion enters its 17th day.  Civilians living near the Zaporizhzhia plant have fled to other parts of Ukraine The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom, said Russian officials have tried to enter and take full control of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom's chief, Petro Kotin, said Russian forces had told Ukrainian staff at the plant that it now belonged to Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear company. In a televised interview, Kotin said 10 officials from Rosatom - including two senior engineers - unsuccessfully attempted to enter the plant and take control of operations. He added: ""On the territory [of the plant] there are around 500 Russian soldiers with automatic weapons â¦ our staff are in an extremely bad psychological state."" Kotin said on Friday that the radioactive material at the Chernobyl nuclear plant is still safely housed in storage, but warned that the plant remains disconnected from IAEA monitoring systems. The head of Instagram says that Russia's decision to block the social media platform means that tens of millions of Russians will on Monday lose access to the site and app. ""On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia,"" tweeted Adam Mosseri. ""This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong."" Russia made the move on Friday after Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said that it would temporarily suspend its own rules to allow for violent threats against Russian troops. Meta's head of global affairs said earlier today that the company's changes on speech in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will only apply in Ukraine itself and were temporary.

The image of heavily-pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied as she descended rubble-strewn steps, was widely shared amid outrage at the attack, which killed three people. She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika. Mariana became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Mariana was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. Read more about Mariana's story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The integrated education bill has passed through Stormont A new law requiring the Department of Education (DE) to give more ""support"" to integrated education has been passed by assembly members. The new law is the result of a private members bill brought by the Alliance assembly member Kellie Armstrong. A DUP move to block the legislation using a petition of concern failed as it did not gain enough support. The new law was supported by 49 assembly members, with 38 voting against it and one abstaining. It means that the Department of Education has to increase the number of integrated school places and set targets for the number of children being educated in them. About 7% of pupils in Northern Ireland are educated currently in just under 70 formally integrated schools, which aim to mix pupils from Protestant, Catholic and other backgrounds. This video can not be played Kellie Armstrong MLA said her integrated education bill would not undermine any sector. However, some non-integrated schools also have a mix of pupils from different religious backgrounds as well as those who are not religious. The commitments contained in the bill led some schools, education bodies and church representatives to claim the legislation would""elevate integrated schools""above other types of school. But the new law also receivedstrong support from some schools and organisationsand the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children, Koulla Yiasouma. Assembly members from the Ulster Unionist Party did not support the bill but did not back the petition of concern. Apetition of concern to block legislationhas to be supported by 30 assembly members. Speaking during the debate, the Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said his party would not ""abuse a mechanism that we put in (to the Good Friday Agreement) in 1998"". ""Signing a petition of concern on this issue would be an abuse of that mechanism,"" he added. In some parts of Northern Ireland, there are places in integrated schools and if you're a parent who wants to send their child to a formally integrated school, you can. In other parts, that's much harder. Not a lot will change immediately, but with the passing of this bill, in time, some of that demand for more integrated school places should be met. Those against the bill worry the Department of Education will have to spend more money providing those places, and less money on the controlled and maintained sectors. It really depends on the support, and that's the key in this bill, the department has to give integrated education. This bill commits the department to bring forward an action plan and draw up targets. That won't happen overnight and will be the responsibility of the next education minister. Opening the debate earlier, Ms Armstrong said that ""more young people growing up together and being educated together will move Northern Ireland forward"". But DUP assembly member Diane Dodds said the bill would leave a ""terrible legacy"" for children while the TUV leader Jim Allister said it created ""supremacy for one sector over another"". Ms Dodds also criticised assembly members opposed to the bill for not having the ""backbone"" to stop it and said they were ""scared"" of political opponents. The UUP's Robbie Butler said there was ""a lack of fairness and equality"" in the bill and that it would ""elevate one sector above another"". No religious mix in 'nearly a third of NI schools' Integrated education bill worries some schools However, Sinn Fein assembly member Pat Sheehan called Mr Allister's claims of supremacy ""arrant nonsense"". The SDLP's Daniel McCrossan said there were a number of ""issues with the bill"" but it was in ""much better shape"" following a range of changes and amendments during the consideration process. Closing the debate, Ms Armstrong said that since she first proposed the bill she had faced ""allegations of being sectarian, threatened to be excommunicated from the church by some principals"". ""I have had people ask me not to return to go to Mass, I've had local people who have said to me that they would rather see me out of my house and out of the area all because of the misinformation that was shared about this bill."" The Integrated Education Bill commits the Department of Education to a duty to actively ""support"" integrated education. It means the department must provide ""sufficient places in integrated schools to aim to meet the demand for integrated education within the context of area planning and the overall sustainability of the school estate"". Just under 70 schools in Northern Ireland are formally integrated Education bodies must also ""consider integrated education when planning for the establishment of a new school"". The bill could also mean an increase in the budget for some integrated schools as the department must produce an integrated education strategy to ""include provision for resources (including personnel) to encourage, facilitate and support integrated education"". The department must also produce an action plan and ""quantify funding commitments and identify respective resources made available for the support for and provision of integrated education"". Those additional resources could include ""the establishment of new integrated schools, the expansion of existing integrated schools and the transformation of existing schools into integrated schools"".
