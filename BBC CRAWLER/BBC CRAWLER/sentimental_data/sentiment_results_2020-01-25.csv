"The UK's fixed-term parliaments could see politicians failing to prioritise climate change, veteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough has suggested. He told the first citizens' assembly on climate having a five-year government leads to a lack of long-term planning. The 110-strong assembly in Birmingham will meet over four weekends to examine options for how the UK can meet its greenhouse gas emission targets. Sir David said he was ""extremely grateful"" to those taking part. It is hoped their recommendations - to be published in April - will help inform Parliament and the government on policies to reach net zero emissions. Sir David said one of the problems with Parliament having a fixed length of five years is that the effects of climate change may only be felt much later. ""It is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry about an issue which is not going to come to a climax - and people won't know if it is successful or not successful - for 10 years hence, 15 years hence,"" he said. Citizens' assembly aims to tackle climate change 'We've been putting things off for year after year' Attenborough backs Â£1m nature reserve appeal Sir David Attenborough to make climate change plea He told the group: ""So the fact you are here is extremely important because it shows you can put pressure on your members of Parliament to take this issue seriously."" ""I believe that the question we are facing is of the utmost importance,"" he added. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 requires an election be held every five years, unless two-thirds of MPs vote for an early poll. The citizens' assembly, commissioned by six parliamentary select committees, is being asked to examine how the UK meets its legal target to cut greenhouse gases to zero overall by 2050. The 110 members of the assembly will learn from experts about climate change, and discuss and make informed decisions on options for meeting the net zero goal during sessions in Birmingham. Their differences are crucial - they've been chosen to reflect the nation in diversity of age, ethnicity, geography and opinion. Among them are people who are unworried by climate change - as well as others who are positively alarmed. You might have thought a climate conference like this would be a meat-free zone, given the impact of cows on the planet. But this aims to be an extraordinary gathering of ""ordinary"" people. That means chicken and sweet potatoes on the lunch menu, as well as the beef - and a vegan option. And no preaching. Chris, an engineer from Oxford, says he's not yet convinced climate change is an emergency - he says he wants more facts. Leia from Darlington, who just lost her job as an engineering apprentice, doesn't need convincing - she doesn't want to be left with a badly-damaged planet. They have been drawn from more than 1,800 people who responded to 30,000 invitations sent out to UK households selected at random and are representative of the UK population in age, gender, ethnicity, education and where they live. Members are also representative of the country in terms of how concerned they are about climate change. Three of the group said they were not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said. Business, trade union, faith, farming and environmental leaders have given their backing to the citizens' assembly. The Â£520,000 scheme has been funded through Â£120,000 from Parliament's select committees' research budgets and two philanthropic foundations.

""There are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public is low,"" the Department of Health said. It came after the Chief Medical Officer for Englandsaid there was a ""fair chance""the UK would see a case.

"Sajid Javid and Steve Mnuchin had breakfast on Saturday morning The US wants to agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK this year, the country's treasury secretary has said. After meeting Chancellor Sajid Javid in London, Steve Mnuchin said he believed the UK could negotiate trade deals with the US and EU at the same time. ""I'm quite optimistic,"" he told a Chatham House think tank event. After Brexit happens on 31 January, the UK will be free to negotiate and sign new trade deals with countries with no existing EU deals - like the US. At the same time, the UK will also be negotiating a free trade deal with the EU to ensure that UK goods are not subject to tariffs and other trade barriers once the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Chancellor reassures firms on post-Brexit trade UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax Is the UK toughening its stance with the US? Mr Mnuchin, who met Mr Javid for breakfast on Saturday morning andposted an image of them on Instagram,external, said the US was ""prepared to dedicate a lot of resources"" to securing a trade deal with the UK this year. He said: ""We've said that our goal - your goal - is trying to get both of these trade agreements done this year. And I think from a US standpoint we are prepared to dedicate a lot of resources. ""If the UK and US have very similar economies with a big focus on services, and I think this will be a very important relationship."" Mr Mnuchin added President Donald Trump had previously said the UK would ""be at the top of the list"" for a deal. He also reiterated the US's objections to a new tax on the revenues of big tech firms, calling it ""discriminatory"". He told the audience at Chatham House it was ""not appropriate"" and has ""violations to our tax treaties and other issues"". ""So, we're working through that and I think we have a good outcome of trying to give some room now in 2020 to continue these discussions."" Mr Javid intends to introduce a 2% levy on the revenues of search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces which derive value from UK users. He has said the digital services tax will only be a temporary measure until an international agreement is in place on how to deal with online giants such as Google and Facebook. Earlier this week,Mr Mnuchin threatened new tariffs on UK carmakersafter the chancellor defied US pressure to cancel the tax. The issue of whether Chinese telecoms giant Huawei should have a role in the UK's 5G network was also raised. The USrecently warned the British governmentit ""would be madness"" to use Huawei technology in the UK's 5G network. A decision is expected imminently on whether to allow Huawei to supply some ""non-core"" parts for the UK network. Mr Mnuchin said ""active discussions"" about that were ongoing with UK government and others. He also said hiscriticisms of climate activist Greta Thunberg earlier this weekhad been meant as a ""joke"".

"A health team is available at Heathrow Airport for travellers from China Officials are attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors who have flown in to the UK from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where thenew strain of coronavirusfirst broke out. Tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said. Prof Whitty said there is a ""fair chance"" Britain will see cases of the new virus, which has killed 26 people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the risk to the public ""remains low"". It came after Public Health England said that, while cases of the new virus in the UK are ""highly likely"", most of those affected abroad by the virus were making a good recovery. Globally,there are more than800 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 26 people in China. Mr Hancock chaired a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there were still no confirmed cases in the country. Prof Whitty said further tests on a number of other patients are still being processed but that he did not want to provide exact numbers. ""This is a marathon not a sprint,"" he said, adding that clinicians are now implementing a system to deal with the new virus that can be scaled up if needed. Prof Whitty said attempts are being made to trace those who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan - the Chinese city where the virus first broke out - over the last 14 days. It is understood that the aim is to eliminate those who have flown on to other destinations and to check on the health of others in case they might have the coronavirus. It is believed that this could involve as many as 2,000 people. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France China battles to prevent New Year virus spike Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Meanwhile the Chinese Ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said his country's government ""is very much determined to curb"" the virus. ""We think we can get it under control,"" he added ahead of a No 10 reception for the Chinese New Year. All the people who have been tested in the UK had visited Wuhan in the last two weeks. In Scotland, where five people were tested,an incident team has been set upto deal with the health threat. Four of the patients were believed to be Chinese, Downing Street said. Those tested in the UK includedone person in Wales,who was given the all clear last week, andone man in Belfast. One of those cleared was British artist Michael Hope, 45, whospent two days in quarantine this weekafter developing ""a nasty cough"" on returning to Newcastle from Wuhan. Prof Cosford told the BBC ""we will not be surprised"" if people return from China to the UK with the infection, which can cause lung problems such as pneumonia. ""I think it's highly likely that we will have cases in the UK - and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one."" There are no planes or trains in or out of Wuhan, where people are being treated He added: ""These are early days yet with this virus. The vast majority of people who are infected do seem to be getting better. ""The people who have done particularly badly, and sadly died, they seem to be people who have other conditions that might make them more likely to suffer badly with this virus."" The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan and the UK is monitoring direct flights arriving from China as a precaution. Passengers are receiving leaflets and advice on what to do if they fall ill, and a health team is available at Heathrow Airport to check for symptoms. GPs have been told to isolate any patients showing symptoms and avoid physically examining them if they have recently travelled from Wuhan. Public Health England is advising anyone who has been to Wuhan within the past 14 days and has developed respiratory symptoms to phone NHS 111. Those symptoms include a cough, a sneeze, shortness of breath, or a fever. People who are concerned should phone ahead before going to any medical facility and mention their recent travel to the city. PHE also advises anyone travelling to China to maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene, and avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. The agency is currently not advising people to wear face masks. China has widened a lockdown in Hubei province - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The travel restrictions will affect at least 20 million people across 10 cities. The lockdown comes on the eve of Lunar New Year - one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, when millions of people travel home. The virus has spread across China and to countries as far as Japan, Thailand and the US. This video can not be played What's life like in quarantined Wuhan? The World Health Organization has not classed the virus as an ""international emergency"", partly because of the low number of overseas cases, but said it ""may yet become one"". Peter Piot, professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said ""data to date suggests that this virus may have a lower mortality than Sars"", which killed hundreds in the early 2000s. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. Authorities have said it originated in a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be?

"This video can not be played What's life like in quarantined Wuhan? The spread of a deadly new virus is accelerating, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned, after holding a special government meeting on the Lunar New Year public holiday. The country is facing a ""grave situation"" Mr Xi told senior officials. The coronavirus has killed at least 56 people and infected almost 2,000 since its discovery in the city of Wuhan. The US has announced that staff at the Wuhan consulate will be evacuated on a special flight on Tuesday. The State Department said that private Americans most at risk will also be able to board the flight to San Francisco. Meanwhile, UK-based researchers have warned of a real possibility that China will not be able to contain the virus. Travel restrictions have come in place in several affected cities. From Sunday, private vehicles will be banned from central districts of Wuhan, the source of the outbreak. A second emergency hospital is to be built there within weeks to handle 1,300 new patients, and will be finished in half a month, state newspaper the People's Daily said. It is the second such rapid construction project: work on another 1,000-bed hospital has already begun. Specialist military medical teams have also been flown into Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. The urgency reflects concern both within China and elsewhere about the virus which first appeared in December. How can China build a hospital so quickly? Coronavirus sparks anxiety among Chinese overseas Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the rat, which began on Saturday, have been cancelled in many Chinese cities. Across mainland China, travellers are having their temperatures checked for signs of fever, and train stations have been shut in several cities. Allow Twitter content?

Symptoms seem to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, lead to shortness of breath and some patients needing hospital treatment. There is no specific cure or vaccine. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Based on early information, it is believed that only a quarter of infected cases are ""severe"", and the dead are mostly - though not exclusively - older people, some of whom have pre-existing conditions. The Chinese authorities suspect a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"" was the source of the outbreak. Scientists at the respected MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis in the UK have warned that it may not be possible to contain the virus to China. They say self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus is the ""only plausible explanation"" for the scale of the epidemic. Their calculations estimate each infected person is passing it onto, on average, 2.5 other people. The centre praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities, but said transmission of the virus needed to be cut by 60% in order to get on top of the outbreak. The coronavirus has killed at least 56 people This is a massive challenge, the scientists suggest, which will require finding and isolating even patients with only mild symptoms that could easily be confused with other diseases. Elsewhere, a team at Lancaster University have published their estimates of the number of cases suggesting 11,000 have been infected this year. If true, that would be more than Sars. There are now 1,372 confirmed cases across China, though most are concentrated in those provinces closest to Hubei. But it has also spread abroad - in isolated cases affecting small numbers of patients. On Saturday, Australia confirmed its first four cases - first in Melbourne, and then three more in Sydney. It has also spread to Europe, with three cases confirmed in France.Tests in the UK on 31 people have come back negative, the government has said. Officials are trying to trace around 2,000 people who have recently flown to the UK from Hubei province. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France Fourteen people in UK tested for new strain The cases largely involve people who had recently travelled from the affected region in China. China's neighbours in the Asia region are on high alert, however, with cases reported in Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, South Korea and Nepal. There are also two cases in the United States, including a woman in her 60s who had returned home to Chicago from Wuhan on 13 January. Canada has a ""presumptive case"" of the virus, but the condition of the person suffering from it is deemed stable, according to a government statement. The city of Wuhan is effectively on lockdown, with heavy restrictions on travel in and out, and public transport options from buses to planes cancelled. It is a major population centre with up to 11 million inhabitants - comparable in size to London. Pharmacies in the city have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been filled with nervous members of the public. Officials have urged people to avoid crowds and gatherings. ""The whole transport system has been shut down,"" Kathleen Bell, who is is originally from the UK and works in Wuhan, told the BBC. ""From midnight tonight private cars are not allowed on the road. And taxis aren't running."" Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began How do you quarantine a city - and does it work?

"Fraudsters ""operate with impunity"" as a surge in cases has left police struggling to cope, a report has found. Staff feel they cannot identify criminals and bring them to justice, the report said, at a time when there has been a 15% rise in cases. The report, by ex-Met Police Deputy Commissioner Sir Craig Mackey, found fraud now accounts for one-in-three crimes - but just 2% are detected. The Home Office said it will study Sir Craig's findings. The report also revealed fewer than 1% of police officers directly investigate fraud. And despite nearly 2,000 fraud offences being committed daily in England and Wales, just one in 50 is prosecuted. Sir Craig warned that a lack of proper investment and inadequate technology was hampering efforts to tackle the crime. Courier fraud victim 'cried for days' Pensioner loses life savings in Bitcoin fraud Fraudsters 'use tricks of speech' in cons While overall crime in England and Wales has remained ""broadly static"" over the past 12 months, reporting of fraud has jumped by 500,000 cases - a rise of 15%. The reviewfollows an investigation by the Times last year,external, which claimed call handlers forAction Fraud,external, the national fraud reporting service, had mocked victims and misled people into thinking they were dealing with police. It is estimated 86% of fraud is committed online and around 78% of cases involves offences where suspects and offenders do not live in the same area. Victims of fraud must report it to Action Fraud, which is overseen by the City of London Police, the force that specialises in fraud investigations. However, Action Fraud's call centre and computer systems are handled by private companies. Last year, an undercover Times reporter applied for a job as a call handler for one of the companies, Concentrix, at a call centre in Gourock, Inverclyde. The Times' investigation, published last August, said: Call handlers responsible for recording victims' fraud reports undertook just two weeks' training and were taught to mislead callers into thinking they are talking to police officers They quickly decide during calls whether or not to categorise victims' reports as crimes, but are told never to reveal this to victims Staff took fraud calls while distracted, napping or play-fighting Managers reportedly said the police ""do absolutely everything in their power to avoid"" investigating fraud Sir Craig visited Action Fraud as part of his review and found a number of staff had been dismissed following the newspaper's probe while others had been warned over their behaviour. He recommended the service should now be ""re-defined and brought back into line with industry standards and public expectation"". Overall, the ex-police chief said ""fraud investigation in the UK needs a 'new future'"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""It is vital that fraud victims have the confidence to come forward and know that their case will be dealt with properly. ""We note this review into the standards, culture and management of Action Fraud and will look at it carefully.""

"A representative of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex complained to the firm about the adverts A house building firm that used images of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a bid to sell new homes has apologised over its advertising campaign. Hagan Homes, one of Northern Ireland's biggest property developers, said its houses ""fit for part-time royalty' ads were meant to be ""light-hearted"". It did not have the couple's permission and has been told to remove the ads. The firm said it had not intended to cause any offence and it has offered to make a Â£10,000 donation to charity. On Friday, theBelfast Telegraph,externalreported that representatives of the duke and duchess were to take ""action"" over the advertising campaign. The adverts, which appeared on Belfast billboards and on social media, featured photos of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with worried expressions. ""Buying a new home can be rather stressful,"" one of the adverts stated. It followed an announcement from the couple earlier in January in which they said they intended to""step back"" from royal duties and become ""financially independent"". It was also confirmed thatthey wish to repay the Â£2.4m of public funds spent on the refurbishment of their UK home, Frogmore Cottage. In a statement on Saturday the founder and chairman of Hagan Homes, James Hagan, said the firm was in the process of removing all the adverts. ""We have been in contact with representatives for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and taken action to remove the social media posts and billboard advertising,"" Mr Hagan said. ""The 'Hagan Homes Fit For Part-time Royalty' campaign was intended to reflect Northern Ireland's typically light-hearted approach to a challenging situation. Harry and Meghan's trademark bid challenged Who pays for Harry and Meghan? Harry and Meghan's future: Your questions answered ""Many young people struggle with the complexities of buying a new home and we were keen to emphasise that support is available in such circumstances."" He added: ""It was not our intention to cause any offence and we sincerely apologise if any has been taken. ""We believe Harry and Meghan are strong role models for all young people who are trying to find their own path in life and in recognition of this Hagan Homes is keen to make a donation of Â£10,000 to a charity of Harry and Meghan's choice."" A spokeswoman for Hagan Homes confirmed to BBC News NI that the firm received an email from the couple's representatives, requesting the adverts be taken down. She said the email referred to rules from the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP). The rules makes specific mention of the Royal Family, saying its members ""should not normally be shown or mentioned in a marketing communication without their prior permission"". Hagan Homes, based in Ballyclare, County Antrim, has already deleted its social media adverts and said its billboard adverts will be be ""taken down by close of play"" on Monday 27 January 2020.

"Dr Yvonne Griffiths is in a hotel room in Wuhan A lecturer ""stranded"" in China in the coronavirus outbreak will not be able to leave unless the UK government intervenes, her daughter said. Dr Yvonne Griffiths, 71, from Thornhill in Cardiff, has been in Wuhan for three weeks with two colleagues on behalf of Birmingham City University.

Ms Webber added her mother was getting more anxious about the spread of the virus. ""There have been some mixed messages about masks and their effectiveness, that's adding more uncertainty and it's more scary than if you think you're going to be protected by wearing a mask and then suddenly everyone is saying you may not be,"" she said.

The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei province, and has infected 2,000 people since its discovery Speaking to BBC News, Dr Griffiths said: ""We've noticed everybody wearing masks now, the government has instructed that... so everybody in shops, on the streets, in the hotel where we are, you will see nobody without a mask now. ""We're also getting information about different types of masks, that some of them are not effective. We went today to try to buy some better ones.

Dr Griffiths, who is originally from Holywood near Belfast, Northern Ireland, works as an English language lecturer and is in Wuhan due to its twinning with Birmingham City University.

"The Holburne Museum in Bath will have a nightmare on its hands if its exhibition Grayson Perry: The Pre-Therapy Years is even remotely successful. There will be havoc. Punters will turn on the genteel Georgian institution like Frankenstein's monster, furious with the darkly satirical show it has created. It won't be the contents that rattles their collective cage, which is exactly what you'd expect from the Turner Prize-winning potter, but the way it has been displayed. Or, more specifically, the shortcomings of the first room of the show. It is tiny. Put a dozen or so people in there and it will feel more like a game of sardines than an art reconnaissance trip. One minute you'll be admiring a large photograph of a young, naked Grayson covered in paint, the next Mrs Stockbridge from The Crescent will be squeezing past his decorated member apologising for the coarseness of her tweed suit. You can't avoid it. The first room, that is. The exhibition is hung chronologically and most people like to start at the beginning. The good folk at the museum will have to figure out how to manage visitor flow (there's a secret door that could come into play) because the space isn't just very small, it is also full of objects and you stay in there for three films that collectively last over an hour. This is where we first meet the recently graduated Grayson who, we discover, is on the hunt for his artistic voice. He's not short of things to say - he's never short of things to say - but is yet to find the medium through which to communicate. He is living in a north London squat and hanging out with a bohemian crowd, including a pre-pop star Boy George, and, on occasion, Derek Jarman, the avant-garde film-maker and elder statesman. Grayson Perry as his alter ego Claire, 1988 Perry starts by making films, which have not aged well. He dabbles in performance art, and then accepts an invitation from his girlfriend's sister to come along to her pottery night class. And that is where this show begins, with a small brown plate called Kinky Sex (1983), which he produced a few weeks after starting the course. It is not very good, either technically or artistically, but it is distinctly Grayson Perry in tone and aesthetic. Grayson Perry made his first plate Kinky Sex, at an evening pottery class in 1983 The plate shows two heads in profile either side of a long-haired, crucified central figure welded to the plate by a melted coin over his or her privates (sexes are ambiguous). It is, like all his work, fantastical and pointed, realised with a drawn line that is as distinctive as his throaty cackle. There is a Hieronymus Bosch-like detail in these early bits and pieces, mischievous layers of words, picture and material that subvert the medium and the apparent naivety of the image. Essex Plate (1985), for example, gives us a nice traditional coastal landscape with a boat bobbing around under a warming sun. It's Turneresque, almost. Until you see the black clouds gathered over the heads of the outlined faces and read the words printed on the rim: ""LA LA LA LA HARMONY PEACE AND LOVE THE NON MAGICK OF MEN WILL KILL US ALL."" Grayson Perry grew up in Essex, which is reflected in many of his works such as Essex Plate, 1985 Grayson wears his heart on his work. He reveals his frustrations as well as his fetishes in pieces such as Self Portrait Cracked and Warped (1985), in which we see his likeness served upside down on a plate. It is a sarcastic homage to the German expressionist painter Georg Baselitz, who Perry resentfully saw as a ""macho"" artist with global recognition working in a respected medium, while he struggled in obscurity making pots often perceived by a sniffy art world as lowly craft objects. Baselitz was selling his work for huge sums, Grayson was selling his for a few quid. But he was selling, as this show attests. Maybe it was only for Â£40 here and Â£50 there, but it was enough to stop him opting for career Plan B, which was to become a copywriter in an ad agency. And for that, we should be grateful. In Self Portrait Cracked and Warped (1985), Perry is referencing the German artist Georg Baselitz Baselitz was famous for his upside-down portraits, which were on show at an exhibition in Venice last year I'm sure the witty Mr Perry would have been a big success at Saatchi & Saatchi or wherever he ended up, but the world would have been a poorer place without his pagan pots and confessional plates, on which he smuggled what were then outre ideas and opinions about gender, sex, class, and taste. All art is autobiographical, but Perry's is specifically so, in much the same way as that of his fellow contemporary British artist Tracey Emin, who also uses craft materials to tell her story. The upshot of that means this show is more than a retrospective of his early works. It's also a diary of a young transvestite artist honing his talent and finding his way in the highly competitive art world of the late 1980s and early '90s when the YBAs (Young British Artists) ruled the roost. There is a rawness to his art, which goes beyond what he describes as technical ""ineptitude"", and leans towards a punk-influenced anger and distaste for establishment conventions. Can you imagine Bernard Leach, the father of modern British pottery, approving of Untitled (1988)? It is an oval, glazed terracotta plate with a cream background, on which we see a tableau consisting of a bemused transvestite with a shopping trolley surrounded by a variety of images from flowers on one side to a sinister wedding on the other. Bernard Leach, regarded as the father of British studio pottery, and Grayson Perry's Untitled, 1988 were from different eras It is testament to the formative influence of outsider art on Perry, who was struck by the honesty and directness of the images produced by the untrained and often mentally disturbed. Four years later he's riffing on Japanese teaware from the Edo period in a vase called Western Art in the Form of a Saki Bottle (1992). In Western Art in the Form of a Saki Bottle (1992), Perry says he was starting to understand where he ""stood within the long history of ceramics"" Here he plays the ultimate post-modernist, referencing not only Asian culture, but also Pop Art, surrealism, modernism, northern European gothic and Hogarth's English satire - all wrapped up in sincere love for a William Morris-like commitment to craftsmanship.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told US President Donald Trump of ""the need"" for the suspect in the Harry Dunn case to return to the UK, No 10 has said. In a telephone conversation with the president the prime minister spoke of ""the need to secure justice for Harry's family"", following the fatal crash. It comes after the US rejected the UK's extradition request for Anne Sacoolas. She was driving a car that was in collision with Mr Dunn's motorcycle near RAF Croughton in 2019. Downing Street said Mr Johnson had raised the issue again in a phone call with the president on Friday. Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles has said the family's determination to get justice is ""stronger than ever"" ""The Prime Minister raised the tragic case of Harry Dunn, and the need to secure justice for Harry's family,"" a spokesman said. ""He reiterated the need for the individual involved to return to the UK."" Ms Sacoolas, 42, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash in August and was able to return home to the US. The crash happened outside the Northamptonshire RAF base where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Ms Sacoolas is to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving but Mr Johnson has previously said the chance of her ever returning to the UK is very low. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom met Mr Dunn's family on Friday, the day after she had informed them of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's decision to refuse the extradition request.

"Marianne Phillips says her agent dropped the asking price of her house without permission Home sellers could be at risk of losing large sums of money when using quick-sale estate agents to find a buyer, Trading Standards has warned. It has seen dozens of cases of people losing tens of thousands of pounds off the market value of their homes. Some homeowners will accept a lower offer price to secure a speedy sale, and many firms provide a good service. But investigator Alison Farrar said Trading Standards had ""a few of these companies on their radar"" at present. ""I would imagine there are quite a few more we don't know about,"" she added. Adverts on social media and in national newspapers promise to sell people's homes within seven or 14 days, and in many cases offer a valuable service for people needing to sell quickly. But Radio 4's Money Box programme has heard examples where people have had the offer price of their homes reduced, without their knowledge or permission, by tens of thousands of pounds. Marianne Phillips is worried her three bed semi, which she agreed to put up for sale at Â£250,000, has effectively been devalued by the company she used. It dropped the asking price by Â£20,000 without her knowledge or permission. When she found out, Marianne says she was ""absolutely incredulous"". ""No way did I ever give my approval for that, I was absolutely devastated. It's a lot of money to reduce a house by without ever getting in touch with the person who owns it,"" she says. ""The equity I've built up in the house, they've just potentially wiped a lot of that out by reducing it by Â£20,000. ""It could have quite a dramatic effect on my future"". After Marianne's deal with the quick sale estate agent she was using ended, she relisted with a more traditional agent. This makes it hard to put an exact figure on how much money she might have lost. What is clear though is the stress and anxiety she has suffered, given her concern that her home has been potentially devalued by tens of thousands of pounds. Lowering the asking price of someone's home without their permission is illegal Lowering the sale price of a property without the seller's permission is also against the law. Lee Reynolds, a lawyer who specialises in Trading Standards law, says ""dropping the price of someone's house is a potential breach of what's called Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading regulations"". ""That's punishable by up to two years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. ""If it was done knowingly or recklessly it's still a potential breach."" Courier fraud: Victim 'cried for days' 'My home's freehold isn't worth the paper it's written on' 'Freehold charges cost us our dream home' 'Car payments are ruining our lives' Consumers have rights, but National Trading Standards says not many people know where to go to complain. It wants anyone who thinks they may have been dealt with unfairly by a quick sale estate agent toget in touch,external. People can also complain to one of twogovernment approved organisations,external: the Property Ombudsman Limited and the Property Redress Scheme. To be an estate agent in the UK you must be registered with one of these schemes, which are able to issue financial awards to people who've been left out of pocket. Mark Hayward, the chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents Propertymark, says people must do their research and find an estate agent - quick-sale or not - that works for them. ""I would warn people to make sure they've read the small print and to not be pushed into any price they're not comfortable with,"" he says. ""The safest way to get an estate agent is to look for one that is regulated and has professional indemnity insurance. ""[Your house] is your biggest asset, don't be rushed into making any decision."" You can hear more from BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme by listeninghere.

"The Holburne Museum in Bath will have a nightmare on its hands if its exhibition Grayson Perry: The Pre-Therapy Years is even remotely successful. There will be havoc. Punters will turn on the genteel Georgian institution like Frankenstein's monster, furious with the darkly satirical show it has created. It won't be the contents that rattles their collective cage, which is exactly what you'd expect from the Turner Prize-winning potter, but the way it has been displayed. Or, more specifically, the shortcomings of the first room of the show. It is tiny. Put a dozen or so people in there and it will feel more like a game of sardines than an art reconnaissance trip. One minute you'll be admiring a large photograph of a young, naked Grayson covered in paint, the next Mrs Stockbridge from The Crescent will be squeezing past his decorated member apologising for the coarseness of her tweed suit. You can't avoid it. The first room, that is. The exhibition is hung chronologically and most people like to start at the beginning. The good folk at the museum will have to figure out how to manage visitor flow (there's a secret door that could come into play) because the space isn't just very small, it is also full of objects and you stay in there for three films that collectively last over an hour. This is where we first meet the recently graduated Grayson who, we discover, is on the hunt for his artistic voice. He's not short of things to say - he's never short of things to say - but is yet to find the medium through which to communicate. He is living in a north London squat and hanging out with a bohemian crowd, including a pre-pop star Boy George, and, on occasion, Derek Jarman, the avant-garde film-maker and elder statesman. Grayson Perry as his alter ego Claire, 1988 Perry starts by making films, which have not aged well. He dabbles in performance art, and then accepts an invitation from his girlfriend's sister to come along to her pottery night class. And that is where this show begins, with a small brown plate called Kinky Sex (1983), which he produced a few weeks after starting the course. It is not very good, either technically or artistically, but it is distinctly Grayson Perry in tone and aesthetic. Grayson Perry made his first plate Kinky Sex, at an evening pottery class in 1983 The plate shows two heads in profile either side of a long-haired, crucified central figure welded to the plate by a melted coin over his or her privates (sexes are ambiguous). It is, like all his work, fantastical and pointed, realised with a drawn line that is as distinctive as his throaty cackle. There is a Hieronymus Bosch-like detail in these early bits and pieces, mischievous layers of words, picture and material that subvert the medium and the apparent naivety of the image. Essex Plate (1985), for example, gives us a nice traditional coastal landscape with a boat bobbing around under a warming sun. It's Turneresque, almost. Until you see the black clouds gathered over the heads of the outlined faces and read the words printed on the rim: ""LA LA LA LA HARMONY PEACE AND LOVE THE NON MAGICK OF MEN WILL KILL US ALL."" Grayson Perry grew up in Essex, which is reflected in many of his works such as Essex Plate, 1985 Grayson wears his heart on his work. He reveals his frustrations as well as his fetishes in pieces such as Self Portrait Cracked and Warped (1985), in which we see his likeness served upside down on a plate. It is a sarcastic homage to the German expressionist painter Georg Baselitz, who Perry resentfully saw as a ""macho"" artist with global recognition working in a respected medium, while he struggled in obscurity making pots often perceived by a sniffy art world as lowly craft objects. Baselitz was selling his work for huge sums, Grayson was selling his for a few quid. But he was selling, as this show attests. Maybe it was only for Â£40 here and Â£50 there, but it was enough to stop him opting for career Plan B, which was to become a copywriter in an ad agency. And for that, we should be grateful. In Self Portrait Cracked and Warped (1985), Perry is referencing the German artist Georg Baselitz Baselitz was famous for his upside-down portraits, which were on show at an exhibition in Venice last year I'm sure the witty Mr Perry would have been a big success at Saatchi & Saatchi or wherever he ended up, but the world would have been a poorer place without his pagan pots and confessional plates, on which he smuggled what were then outre ideas and opinions about gender, sex, class, and taste. All art is autobiographical, but Perry's is specifically so, in much the same way as that of his fellow contemporary British artist Tracey Emin, who also uses craft materials to tell her story. The upshot of that means this show is more than a retrospective of his early works. It's also a diary of a young transvestite artist honing his talent and finding his way in the highly competitive art world of the late 1980s and early '90s when the YBAs (Young British Artists) ruled the roost. There is a rawness to his art, which goes beyond what he describes as technical ""ineptitude"", and leans towards a punk-influenced anger and distaste for establishment conventions. Can you imagine Bernard Leach, the father of modern British pottery, approving of Untitled (1988)? It is an oval, glazed terracotta plate with a cream background, on which we see a tableau consisting of a bemused transvestite with a shopping trolley surrounded by a variety of images from flowers on one side to a sinister wedding on the other. Bernard Leach, regarded as the father of British studio pottery, and Grayson Perry's Untitled, 1988 were from different eras It is testament to the formative influence of outsider art on Perry, who was struck by the honesty and directness of the images produced by the untrained and often mentally disturbed. Four years later he's riffing on Japanese teaware from the Edo period in a vase called Western Art in the Form of a Saki Bottle (1992). In Western Art in the Form of a Saki Bottle (1992), Perry says he was starting to understand where he ""stood within the long history of ceramics"" Here he plays the ultimate post-modernist, referencing not only Asian culture, but also Pop Art, surrealism, modernism, northern European gothic and Hogarth's English satire - all wrapped up in sincere love for a William Morris-like commitment to craftsmanship.

"This video can not be played Rescue teams rushed to help after the earthquake struck At least 31 people have been killed and more than 1,600 injured in a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey. The magnitude-6.8 quake centred on the town of Sivrice in Elazig province caused buildings to collapse and sent residents rushing into the street. Forty-five people have been rescued so far, with more than 20 feared to remain trapped, officials say. Earthquakes are common in Turkey - about 17,000 people died in a quake in the western city of Izmit in 1999. Friday's quake struck at about 20:55 local time (17:55 GMT). Tremors were also felt in neighbouring Syria, Lebanon and Iran. This woman was pulled from the rubble in Elazig More than 400 aftershocks were recorded, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (Afad) said. Rescue teams worked through the night, using their hands, drills and diggers to try to find people in the rubble of fallen buildings. They also brought beds and tents for those displaced, and warned residents against returning to damaged buildings because of the danger of aftershocks. Afad said that most of the casualties were in Elazig province, and deaths were also reported in the neighbouring province of Malatya. Some 1,607 people were injured by the earthquake, according to the latest count. History of deadly earthquakes Reports said an elderly woman was pulled alive from the rubble about 19 hours after the earthquake. Another woman left buried was saved after calling her relatives from her mobile phone and telling them where she was trapped. But a 12-year-old boy rescued from the wreckage later died in hospital. The quake caused many buildings to collapse Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (centre-right) attends the funeral of some of the victims in Elazig ""It was very scary - furniture fell on top of us. We rushed outside,"" AFP news agency quoted 47-year-old Melahat Can, who lives in the city of Elazig, as saying. ""Our houses collapsed...we cannot go inside them,"" a 32-year-old man from Sivrice told Reuters. The region struck by the quake, some 550km (340 miles) east of the capital Ankara, is remote and sparsely populated, so details of damage and fatalities could be slow to emerge. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cancelled plans in Istanbul on Saturday to instead visit the affected area and attend the funeral of two of the victims. ""We are doing everything we can as the state and nation, and we will continue to do so. Our efforts at all rescue sites will continue,"" he said. In its advisory on Saturday morning, the emergency authority said the overnight temperature had fallen to -8C (17.6F), with similar cold expected the following night. The Turkish Red Crescent has also dispatched hundreds of personnel with emergency supplies, it said. Sivrice, a town of about 4,000 people, is a popular tourist spot on the shore of Hazar lake, the source of the river Tigris. Are you in the area?

"This video can not be played Royal Navy veteran Paul Smith says Combat Stress saved his life A leading mental health charity for military veterans says it will not be able to take any new cases in England and Wales, because of a funding crisis. Combat Stress said its income has fallen from Â£16m to Â£10m in the current financial year partly due to cuts in NHS funding support. The charity had been receiving around 2,000 referrals for treatment a year. The NHS said new specialist services for ex-soldiers have helped more than 10,000 people to date. The NHS said in a statement its ""number one priority is providing the best care for veterans"". NHS England had previously commissioned Combat Stress to provide a six-week residential programme, providing them with more than Â£3m funding a year. After consulting veterans and their families as part of a review, it has decided instead to use this money onnew services, including community-based help,external. It also provides a range of intensive treatments and interventions for a longer period of up to 32 weeks. Soldiers 'failed by lack of mental health care' 'I feel abandoned by the Army' 'Higher levels of PTSD among veterans' But veterans' minister Johnny Mercer said he will hold an ""urgent meeting"" over Combat Stress' problems. Combat Stress said that, until 2018, it was receiving more than Â£3m a year from NHS England. But it said 90% of its income is now dependent on public donations. The charity still receives more than Â£1m from NHS Scotland and it will continue to take on new cases there and in Northern Ireland. Combat Stress,external- which describes itself as the UK's leading charity for veterans' mental health - said its decision not to take on any new referrals in England and Wales has been taken ""with great sadness"". It said it is now faced with scaling back its services and workforce and is consulting with staff about its proposals. All new referrals will now be redirected to the NHS, which Combat Stress said ""needs to demonstrate"" it can deal with the additional demands. The charity's president and former head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, said: ""The onus to treat the small minority of military veterans suffering from mental ill-health is falling on a charity that lacks the resources to meet the current demand"". He added: ""We all have a responsibility to sort this out"". Veteran trauma service 'rebuilding lives' The real model army helping veterans with mental health issues Sue Freeth, chief executive of Combat Stress, has questioned whether NHS England will be able to cope. She told the BBC: ""I don't believe the NHS can pick this up. That is why we exist."" Ms Freeth said 80% of veterans who come to her organisation have either used the NHS and have not had their needs met, or have felt unable to use NHS services. An NHS spokesman said: ""For anyone who has served in the armed forces and may be experiencing mental health difficulties help is available through speaking to their GP or contacting the dedicated NHS services directly."" A number of groups and charities have warned of a spike in the number of veterans taking their own lives. Earlier this month the body of a former soldier, Jamie Davis, was found after he went missing. His wife Alicia has criticised the ""lack of intervention"" to help him with his post-traumatic stress disorder. This video can not be played Army veteran Jamie Davis was found dead six days ago in Totton, Hampshire. Mr Davis' former commanding officer in Afghanistan has also expressed his concern. Retired Major Richard Streatfield served in Sangin in 2010 and said Mr Davis was the fourth soldier under his command to have died at home in ""similar tragic circumstances"". He said the British army and the government has a duty to dedicate time and resources to those who have been exposed to trauma. Former Royal Navy engineer Paul Smith told the BBC the government needs to do more to support military veterans. He said Combat Stress ""saved my life"" as he struggled with PTSD for 30 years after serving in the Falklands. Mr Smith said he suffered nightmares and flashbacks and became an alcoholic as a result of his military service at the age of 17. He said the clinicians at the charity know how to deal with veterans who are ""scared and frightened, people who are close to ending their lives"". ""The men and women of the military serve this country and are willing to die for this country,"" he explained. ""But they come back and it's as if the government is ignoring them.""

"Fraudsters ""operate with impunity"" as a surge in cases has left police struggling to cope, a report has found. Staff feel they cannot identify criminals and bring them to justice, the report said, at a time when there has been a 15% rise in cases. The report, by ex-Met Police Deputy Commissioner Sir Craig Mackey, found fraud now accounts for one-in-three crimes - but just 2% are detected. The Home Office said it will study Sir Craig's findings. The report also revealed fewer than 1% of police officers directly investigate fraud. And despite nearly 2,000 fraud offences being committed daily in England and Wales, just one in 50 is prosecuted. Sir Craig warned that a lack of proper investment and inadequate technology was hampering efforts to tackle the crime. Courier fraud victim 'cried for days' Pensioner loses life savings in Bitcoin fraud Fraudsters 'use tricks of speech' in cons While overall crime in England and Wales has remained ""broadly static"" over the past 12 months, reporting of fraud has jumped by 500,000 cases - a rise of 15%. The reviewfollows an investigation by the Times last year,external, which claimed call handlers forAction Fraud,external, the national fraud reporting service, had mocked victims and misled people into thinking they were dealing with police. It is estimated 86% of fraud is committed online and around 78% of cases involves offences where suspects and offenders do not live in the same area. Victims of fraud must report it to Action Fraud, which is overseen by the City of London Police, the force that specialises in fraud investigations. However, Action Fraud's call centre and computer systems are handled by private companies. Last year, an undercover Times reporter applied for a job as a call handler for one of the companies, Concentrix, at a call centre in Gourock, Inverclyde. The Times' investigation, published last August, said: Call handlers responsible for recording victims' fraud reports undertook just two weeks' training and were taught to mislead callers into thinking they are talking to police officers They quickly decide during calls whether or not to categorise victims' reports as crimes, but are told never to reveal this to victims Staff took fraud calls while distracted, napping or play-fighting Managers reportedly said the police ""do absolutely everything in their power to avoid"" investigating fraud Sir Craig visited Action Fraud as part of his review and found a number of staff had been dismissed following the newspaper's probe while others had been warned over their behaviour.

"Emily Thornberry, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Sir Keir Starmer are all hoping for the nomination Labour has experienced a surge in membership since the general election, BBC Two's Newsnight has learned. Constituency Labour parties (CLPs) have reported rises in local membership amid the ongoing leadership race, in which members will vote from 21 February. In Hammersmith, west London, the CLP has seen a 32% increase while in Bury North numbers have gone up by 26%. It is not clear whether these members have only joined to get a vote - but the surge will boost Labour's finances. The average increase in membership in the CLPs contacted by BBC Newsnight was around 20%. Unite union backs Long-Bailey for Labour leader Nandy joins Starmer on Labour leadership ballot Who will be Labour's next leader? In Hammersmith, 413 members have joined in a single month and in Bury North 202 more people have signed up. Elsewhere, Richmond, south-west London, now boasts 350 new members, up 30%, and Hove, East Sussex, has 477 more, up 21%, while Exeter has seen a 25% increase with 300 additional members. BBC Newsnight has been told the CLP of Sir Keir Starmer, who is a candidate in the leadership race, has seen its membership rise by 1,000 - almost a third. These are large increases in a short length of time. Of the CLP chairmen and chairwomen and MPs who spoke to Newsnight, virtually all seemed certain these members joined in order to have a say about the next Labour Party leader. In 2015 and 2016, the two Labour leadership contests in which Jeremy Corbyn ran, much was made about the ""entryism"" or programme of enlisting new members to vote for the left-wing candidate. The intentions of all the new members this time is not certain - there are simply too many of them to be sure. However, sources within local parties are confident many if not most had joined to vote against the left-wing candidate, a reversal of what happened four years ago. One MP, in a CLP that now numbers nearly 3,000 members, told Newsnight: ""We're just trying to figure it out, but it seems that overwhelmingly the new joiners since the election are moderates who want to vote against Rebecca Long-Bailey in some form. ""A lot joined for Jess Phillips and are now deciding who next."" This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? Another constituency chairman added that in a single ward in his constituency ""there are around 100 new members and rejoiners just in my branch"". ""We've been phoning them and the overwhelming majority have joined to vote for a moderate candidate,"" he said. Another Labour source was convinced this surge meant that the probable outcome of the leadership race was certain. ""I think the contest is over to be honest: [Angela] Rayner [as deputy leader] and Starmer in the first round, unless [Lisa] Nandy really surges,"" they said. ""A lot of solidly left activists I know are pretty resigned saying things like 'when Starmer wins we'll need to be organised'."" Many CLP officers and MPs believe the party has been flooded by pro-EU members in favour of Sir Keir, someone they deem creditworthy after his advocacy of a second EU referendum. The increases in Sir Keir's own constituency of Holborn and St Pancras lend weight to this theory. These new members will be forbidden from taking part in the constituency nomination process, as a result of long-standing Labour Party rules. However, they will have a vote in the upcoming leader and deputy leader contests. Such a large number of new voters in this electorate potentially makes the contest more unpredictable. However, few party insiders believe that this new infusion will benefit Jeremy Corbyn's preferred successor, Rebecca Long-Bailey. It seems improbable that there are a large pool of left-inclined voters who didn't join for Jeremy Corbyn who would choose to join now. New members will be also be a financial boon to the party. But it isn't all good news for Labour. The one exception to the new surge seems to be Scotland. Increases for CLPs in Scotland were, in some cases, in single figures - with the prospect of influencing the future of Britain's second biggest party, but Scotland's fourth, apparently failing to excite many politically inclined voters.

"Sharon Green's daughter Rebecca went rollerblading in 1996 and ""never came home"" A mother who marks every anniversary of her daughter's death by placing flowers at the roadside was ""overwhelmed"" when a stranger left a poem for her to find. Sharon Green leaves a floral tribute by the road in Sheffield where 13-year-old Rebecca was run over in 1996. Peter Fearnley actually wrote the poem in 2018 as the lyrics to a song. This year, he attached a laminated card of his verse to the railings. Ms Green found his work and they were put in touch through social media. ""I was just overwhelmed to think that someone would go and put so much effort into writing the most beautiful verse,"" Ms Green told BBC Radio Sheffield. In his poem, Mr Fearnley described the flowers as ""an epitaph and a shrine for a loved one lost too early"" ""I've seen this act of sweet remembrance for over twenty years Flowers on the railings full of tenderness and tears All the colours of the rainbow wrapped up in a pretty bow The flowers on the railings for a love that won't let go"" Rebecca was knocked down at a crossing on Penistone Road on 20 January 1996, and each year since then her mum has left flowers as a ""reminder"" for passing drivers. One of the motorists who noticed them over the years was Mr Fearnley, who commutes into Sheffield from Deepcar. Two years ago Mr Fearnley recorded asong he shared online,external, in the hope the person who left the flowers would come across it - but to no avail. ""I thought it was a really touching tribute and always felt really moved [by the flowers],"" he said. ""I've been a songwriter for many years so it was natural for me to try and put those feelings into verse."" Sharon Green's daughter Emma shared the poem on Facebook After reading the verse, Ms Green asked her daughter Emma to share it on Facebook and the following day they made contact with Mr Fearnley. ""It's absolutely wonderful,"" Ms Green said. ""I can't believe someone has been driving past for the past 24 years and taking note that the flowers were there.""

"""We are looking at this very closely,"" Nigel Adams Football has ""far too much dependency"" on sponsorship from gambling companies, according to the sports minister. Nigel Adams MP says clubs ""need to look at different sources of income"". His warning comes amid mounting scrutiny of the close relationship between sport and the betting industry. ""We're going to be reviewing the current Gambling Act and I'm sure the link between sports - football in particular - will form a part of that,"" said Adams. In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport, the minister also said he met the EFL's new chairman Rick Parry this week to discuss ongoing financial concerns in the Football League. Earlier this month the Football Association was criticised for selling the live streaming rights to FA Cup matches to betting firms via a third party. Seven gambling websites were able to show some third round matches exclusively to anyone who placed a bet or put a deposit in their account in the 24 hours before kick-off. The deal sparked outrage at a time when the FA were campaigning for mental health, and the betting companies then offered to give up their exclusivity. But the controversy reinforced fears football is being used to normalise gambling among young fans via sponsorship of shirts, and advertising at matches and during TV coverage. Half of all Premier League clubs have betting firms as shirt sponsors, with the figure rising to 15 in the Championship. The Football League itself is sponsored by Sky Bet. Earlier this season, Huddersfield Town were fined by the FA after wearing a kit advertising a bookmaker's logo that breached regulations in a friendly. ""We have to look at this very carefully because problem gambling leads to serious social problems, and in some cases people have done drastic things and taken their lives, so we are looking at this very closely,"" said Adams. ""Occasionally it boils over and you get incidents like you had with some clubs who get into bother over it, like at Huddersfield Town, and the stunt there. ""So there's way too much dependency, and I'm sure the football authorities are aware of that."" Last year, Britain's biggest gambling companies voluntarily agreed to a""whistle-to-whistle"" television advertising ban,ending commercials during live sports broadcasts. But the government is now to review gambling laws, and is considering regulating the way bookmakers advertise through football. But Labour - and anti-gambling campaigners - have called for shirt sponsorship by betting companies to be outlawed, as in countries like Italy. Adams would not be drawn on whether a blanket ban on shirt sponsorship by bookmakers was possible. The EFL has said gambling companies contribute Â£40m to its clubs each year through sponsorship. In the Premier League the figure is estimated to be around Â£70m. Adams' warning comes at a time of financial turmoil in the EFL. Last week, Derby County became the latest club to be charged for breaching financial rules over the sale of its stadium. A review is also being conducted into the league's governance and financial sustainability afterthe collapse of Bury FCearlier this season, with a number of other clubs having struggled to pay wages. ""It's not a healthy picture. There aren't many football clubs in the EFL that are profitable,"" said Adams. ""I have met with the new EFL chief executive (Rick Parry) and I'm encouraged by what he said in terms of their review into broader governance. ""It's not healthy to see clubs like Bury go out of the league. You've got question marks with clubs like Macclesfield. We're taking a very keen interest."" The EFL told BBC Sport it has ""open and regular dialogue with the Government and relevant stakeholders regarding football's ongoing relationship with the gambling industry"". The EFL added in a statement it believes the gambling industry should make ""a financial contribution back into football"". ""This is currently being achieved through commercial partnerships with the EFL and a number of our member clubs,"" they said. ""However, it is important that such arrangements are delivered in a responsible manner. ""With more than Â£40m a season paid by the sector to the League and its clubs, it continues to be an important part of the EFL's financial model alongside a domestic broadcasting deal worth Â£119m a year and a number of other key revenue streams including ticketing, sponsorship and negotiated solidarity payments achieved through the sale of media rights."" Adams also described the current issues around racism in football as ""absolutely shocking"". Incidents of racism have marred a number of Premier League games this season, while England's Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Bulgaria in October 2019 washalted on multiple occasionsdue to racist chanting by supporters. ""It's a cancer in the game that we've had for many years,"" said Adams. ""The thought was that now we're in 2020 we would have got to a better place. It's not happened. ""It's good the players are taking back control and we've seen that in a number of games with the England-Bulgaria game in particular. The football authorities, the Premier League, the FA, the EFL, they're very mindful of the problem. ""It's absolutely crucial we work with everybody because it's a societal problem, not just a football problem. Every time we meet with the football authorities we are being very clear and asking them for updates on where they're getting in terms of actions. ""I think what it might possibly take is some prosecutions. We need to, ideally, see the Crown Prosecution Service taking these cases forward and bringing people to book and that may very well have an impact."" The sports minister also confirmed ongoing talks on a ""potential bid"" for the United Kingdom and Ireland to host the World Cup in 2030, though he has called for a more ""transparent"" bidding process after the controversy that surrounded England's failed attempt to host the 2018 tournament. Since the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively in December 2010, widespread corruption has been exposed in the global game, includingallegations of bribery and payment for votes. ""We want to bid for the World Cup in 2030, it's about time we had the World Cup here,"" said Adams. ""But it has to be far more transparent than it potentially was in the past and I believe that is happening. ""The prime minister is incredibly keen we land the World Cup. I want to see it here in the United Kingdom and Ireland. ""As you probably know we've got some talks going on with the devolved nations and Ireland, I met again with the FA last week to discuss the potential bid. ""It's a work in progress but I think if we have the opportunity of being the European host nation option, I think we've got a very good chance.""

Until now no president had ever attended the march, which takes place just steps from the White House, though previous Republican presidents, including George W Bush and Ronald Reagan, have addressed the group remotely. Mike Pence became the first sitting vice-president to attend the rally in 2017. Mr Trump's appearance at the 47th March for Life delighted protesters. Voters who support limiting abortion make up a key constituency for Mr Trump, who is seeking their support at the polls again in the 2020 election. On Friday, marchers in Washington shouted ""four more years"" and ""we love you"". On the streets surrounding the National Mall vendors selling Trump flags and Make America Great Again hats were aplenty. Many of the attendees sported pro-Trump merchandise, though for some, there was a distinction between liking the president and liking his anti-abortion stance. One young woman, Julia, told the BBC: ""I'm not necessarily pro-Trump, but I appreciate that the President of the United States is making the move to be here."" She added that she was unhappy at all the focus on Mr Trump as opposed to the issue. ""Until the day we can see Roe v Wade switched, [the movement] will continue, whether he's president in the next election or not."" Chuck Raymond, a financial advisor in St Louis, said: ""Without a doubt, he is the most pro-life, pro-family, pro-religious freedom president we've ever had."" Julia (right) said abortion was a key issue for her in the 2020 election Mr Trump's appearance on Friday has already made a difference for some voters. Jose Sandoval, who drove nine hours from Knoxville, Tennessee, to participate in the march, said he did not vote for Mr Trump in 2016, but his attendance has changed Mr Sandoval's mind for 2020. ""I really appreciate what he's doing for us,"" he told the BBC. ""It matters what he thinks about [abortion], and this changed my thinking about him."" Mother-daughter pair Marci and Jeanette Houle had a similar journey down to the capital - 10 hours in a bus from New Hampshire. Marci said they appreciated that the president was backing up his anti-abortion stance with his presence. ""We voted for Trump in the first place because he was the pro-life [anti-abortion] choice, that was our main concern. If his opponent [in 2020] is not pro-life, we're going to vote for Donald Trump."" In 2016,81% of Evangelical voters,external- a group for whom abortion is the biggest political issue - backed Mr Trump for president. He has continued to court them as his re-election campaign ramps up. March for Life president Jeanne Mancini said Mr Trump and his administration ""have been consistent champions for life"". But pro-choice groups said his appearance was a distraction tactic. Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said it was ""a desperate attempt to divert attention from his criminal presidency and fire up his radical base"". Allow Twitter content?

America's two main political parties are more polarised than ever on the issue of abortion. Democrats campaigning for November's White House election are unapologetically pro-choice - something many March for Life attendees said made the candidates inaccessible to anti-abortion supporters, even if they disliked Mr Trump. In 2016, the Democratic party for the first time included in its platform a call to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old law that prohibits using taxpayer money for abortions. Last year, leading White House contender Joe Biden was sharply criticised by his Democratic rivals for initially backing the Hyde Amendment. Amid uproar from the party's liberal base, he reversed course in June. Mr Trump, meanwhile, has bolstered support for anti-abortion views within the Republican party. In 2018, he was the first sitting president to address the Campaign for Life gala, sponsored by the Susan B Anthony List anti-abortion political action group. Earlier this week, the group announced it would spend $52m (Â£40m) in support of the president and Republicans in 2020. Mr Trump has appointed conservative judges, banned clinics receiving tax money from promoting abortions and barred federal money going to foreign organisations that educate about or perform abortions. Anti-abortion activists across the nation have been pushing abortion bans through state legislatures - measures that in some cases would bar an abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. What's going on with US abortion rights? Why are people talking about NY's abortion law? The women looking outside the law for abortions Last year, 17 states enacted some form of abortion restriction, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes research on abortion access. Anti-abortion groups hope the lawsuits will reach the US Supreme Court, which is now stacked with conservative-leaning justices, and ultimately result in Roe v Wade being overturned. Such a monumental decision would enable individual states, such as those in the South and Midwest, to enshrine the abortion bans they have already passed. In a few weeks, the justices are expected to take up the first major abortion related case since the arrival of Trump appointees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Sarah Schultz said the Democratic candidates seemed inaccessible for those who support the anti-abortion movement Sarah Schultz, who flew in from South Dakota for the rally, said that ""the presidency has helped [Mr Trump] figure out the issues for himself"". ""He's making a clear line,"" she said of his appearance on Friday. ""People are going to be drawn to one side or another now - they have to take a stand."" Ms Schultz adds: ""I like that the issues are clearer, but in this country, we should be able to discuss our differences without getting angry.""

"Marianne Phillips says her agent dropped the asking price of her house without permission Home sellers could be at risk of losing large sums of money when using quick-sale estate agents to find a buyer, Trading Standards has warned. It has seen dozens of cases of people losing tens of thousands of pounds off the market value of their homes. Some homeowners will accept a lower offer price to secure a speedy sale, and many firms provide a good service. But investigator Alison Farrar said Trading Standards had ""a few of these companies on their radar"" at present. ""I would imagine there are quite a few more we don't know about,"" she added. Adverts on social media and in national newspapers promise to sell people's homes within seven or 14 days, and in many cases offer a valuable service for people needing to sell quickly. But Radio 4's Money Box programme has heard examples where people have had the offer price of their homes reduced, without their knowledge or permission, by tens of thousands of pounds. Marianne Phillips is worried her three bed semi, which she agreed to put up for sale at Â£250,000, has effectively been devalued by the company she used. It dropped the asking price by Â£20,000 without her knowledge or permission. When she found out, Marianne says she was ""absolutely incredulous"". ""No way did I ever give my approval for that, I was absolutely devastated. It's a lot of money to reduce a house by without ever getting in touch with the person who owns it,"" she says. ""The equity I've built up in the house, they've just potentially wiped a lot of that out by reducing it by Â£20,000. ""It could have quite a dramatic effect on my future"". After Marianne's deal with the quick sale estate agent she was using ended, she relisted with a more traditional agent. This makes it hard to put an exact figure on how much money she might have lost. What is clear though is the stress and anxiety she has suffered, given her concern that her home has been potentially devalued by tens of thousands of pounds. Lowering the asking price of someone's home without their permission is illegal Lowering the sale price of a property without the seller's permission is also against the law. Lee Reynolds, a lawyer who specialises in Trading Standards law, says ""dropping the price of someone's house is a potential breach of what's called Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading regulations"". ""That's punishable by up to two years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. ""If it was done knowingly or recklessly it's still a potential breach.""

"Sharon Green's daughter Rebecca went rollerblading in 1996 and ""never came home"" A mother who marks every anniversary of her daughter's death by placing flowers at the roadside was ""overwhelmed"" when a stranger left a poem for her to find. Sharon Green leaves a floral tribute by the road in Sheffield where 13-year-old Rebecca was run over in 1996. Peter Fearnley actually wrote the poem in 2018 as the lyrics to a song. This year, he attached a laminated card of his verse to the railings. Ms Green found his work and they were put in touch through social media. ""I was just overwhelmed to think that someone would go and put so much effort into writing the most beautiful verse,"" Ms Green told BBC Radio Sheffield. In his poem, Mr Fearnley described the flowers as ""an epitaph and a shrine for a loved one lost too early"" ""I've seen this act of sweet remembrance for over twenty years Flowers on the railings full of tenderness and tears All the colours of the rainbow wrapped up in a pretty bow The flowers on the railings for a love that won't let go"" Rebecca was knocked down at a crossing on Penistone Road on 20 January 1996, and each year since then her mum has left flowers as a ""reminder"" for passing drivers. One of the motorists who noticed them over the years was Mr Fearnley, who commutes into Sheffield from Deepcar. Two years ago Mr Fearnley recorded asong he shared online,external, in the hope the person who left the flowers would come across it - but to no avail. ""I thought it was a really touching tribute and always felt really moved [by the flowers],"" he said. ""I've been a songwriter for many years so it was natural for me to try and put those feelings into verse."" Sharon Green's daughter Emma shared the poem on Facebook After reading the verse, Ms Green asked her daughter Emma to share it on Facebook and the following day they made contact with Mr Fearnley. ""It's absolutely wonderful,"" Ms Green said. ""I can't believe someone has been driving past for the past 24 years and taking note that the flowers were there.""

"This video can not be played What's life like in quarantined Wuhan? The spread of a deadly new virus is accelerating, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned, after holding a special government meeting on the Lunar New Year public holiday. The country is facing a ""grave situation"" Mr Xi told senior officials. The coronavirus has killed at least 56 people and infected almost 2,000 since its discovery in the city of Wuhan. The US has announced that staff at the Wuhan consulate will be evacuated on a special flight on Tuesday. The State Department said that private Americans most at risk will also be able to board the flight to San Francisco. Meanwhile, UK-based researchers have warned of a real possibility that China will not be able to contain the virus. Travel restrictions have come in place in several affected cities. From Sunday, private vehicles will be banned from central districts of Wuhan, the source of the outbreak. A second emergency hospital is to be built there within weeks to handle 1,300 new patients, and will be finished in half a month, state newspaper the People's Daily said. It is the second such rapid construction project: work on another 1,000-bed hospital has already begun. Specialist military medical teams have also been flown into Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. The urgency reflects concern both within China and elsewhere about the virus which first appeared in December. How can China build a hospital so quickly? Coronavirus sparks anxiety among Chinese overseas Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the rat, which began on Saturday, have been cancelled in many Chinese cities. Across mainland China, travellers are having their temperatures checked for signs of fever, and train stations have been shut in several cities. Allow Twitter content?

In Hong Kong, the highest level of emergency has been declared and school holidays extended. Several other nations are each dealing with a handful of cases, with patients being treated in isolation. A coronavirus is a family of viruses which include the common cold. But this virus has never been seen before, so it's been called 2019-nCov, for ""novel coronavirus"". New viruses can become common in humans after jumping across the species barrier from animals. The Sars [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] outbreak of 2003 started in bats and transferred to the civet cat which passed it on to humans. Queues have been growing at hospitals in Wuhan This new virus also causes severe acute respiratory infection. Symptoms seem to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, lead to shortness of breath and some patients needing hospital treatment. There is no specific cure or vaccine. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Based on early information, it is believed that only a quarter of infected cases are ""severe"", and the dead are mostly - though not exclusively - older people, some of whom have pre-existing conditions. The Chinese authorities suspect a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"" was the source of the outbreak. Scientists at the respected MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis in the UK have warned that it may not be possible to contain the virus to China. They say self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus is the ""only plausible explanation"" for the scale of the epidemic. Their calculations estimate each infected person is passing it onto, on average, 2.5 other people. The centre praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities, but said transmission of the virus needed to be cut by 60% in order to get on top of the outbreak. The coronavirus has killed at least 56 people This is a massive challenge, the scientists suggest, which will require finding and isolating even patients with only mild symptoms that could easily be confused with other diseases. Elsewhere, a team at Lancaster University have published their estimates of the number of cases suggesting 11,000 have been infected this year. If true, that would be more than Sars. There are now 1,372 confirmed cases across China, though most are concentrated in those provinces closest to Hubei. But it has also spread abroad - in isolated cases affecting small numbers of patients. On Saturday, Australia confirmed its first four cases - first in Melbourne, and then three more in Sydney. It has also spread to Europe, with three cases confirmed in France.Tests in the UK on 31 people have come back negative, the government has said. Officials are trying to trace around 2,000 people who have recently flown to the UK from Hubei province. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France Fourteen people in UK tested for new strain The cases largely involve people who had recently travelled from the affected region in China. China's neighbours in the Asia region are on high alert, however, with cases reported in Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, South Korea and Nepal. There are also two cases in the United States, including a woman in her 60s who had returned home to Chicago from Wuhan on 13 January. Canada has a ""presumptive case"" of the virus, but the condition of the person suffering from it is deemed stable, according to a government statement. The city of Wuhan is effectively on lockdown, with heavy restrictions on travel in and out, and public transport options from buses to planes cancelled. It is a major population centre with up to 11 million inhabitants - comparable in size to London. Pharmacies in the city have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been filled with nervous members of the public. Officials have urged people to avoid crowds and gatherings. ""The whole transport system has been shut down,"" Kathleen Bell, who is is originally from the UK and works in Wuhan, told the BBC. ""From midnight tonight private cars are not allowed on the road. And taxis aren't running."" Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began How do you quarantine a city - and does it work?

"""We are looking at this very closely,"" Nigel Adams Football has ""far too much dependency"" on sponsorship from gambling companies, according to the sports minister. Nigel Adams MP says clubs ""need to look at different sources of income"". His warning comes amid mounting scrutiny of the close relationship between sport and the betting industry. ""We're going to be reviewing the current Gambling Act and I'm sure the link between sports - football in particular - will form a part of that,"" said Adams. In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport, the minister also said he met the EFL's new chairman Rick Parry this week to discuss ongoing financial concerns in the Football League. Earlier this month the Football Association was criticised for selling the live streaming rights to FA Cup matches to betting firms via a third party. Seven gambling websites were able to show some third round matches exclusively to anyone who placed a bet or put a deposit in their account in the 24 hours before kick-off. The deal sparked outrage at a time when the FA were campaigning for mental health, and the betting companies then offered to give up their exclusivity. But the controversy reinforced fears football is being used to normalise gambling among young fans via sponsorship of shirts, and advertising at matches and during TV coverage. Half of all Premier League clubs have betting firms as shirt sponsors, with the figure rising to 15 in the Championship. The Football League itself is sponsored by Sky Bet. Earlier this season, Huddersfield Town were fined by the FA after wearing a kit advertising a bookmaker's logo that breached regulations in a friendly. ""We have to look at this very carefully because problem gambling leads to serious social problems, and in some cases people have done drastic things and taken their lives, so we are looking at this very closely,"" said Adams. ""Occasionally it boils over and you get incidents like you had with some clubs who get into bother over it, like at Huddersfield Town, and the stunt there. ""So there's way too much dependency, and I'm sure the football authorities are aware of that."" Last year, Britain's biggest gambling companies voluntarily agreed to a""whistle-to-whistle"" television advertising ban,ending commercials during live sports broadcasts. But the government is now to review gambling laws, and is considering regulating the way bookmakers advertise through football. But Labour - and anti-gambling campaigners - have called for shirt sponsorship by betting companies to be outlawed, as in countries like Italy. Adams would not be drawn on whether a blanket ban on shirt sponsorship by bookmakers was possible. The EFL has said gambling companies contribute Â£40m to its clubs each year through sponsorship. In the Premier League the figure is estimated to be around Â£70m. Adams' warning comes at a time of financial turmoil in the EFL. Last week, Derby County became the latest club to be charged for breaching financial rules over the sale of its stadium. A review is also being conducted into the league's governance and financial sustainability afterthe collapse of Bury FCearlier this season, with a number of other clubs having struggled to pay wages. ""It's not a healthy picture. There aren't many football clubs in the EFL that are profitable,"" said Adams. ""I have met with the new EFL chief executive (Rick Parry) and I'm encouraged by what he said in terms of their review into broader governance. ""It's not healthy to see clubs like Bury go out of the league. You've got question marks with clubs like Macclesfield. We're taking a very keen interest."" The EFL told BBC Sport it has ""open and regular dialogue with the Government and relevant stakeholders regarding football's ongoing relationship with the gambling industry"". The EFL added in a statement it believes the gambling industry should make ""a financial contribution back into football"". ""This is currently being achieved through commercial partnerships with the EFL and a number of our member clubs,"" they said. ""However, it is important that such arrangements are delivered in a responsible manner. ""With more than Â£40m a season paid by the sector to the League and its clubs, it continues to be an important part of the EFL's financial model alongside a domestic broadcasting deal worth Â£119m a year and a number of other key revenue streams including ticketing, sponsorship and negotiated solidarity payments achieved through the sale of media rights."" Adams also described the current issues around racism in football as ""absolutely shocking"". Incidents of racism have marred a number of Premier League games this season, while England's Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Bulgaria in October 2019 washalted on multiple occasionsdue to racist chanting by supporters. ""It's a cancer in the game that we've had for many years,"" said Adams. ""The thought was that now we're in 2020 we would have got to a better place. It's not happened. ""It's good the players are taking back control and we've seen that in a number of games with the England-Bulgaria game in particular. The football authorities, the Premier League, the FA, the EFL, they're very mindful of the problem. ""It's absolutely crucial we work with everybody because it's a societal problem, not just a football problem. Every time we meet with the football authorities we are being very clear and asking them for updates on where they're getting in terms of actions. ""I think what it might possibly take is some prosecutions. We need to, ideally, see the Crown Prosecution Service taking these cases forward and bringing people to book and that may very well have an impact."" The sports minister also confirmed ongoing talks on a ""potential bid"" for the United Kingdom and Ireland to host the World Cup in 2030, though he has called for a more ""transparent"" bidding process after the controversy that surrounded England's failed attempt to host the 2018 tournament. Since the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively in December 2010, widespread corruption has been exposed in the global game, includingallegations of bribery and payment for votes. ""We want to bid for the World Cup in 2030, it's about time we had the World Cup here,"" said Adams. ""But it has to be far more transparent than it potentially was in the past and I believe that is happening. ""The prime minister is incredibly keen we land the World Cup. I want to see it here in the United Kingdom and Ireland. ""As you probably know we've got some talks going on with the devolved nations and Ireland, I met again with the FA last week to discuss the potential bid. ""It's a work in progress but I think if we have the opportunity of being the European host nation option, I think we've got a very good chance.""

"This video can not be played Royal Navy veteran Paul Smith says Combat Stress saved his life A leading mental health charity for military veterans says it will not be able to take any new cases in England and Wales, because of a funding crisis. Combat Stress said its income has fallen from Â£16m to Â£10m in the current financial year partly due to cuts in NHS funding support. The charity had been receiving around 2,000 referrals for treatment a year. The NHS said new specialist services for ex-soldiers have helped more than 10,000 people to date. The NHS said in a statement its ""number one priority is providing the best care for veterans"". NHS England had previously commissioned Combat Stress to provide a six-week residential programme, providing them with more than Â£3m funding a year. After consulting veterans and their families as part of a review, it has decided instead to use this money onnew services, including community-based help,external. It also provides a range of intensive treatments and interventions for a longer period of up to 32 weeks. Soldiers 'failed by lack of mental health care' 'I feel abandoned by the Army' 'Higher levels of PTSD among veterans' But veterans' minister Johnny Mercer said he will hold an ""urgent meeting"" over Combat Stress' problems. Combat Stress said that, until 2018, it was receiving more than Â£3m a year from NHS England. But it said 90% of its income is now dependent on public donations. The charity still receives more than Â£1m from NHS Scotland and it will continue to take on new cases there and in Northern Ireland. Combat Stress,external- which describes itself as the UK's leading charity for veterans' mental health - said its decision not to take on any new referrals in England and Wales has been taken ""with great sadness"". It said it is now faced with scaling back its services and workforce and is consulting with staff about its proposals. All new referrals will now be redirected to the NHS, which Combat Stress said ""needs to demonstrate"" it can deal with the additional demands. The charity's president and former head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, said: ""The onus to treat the small minority of military veterans suffering from mental ill-health is falling on a charity that lacks the resources to meet the current demand"". He added: ""We all have a responsibility to sort this out"". Veteran trauma service 'rebuilding lives' The real model army helping veterans with mental health issues Sue Freeth, chief executive of Combat Stress, has questioned whether NHS England will be able to cope. She told the BBC: ""I don't believe the NHS can pick this up. That is why we exist."" Ms Freeth said 80% of veterans who come to her organisation have either used the NHS and have not had their needs met, or have felt unable to use NHS services. An NHS spokesman said: ""For anyone who has served in the armed forces and may be experiencing mental health difficulties help is available through speaking to their GP or contacting the dedicated NHS services directly."" A number of groups and charities have warned of a spike in the number of veterans taking their own lives. Earlier this month the body of a former soldier, Jamie Davis, was found after he went missing. His wife Alicia has criticised the ""lack of intervention"" to help him with his post-traumatic stress disorder. This video can not be played Army veteran Jamie Davis was found dead six days ago in Totton, Hampshire. Mr Davis' former commanding officer in Afghanistan has also expressed his concern. Retired Major Richard Streatfield served in Sangin in 2010 and said Mr Davis was the fourth soldier under his command to have died at home in ""similar tragic circumstances"". He said the British army and the government has a duty to dedicate time and resources to those who have been exposed to trauma. Former Royal Navy engineer Paul Smith told the BBC the government needs to do more to support military veterans. He said Combat Stress ""saved my life"" as he struggled with PTSD for 30 years after serving in the Falklands. Mr Smith said he suffered nightmares and flashbacks and became an alcoholic as a result of his military service at the age of 17. He said the clinicians at the charity know how to deal with veterans who are ""scared and frightened, people who are close to ending their lives"". ""The men and women of the military serve this country and are willing to die for this country,"" he explained. ""But they come back and it's as if the government is ignoring them.""

"Content moderators are being asked to sign forms stating they understand the job could cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to reports. The Financial Times and The Verge reported moderators for Facebook and YouTube, hired by the contractor Accenture, were sent the documents. Moderators monitor objectionable materials and often view hundreds of disturbing images in a day's work. Accenture said the wellbeing of workers was a ""top priority"". In a statement the company added only new joiners were being asked to sign the forms, whereas existing employees were being sent the form as an update. ""We regularly update the information we give our people to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the work they do,"" Accenture said in a statement. Accenture is a professional services company hired by firms including Google, Facebook and Twitter. Its contractors work as outside monitors for social media sites to remove any inappropriate content. The job often requires watching and listening to disturbing posts that can be violent or sexual in nature. Both The Verge and Financial Times report that moderators were sent documents that required to them to acknowledge the mental health risks of the role. ""I understand the content I will be reviewing may be disturbing. It is possible that reviewing such content may impact my mental health, and it could even lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"" the statement read. The notices were sent to Accenture employees in the United States and Europe. The reports come as Facebook faces lawsuits from former content moderators over a range of mental health issues in California and Ireland. Facebook said it did not review Accenture's new form, but the social media firm does require its partners to offer psychological support for content moderators. Google - YouTube's parent company- also said it did not review the documents but required its partners to offer mental health support. The forms sent to the moderators outline support services on offer, including a hotline and a wellness coach. But it concedes in the forms that neither one is staffed by medical professionals and ""cannot diagnose or treat mental disorders"". Cases of PTSD and other mental health issues have been on the rise among content moderators. In 2019 The Verge published a behind the scenes report of the of Facebook Moderators. One moderator quoted in that report said he ""sleeps with a gun by his side"" after doing the job. Mental health experts say understanding the psychological strains of this job does not mitigate its risks.

"This video can not be played Inside the US base attacked by Iranian missiles The Pentagon has said that 34 US troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) following an Iranian attack on their base in Iraq. Seventeen troops are still under medical observation, a spokesman said. President Donald Trump had said no Americans were injured in the 8 January strike, which came in retaliation for the US killing of an Iranian general. Mr Trump had cited the supposed lack of injuries in his decision not to strike back against Iran. But last week, the Pentagon said 11 service members had been treated for concussion symptoms from the attack. Asked about the apparent discrepancy this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Trump said: ""I heard that they had headaches, and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report, it's not very serious."" ""I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries I have seen,"" he said when asked about possible TBIs. The Pentagon says no Americans were killed in the Iranian missile strike on the Ain al-Asad base, with most sheltering in bunkers as missiles rained down. What is the future of US troops in Iraq? Huge rally as Iraqis demand US troops pull out Iran attacks base once known as 'Camp Cupcake' On Friday, defence department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters that eight of the affected soldiers have been sent back to the US for further treatment, while another nine are being treated in Germany. Sixteen troops were treated in Iraq and one in Kuwait before all 17 were returned to active duty, officials say. Mr Hoffman added that the US Defence Secretary Mark Esper had not immediately been aware of the injuries in the days after the attack. Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America, a non-profit organisation, slammed the Trump administration for taking so long to reveal the extent of casualties. ""This is a big deal,"" its founder Paul Rieckhoff tweeted. ""The American people must be able to trust the government to share information about our sons and daughters in harms way. Nothing is more serious and sacred."" TBIs are common in warzones,according to the US military.,external The most common cause of a TBI for deployed soldiers is an explosive blast, writes the US Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. They are classified as mild, moderate, severe or penetrating. A mild TBI is also known as a concussion, and can be caused by a blast's ""atmospheric over-pressure followed by under-pressure or vacuum"". The air vacuum is capable of penetrating solid objects, making it possible for soldiers to avoid blunt force trauma but still receive an invisible brain injury. On Friday, tens of thousands of Iraqis protested in the streets Baghdad against the presence of some 5,000 foreign troops in the country. The Iraqi parliament has urged all foreign fighters - including from the US - to leave. Inside a US air base attacked by Iranian missiles.

"NHS staff are being encouraged to drive to work less and bring in reusable cups and bottles to help the health service tackle climate change. The suggestions are part of an NHS plan to cut carbon emissions to net zero and reduce air pollution. Hospitals will also be told to switch to less-polluting anaesthetic gases and reduce emissions from buildings. The plan follows the launch ofClimate Assembly UK,externalthis week, which is looking at how the UK can best get to net zero. Thegovernment has committed to the UK reaching the target- where the same volume of greenhouse gases is being emitted as is being absorbed through offsetting techniques like forestry - by 2050. Are there too many people on Earth... and other questions Climate change: Where we are in seven charts The NHS employs 1.3 million staff in England. The health and care system in England is responsible for an estimated 4%-5% of the country's carbon footprint, NHS England said. Several conditions such as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer have been partly attributed to air pollution. The three conditions are estimated to contribute to around 36,000 deaths in the UK annually. Sir Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, said: ""With almost 700 people dying potentially avoidable deaths due to air pollution every week, we are facing a health emergency as well as a climate emergency. ""Patients and the public rightly want the NHS to deliver for them today, and to help safeguard the future health of our children and grandchildren."" As part of its plans, the NHS is proposing a new standard contract this year, encouraging staff to cut back on driving to work, for example by walking or cycling, taking public transport or car sharing. Other suggestions for staff include using refillable water bottles and turning off monitors, printers and photocopiers. The health service is also establishing an expert panel to advise it on how to reach net zero and by what timescale this can be achieved. The panel will look at changes the NHS itself can make, including better use of technology to make up to 30 million outpatient appointments ""redundant"". This would spare patients ""thousands of unnecessary trips to and from hospital"", it said. It is estimated some 6.7 billion road miles each year are from patients and their visitors travelling to and from the NHS. It will also look at changes that can be made in the NHS's medical devices, consumables and pharmaceutical supply, and moving to more renewable energy. Dr Helena McKeown, from the British Medical Association, said doctors were becoming ""increasingly concerned"" about the damaging impact air pollution was having on public health. She added: ""As those tasked with looking after the health of the nation, it is positive to see that our health service is already leading by example by providing environmentally friendly healthcare for patients."" Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said its members were already changing practices to help reduce their workplace's carbon footprint and they were ""committed to extending that"". But Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said the implications for the NHS building stock were ""huge"". ""Everyone must now work together to understand how environment-harming heating and lighting systems can be replaced without redirecting funds from patient care,"" he added. The panel will submit an interim report to NHS England in the summer with the final report expected in the autumn.

"The guidance highlights the positive role dogs can play in people's lives A homeless shelter in Glasgow has announced it will allow dogs to stay with their owners, following advice from housing providers. The Glasgow City Mission will supply items such as food, bedding and treats for pets from 24 January. In November Simon Community Scotland issued guidance with Dogs Trust on the matter, highlighting how dogs could provide comfort for people with trauma. Dogs Trust estimated only about 10% of hostels were dog-friendly at the time.
