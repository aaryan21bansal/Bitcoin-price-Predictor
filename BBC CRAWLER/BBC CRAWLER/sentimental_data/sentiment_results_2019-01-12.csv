"This video can not be played Pro-Brexit activist James Goddard arrested Pro-Brexit activist James Goddard has been arrested in connection with incidents outside Parliament on Monday. Police said a man in his 30s was arrested outside St James's Park Tube station in London just before midday. He was held on suspicion of a public order offence but was later released on bail until February. Mr Goddard was involved in a protest in Westminster earlier this week during which Remain-supporting Conservative MP Anna Soubry was called a Nazi. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said Mr Goddard's supporters said he had been about to hand himself in at a London police station. His ""small"" group of supporters were angry about his arrest, our correspondent said. James Goddard was involved in a pro-Brexit protest in Westminster on Monday In recent weeks, an increasing number of protesters have gathered opposite the House of Commons, shouting and waving flags about Brexit as broadcasters interview MPs. The BBC and other broadcasters have set up temporary studios on College Green, a traditional spot for political interviews, ahead of the Commons vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on 15 January. Anna Soubry criticised police after Monday's incident On Monday, Conservative MP Anna Soubry was called a ""Nazi"" by protesters during a live BBC News interview. Earlier that day, she had faced barracking by a group of protesters as she walked to Parliament. In the wake of the incidents, Ms Soubry, who supports another Brexit referendum, criticised the police for not intervening at the time.

"Lord Hattersley has said that leaving the European Union would be a ""disaster"" Former Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley has said he supports another Brexit referendum ""very strongly"". The politician said Britons have ""a right"" to have their say on Theresa May's Brexit deal, which goes to a vote in the Commons on Tuesday. A People's Vote event has been held in Sheffield, with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable speaking. Lord Hattersley said those who voted to leave the EU had ""no idea"" what that would mean. Former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton has also said thatthe UK's approach to Brexit meant it had decided to ""tear up"" the Good Friday Agreement. Blocking Brexit could cause ""far-right surge"" Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Lord Hattersley, 86, who was due to speak at the rally but pulled out due to illness, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think the British people have a right to cast a vote on the merits of the package Mrs May has negotiated. ""They voted by a small majority to leave the union, but they had no idea what leaving the union meant. ""We now know how bad it will be. We now know that it will be much worse than remaining in, and that the British people have a right to express a view on whether they want to remain in or they want to leave."" He added that ""sometimes, you just have to do what is right"", rather than looking at what ""wins elections"" and possibly at the risk of losing Labour supporters. No deal would be the worst possible scenario and needed to be avoided, said Lord Hattersley, who previously said that leaving the European Union would be a ""disaster"". The peer, a minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, added that he did not think a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for - would happen. MPs are widely expected to reject Mrs May's deal on Tuesday, negotiated between the EU and UK, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those expected to vote against it. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling earliertold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"". He said blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism. Lord Hattersley dismissed those comments, saying not many would regard Mr Grayling as ""an expert in these matters"". Pro-EU former Conservative minister Anna Soubry also criticised Mr Grayling's comments as ""irresponsible nonsense"". David Lammy, a Labour former minister, said it was ""a desperate attempt by a government minister to use a tiny far-right minority to hold our democracy to ransom"", adding: ""It is gutter politics."" An anti-austerity march took place in central London, ending with a rally in Trafalgar Square Ms Soubry was also among those at the Sheffield rally. Lord Hattersley had been due to say that the ""vast majority"" of Labour members want the party to campaign for a new Brexit referendum if hopes of an early general election are extinguished. He was to say that ""no conceivable deal which is remotely as beneficial to Great Britain as full membership of the European Union"" and that young people would pay the price for Brexit. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have been attending an anti-austerity march in central London. The event was organised by The People's Assembly Against Austerity, with speakers including shadow chancellor John McDonnell. People gathered outside the BBC's New Broadcasting House before marching to Trafalgar Square,many wearing yellow vests- which national organiser Ramona McCartney said was to show ""solidarity with the left and working class in France"". France has seen weeks of anti-austerity demonstrations by those wearing the vests, known as the ""gilets jaunes"" movement. Addressing protesters in Trafalgar Square, Labour's John McDonnell said eight years of austerity was ""tearing apart the very social fabric"" of the UK. He said when ""the time is right"", his party will move a motion of no confidence in the government. He read a message from Mr Corbyn, saying a general election was needed to bring about a ""fairer, more equal society"". An anti-austerity protest also took place in Belfast city centre. Separately, there was a march in central London which was broadly pro-Brexit, BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said, but smaller than the anti-austerity rally, with between 200 and 300 attending.

"Murray could be seen holding his hip during practice at the Australian Open on Saturday Andy Murray's impending retirement was a decision he had to take because he is ""suffering"", says long-time rival Rafael Nadal. The 31-year-old Briton announced on Friday that he will quit this year, and next week's Australian Open could be the final tournament of his career. ""When you are going on court without a clear goal because you cannot move well and you have pain, then it is the time to take a decision,"" Nadal said. ""He will be a big loss for tennis."" Nadal, 32, knows more than most players what it is like to battle injury having had a catalogue of serious problems over the years, with his knees and wrists in particular. But the Spaniard, a 17-time Grand Slam singles champion, says he has never ""arrived"" at the point of feeling he had to quit the sport. ""I always had the feeling that we'll fix it,"" said the world number two, who begins his Australian Open campaign against home wildcard James Duckworth on Monday. ""But, of course, there are periods of time that you don't see the light. It is tough. ""I know it is hard mentally. It is tough when you have one thing, then another thing. ""Andy has probably been fighting to keep going for a long time. If he doesn't feel that the injury can become better, he has probably done the right thing for his mental health."" Scotland's Murray first met Nadal, who has won 17 Grand Slam titles, when they were teenagers and played against each other at junior tournaments. The pair have met 24 times as seniors, with the Majorcan winning 17 of the contests. ""I always had good relationship with him,"" said Nadal. ""We shared moments in my academy. We shared courts in the most important stadiums in the world, competing for the most important things. That's impossible to forget. ""So all the best to him. We will miss him. But today is him. Tomorrow another one. We are not 20 any more. Our generation, everyone is more than 30 - these kind of things happen. ""He will be a very important loss for us, for the world of tennis, for the tour, for the fans. But that's life. It seems like he had not a very long career because today players are playing that long. But he's 31 - 10 years ago, if he retired at 31, we would say he had a great and very long career.""

"Taylor Schofield died in hospital after the crash Police are questioning a man after an 11-year-old boy was killed in a hit-and-run collision. Taylor Schofield died in hospital after the collision in Beswick, Manchester, at about 18:10 GMT on Saturday. A 31-year-old man later attended a police station and was held on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He remains in custody. ""Devastated"" neighbours have said they believe Taylor was on his bike around the time the crash happened. A grey Volkswagen Golf, believed to have been involved in the collision, was found abandoned near the scene. Paying tribute to Taylor, his family said: ""Taylor was a cheeky, handsome lad who loved his mates, football and Man United. ""He was a very bright, intelligent, loving and caring kid - always smiling, making jokes. ""He's going to be missed by everyone. He was taken too soon from us."" A woman leaving a black Manchester United shirt in tribute to Taylor Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash on Albert Street. One neighbour said: ""I didn't know the lad to talk to but he loved my dog and would always stroke him. You would see him every day at the shop on his bike. It's so tragic.""

"Ministers are being warned that a proposal to scrap prison sentences of six months or less will only work if there is more investment in the probation services. The government says this approach in England and Wales' prisons could reduce overcrowding and re-offending. It is thought it would free up thousands of prison places. But the probation officers' union says the partial privatisation of the service needs to be reversed. About 30,000 offenders - including burglars and most shoplifters - could avoid jail every year under the Ministry of Justice plans. Sentences for violent and sexual crimes would not be affected by the proposed change, which has been welcomed by prison reform charities as well as trade union Napo. Ministers consider end to short jail terms Call to end 12-month prison sentences I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Spice 'causing huge problems' in prisons Ian Lawrence, Napo's general secretary, said while he supported the concept, there was ""one important caveat"". He told the BBC the part-privatisation over the past four years had ""had a massive impact on service delivery and the ability of our skilled professionals to do exactly what they should be doing"". ""Levels of supervision, in many regards, are unsatisfactory,"" he said. ""It's not conducive to proper rehabilitation. It's not cost-effective for the taxpayer. ""And what we need to see is more provision in the community for people to be given the opportunity to turn their lives around."" Mr Stewart has previously spoken of his ambition to reduce short prison terms Offenders could face sanctions such as community sentences if the proposal goes ahead, but no alternative penalties have been confirmed. Ministers argue that short jail terms are less effective at cutting reoffending than community penalties. Prisons ministerRory Stewart told the Daily Telegraph,externalthat such sentences were ""long enough to damage you and not long enough to heal you"". Arguing for the need for reform, Mr Stewart said: ""You bring somebody in for three or four weeks, they lose their house, their job, their family, their reputation. ""They come (into prison), they meet a lot of interesting characters (to put it politely) and then you whap them on to the streets again. ""The public are safer if we have a good community sentence... and it will relieve a lot of pressure on prisons."" Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, told the BBC: ""We should not be using prison for these people. We should be turning their lives around and giving them support - dealing with their drug addiction, their homelessness - and getting them to make amends for the wrong they have done. ""That's really good for victims, it's good for the taxpayer and it will ease pressure on prisons."" The Prison Reform Trust,which has previously called for a presumption against short prison sentences,external, welcomed the new proposals. Peter Dawson, the charity's director, told the Telegraph: ""Ministers should be congratulated for having the political courage to start the debate."" In Scotland, a presumption against prison sentences of less than three months is already in place and is due to be extended to 12 months. More than half of the 86,275 offenders sentenced to immediate custody in England and Wales in 2017 were handed sentences of six months or less, according to a Parliamentary response from Mr Stewart last month. The prison population has doubled in England and Wales since the early 1990s, rising from about 40,000 to more than 80,000 in 2018, official figures show. Almost two-thirds of prisoners released after sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year. What impact do short prison sentences have?

"Although there were clashes around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, there was not the same kind of violence seen in recent protests Thousands of demonstrators turned out across France for new ""yellow vests"" protests, with dozens of arrests and clashes in Paris and other cities. Police in the capital used water cannon and tear gas as scuffles broke out at the Arc de Triomphe, on the ninth consecutive weekend of protests. Some 84,000 demonstrators were recorded nationwide, an increase compared with last week, official figures show. The nationwide protests were initially triggered by the rising price of fuel. They have since widened to include anger at the cost of living, with a wide-ranging list of other demands. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Macron concessions divide protest leaders Thousands of officers were deployed across Paris, which has previously seen street clashes and vandalism, to tackle the protesters, and parts of the city centre were blocked off by riot police. Some 8,000 demonstrators were on the streets - more than in the past two weekends, when authorities counted just 3,500 people on 5 January and 800 on 29 December, according to interior ministry figures. Some 156 protesters were arrested, and as of 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT), 108 remained in custody, police said. By nightfall, there had not been the looting or burning of cars as seen in previous weeks. Skirmishes also broke out in cities around the country, including Bordeaux There were also thousands of protesters in the cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse in southern France as well as Strasbourg in the east and the central city of Bourges, the site of another major rally, where more than 6,000 people took to the streets. Nationwide, 244 people were arrested, of which 201 remained in custody, police said. Some 80,000 police officers were deployed nationwide to face the protesters.

"This video can not be played Video showed the aftermath of the explosion, with flames engulfing the ground floor Two firefighters and a Spanish woman have been killed after a huge blast at a bakery in France's capital, Paris. The emergency services were responding to a gas leak when ""a dramatic explosion"" occurred, said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Forty-seven people were injured, 10 seriously, in the blast on rue de TrÃ©vise at around 09:00 (08:00 GMT). It happened near the Paris Opera, a popular tourist area, and was felt several streets away. In pictures: Rescuers fight bakery blaze In the immediate aftermath, overturned cars and debris from other shop fronts littered the street in front of the burning bakery as people stood around, looking stunned by the force of the explosion. The Spanish woman, who was on holiday with her husband in Paris, died in hospital after the blast, while another Spanish national was also injured. The Hubert bakery at 6, rue de TrÃ©vise was not due to be open at the time of the blast, Le Parisien newspaper reports. A gas leak had been reported in the building and firefighters had been on their way to deal with it when the explosion occurred. Firefighters were hurt in the blast Helicopters landed on the nearby place de l'OpÃ©ra to evacuate the injured. Some 150 people sought refuge in the city's 9th district town hall after the blast, the deputy Paris mayor in charge of security, Colombe Brossel, told French radio.

"This video can not be played The moment Saudi teen refugee Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun arrived in Canada A Saudi teenager who fled her family alleging abuse and got stranded at a Bangkok airport has arrived in Canada after being granted asylum there. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, had been trying to reach Australia via Bangkok but was initially told to return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She refused to fly back and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room, attracting international attention. She also said she had renounced Islam, punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.

Arrested for disobeying your father #SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi woman Saudi women on what life's really like Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland introduced the teenager as ""a very brave new Canadian"" but said that Ms al-Qunun was tired from her ordeal and long journey and would not be making any public statement on Saturday. ""She is a very brave young woman who has been through a lot... and she is now going to go to her new home,"" the minister added. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier told reporters that his country had granted a request from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to grant asylum. ""Canada has been unequivocal that we will always stand up for human rights and women's rights around the world,"" he said. She arrived in Pearson International Airport on a Korean Air flight from Seoul on Saturday.

Ms Qunun told the BBC earlier that she was afraid her family would kill her. ""I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want,"" she said. Separately, she told AFP news agency she had suffered physical and psychological abuse from her family, including being locked in her room for six months for cutting her hair. A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said it considered her to be a legitimate refugee and welcomed Canada's decision to grant her asylum. ""International refugee law and overriding values of humanity have prevailed,"" said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi. Canada has previously angered Saudi Arabia after calling for the release of detained women's rights activists in the country -prompting Riyadh to expel Canada's ambassadorand freeze all new trade. Why Trudeau won't back down She had been on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight to the Thai capital, saying she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia and had an Australian visa. But she says her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight in Bangkok, leaving her stranded. A Saudi envoy in Bangkok denied any official Saudi involvement in Ms Qunun's detention, and her passport was later returned. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi asylum seeker 'taken home' by family Saudi women to get divorce notice by text Thai officials initially described her case as a ""family problem"" and said she would be repatriated back to Kuwait the next day. However, Ms Qunun sent a series of tweets pleading for help from her airport hotel room, and her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and journalists. Thailand allowed her to stay and the UN assessed her claim for asylum.

"Ministers are being warned that a proposal to scrap prison sentences of six months or less will only work if there is more investment in the probation services. The government says this approach in England and Wales' prisons could reduce overcrowding and re-offending. It is thought it would free up thousands of prison places. But the probation officers' union says the partial privatisation of the service needs to be reversed. About 30,000 offenders - including burglars and most shoplifters - could avoid jail every year under the Ministry of Justice plans. Sentences for violent and sexual crimes would not be affected by the proposed change, which has been welcomed by prison reform charities as well as trade union Napo. Ministers consider end to short jail terms Call to end 12-month prison sentences I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Spice 'causing huge problems' in prisons Ian Lawrence, Napo's general secretary, said while he supported the concept, there was ""one important caveat"". He told the BBC the part-privatisation over the past four years had ""had a massive impact on service delivery and the ability of our skilled professionals to do exactly what they should be doing"". ""Levels of supervision, in many regards, are unsatisfactory,"" he said. ""It's not conducive to proper rehabilitation. It's not cost-effective for the taxpayer. ""And what we need to see is more provision in the community for people to be given the opportunity to turn their lives around."" Mr Stewart has previously spoken of his ambition to reduce short prison terms Offenders could face sanctions such as community sentences if the proposal goes ahead, but no alternative penalties have been confirmed. Ministers argue that short jail terms are less effective at cutting reoffending than community penalties. Prisons ministerRory Stewart told the Daily Telegraph,externalthat such sentences were ""long enough to damage you and not long enough to heal you"". Arguing for the need for reform, Mr Stewart said: ""You bring somebody in for three or four weeks, they lose their house, their job, their family, their reputation. ""They come (into prison), they meet a lot of interesting characters (to put it politely) and then you whap them on to the streets again. ""The public are safer if we have a good community sentence... and it will relieve a lot of pressure on prisons."" Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, told the BBC: ""We should not be using prison for these people. We should be turning their lives around and giving them support - dealing with their drug addiction, their homelessness - and getting them to make amends for the wrong they have done. ""That's really good for victims, it's good for the taxpayer and it will ease pressure on prisons."" The Prison Reform Trust,which has previously called for a presumption against short prison sentences,external, welcomed the new proposals. Peter Dawson, the charity's director, told the Telegraph: ""Ministers should be congratulated for having the political courage to start the debate."" In Scotland, a presumption against prison sentences of less than three months is already in place and is due to be extended to 12 months. More than half of the 86,275 offenders sentenced to immediate custody in England and Wales in 2017 were handed sentences of six months or less, according to a Parliamentary response from Mr Stewart last month. The prison population has doubled in England and Wales since the early 1990s, rising from about 40,000 to more than 80,000 in 2018, official figures show. Almost two-thirds of prisoners released after sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year. What impact do short prison sentences have?

""Here's to more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world."" One year later, the music industry seems to have taken note, with female artists dominating the shortlist for 2019's ceremony. Dua is up for four awards, including best single for One Kiss; tying with pop star Anne-Marie as the year's most-nominated artist. And for only the second time in Brit Awards history, more women than men are up for the night's biggest prize, album of the year. Former winner Florence + The Machine is joined by newcomers Jorja Smith and Anne-Marie in that category; with singer-songwriter George Ezra and pop group The 1975 completing the shortlist.

With the other nominations going to dance artist Aphex Twin and R&B star Craig David, the category is Ezra's to lose. The shortlist for best female will be more hotly contested, with multiple nominees Jorja Smith, Anne-Marie, Jess Glynne and Florence + The Machine joined by Lily Allen, whose confessional, heartbreaking fourth album No Shame was one of 2018's most surprising and welcome comebacks. Arctic Monkeys may have been overlooked in the best album category, but they will be firm favourites for best group; where they square off against last year's winners Gorillaz, pop architects Years & Years, Matty Healy's The 1975 and girl group Little Mix - who receive the ninth nomination of their career.

""This is absurd,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. ""James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI,"" she said in a statement. ""Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."" In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had launched cyber-attacks and planted fake news stories on social media in a bid to boost Donald Trump and damage his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. The New York Times report said the FBI investigation was a joint counterintelligence and criminal probe. The counterintelligence part sought to establish whether Mr Trump was knowingly aiding the Kremlin against America's interests, or ""had unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence"". The criminal aspect concerned the president's sacking of Mr Comey, and whether it was an obstruction of justice. The ex-FBI director told a congressional hearing that Mr Trump told him ""I expect loyalty,"" and pressured him to end an inquiry into the president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Did Trump fire Comey as part of a cover-up? The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words All you need to know about Trump Russia story Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US. The paper says the FBI investigation was rolled into the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading an inquiry into whether Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 US election. Mr Mueller was appointed within days of Mr Comey's firing.

His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance and fraud crimes while his campaign chief Paul Manafort was convicted of financial fraud. The Times said it was not clear if the counterintelligence part of the FBI inquiry was still being pursued.

'Right to repair' gathers force Mr Gilbert said the job just requires pulling out the machine, disconnecting the hoses, removing a panel and swapping the faulty pump for a new one. Some consumer electronics fixes are even easier, said Janet Gunter, co-founder of Restart, a project which organises parties across the country where people teach each other repair skills. If you've got a faulty headphone socket on your phone, it could be caused by a build-up of dust.Simply dig out the fluff with a toothpick,external, Restart advises. Lee Gilbert is one of many repair experts producing instructional videos online Laptops and mobile phones are the usual devices in need of attention at Restart parties. There, people might learn how to stop their computer overheating -using compressed air or a brush to clean the fan,externalcan get a laptop running cooler again. For Mr Gilbert, faulty ovens which won't heat up are a common complaint. ""You turn it on and 20 minutes later, it's still cold,"" he says. He said it takes just ten minutes,externaland costs Â£20 to Â£40 to replace the heating element. Disconnect the oven from the mains, remove the screws on a cover at the back of the oven, and swap in the new element, he says. ""The oven is one of the most expensive appliances in the house. So when it doesn't heat up, people think that's going to cost them Â£600 to get a new one."" If you're new to repairing electrical appliances, Ms Gunter advises steering clear of mains-powered devices. ""It's a good idea to get started with battery-powered devices, which are much safer, as a way to get confidence,"" she says. If you are tackling larger devices, everything should be disconnected from the mains before you start, Mr Gilbert adds. He says DIYers should also watch out for scorch marks: it might indicate an electrical fault which is not safe for amateurs to tackle. ""The safety principles are pretty much common sense,"" he says. But he also advises taking photos as you go - so you can be sure to put everything back in the right place. Flat-screen TVs may look good - but it can be impossible to repair a damaged screen Restart has campaigned for products to be easier to repair with plenty of spare parts - but not all manufacturers have got the message. ""Mostly it's low-cost or off-brand appliances which are impossible to repair - you're never going to get a spare part. If your Â£6 or Â£7 kettle or toaster goes wrong, you probably can't fix it,"" Ms Gunter says. Flat-screen TVs are also often irreparable, she says. ""If the screen is damaged, it's pretty much game over."" And Ms Gunter predicts that ""bundling"" will become a growing obstacle to the right to repair. That is, some manufacturers will only sell several spare parts bundled together, making repairs more costly. ""That's the way that manufacturers will get around everything,"" she says.

"This video can not be played Fiona Bruce takes over from David Dimbleby as Question Time host, but the music stays the same. Play for an excerpt A new year brings a new host to Question Time, with new topics to be debated. But through all the change, one thing stays the same - the programme's music. Such is the legacy of its composer Stanley Myers, his cultural imprint is still felt in Hollywood as well as on British TV. But how does he link Fiona Bruce to Robert de Niro? Gone is David Dimbleby of Dimblebot and tie fame. Here comes Question Time's first new host in 25 years, Fiona Bruce. When the BBC's lively debate show returns on Thursday night, things will be different. And yet, viewers at home will still prepare in the same way. For in their ears will be something familiar; a tune that for 40 years has got heads ready for what comes next. The ticking bomb of a piece may have inspired the Dimble-dance - and soon the Bruce bop? - but it also warns of time running out and getting things wrong. It's the sound, after all, of the public grilling politicians. And it's burned into Britain's Thursday-night psyche; the national, aural shorthand for ""it's Friday tomorrow"". The music was written byStanley Myers, the late English composer for screen silver and small with more than 100 credits to his name. Poke around in his CV and there's music for episodes of vintage TV staples Z Cars and Doctor Who, along with movies The Witches, Wish You Were Here and My Beautiful Laundrette. This video can not be played David Dimbleby's memorable moments: He said he was not only aware of the Dimble-dance but knew how to throw shapes to Myers's instantly recognisable tune Dig a bit further, though, and there's a more obscure Myers credit, the 1970 film The Walking Stick. It's this movie's melody - or a version of it - that would go on to get a Hollywood leg-up when resurrected within the decade for an A-list feature. Far gentler than Question Time's thumping bluster, the haunting tune was called Cavatina, the notes of which were plucked by guitar virtuoso John Williams (not to be confused with the composer of Star Wars and Jaws). But by 1978 - and still Williams-plucked - it had become known as something else; the theme for a Robert de Niro movie. Dimbleby and Dimblebot: Question Time and social media Fiona Bruce is debate show's new host Watch Question Time Ready for some trivia-dropping fun, then? The man who wrote Question Time also wrote the music for The Deer Hunter - the acclaimed Vietnam War epic co-starring Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken. You can listenhere. There you were thinking Fiona Bruce's sole link to de Niro was someone on Question Time saying ""you talkin' to me?"" to which the reply is ""no madam, the woman next to you in the lemon blouse"". Yet joined they are - a cultural odd couple to be sure, but together in eclectic dreams; one fronting scenes of combat, the other the star of The Deer Hunter. Composer Stanley Myers had more than 100 film and TV credits to his name According to Myers,who died aged 63 in 1993,external, the toughest nut to crack was always finding a central melody; that signature through-line. ""A main theme is the hardest thing, that's what takes the longest time,"" the Birmingham-born composer said in an interview on the recording, The Deer Hunter and Other Themes. ""To write a melody - the thing that's important to the picture - is difficult and requires a lot of craftsmanship."" He needn't have worried where Cavatina was concerned. In 1978, the piece won anIvor Novello award for best instrumental work,external. Like de Niro's face, it tells you how to feel. One fronts scenes of combat, the other is in war epic The Deer Hunter The thing with awards, though, is they speak little of cultural impact. On that score, Cavatina is the gift that keeps on giving, pairing de Niro with another unlikely figure from the fabric of British cultural life - this time via vintage kids' telly. That's because as well as 'Nam, the piece found its way into Take Hart (1977-83) - an art show fronted by the kindly Tony Hart who appealed to pre-internet kids' creative instincts. Despite having war's soundtrack, there were no battles here, just minor disagreements with Morph; a shape-shifting boy made out of modelling clay. The only explosions in Tony Hart's show were ones of glitter As with Take Hart forerunner Vision On, the show's plum spot was a segment called The Gallery in which kids' sent-in pictures were shared before their peers; a sort of early Instagram but with felt tip instead of filters. For musical accompaniment, Vision On's vibraphone whimsy was bumped for Cavatina's guitar. And as its shy melancholy played for Hollywood's whizzing bullets, it played too for kids' art. But that was Myers. A man with a melody so special, it could work for both blown-out brains and a snowman by Georgina. A man versatile enough to know the sound for a flustered cabinet member. A man whose music remains seared into the national consciousness, decades after being written. Dimbleby bids moving farewell to Question Time.

"This video can not be played What's keeping Highland pubs going? Pubs in the Highlands appeared to be bucking a UK-wide trend of pub and bar closures. Since 2008, almost a quarter of pubs in the UK have shutaccording to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis,external. But the study shows that in the Highlands there are 14% more pubs than there were 10 years ago. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said a major factor behind the growth was that the pubs had done well catering for tourists. Tourism is the Highland region's most important industry and supports 25,000 jobs. Provisional figures for last year suggest almost 6.5 million visitors came to the area. Paul Waterson says Scottish pubs have been under pressure for years According to the ONS, more than 11,000 pubs have closed in the UK in the last decade - a fall of 23%. In Scotland, East Renfewshire and East Ayrshire saw the largest decline in pub numbers. The two areas have 40% fewer pubs than 10 years ago. Other areas of Scotland have also seen declines, including Moray, Angus, Fife and the Scottish Borders where there the numbers have fallen by 20% or more. But the Highlands and East Dunbartonshire, where there has been an increase of 20% or more in pubs, have experienced growth. They join places such as Ceredigion in Wales and English seaside resorts Scarborough, Blackpool and Brighton in bucking the trend. The Highland region appears to have bucked the UK trend, according to the ONS Tourism is held up as a factor in supporting Highlands businesses Mr Waterson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that Scottish pubs have had a hard time trading since the introduction of a law prohibiting smoking in public places. He said: ""We've been under pressure since around 2006 when the smoking ban came in. That was certainly a game changer. ""Also, a move towards home drinking through cheap supermarket alcohol hasn't helped. ""Thousands of pubs have closed over the last number of years, but the Highlands and Islands have bucked that trend. ""I think it is down to the pubs being well run and catering for the customer, but also a huge increase in the number of tourists coming to that area who are then well catered for in the pubs and bars in the Highlands and Islands."" Mr Waterson said pubs elsewhere in Scotland were being encouraged to tap into the tourism where possible. Bruce McGregor says he was told he was an idiot for trying to open a new bar Musician Bruce McGregor opened a new bar in Inverness on St Andrew's Day last year. He said he was told he was an ""idiot"" for trying to open such a business on the ""wrong side of town"" and against a national decline in pubs. But among his reasons for pressing ahead with his venture was to create somewhere he and his wife, and other people of the same age, could go to and enjoy Highland food, drink and live music. Mr McGregor said: ""Another reason was that there were so many tourists coming into Inverness. ""We were blown away by the numbers of tourists we saw last year - Americans, Germans, Spaniards and French."" George Callum said business can be tough for rural Highlands pubs outside of the tourist season However, George Callum, who has run a pub in Munlochy on the Black Isle for the last five years, said business could be tough for rural Highland pubs outside the tourism season. He said: ""Christmas is good but in the months between October to probably March most businesses are closed, or are struggling to keep afloat because of the lack of numbers."" Mr Callum said his pub was one of the ""lucky ones"" in being able to get business from local customers and, in the tourist season, from visitors. His pub puts on steak nights, karaoke and live music to attract customers. But he said he could understand why traditional pub-going had declined. ""We are in an age of uncertainty,"" he said, adding: ""And if you are young family it is economically better to sit and drink at home because you are going to get more for your pound.""

"Lord Hattersley has said that leaving the European Union would be a ""disaster"" Former Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley has said he supports another Brexit referendum ""very strongly"". The politician said Britons have ""a right"" to have their say on Theresa May's Brexit deal, which goes to a vote in the Commons on Tuesday. A People's Vote event has been held in Sheffield, with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable speaking. Lord Hattersley said those who voted to leave the EU had ""no idea"" what that would mean. Former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton has also said thatthe UK's approach to Brexit meant it had decided to ""tear up"" the Good Friday Agreement. Blocking Brexit could cause ""far-right surge"" Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Lord Hattersley, 86, who was due to speak at the rally but pulled out due to illness, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think the British people have a right to cast a vote on the merits of the package Mrs May has negotiated. ""They voted by a small majority to leave the union, but they had no idea what leaving the union meant. ""We now know how bad it will be. We now know that it will be much worse than remaining in, and that the British people have a right to express a view on whether they want to remain in or they want to leave."" He added that ""sometimes, you just have to do what is right"", rather than looking at what ""wins elections"" and possibly at the risk of losing Labour supporters. No deal would be the worst possible scenario and needed to be avoided, said Lord Hattersley, who previously said that leaving the European Union would be a ""disaster"". The peer, a minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, added that he did not think a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for - would happen. MPs are widely expected to reject Mrs May's deal on Tuesday, negotiated between the EU and UK, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those expected to vote against it. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling earliertold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"". He said blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism. Lord Hattersley dismissed those comments, saying not many would regard Mr Grayling as ""an expert in these matters"". Pro-EU former Conservative minister Anna Soubry also criticised Mr Grayling's comments as ""irresponsible nonsense"". David Lammy, a Labour former minister, said it was ""a desperate attempt by a government minister to use a tiny far-right minority to hold our democracy to ransom"", adding: ""It is gutter politics."" An anti-austerity march took place in central London, ending with a rally in Trafalgar Square Ms Soubry was also among those at the Sheffield rally. Lord Hattersley had been due to say that the ""vast majority"" of Labour members want the party to campaign for a new Brexit referendum if hopes of an early general election are extinguished. He was to say that ""no conceivable deal which is remotely as beneficial to Great Britain as full membership of the European Union"" and that young people would pay the price for Brexit. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have been attending an anti-austerity march in central London. The event was organised by The People's Assembly Against Austerity, with speakers including shadow chancellor John McDonnell. People gathered outside the BBC's New Broadcasting House before marching to Trafalgar Square,many wearing yellow vests- which national organiser Ramona McCartney said was to show ""solidarity with the left and working class in France"". France has seen weeks of anti-austerity demonstrations by those wearing the vests, known as the ""gilets jaunes"" movement. Addressing protesters in Trafalgar Square, Labour's John McDonnell said eight years of austerity was ""tearing apart the very social fabric"" of the UK. He said when ""the time is right"", his party will move a motion of no confidence in the government. He read a message from Mr Corbyn, saying a general election was needed to bring about a ""fairer, more equal society"". An anti-austerity protest also took place in Belfast city centre. Separately, there was a march in central London which was broadly pro-Brexit, BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said, but smaller than the anti-austerity rally, with between 200 and 300 attending.

""This is absurd,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. ""James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI,"" she said in a statement. ""Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."" In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had launched cyber-attacks and planted fake news stories on social media in a bid to boost Donald Trump and damage his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. The New York Times report said the FBI investigation was a joint counterintelligence and criminal probe. The counterintelligence part sought to establish whether Mr Trump was knowingly aiding the Kremlin against America's interests, or ""had unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence"". The criminal aspect concerned the president's sacking of Mr Comey, and whether it was an obstruction of justice. The ex-FBI director told a congressional hearing that Mr Trump told him ""I expect loyalty,"" and pressured him to end an inquiry into the president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

"This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? The partial shutdown of the US government has become the longest ever, with no end in sight to the political standoff. On Saturday it reaches its 22nd day, overtaking the previous record - the 21-day shutdown in 1995-96 under then-President Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump is refusing to approve a budget unless it includes funds for a wall on the Mexican border. Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn). About a quarter of the federal government is still out of operation until a spending plan is agreed, leaving 800,000 employees unpaid. On Friday, those workers - including prison guards, airport staff and FBI agents - missed their first salaries of the year. This video can not be played 'I don't need a wall, I want money to plant crops' Meanwhile, President Trump has calmed speculation that he is about to declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress and get the money he needs. His proposed border wall was a key election pledge. He described an emergency declaration as an ""easy way out"" and said he would prefer Congress to resolve the problem. How much has shutdown hit US economy? But he added: ""If they can't do it... I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right."" Correspondents say Democrats would mount an immediate legal challenge if Mr Trump made such a move. On Friday, some workers who missed their first payday of the year shared their blank payslips on social media. Oscar Murillo, an aerospace engineer at Nasa, posted his $0 cheque on Twitter and said he had actually lost money because of mandatory deductions. Another Twitter user, Cat Heifner, shared what she said was her brother's payslip, showing he had been paid one cent for his work as an air traffic controller. Allow Twitter content?

A food bank in Washington DC is arranging five pop-up markets on Saturday for unpaid federal workers. Radha Muthiah, head of Capital Area Food Bank, said dozens of volunteers were working to pack bags of food for affected staff. Meanwhile, the classified advertising website Craigslist has been inundated with listings from government employees trying to sell their possessions. Items ranging from beds to old toys have been listed as ""government shutdown specials"". ""Sells for $93.88 at Walmart. Asking $10,"" one advert for a child's rocking chair reads. ""We need money to pay bills."" President's Trump's promised wall - or barrier - on the Mexican border is a key issue in the shutdown Of the 800,000 federal employees going unpaid, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay-off - while the rest are continuing to work. Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits amid the financial uncertainty. One major airport, Miami International, will close an entire terminal this weekend because of a shortage of security agents caused by the shutdown. The agents are ""essential"" federal workers and expected to work - despite not being paid until the shutdown ends.

"The beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh was hugely popular with Britons but visitor numbers dropped after the flight ban Direct flights from Britain to Sharm el-Sheikh should resume, the Egyptian ambassador to the UK has said. Tarek Adel told the BBC Egypt had finished working with British security teams to upgrade its airports and was ready to welcome flights again. All UK flights to beach resort Sharm el-Sheikh were banned inNovember 2015. It followed the bombing of a Russian airliner which killed all 224 people on board. The Islamic State group claimed it was behind the attack. Sharm el-Sheikh previously attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors from the UK each year, making it an important resort for airlines and holiday companies.

Sharm el-Sheikh: Beating the flight ban Egypt 'let down' by continued UK flight ban Can Egypt's tourism recover from latest blow? The Egyptian ambassador told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped the UK government would decide to resume flights soon. ""British direct flights to Sharm el-Sheikh have been suspended since November 2015 and since that date we have been working very closely with British technical and security teams to upgrade many of the facilities in Egyptian airports in general and Sharm el-Sheikh in particular,"" Mr Adel said. ""We have concluded the work in this regard and that was in close co-ordination with the British technical teams and we are set to be ready to receive once again direct flights from Britain."" Former senior police officer Chris Phillips, who visited Sharm el-Sheikh following the bombing, told the Today programme that despite the security upgrade caution was advised. Mr Phillips said he would not travel to the Red Sea city himself. ""We have to be careful because what we may perhaps consider suitable security is not considered the same elsewhere,"" he said. Mr Phillips, who has not visited the area since 2015, said that Sharm el-Sheikh itself was very vulnerable because of its remote location. The former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office said one of the resort's issues was that the surrounding desert made it hard to control its borders because ""you can walk across the desert"". However, he said that the issue needed to be revisited by the British government because Egypt's economy needed tourism. ""It [Sharm el-Sheikh] will always be at the top end of the threat level for holiday makers.

The UK government suspended flights to the Red Sea resort following the bombing on 31 October 2015, which happened on a passenger plane soon after take-off from Sharm el-Sheikh airport. The plane was on its way to St Petersburg when it crashed More than 16,000 Britons stranded in the area were brought home on rescue flights amid increased security. Egyptian officials have since admitted that at the time, Sharm el-Sheikh airport fell well short of international security standards.

"The film has led to a craze in which people attempt everyday tasks while blindfolded Police in the US state of Utah have taken the unusual step of urging residents not to drive blindfolded after an online challenge inspired by a horror film led to a crash. A teenager with her hat over her eyes drove into oncoming traffic in the city of Layton while taking part in the so-called ""Bird Box Challenge"". The craze has come from the Netflix film Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock. Last week Netflix warned fans not to attempt the challenge. This week the same advice came from Layton police department. ""It's just inexcusable to do something as dangerous as this, not only to yourself but everyone else on the road,"" saidpolice Lt Travis Lyman, quoted by KSL.com,external. He said it was a warning he never thought he would have to give - don't drive while blindfolded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Don't lie down on bombs, Dutch warned Smartphone users warned of Antichrist risk Author says women over 50 'too old' to love In the film, Bullock plays a mother of two young children who constantly wears a blindfold to avoid seeing mysterious forces that compel people to take their own lives. She tries to guide her children - referred to as Boy and Girl - to safety along a treacherous river and through a dense forest, all without being able to see. My sleepless nights over Sandra Bullock's blindfold The film inspired some fans to set up #BirdBoxChallenge, leading to people running into walls or coming dangerously close to traffic. Netflix tweeted a warning on 2 January,external, saying: ""Can't believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE.

"This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? The partial shutdown of the US government has become the longest ever, with no end in sight to the political standoff. On Saturday it reaches its 22nd day, overtaking the previous record - the 21-day shutdown in 1995-96 under then-President Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump is refusing to approve a budget unless it includes funds for a wall on the Mexican border. Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn). About a quarter of the federal government is still out of operation until a spending plan is agreed, leaving 800,000 employees unpaid. On Friday, those workers - including prison guards, airport staff and FBI agents - missed their first salaries of the year. This video can not be played 'I don't need a wall, I want money to plant crops' Meanwhile, President Trump has calmed speculation that he is about to declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress and get the money he needs. His proposed border wall was a key election pledge. He described an emergency declaration as an ""easy way out"" and said he would prefer Congress to resolve the problem. How much has shutdown hit US economy? But he added: ""If they can't do it... I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right."" Correspondents say Democrats would mount an immediate legal challenge if Mr Trump made such a move. On Friday, some workers who missed their first payday of the year shared their blank payslips on social media. Oscar Murillo, an aerospace engineer at Nasa, posted his $0 cheque on Twitter and said he had actually lost money because of mandatory deductions. Another Twitter user, Cat Heifner, shared what she said was her brother's payslip, showing he had been paid one cent for his work as an air traffic controller. Allow Twitter content?

A food bank in Washington DC is arranging five pop-up markets on Saturday for unpaid federal workers. Radha Muthiah, head of Capital Area Food Bank, said dozens of volunteers were working to pack bags of food for affected staff. Meanwhile, the classified advertising website Craigslist has been inundated with listings from government employees trying to sell their possessions. Items ranging from beds to old toys have been listed as ""government shutdown specials"". ""Sells for $93.88 at Walmart. Asking $10,"" one advert for a child's rocking chair reads. ""We need money to pay bills."" President's Trump's promised wall - or barrier - on the Mexican border is a key issue in the shutdown Of the 800,000 federal employees going unpaid, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay-off - while the rest are continuing to work. Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits amid the financial uncertainty. One major airport, Miami International, will close an entire terminal this weekend because of a shortage of security agents caused by the shutdown. The agents are ""essential"" federal workers and expected to work - despite not being paid until the shutdown ends. Instead many agents are calling in sick in protest at the situation, the Miami Herald reports.

"The wreck is attracting curious visitors at low tide The wreck of a World War One German submarine is gradually resurfacing on a beach in northern France after decades of being buried in the sand. Shifting sand off Wissant, near Calais, is exposing the remains of the UC-61 which was stranded there in July 1917. The crew flooded the vessel and abandoned it and by the 1930s the submarine had largely been buried. It is now becoming a tourist attraction again, although the local mayor warns it may only be a fleeting visit. Since December, two sections of the submarine have been visible at low tide about 330ft (100m) from the dunes. ""The wreck is visible briefly every two to three years, depending on the tides and the wind that leads to sand movements, but a good gust of wind and the wreck will disappear again,"" said Mayor of Wissant Bernard Bracq. Missing German U-boat wreck discovered German U-boat found off Belgian coast However, local tour guide Vincent Schmitt believes the winds and tides could lead to even more of the UC-61 being exposed. ""All the residents of Wissant knew there was a submarine here, but the wreck is mostly silted and therefore invisible,"" he said. ""Pieces reappear from time to time, but this is the first time we discover so much."" German submarines, known as U-boats, targeted Allied shipping during World War One, sinking hundreds of vessels. Historians say the UC-61 was credited with sinking at least 11 ships, either by laying mines or by firing torpedoes. On its last journey, the submarine had left Zeebrugge in Belgium and was heading to Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Havre to lay mines when it ran aground. The 26 crewmen surrendered to French authorities.

"Blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism in the UK, a cabinet minister has said. Transport Secretary Chris Graylingtold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"". This could end centuries of ""moderate"" politics in the UK, he said, as he urged his colleagues to back Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal. A vote on the agreement takes place in the Commons on Tuesday. MPs are widely expected to reject the deal, negotiated between the EU and UK, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those opposing it. Some ministers have warned the UK faces Brexit ""paralysis"" if this happens. Just days before the critical vote, Mr Grayling, who campaigned to leave the EU, told the Daily Mail there would be a ""different tone"" in British politics if the UK failed to leave the EU, and predicted a ""less tolerant society"" and a ""more nationalistic nation"". ""It will open the door to extremist populist political forces in this country of the kind we see in other countries in Europe,"" Mr Grayling told the paper. ""If MPs who represent seats that voted 70% to leave say 'sorry guys, we're still going to have freedom of movement', they will turn against the political mainstream,"" he added. ""There's already a nastiness and unpleasantness in our politics, more people with extreme views, more people willing to behave in an uncivilised way,"" he said. Lord Hattersley, a former deputy Labour Party leader, dismissed Mr Grayling's comments, saying not many would regard him as ""an expert in these matters"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not believe a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has pushed for - would happen. Lord Hattersley, a minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, called for another referendum, saying the party had to risk losing the support of Labour supporters who voted to leave the EU in order to do the ""right"" thing. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. There have been pro-Brexit protests at Westminster Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Mr Grayling's intervention comes after his Conservative colleagues warned about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with no deal. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said a no-deal exit would create a ""feeling of unrest"". Tory rebel Dominic Grieve,who tabled the amendment that led to a second government defeat on Brexit last week, urged the prime minister to delay Brexit if her EU deal was rejected by MPs. Mr Grieve is among a group of MPs calling for another referendum. Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Kuenssberg: Could May win?

"Jack Shepherd failed to appear in court and his whereabouts remain a mystery Three days before Jack Shepherd was due to stand trial for manslaughter by gross negligence, police found he had disappeared. He was convicted in his absence of killing Charlotte Brown in a drunken speedboat crash and has spent the last six months on the run. Can a fugitive really evade the law forever? Shepherd had been trying to impress Ms Brown when he let her drive his defective boat along the River Thames on their first date in 2015. It was a drastic error of judgement which ended with the speeding vessel capsizing, throwing the pair into the water,where the 24-year-old drowned. Rather than face the consequences, the 30-year-old web developer skipped bail before his court appearance and fled, sparking a manhunt that Ms Brown's family described as ""prolonging the agony for everyone"". He was sentenced regardless to six years in prison, not a day of which he has served, and his whereabouts remain a mystery. But should police prioritise his capture above the two dozen hardened criminals on its most wanted list -  and where do officers even start when a suspect goes on the run? The first step is to prevent a fugitive leaving the country. When officers update the UK's police national computer, marking a suspect as internationally wanted, an alert will be circulated to forces at all UK ports and across Europe, via a crime-fighting database known as the Schengen Information System II. ""If he tried to get out through one of the established ports using his ID, he'd get picked up,"" said Nick Biddis, a retired detective superintendent who led Kent Police's capture ofKenneth Noye, one of Britain's most infamous fugitives. This, however, can be circumvented using smaller ports or forged documents. And while it is not known if Shepherd has left the country, recent cases have demonstrated the ease with which criminals can slip over borders. Charlotte Brown and Shepherd shared two bottles of wine at dinner before the speedboat crash Shane O'Brien,who was wanted over the murder of Josh Hanson in 2015, left the country on a private flight from Biggin Hill Airport. He was arrested by Czech police in February 2017 while using fake Italian documents and released before officers discovered his true identity. He remains at large. Peter Bleksley, a retired Met Police detective and star of Channel 4's Hunted - which pits a team of professional investigators against contestants - said forged documents were no longer the preserve of well-connected underworld figures, thanks to illicit marketplaces on the dark web. Tech-savvy Shepherd was ""going to know his way around the dark web better than your average Joe,"" he said. A fugitive's ""family and known associations"" would be the next port of call. ""You rattle the cages of those that are near and dear to him,"" said Mr Bleksley. ""Search their homes, check their devices. Is each and every number allocated to a person or is there a phone call received from an unknown number?"" In some cases, officers would be deployed to monitor their movements. ""But this is all manpower intensive,"" he said. ""I have my concerns about just how many officers will be actively working on [Shepherd's] case."" Shane O'Brien was caught using fake documents but released before his true identity was discovered Other tactics include utilising a network of cameras, known as the automatic number plate recognition system, to track a suspect's car. An application to the Home Office for authority to trace known phone numbers, email addresses and social media accounts, could also be sought. ""You look at any phones he has used. Who has he called and emailed? Has he laid his hands on a burner [disposable] phone?"" asked Mr Bleksley. Bank accounts can be monitored or frozen. In Shepherd's case, the Met said he had not accessed any bank or line of communication that they knew of. How I took my family on the run for 19 years Can postcards catch Europe's most wanted? What happened to Carole Packman? Tony Imossi, a private investigator with more than 30 years' experience, said staying ""below the radar"" required support. To avoid detection Shepherd would have had to ditch his phone, bank accounts and all known online accounts, as well as staying away from government agencies, like the NHS. He would also have had to avoid contacting his loved ones. ""It's very difficult for someone to drop out of their circle and live completely hidden,"" said Mr Imossi. ""You need someone to have a bank account in your name, to have a car insurance in your name, all this is expensive. It requires a lot of support."" If he flew out of Britain before border staff were alerted, Shepherd could have left Europe along an established route without leaving a trace, the investigator said. ""He could have caught a flight to Gibraltar... From there he can cross the border into Spain and could then get to Morocco and be in Africa without leaving any footprint."" Kenneth Noye, who was suspected of being involved in the 1983 Brink's-Mat gold bullion raid, fled to Spain after killing a stranger in a road-rage confrontation Mr Imossi said the focus would be on building a profile of Shepherd and his acquaintances, before carrying out ""intensive surveillance"" and door-to-door inquiries. ""He will emerge eventually. He would not be living a life of luxury, drinking cocktails on a sandy beach. At some point he will run out of finances and help and will live an uncomfortable life. Even [Great Train Robber] Ronnie Biggs had to come home eventually."" The stress of evading police would eventually take its toll, Mr Bleksley added. ""Going on the run is draining, both physically and mentally."" The National Crime Agency (NCA) plays a vital role in tracking fugitives and co-ordinating the actions of police forces in the UK and abroad. It declined to detail its methods but a spokesman said officers work to ""develop intelligence"" using both ""open sources and police sources of information"". The agency's UK International Crime Bureau works with Interpol. The extradition unit of the Met's serious and organised crime command, known as SCO7, tracks foreign criminals in the UK. The force relies on counterparts in similar units abroad - like the Serious and Organised Crime Team in Holland, which has become a notorious bolthole for British fugitives. In recent years, the Dutch unit has been responsible for capturingJames Taylor,Anthony Downes and Kirk Bradley- responsible for knife, gun and grenade attacks in Liverpool. Police and the NCA work together to catch and extradite fugitives In the case of Shepherd, the Met would only confirm that the search is ""being supported by detectives from other specialist departments"". An international arrest warrant has been obtained and law enforcement agencies across the world have been alerted. Det Ch Insp Mick Norman, who is leading the hunt for the force's homicide and major crime command, said Shepherd may be using the accounts of friends or associates to evade arrest and extradition and urged anyone helping him to ""do the right thing"". Kevin Moore, a retired chief superintendent with more than 40 years of policing experience, said fugitives were often only caught when arrested for another crime. Despite technological advances -and revelations about the vast reach of Britain's intelligence services- breakthroughs in long-running manhunts also often come from tip-offs. ""Unless there is intelligence fed back that an individual is in a particular place, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack,"" Mr Moore said. ""If you have got the financial backing or are a high level criminal, if you keep your head below the parapet, it's quite easy to disappear. It's a big world."" Ms Brown's sister, Katie, has called for a review of how Shepherd was able to communicate with his lawyers while evading justice Mr Biddis, who led the team that tracked down Noye in Spain following a tip-off, said police were likely to receive daily suspected sightings of Shepherd, the majority of which are ""probably cobblers"". ""You can't ignore any. It's like panning for gold. You just have to sift through it all, looking for a nugget."" Mr Bleksley believes somebody will recognise Shepherd and contact police, describing it as ""his Achilles heel"". If he is located abroad, police will face the question of how to bring him back to the UK. In countries with existing extradition treaties - or the 28 members of the EU, which observes European Arrest Warrants - the process would be straightforward, Mr Biddis said. Elsewhere, police will have to request the Home and Foreign Offices to go through diplomatic channels and the country's judicial process. ""That can take weeks or months, if they fight it."" The NCA's most-wanted list features murderers, drug importers and billion-pound money launderers According to the NCA, 183 suspects wanted in Britain were arrested under European Arrest Warrants last year. The agency features 27 people on its most wanted list who have been convicted, or suspected of, crimes including murder, rape and importing class-A drugs. Shepherd is not currently listed. Ms Brown's sister, Katie, from Dartford, Kent, hascalled for a review of how he was able to communicate with his lawyers and win the right to appeal against his conviction, while evading justice. ""In a perfect world there would be a team of experienced, dedicated, resourceful detectives applied to the search for Shepherd,"" Mr Bleksley said. ""But, the fact of the matter is there are murders happening in the UK on a daily basis and they will need investigating too.""

"Bath council wants the power to charge a 'tourist tax' on visitors to the World Heritage Site A tourist tax could be imposed on visitors to some of the UK's leading destinations if cash-strapped councils get their way. Bath wants the power to impose a Â£1-per-night charge to allow the authority to ""put the icing back on the cake"" after years of financial restraints. The Scottish Highlands and Aberdeen are among others considering a levy. But industry figures have warned the proposals could hit the wider tourism industry hard. Visitors to Bath could be charged a Â£1-per-night levy Bath and North East Somerset Council has asked central government for the power to ""introduce a levy on local tourism and short-term holiday lettings"". The law does not currently allow councils to impose a tax on hotels or restaurants. Council leader Tim Warren said that while a levy wouldn't make a ""big difference"" to visitors' hotel bills, it would have an impact on the council's budget for services such as street improvements. He added: ""We are not asking for more money, we are asking for the opportunity to make our own money."" Aberdeen city leaders have said a levy is just one of the ""levers"" to boost the economy and offset funding cuts. The city council's co-leader, Jenny Laing, said: ""We have been considering the potential of a tourism levy since 2015, a demonstration of our determination to innovate in the face of the funding challenges we face, but no decision can be made unless the council has the devolved power to do so. ""Any decision would be based on consultation with key local stakeholders in the tourism sector to ensure their views continue to help shape future plans."" Huge crowds watched giant puppets walk through the streets of Liverpool in 2018, ten years after the city was Capital of Culture Liverpool city councillors could be about to push for a voluntary tourist tax. Tourism has boomed in the decade since the city was the 2008 European Capital of Culture year and on Wednesday the city council will debate the idea of a tax for ""cultural events"". Two members taking the idea to the city council said that while the industry is creating many jobs, they need to be sure everyone in the city can get the right training. Proposals for aÂ£2 a night hotel tax in Edinburghalso received strong public support this week, whileHighland Council is on the brink of launching its own consultationto find out if locals back plans for a tax. Skye is Scotland's second most popular destination after Edinburgh say islanders Increasing numbers of visitors to places such as the Isle of Skye have placed more pressure on public services and attractions. A council report said a levy could generate Â£5m-Â£10m to invest in improvements. The Scottish government was against allowing councils to set a tourist tax, but Nicola Sturgeon signalled a change in direction last year when she said there should befurther consultation. Elsewhere, plans were also floated for a central London levyto fund facilities such as public toilets, parks and open spaces,externalbefore being put 'on hold', partly because of uncertainty over Brexit. Tony Sophoclides, from trade body UK Hospitality, said he can understand why a tourism levy would be attractive to councils looking for new ways to bring in cash, but warned the result could be a falling incomes across all tourism businesses - far outweighing the income a levy might bring. He said the model may work in European cities and other comparable tourist destinations, but the UK has higher rates of VAT on accommodation and already scores badly in terms of tourism-price competiveness. He added: ""It's not as simple as saying it works elsewhere, so why not here.""

"The wreck is attracting curious visitors at low tide The wreck of a World War One German submarine is gradually resurfacing on a beach in northern France after decades of being buried in the sand. Shifting sand off Wissant, near Calais, is exposing the remains of the UC-61 which was stranded there in July 1917. The crew flooded the vessel and abandoned it and by the 1930s the submarine had largely been buried. It is now becoming a tourist attraction again, although the local mayor warns it may only be a fleeting visit. Since December, two sections of the submarine have been visible at low tide about 330ft (100m) from the dunes. ""The wreck is visible briefly every two to three years, depending on the tides and the wind that leads to sand movements, but a good gust of wind and the wreck will disappear again,"" said Mayor of Wissant Bernard Bracq. Missing German U-boat wreck discovered German U-boat found off Belgian coast However, local tour guide Vincent Schmitt believes the winds and tides could lead to even more of the UC-61 being exposed. ""All the residents of Wissant knew there was a submarine here, but the wreck is mostly silted and therefore invisible,"" he said. ""Pieces reappear from time to time, but this is the first time we discover so much."" German submarines, known as U-boats, targeted Allied shipping during World War One, sinking hundreds of vessels. Historians say the UC-61 was credited with sinking at least 11 ships, either by laying mines or by firing torpedoes. On its last journey, the submarine had left Zeebrugge in Belgium and was heading to Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Havre to lay mines when it ran aground. The 26 crewmen surrendered to French authorities.

Despite technological advances -and revelations about the vast reach of Britain's intelligence services- breakthroughs in long-running manhunts also often come from tip-offs. ""Unless there is intelligence fed back that an individual is in a particular place, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack,"" Mr Moore said. ""If you have got the financial backing or are a high level criminal, if you keep your head below the parapet, it's quite easy to disappear. It's a big world."" Ms Brown's sister, Katie, has called for a review of how Shepherd was able to communicate with his lawyers while evading justice Mr Biddis, who led the team that tracked down Noye in Spain following a tip-off, said police were likely to receive daily suspected sightings of Shepherd, the majority of which are ""probably cobblers"". ""You can't ignore any. It's like panning for gold. You just have to sift through it all, looking for a nugget."" Mr Bleksley believes somebody will recognise Shepherd and contact police, describing it as ""his Achilles heel"". If he is located abroad, police will face the question of how to bring him back to the UK. In countries with existing extradition treaties - or the 28 members of the EU, which observes European Arrest Warrants - the process would be straightforward, Mr Biddis said. Elsewhere, police will have to request the Home and Foreign Offices to go through diplomatic channels and the country's judicial process. ""That can take weeks or months, if they fight it."" The NCA's most-wanted list features murderers, drug importers and billion-pound money launderers According to the NCA, 183 suspects wanted in Britain were arrested under European Arrest Warrants last year. The agency features 27 people on its most wanted list who have been convicted, or suspected of, crimes including murder, rape and importing class-A drugs. Shepherd is not currently listed. Ms Brown's sister, Katie, from Dartford, Kent, hascalled for a review of how he was able to communicate with his lawyers and win the right to appeal against his conviction, while evading justice. ""In a perfect world there would be a team of experienced, dedicated, resourceful detectives applied to the search for Shepherd,"" Mr Bleksley said. ""But, the fact of the matter is there are murders happening in the UK on a daily basis and they will need investigating too.""

"This video can not be played Artist Angus Farquhar gives a tour of St Peter's Seminary An A-listed modernist building has been described as an ""albatross around our neck"" by the Roman Catholic Church, who said they could not even give it away. St Peter's Seminary in Cardross, near Dumbarton, was built in 1966 as a training college for priests. It was once described as a ""modernist masterpiece"" but closed in the 1970s and lay empty until a plan emerged to turn it into a cultural centre. However, that plan was shelved and the building is now set to remain a ruin. St Peter's Seminary was built by modernist architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein The building opened in 1966 and was deconsecrated in 1980 The seminary was used as a backdrop for a sound and light show called Hinterland by NVA in March 2016 The seminary, which is surrounded by acres of woodland, was designed by Scottish architectural firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia for the Archdiocese of Glasgow. Renowned architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein supplied the vision for the distinctive zig-zag design and concrete appearance, with internal features such as vaulted ceilings and floating staircases. St Peter's Seminary was built in 1966 as a training college for priests The seminary is considered a modernist masterpiece The structure came to be considered a modernist masterpiece but its working lifetime was short and when the number of trainee priests fell, the seminary was deconsecrated in 1980. Since then, the building has became degraded by fire, rain and vandalism, but it still regularly attracts visits from architecture students and aficionados from around the world. Its importance was recognised in 1992 when the seminary was Category A listed by Historic Scotland. Prof Alan Dunlop said the building was of international importance Architecture expert Prof Alan Dunlop told BBC Scotland its A-listing showed it was a building of international importance. He said: ""I would go as far as saying this building is as important as Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art. ""That is how high I rate its place in the pantheon of Scottish architecture. ""This is unequivocally an excellent structure that is worth saving."" The inside of the seminary pictured in 2004 before work was carried out to make the area safe Work has been carried to clear debris and make the building safe but the organisation behind the move went bust The secluded seminary has been a target for vandalism and graffiti Some have likened the building to a disused car park but others consider it a classic The Archdiocese of Glasgow has been trying to find someone to take the building on for decades but now fears it will have to remain a ruin. Its director of communications Ronnie Convery told BBC Scotland that after 40 years they were ""back to scratch"". He said: ""We would literally give it away for nothing but we can't find anyone to take it off our hands."" Church spokesman Ronnie Convery said it was a Catch-22 situation Until June last year there was hope for the building, with arts organisation NVA working on turning it into an arts venue and cultural centre. It spent about Â£3m trying to make the building safe and removing hazardous materials such as asbestos. In 2016 it staged Hinterland, a sound and light display using the ruin as a spectacular backdrop. However, NVA closed down last year, saying the challenges facing the company were ""compounded"" when a core funding bid to Creative Scotland was unsuccessful. Mr Convery said the Scottish government had recently ordered a study into what could be done to save the building for the nation. He expects that report to be published soon. The church spokesman said he thought public funding was now the only way forward. Mr Convery said: ""If someone were to go today through the forest and try to find this A-listed masterpiece they would probably be shocked because it looks to an average person, who does not have a lot of architectural background, a bit like a concrete car park that has fallen into ruin. ""For those who understand such things, the Brutalist architecture of the day, the materials used, were unique. ""It draws heavily from Le Corbusier's work in the south of France and was part of the Gillespie, Kidd and Coia and Coia empire and is considered the best of their works. ""Therefore it is a significant building for the nation and probably one that needs public money to survive."" Mr Convery added: ""The archdiocese recognises that it has the responsibility to maintain the estate, to keep it secure and provide the proper insurance cover, but as you can imagine it is a huge albatross around our neck. ""We are literally struck, it is an impossible position. ""We can't sell it, we can't give it away, we can't demolish it. We are in a Catch-22 situation."" Prof Dunlop said he hoped the government would look favourably on the building and spend money on saving it. ""I would be happy to tell them how extraordinary it is and how architects from around the world would want to come and see it,"" he said. ""It is not until you get on site and explore it that you appreciate the true qualities it has."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""In the first instance, the future of the building is a matter for the Archdiocese of Glasgow, who own the building. ""Scottish ministers asked Historic Environment Scotland for advice on potential options for the future of the former seminary, and the wider site. This is under consideration."" The seminary lies in the Argyll and Bute Council area. A spokeswoman for the council said St Peter's was on greenbelt land which restricted any possibility of new development. However, she said the area around the seminary had been designated an ""Area for Action"", which offered the possibility of opportunities for public leisure and recreational purposes.

"This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? The partial shutdown of the US government has become the longest ever, with no end in sight to the political standoff. On Saturday it reaches its 22nd day, overtaking the previous record - the 21-day shutdown in 1995-96 under then-President Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump is refusing to approve a budget unless it includes funds for a wall on the Mexican border. Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn). About a quarter of the federal government is still out of operation until a spending plan is agreed, leaving 800,000 employees unpaid. On Friday, those workers - including prison guards, airport staff and FBI agents - missed their first salaries of the year. This video can not be played 'I don't need a wall, I want money to plant crops' Meanwhile, President Trump has calmed speculation that he is about to declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress and get the money he needs. His proposed border wall was a key election pledge. He described an emergency declaration as an ""easy way out"" and said he would prefer Congress to resolve the problem. How much has shutdown hit US economy? But he added: ""If they can't do it... I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right."" Correspondents say Democrats would mount an immediate legal challenge if Mr Trump made such a move. On Friday, some workers who missed their first payday of the year shared their blank payslips on social media. Oscar Murillo, an aerospace engineer at Nasa, posted his $0 cheque on Twitter and said he had actually lost money because of mandatory deductions. Another Twitter user, Cat Heifner, shared what she said was her brother's payslip, showing he had been paid one cent for his work as an air traffic controller. Allow Twitter content?

A food bank in Washington DC is arranging five pop-up markets on Saturday for unpaid federal workers. Radha Muthiah, head of Capital Area Food Bank, said dozens of volunteers were working to pack bags of food for affected staff. Meanwhile, the classified advertising website Craigslist has been inundated with listings from government employees trying to sell their possessions. Items ranging from beds to old toys have been listed as ""government shutdown specials"". ""Sells for $93.88 at Walmart. Asking $10,"" one advert for a child's rocking chair reads. ""We need money to pay bills."" President's Trump's promised wall - or barrier - on the Mexican border is a key issue in the shutdown Of the 800,000 federal employees going unpaid, about 350,000 are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay-off - while the rest are continuing to work. Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits amid the financial uncertainty. One major airport, Miami International, will close an entire terminal this weekend because of a shortage of security agents caused by the shutdown. The agents are ""essential"" federal workers and expected to work - despite not being paid until the shutdown ends. Instead many agents are calling in sick in protest at the situation, the Miami Herald reports. The House and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill on Friday to ensure all government workers receive retroactive pay after the shutdown ends. The president is expected to sign the legislation. But that may be small consolation to those federal employees currently in dire straits, with no end in sight to the impasse. President Trump shows no signs of backing down At a roundtable discussion about border security on Friday with state and local leaders, Mr Trump again demanded that Democrats approve funding for a wall or steel barrier. How much of Trump's wall has been built? What border politicians think of Trump's wall However, the Democratic leader of the US House of Representatives said the ball was in Mr Trump's court. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters: ""When the president acts, we will respond to whatever he does."" According to the Associated Press, senior White House aide Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's son-in-law - is among those who have cautioned the president against declaring a national emergency. US media report the White House is considering diverting some of the $13.9bn allocated last year by Congress for disaster relief in such areas as Puerto Rico, Texas and California to pay for the wall. But Republican congressman Mark Meadows, who is close to the president, said that option was not under serious consideration. Have you been affected by the US government shutdown?

"This video can not be played Video showed the aftermath of the explosion, with flames engulfing the ground floor Two firefighters and a Spanish woman have been killed after a huge blast at a bakery in France's capital, Paris. The emergency services were responding to a gas leak when ""a dramatic explosion"" occurred, said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Forty-seven people were injured, 10 seriously, in the blast on rue de TrÃ©vise at around 09:00 (08:00 GMT). It happened near the Paris Opera, a popular tourist area, and was felt several streets away. In pictures: Rescuers fight bakery blaze In the immediate aftermath, overturned cars and debris from other shop fronts littered the street in front of the burning bakery as people stood around, looking stunned by the force of the explosion. The Spanish woman, who was on holiday with her husband in Paris, died in hospital after the blast, while another Spanish national was also injured. The Hubert bakery at 6, rue de TrÃ©vise was not due to be open at the time of the blast, Le Parisien newspaper reports. A gas leak had been reported in the building and firefighters had been on their way to deal with it when the explosion occurred. Firefighters were hurt in the blast Helicopters landed on the nearby place de l'OpÃ©ra to evacuate the injured. Some 150 people sought refuge in the city's 9th district town hall after the blast, the deputy Paris mayor in charge of security, Colombe Brossel, told French radio.

"Blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism in the UK, a cabinet minister has said. Transport Secretary Chris Graylingtold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"". This could end centuries of ""moderate"" politics in the UK, he said, as he urged his colleagues to back Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal. A vote on the agreement takes place in the Commons on Tuesday. MPs are widely expected to reject the deal, negotiated between the EU and UK, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those opposing it. Some ministers have warned the UK faces Brexit ""paralysis"" if this happens. Just days before the critical vote, Mr Grayling, who campaigned to leave the EU, told the Daily Mail there would be a ""different tone"" in British politics if the UK failed to leave the EU, and predicted a ""less tolerant society"" and a ""more nationalistic nation"". ""It will open the door to extremist populist political forces in this country of the kind we see in other countries in Europe,"" Mr Grayling told the paper. ""If MPs who represent seats that voted 70% to leave say 'sorry guys, we're still going to have freedom of movement', they will turn against the political mainstream,"" he added. ""There's already a nastiness and unpleasantness in our politics, more people with extreme views, more people willing to behave in an uncivilised way,"" he said. Lord Hattersley, a former deputy Labour Party leader, dismissed Mr Grayling's comments, saying not many would regard him as ""an expert in these matters"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not believe a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has pushed for - would happen. Lord Hattersley, a minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, called for another referendum, saying the party had to risk losing the support of Labour supporters who voted to leave the EU in order to do the ""right"" thing. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. There have been pro-Brexit protests at Westminster Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Mr Grayling's intervention comes after his Conservative colleagues warned about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with no deal. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said a no-deal exit would create a ""feeling of unrest"". Tory rebel Dominic Grieve,who tabled the amendment that led to a second government defeat on Brexit last week, urged the prime minister to delay Brexit if her EU deal was rejected by MPs. Mr Grieve is among a group of MPs calling for another referendum. Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Kuenssberg: Could May win?

"Production of a new Jaguar engine at Bridgend was halted for a week in October Electric cars could hold the key to saving threatened jobs at Ford's plant in Bridgend, an AM has said. Fordwants to cut 370 workersin the first phase of up to 1,000 job losses, BBC Wales understands. A contract for Jaguar Land Rover engines finishes at the end of 2019, at about the same time the plant will stop making the Ford Ecoboost engine. Huw Irranca-Davies said the Welsh Government wanted to help the company set up new production lines. The Ogmore AM said: ""This decision will not be taken by Ford Bridgend but Ford Europe and Ford globally. ""However, what they do know is that they have got a willing partner within Welsh Government. ""Welsh Government has traditionally invested a heck of a lot within the Ford plant and if we need to invest again, I know the Welsh Government will want to."" He called on the company to work with the Welsh Government to look at new production lines and make electric and battery-powered cars. The job losses in Bridgend would be phased over the next two years Mr Irranca-Davies said he had spoken to Bridgend AM and former First Minister Carwyn Jones and said they were ""determined"" as was current First Minister Mark Drakeford to help. ""If we can lend assistance to Ford to retool them for the future to keep this plant there for another 20 or 30 year we will do it,"" he added. Ford: 1,000 Bridgend job losses by 2021 outlined to unions Ford Bridgend could lose 1,160 jobs in worse case scenario ""We want Ford Europe to engage with us and say 'yes, it is a brilliant workforce that has proved time and time again they are willing to adapt and confront new challenges'."" If plans go ahead, 990 jobs to be lost at Bridgend - almost half of the site's workforce - will go in two phases by 2021, as part of 1,150 losses across the UK. Ford declined to confirm the figures and said it was currently consulting with unions ahead of implementing a ""comprehensive transformation strategy"". Suzy Davies, Welsh Conservative AM for South Wales West, said it could be the ""first real test for the new first minister"". The Welsh Government backed Ford's Dragon Engine project to build itsnew generation of petrol enginesat the plant with agrant offer of Â£14.6m,external, but that will only employ about 500. Ms Davies said: ""The economy minister said that Welsh Government would only support Ford if five years sustainable and secure employment was guaranteed. ""We need to know how hard Welsh Government have pushed Ford to keep those promises?"" She also poured cold water on discussions about electric engines being manufactured at the site. ""Three years down the line, there appears to have been no progress on this,"" she added. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Questions have been raised about the future of the plant for some time. ""The Labour Welsh Government should already be at the door of the Ford management pressing them on this decision, which will seemingly lead to terrible consequences for thousands of families that rely on Ford for employment.""

It happened near the Paris Opera, a popular tourist area, and was felt several streets away.

The Spanish woman, who was on holiday with her husband in Paris, died in hospital after the blast, while another Spanish national was also injured. The Hubert bakery at 6, rue de TrÃ©vise was not due to be open at the time of the blast, Le Parisien newspaper reports. A gas leak had been reported in the building and firefighters had been on their way to deal with it when the explosion occurred. Firefighters were hurt in the blast Helicopters landed on the nearby place de l'OpÃ©ra to evacuate the injured. Some 150 people sought refuge in the city's 9th district town hall after the blast, the deputy Paris mayor in charge of security, Colombe Brossel, told French radio. A passing journalist, Emily Molli, described the vast extent of the damage. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"""With the greatest respect..."" Britons like to think they have a ""special relationship"" with the US, based on a common language and cultural, historical and political ties. But, according to one of the UK's most respected polling companies, there's one chasm the English language can't always bridge - the British love of passive-aggressive statements. In the words of YouGov,external, ""half of Americans wouldn't be able to tell that a Briton is calling them an idiot"". YouGov showed a number of common British phrases, including ""with the greatest respect"", ""I'll bear it in mind"" and ""you must come for dinner"", to Britons and Americans. ""While not all the phrases show a difference in transatlantic understanding, there are some statements where many Yanks are in danger of missing the serious passive aggression we Brits employ,"" YouGov said. The starkest difference was in the phrase ""with the greatest respect"" - which most Britons took to mean ""I think you are an idiot"", but nearly half of Americans interpreted as ""I am listening to you"".

YouGov based its survey on a popular meme of British phrases and their subtext. It's not clear who came up with the table,external, although it's done the rounds online for several years - and was first seen by the BBC in 2011 ina blog by Oxfam,external. YouGov decided to show the same phrases, and each of the meanings, to about1,700 Brits,externaland1,900 Americans,external, and asked them which matched their own interpretation the most closely. The survey showed that some - though not all - of the stereotypes in the table were statistically correct. There was plenty of common ground - for example, a majority of both British and US adults consider ""I was a bit disappointed that"" a polite way of saying ""I am annoyed that"" - rather than ""it doesn't really matter"". But those in the UK are much more likely to consider ""I'll bear it in mind"" and ""I hear what you say"" to be attempts to brush you off. And a higher proportion of Britons than Americans (44% to 31%) think ""that is a very brave proposal"" actually means ""you are insane"". The British have a long history of sarcasm Plenty of Americans working in the UK have complained about British passive-aggressiveness, or their annoying tendency to beat around the bush. Idiosyncrasies of the Brits at work Why do Brits and Americans swear so differently?

"Production of a new Jaguar engine at Bridgend was halted for a week in October Electric cars could hold the key to saving threatened jobs at Ford's plant in Bridgend, an AM has said. Fordwants to cut 370 workersin the first phase of up to 1,000 job losses, BBC Wales understands. A contract for Jaguar Land Rover engines finishes at the end of 2019, at about the same time the plant will stop making the Ford Ecoboost engine. Huw Irranca-Davies said the Welsh Government wanted to help the company set up new production lines. The Ogmore AM said: ""This decision will not be taken by Ford Bridgend but Ford Europe and Ford globally. ""However, what they do know is that they have got a willing partner within Welsh Government. ""Welsh Government has traditionally invested a heck of a lot within the Ford plant and if we need to invest again, I know the Welsh Government will want to."" He called on the company to work with the Welsh Government to look at new production lines and make electric and battery-powered cars. The job losses in Bridgend would be phased over the next two years Mr Irranca-Davies said he had spoken to Bridgend AM and former First Minister Carwyn Jones and said they were ""determined"" as was current First Minister Mark Drakeford to help. ""If we can lend assistance to Ford to retool them for the future to keep this plant there for another 20 or 30 year we will do it,"" he added. Ford: 1,000 Bridgend job losses by 2021 outlined to unions Ford Bridgend could lose 1,160 jobs in worse case scenario ""We want Ford Europe to engage with us and say 'yes, it is a brilliant workforce that has proved time and time again they are willing to adapt and confront new challenges'."" If plans go ahead, 990 jobs to be lost at Bridgend - almost half of the site's workforce - will go in two phases by 2021, as part of 1,150 losses across the UK. Ford declined to confirm the figures and said it was currently consulting with unions ahead of implementing a ""comprehensive transformation strategy"". Suzy Davies, Welsh Conservative AM for South Wales West, said it could be the ""first real test for the new first minister"". The Welsh Government backed Ford's Dragon Engine project to build itsnew generation of petrol enginesat the plant with agrant offer of Â£14.6m,external, but that will only employ about 500. Ms Davies said: ""The economy minister said that Welsh Government would only support Ford if five years sustainable and secure employment was guaranteed. ""We need to know how hard Welsh Government have pushed Ford to keep those promises?"" She also poured cold water on discussions about electric engines being manufactured at the site. ""Three years down the line, there appears to have been no progress on this,"" she added. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Questions have been raised about the future of the plant for some time. ""The Labour Welsh Government should already be at the door of the Ford management pressing them on this decision, which will seemingly lead to terrible consequences for thousands of families that rely on Ford for employment.""

"This video can not be played Artist Angus Farquhar gives a tour of St Peter's Seminary An A-listed modernist building has been described as an ""albatross around our neck"" by the Roman Catholic Church, who said they could not even give it away. St Peter's Seminary in Cardross, near Dumbarton, was built in 1966 as a training college for priests. It was once described as a ""modernist masterpiece"" but closed in the 1970s and lay empty until a plan emerged to turn it into a cultural centre. However, that plan was shelved and the building is now set to remain a ruin. St Peter's Seminary was built by modernist architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein The building opened in 1966 and was deconsecrated in 1980 The seminary was used as a backdrop for a sound and light show called Hinterland by NVA in March 2016 The seminary, which is surrounded by acres of woodland, was designed by Scottish architectural firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia for the Archdiocese of Glasgow. Renowned architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein supplied the vision for the distinctive zig-zag design and concrete appearance, with internal features such as vaulted ceilings and floating staircases. St Peter's Seminary was built in 1966 as a training college for priests The seminary is considered a modernist masterpiece The structure came to be considered a modernist masterpiece but its working lifetime was short and when the number of trainee priests fell, the seminary was deconsecrated in 1980. Since then, the building has became degraded by fire, rain and vandalism, but it still regularly attracts visits from architecture students and aficionados from around the world. Its importance was recognised in 1992 when the seminary was Category A listed by Historic Scotland. Prof Alan Dunlop said the building was of international importance Architecture expert Prof Alan Dunlop told BBC Scotland its A-listing showed it was a building of international importance. He said: ""I would go as far as saying this building is as important as Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art. ""That is how high I rate its place in the pantheon of Scottish architecture. ""This is unequivocally an excellent structure that is worth saving."" The inside of the seminary pictured in 2004 before work was carried out to make the area safe Work has been carried to clear debris and make the building safe but the organisation behind the move went bust The secluded seminary has been a target for vandalism and graffiti Some have likened the building to a disused car park but others consider it a classic The Archdiocese of Glasgow has been trying to find someone to take the building on for decades but now fears it will have to remain a ruin. Its director of communications Ronnie Convery told BBC Scotland that after 40 years they were ""back to scratch"". He said: ""We would literally give it away for nothing but we can't find anyone to take it off our hands."" Church spokesman Ronnie Convery said it was a Catch-22 situation Until June last year there was hope for the building, with arts organisation NVA working on turning it into an arts venue and cultural centre. It spent about Â£3m trying to make the building safe and removing hazardous materials such as asbestos. In 2016 it staged Hinterland, a sound and light display using the ruin as a spectacular backdrop. However, NVA closed down last year, saying the challenges facing the company were ""compounded"" when a core funding bid to Creative Scotland was unsuccessful. Mr Convery said the Scottish government had recently ordered a study into what could be done to save the building for the nation. He expects that report to be published soon. The church spokesman said he thought public funding was now the only way forward. Mr Convery said: ""If someone were to go today through the forest and try to find this A-listed masterpiece they would probably be shocked because it looks to an average person, who does not have a lot of architectural background, a bit like a concrete car park that has fallen into ruin. ""For those who understand such things, the Brutalist architecture of the day, the materials used, were unique. ""It draws heavily from Le Corbusier's work in the south of France and was part of the Gillespie, Kidd and Coia and Coia empire and is considered the best of their works. ""Therefore it is a significant building for the nation and probably one that needs public money to survive."" Mr Convery added: ""The archdiocese recognises that it has the responsibility to maintain the estate, to keep it secure and provide the proper insurance cover, but as you can imagine it is a huge albatross around our neck. ""We are literally struck, it is an impossible position. ""We can't sell it, we can't give it away, we can't demolish it. We are in a Catch-22 situation."" Prof Dunlop said he hoped the government would look favourably on the building and spend money on saving it. ""I would be happy to tell them how extraordinary it is and how architects from around the world would want to come and see it,"" he said. ""It is not until you get on site and explore it that you appreciate the true qualities it has."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""In the first instance, the future of the building is a matter for the Archdiocese of Glasgow, who own the building. ""Scottish ministers asked Historic Environment Scotland for advice on potential options for the future of the former seminary, and the wider site. This is under consideration."" The seminary lies in the Argyll and Bute Council area. A spokeswoman for the council said St Peter's was on greenbelt land which restricted any possibility of new development. However, she said the area around the seminary had been designated an ""Area for Action"", which offered the possibility of opportunities for public leisure and recreational purposes.

"Bath council wants the power to charge a 'tourist tax' on visitors to the World Heritage Site A tourist tax could be imposed on visitors to some of the UK's leading destinations if cash-strapped councils get their way. Bath wants the power to impose a Â£1-per-night charge to allow the authority to ""put the icing back on the cake"" after years of financial restraints. The Scottish Highlands and Aberdeen are among others considering a levy. But industry figures have warned the proposals could hit the wider tourism industry hard. Visitors to Bath could be charged a Â£1-per-night levy Bath and North East Somerset Council has asked central government for the power to ""introduce a levy on local tourism and short-term holiday lettings"". The law does not currently allow councils to impose a tax on hotels or restaurants. Council leader Tim Warren said that while a levy wouldn't make a ""big difference"" to visitors' hotel bills, it would have an impact on the council's budget for services such as street improvements. He added: ""We are not asking for more money, we are asking for the opportunity to make our own money."" Aberdeen city leaders have said a levy is just one of the ""levers"" to boost the economy and offset funding cuts. The city council's co-leader, Jenny Laing, said: ""We have been considering the potential of a tourism levy since 2015, a demonstration of our determination to innovate in the face of the funding challenges we face, but no decision can be made unless the council has the devolved power to do so. ""Any decision would be based on consultation with key local stakeholders in the tourism sector to ensure their views continue to help shape future plans."" Huge crowds watched giant puppets walk through the streets of Liverpool in 2018, ten years after the city was Capital of Culture Liverpool city councillors could be about to push for a voluntary tourist tax. Tourism has boomed in the decade since the city was the 2008 European Capital of Culture year and on Wednesday the city council will debate the idea of a tax for ""cultural events"". Two members taking the idea to the city council said that while the industry is creating many jobs, they need to be sure everyone in the city can get the right training. Proposals for aÂ£2 a night hotel tax in Edinburghalso received strong public support this week, whileHighland Council is on the brink of launching its own consultationto find out if locals back plans for a tax. Skye is Scotland's second most popular destination after Edinburgh say islanders Increasing numbers of visitors to places such as the Isle of Skye have placed more pressure on public services and attractions. A council report said a levy could generate Â£5m-Â£10m to invest in improvements. The Scottish government was against allowing councils to set a tourist tax, but Nicola Sturgeon signalled a change in direction last year when she said there should befurther consultation. Elsewhere, plans were also floated for a central London levyto fund facilities such as public toilets, parks and open spaces,externalbefore being put 'on hold', partly because of uncertainty over Brexit. Tony Sophoclides, from trade body UK Hospitality, said he can understand why a tourism levy would be attractive to councils looking for new ways to bring in cash, but warned the result could be a falling incomes across all tourism businesses - far outweighing the income a levy might bring. He said the model may work in European cities and other comparable tourist destinations, but the UK has higher rates of VAT on accommodation and already scores badly in terms of tourism-price competiveness. He added: ""It's not as simple as saying it works elsewhere, so why not here.""

"Blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism in the UK, a cabinet minister has said. Transport Secretary Chris Graylingtold the Daily Mail,externalthat not leaving the EU would cause the 17 million people who voted for Brexit to feel ""cheated"". This could end centuries of ""moderate"" politics in the UK, he said, as he urged his colleagues to back Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal. A vote on the agreement takes place in the Commons on Tuesday. MPs are widely expected to reject the deal, negotiated between the EU and UK, with more than 100 Conservative MPs among those opposing it. Some ministers have warned the UK faces Brexit ""paralysis"" if this happens. Just days before the critical vote, Mr Grayling, who campaigned to leave the EU, told the Daily Mail there would be a ""different tone"" in British politics if the UK failed to leave the EU, and predicted a ""less tolerant society"" and a ""more nationalistic nation"". ""It will open the door to extremist populist political forces in this country of the kind we see in other countries in Europe,"" Mr Grayling told the paper. ""If MPs who represent seats that voted 70% to leave say 'sorry guys, we're still going to have freedom of movement', they will turn against the political mainstream,"" he added. ""There's already a nastiness and unpleasantness in our politics, more people with extreme views, more people willing to behave in an uncivilised way,"" he said. Lord Hattersley, a former deputy Labour Party leader, dismissed Mr Grayling's comments, saying not many would regard him as ""an expert in these matters"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not believe a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has pushed for - would happen. Lord Hattersley, a minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, called for another referendum, saying the party had to risk losing the support of Labour supporters who voted to leave the EU in order to do the ""right"" thing. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. There have been pro-Brexit protests at Westminster Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? UK faces Brexit 'paralysis' - Hunt Kuenssberg: What could change dynamics of Brexit vote? Mr Grayling's intervention comes after his Conservative colleagues warned about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with no deal. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said a no-deal exit would create a ""feeling of unrest"". Tory rebel Dominic Grieve,who tabled the amendment that led to a second government defeat on Brexit last week, urged the prime minister to delay Brexit if her EU deal was rejected by MPs.

"The Ministry of Justice is considering banning prison sentences of less than six months in England and Wales. Ministers argue that short jail terms are less effective at cutting reoffending than community penalties. Prisons ministerRory Stewart told the Daily Telegraph,externalthat such sentences were ""long enough to damage you and not long enough to heal you"". If such jail sentences were to be scrapped, it is thought it could free up thousands of prison places. Some 30,000 criminals, including burglars and most shoplifters, could be spared jail every year under the proposals, the Telegraph reports. Offenders could face sanctions such as community sentences but no alternative penalties have been confirmed. Overall, the measure could reduce the prison population by about 3,500, although it would require legislation. The Ministry of Justice is now considering preventing courts from imposing prison terms of less than six months unless the sentence is for a violent crime or a sexual offence. Call to end 12-month prison sentences I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Spice 'causing huge problems' in prisons In Scotland, a presumption against prison sentences of less than three months is already in place and is due to be extended to 12 months. Arguing for the need for reform, Mr Stewart told the Daily Telegraph Magazine: ""You bring somebody in for three or four weeks, they lose their house, their job, their family, their reputation. ""They come (into prison), they meet a lot of interesting characters (to put it politely) and then you whap them on to the streets again. ""The public are safer if we have a good community sentence... and it will relieve a lot of pressure on prisons."" Mr Stewart has previously spoken of his ambition to reduce short prison terms Since they took up their posts last year, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Mr Stewart have both made it clear they want to reduce the use of short prison sentences. The prison population has doubled in England and Wales since the early 1990s, rising from about 40,000 to more than 80,000 in 2018, official figures show. Almost two-thirds of prisoners released after sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year. More than half of the 86,275 offenders sentenced to immediate custody in England and Wales in 2017 were handed sentences of six months or less, according to a Parliamentary response from Mr Stewart last month. Mr Stewart said he realised that the proposals could provoke a backlash against ""soft justice"" by people in his own party and the public, but said it was ""a debate I have to win"". In August last yearhe vowed to resign in a year if he was unable to reduce drug use and violence in 10 target jails in England. The Prison Reform Trust,which has previously called for a presumption against short prison sentences,external, welcomed the new proposals. Peter Dawson, the charity's director, told the Telegraph: ""Ministers should be congratulated for having the political courage to start the debate."" He told BBC News that while the law required community penalties to contain an element of punishment, they can include other things as well such as community work, treatment for addiction and help for mental health conditions. An MoJ spokesperson said: ""As we have said previously, short sentences are too often ineffective, provide little opportunity to rehabilitate offenders and lead to unacceptably high rates of reoffending. ""That's why we are exploring potential alternatives, but this work is ongoing and we have reached no conclusions at this time.""

"The waste was piled on top of containers at health centres in Coatbridge, Kilsyth and Cumbernauld Photographs showing bags of clinical waste piled at three health centres in North Lanarkshire have been posted on social media. The images - from Coatbridge, Kilsyth and Cumbernauld - showed bags of waste on top of large waste containers. It comes after the collapse of the firm Healthcare Environmental Services (HES), which had previously processed clinical waste across Scotland. NHS Lanarkshire said the waste had since been removed and posed no risk. Following the collapse of HES in December, the Scottish government said contingency plans would ensure clinical waste continued to be disposed of safely. NHS National Services Scotland also said ""appropriate contingency measures"" were in place to process clinical waste after HES lost its service contract. However, one former HES worker, who asked not be named, said: ""The firms who have taken over the collections are working flat out, but there is weeks and weeks of waste backed up."" The pictures of the three Lanarkshire sites, reportedly taken this week, appeared on a Facebook page set up by those who said they were concerned about the HES situation. The images have since been removed. Clinical waste at Kilsyth Health Centre John Paterson, director of property and support services at NHS Lanarkshire, said. ""The waste at Coatbridge, Kilsyth and Central (in Cumbernauld) Health Centres was uplifted between 9 and 11 January. ""We have an agreed interim process in place to ensure that clinical waste is uplifted as and when required, while the national contract is resolved. ""There was a delay in uplifts being requested with these three centres, but we have taken steps to avoid this in future. This was low level clinical waste that was bagged in accordance with procedures and held in closed-off areas. There was no risk to public health."" A spokesman for the health board was unable to confirm exactly how long the waste had been lying at the sites. Shotts-based HES lost its contract to provide waste processing services with NHS England after reportsemerged in October last year that human body parts and other clinical waste was piling upafter the company struggled to incinerate it. In December, NHS Scotland announced that the firm would not have its contract continued north of the border when it came up for renewal in April. All 400 employees of HES, including 150 workers at its Shotts HQ, were made redundant Since then the company has served hundreds of redundancy notices and failed to pay the salaries of 350 staff for December. In Inverness,four porters at Raigmore Hospitalwere injured carrying out work involving clinical waste. It is understood porters at the site have had a greater role in dealing with the material following the collapse of HES. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We regard the safety of all NHS employees as paramount. ""The clinical waste contingency arrangements recently introduced across the country, have been risk assessed and safe systems of work identified, with appropriate protective equipment issued and made available to all staff.""

"Mark and Sharon Beresford launched the Win a Megahome competition in March 2018. The owners of a Â£3m home have been criticised by entrants in a so-called property raffle draw to win it. Mark and Sharon Beresford offered their luxury home in Ringwood, Hampshire, as the prize but only sold about Â£750,000 worth of the Â£25 tickets. Entrants claimed the substitute Â£110,000 cash prize was too low. Mr Beresford said he ""fully complied"" with all laws and competition rules and that he had incurred ""very high costs"" running the promotion. The Win a Megahome competition was launched in March 2018, with the 7,000sq ft Huf Haus property as the prize. After it closed at the end of the year, the couple announced ""almost 30,000"" tickets had been sold. The luxury home was described as 'an idyllic house in a fantastic location' Under the terms and conditions, if fewer than 175,000 tickets were sold, a cash prize would be offered instead. The terms allowed the Beresfords to keep a quarter of the revenue, leaving the rest for prize money, minus the costs of promoting the competition. It left prize money of Â£110,070 which was won by an unnamed person from Christchurch. Tweets, since deleted, show the couple were still promoting the house as the main prize even though ticket sales were low Many people expressed anger and frustration on social media about the promotion costs and the competition still being promoted a day before it closed, even though there was little chance the house would be the main prize. James Hill, who bought eight tickets with three friends, said: ""After the competition people clearly wanted answers as to why the prize fund was so low."" Bob Holmes, who bought six tickets, said: ""We live in a council house, so this would have been an absolute dream."" Under the terms and conditions of the competition, if fewer than 175,000 tickets were sold, a cash prize would be offered instead. Mr Beresford insisted the eventual prize was still ""substantial"" and was calculated in accordance with the terms. In a statement, he said: ""The costs incurred were very high and began in 2016 with extensive legal advice and opinions about the interpretation of the rules covering prize draw competitions. ""To do this properly is neither cheap nor for the faint of heart. We will file our accounts in line with statutory requirements."" Such property raffles, which include a question as part of the entry, are not considered as lotteries and arenot regulated by the Gambling Commission,external. Jenny Ross of Which? Money said entrants should pay close attention to terms and conditions when entering property raffles. ""The number of failed housing raffles far outweighs the very small number of successes,"" she said.
