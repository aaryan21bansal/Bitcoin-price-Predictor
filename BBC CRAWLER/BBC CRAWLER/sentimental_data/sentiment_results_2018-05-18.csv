"Like many couples tying the knot, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle asked well-wishers todonate to charity, instead of sending gifts. But, more unusually, everything from mugs and biscuit tins to swimsuits and candles has been made in honour of this couple's big day. So Reality Check wants to know - how much do we spend on souvenirs for big royal occasions? The prince and Ms Markle are to marry in Windsor, and visitors from around the world, as well as the UK and US, are expected to travel to the town to wish the couple well. The wedding has already been attracting global attention. According to theCentre for Retail Research,external, an estimated Â£30m will be spent on memorabilia (including overseas sales) in the run-up to the royal wedding. This estimate is based on a survey of 1,200 UK shoppers, with results analysed by retailers and suppliers of memorabilia. The bride and groom have also approved a range of official merchandise, produced and sold by the Royal Collection Trust. The decorative border on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's official china is inspired by the ironwork of the Gilebertus door of St George's Chapel, where they will be married. In spring 2011, when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married, more than 190,000 items of wedding-related merchandise were sold, according to the Royal Collection Trust, worth almost Â£4m. That was followed by the Queen celebrating her Diamond Jubilee, and by the end of the 2011-12 financial year, the Royal Collection Trust had sold 60,000 items of memorabilia. In both cases, commemorative china - manufactured in Stoke-on-Trent - was the most popular in the collection. The numbers show that spending on royal merchandise has increased in recent years. In 2006-07, retail sales were Â£9.1m, which had more than doubled by 2016-17, when sales were over Â£19m. Over that same time period, visitors to the royal properties - including Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace and Holyrood Palace - grew from 2 million to 2.7 million. A younger generation of royals has taken centre stage over the past decade, from the wedding of Prince William and Catherine to the birth of three royal babies and the wedding of Prince Harry and Ms Markle. But experts say that memorabilia is now just that - for the memories. Because it is now mass-produced, the collectables won't be as valuable in the foreseeable future. ""To be valuable, it has to have age or be rare or personal,"" says Roo Irvine, a BBC antiques expert. ""Each item used to be handmade and hand-painted - it told the story of someone in that time. ""Now, because it's mass-produced, it's more like royal merchandise than memorabilia. People collect it because they have a love for the Royal Family.""

"So, unless you've been living in a dark cave for the last year, you probably know Harry's about to marry Meghan, right? Well, that's where you'd be wrong. Because when the person in charge of the ceremony reads out their names, Harry and Meghan won't be the first ones you hear. But that little nugget is just one of our 'how to impress your mates' gems that you can drop into the conversation as you watch or listen with friends. For when your mate goes: ""OHMAGOD HE'S SAID THE WRONG NAME!!!!"" No, Prince Harry won't be doing a Ross from Friends. Meghan's first name is actually Rachel, although she uses her middle name professionally and it's the name most people know her by. So it's likely Harry will refer to her as Rachel Meghan during the church service. For when your friend goes: ""Whoops. They've got Harry's name wrong now."" The sixth-in-line to the throne's full name and title is Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales, but we all know him as Prince Harry. That will probably change on the morning of the wedding as the Queen normally gives a dukedom to male members of the Royal family when they get married. A lot of people are betting that Harry will be given the title ""Duke of Sussex"". For when your mum goes: ""Princess Meghan is my new favourite royal."" While technically Meghan will be a princess because she's married to a prince, she's less likely to be known as Princess Meghan. It's been announced that Prince Harry has been given a dukedom and his titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. It means Meghan will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex once they're married. Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle, now that we knowher dad can't make the weddingbecause of his ill-health. Before we knew Harry's dad was stepping in, there was a lot of discussion onwho could give Meghan away instead. One of the contenders was her mum, Doria Ragland. So if your dad goes: ""Shame that didn't happen, would have been a first for a royal wedding,"" - your dad is wrong. Queen Victoria walked two of her daughters - Princesses Helena and Beatrice - down the aisle after the death of her husband, Prince Albert.

"For some, Saturday will be spent preparing for street parties, wearing the union jack as a cape, and praying that the weather behaves itself. But for others it can be a reminder of a hatred of crowds, bunting and the pomp and ceremony that goes with a royal wedding. If you're in the latter camp, here are some different ways to spend the day. For those who want to be glued to the TV, but don't want to watch the royal wedding, the FA Cup offers a brilliant alternative. Sports lovers can revel in the grudge match between Chelsea and Man Utd. But with a 17:15 BST (10:15 ET) kick-off, it will be hard to avoid the royal wedding altogether as the nuptials commence at midday. The royal wedding has also caused havoc with the Duke of Cambridge's schedule. As president of the Football Association, Prince William usually hands out the FA Cup to the winning side. But he will miss this year's match at Wembley in favour of his brother's wedding. And for those who follow Scottish football, the Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Motherwell will kick-off at 15:00. Gough's cave in the Cheddar Gorge is a perfect place to get away from social media Wherever you go on royal wedding day, you may be unable to escape the nuptials because of news updates and photos posted to your mobile phone by friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. One option might be to go underground - literally. The lack of phone signal in the cave systems around Cheddar Gorge in Somerset provide the perfect location for those trying to avoid posts about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It's also a fun and educational day out for the whole family. If you're unable to get to Somerset, White Scar Cave in North Yorkshire offers a suitable alternative. If you're in the US, Mammoth Cave in Kentucky has more than 400 miles of passageways, and no phone signal. A non-Brit's guide to the royal wedding Royal wedding: All you need to know If you don't have a set of subterranean caves to peruse, maybe the cinema is the best way to go. You can sit in the darkened room for two hours, safe in the knowledge that the audience shouldn't be following events in Windsor. In the UK and US weekend releases include Deadpool 2, the drama On Chesil Beach and a family comedy about a canine police dog called Show Dogs. News of Meghan Markle's marriage to Prince Harry has piqued America's interest in the Royal Family. Coverage of the events in Windsor on the main TV networks has even surpassed the UK's offerings, making it increasingly difficult for Royal-sceptics in the USA to avoid the nuptials. Luckily basketball offers a welcome distraction for some, as the Boston Celtics take on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the east conference play-offs. The Celtics lead in the series 2-0, but the Cavs have reached the final the last three years, and have NBA All-Star LeBron James at their disposal. The game starts at 20:30 ET. One of the best ways to avoid coverage of the royal wedding is to hunker down under your duvet, and indulge in a bit of extra sleep. For US readers this will be a piece of cake as the wedding begins at 07:00 ET, but people in the UK using this method might want to invest in an eye mask as the ceremony will start at midday. Channel 4 sitcom The Windsors will be spoofing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding If your blood boiled at the thought of the royal wedding, you might be able to take some solace in the fact that it's being mocked on national television. Channel 4 comedy The Windsors, a parody soap opera of the royal family, will return for a one-off special to commemorate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's special day. It was already broadcast on Tuesday, but there will be a re-run of the sitcom at midnight on Saturday. This video can not be played Josh Warrington has no respect for 'cocky' IBF champion Lee Selby If matrimonial harmony is not your thing, watching two men slug it out in a boxing match might be a viable alternative. Lee Selby, otherwise known as The Barry Boy Assassin, will be defending his IBF world featherweight title against Josh Warrington. The fight is taking place on Saturday night at Elland Road in Leeds. If you want to be around others who don't want anything to do with the royal wedding, Republic, who campaign for the abolition of the monarchy, are hosting an international convention on the future of republican movements across Europe. The event in London will include MPs Tommy Sheppard and Emma Dent Coad, and speakers from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Allow Twitter content?

During coverage of royal occasions, there can sometimes be hours where nothing of any significance happens. Veteran broadcaster and BBC News presenter Simon McCoy is well versed in covering the royals and has won plaudits online for his blunt presenting patter. While some of the country gets swept up in a swell of patriotism, it might be a good time to stick on one of his best royal announcements. Parents with an anathema for all things royal can take their children out to do chores A royal wedding might make some want to eat their teeth but it can come with its advantages. While many people crowd around TVs and revel in eating tepid finger food, others can take advantage of the lack of queues. Whether you fancy buying some pot plants at your local garden centre, need to do a big supermarket shop, or you fancy taking back that trowel you bought in error at a DIY store, the world's your oyster.

"This video can not be played Meghan reveals her halter-neck evening dress before driving into the sunset Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have become husband and wife in a moving ceremony at Windsor Castle. An emotional-looking prince and his smiling bride exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. Ms Markle, wearing a white boat-neck dress by British designer Clare Waight Keller, was walked down the aisle by Prince Charles. At the altar, Prince Harry told her: ""You look amazing."" After the service the couple - who will now be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - kissed in front of cheering well-wishers on the steps of the chapel. Thousands of members of the public turned out in bright sunshine to see them driven around Windsor in a horse-drawn carriage. Later, Prince Harry drove the couple to their reception in a 1968 silver blue Jaguar that has been converted to run on electric power, with a registration plate that referenced the date - E190518. This video can not be played Highlights from the wedding ceremony Guests at the wedding included Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John, who later performed at the wedding reception. Ms Markle's sculpted dress was designed by Ms Waight Keller for French fashion house Givenchy. Most striking was a diamond bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen, and a trailing five-metre silk veil embroidered with the flowers of each country in the Commonwealth. Prince Harry, 33, and his brother and best man, the Duke of Cambridge, wore the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals. He was given special permission from the Queen to keep his short beard as it is customary to be clean-shaven when dressed in Army uniform. Their 10 young bridesmaids and pageboys - including Prince George and Princess Charlotte - rose to the occasion. However, the excitement became too much for one of the younger ones who started crying just before Ms Markle, 36, entered the chapel. Five moments from the royal wedding Meghan's dress in detail In pictures: The bridesmaids and page boys Viewpoint: 'Landmark' for African Americans Prince Charles walked Ms Markle down the aisle,after her father, Thomas, was unable to attend for health reasons. Mr Markle, 73, reportedly watched the ceremony from California. He told theUS celebrity website, TMZ,external: ""My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy."" Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, stayed with her daughter overnight before accompanying her to the chapel. Dressed in a pale green Oscar de la Renta dress, with a neat hat, an emotional-looking Ms Ragland sat alone on the bride's side of the chapel for some time. As the witnesses were called to sign the register, Ms Ragland appeared to accept an outstretched hand from Prince Charles with some relief. This video can not be played The couple gazed into each other's eyes as they exchanged vows In her vows, Ms Markle did not promise to ""obey"" her husband, while the prince has broken with royal tradition by choosing to wear a wedding ring. Prince Harry's ring is a platinum band with a textured finish and Ms Markle's has been made from a piece of Welsh gold. The wedding service combined British tradition with modernity and the bride's African-American heritage. The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the president of the US Episcopal Church, gave an address, the Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, conducted the service and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, officiated. ""There's power, power in love,"" said Bishop Curry, who was invited to speak by Ms Markle. ""If you don't believe me think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved."" In a fiery, passionate speech, he also referenced the African-American spiritual song Down by the Riverside, which was sung by slaves, and when he realised he had gone on too long, he told his audience he had better wrap up as ""we gotta get you all married!"" Speaking afterwards, Bishop Curry said it was ""a joyful thing"" to see diversity in the ceremony, adding: ""That happened today, in different ways, different songs, different perspectives, different worlds and all of it came together and gave God thanks."" In pictures: Pomp and ceremony in Windsor In pictures: The A-list guests Lady Jane Fellowes, the sister of Prince Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a reading from the Song of Solomon.

He was accompanied by musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia. The gospel choir also performed Etta James' uplifting version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine as the newlyweds left the chapel. Prince Charles accompanied Ms Markle's mother, Doria, after the service finished After the service, the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor along a route lined by tens of thousands of well-wishers. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said more than 100,000 people visited the town on Saturday. It was a traditional wedding - the dress, the bridesmaids, the vows, the hymns. And it was very, very different. The Palace made it clear in a stream of announcements that they wanted a different kind of wedding. But it was the service that marked this out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple: the Kingdom Gospel choir setting toes tapping, a young black cellist, and a breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, the President of the Episcopal Church. Every royal wedding is a chance for the Royal Family to relaunch and reinvent. There may have been trouble in the week before the wedding. But that is in the past. This wedding was about the future, a different future for the Royal Family. Read more from Jonny Dymond Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It's impossible to describe the magnitude of the evil of someone who would attack innocent children in a school,"" he said. First Lady Melania Trump tweeted: ""My heart goes out to Santa Fe and all of Texas today."" One professional athlete from the state - JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans NFL team - has offered to pay the funeral expenses of the victims, according to US media reports. The Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes: President Trump moved to ban so-called bump stocks, used in last year's Las Vegas shooting Congress is considering the ""Stop School Violence Act"" to provide increased security such as metal detectors in schools Mr Trump has endorsed arming teachers- a long-held position of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Gun control advocates have criticised what they see as minor changes,and have continued political support for the NRA. Earlier this week,a police officer was able to stop a former student who opened fire at an Illinois high schoolbefore anyone was injured. The worst school shooting in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in Virginia, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured by Sueng-Hui Cho, who committed suicide after the attack. There have been more deaths in US school shootings so far in 2018 than there have been deaths in the US military,according to an analysis by the Washington Post,external. Authorities said journals kept by Mr Pagourtzis, 17, showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. But Mr Abbott told reporters that, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Mr Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday. This video can not be played Dimitrios Pagourtzis is read his rights after his arrest ""Unlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,"" Mr Abbott said. ""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On April 30 he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"". He is being held at Galveston County Jail on a charge of capital murder.

"This video can not be played The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport More than 100 people have died after a Boeing 737 airliner crashed near Cuba's main airport in Havana, the country's worst air disaster in decades. Three women were pulled alive from the wreckage, but are said to be in a critical condition. The plane, which was nearly 40 years old, was carrying 105 passengers and six crew members. Cuban authorities have launched an investigation, and two days of national mourning have been declared. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguin on the east of the island. All six crew members on board were Mexican and the majority of the passengers were Cuban, with five foreigners reported to be among them.

"Sergei Skripal was exposed to a nerve agent from the Novichok group in Salisbury Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal has been discharged from hospital, two months after being poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury. The 66-year-old was found slumped on a park bench in the city on 4 March, with his daughter Yulia. They were taken to Salisbury District Hospital's intensive care unit, where they were stabilised after being exposed to Novichok. Ms Skripal was released on 9 April and was moved to a secure location. It is not known whether Mr Skripal has been taken to the same location as his daughter. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said he understood that Mr Skripal is able to walk, and has talked to police at length, but is not completely recovered. He said police sources indicated that the investigation could take months of carefully piecing together movements of people and cars from mobile phone records, CCTV, automatic number plate recognition and passenger flight records. The Metropolitan Police said its investigation into the attack continued and it would not ""be discussing any protective or security arrangements that are in place"".

"This video can not be played Monday was Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years The UN human rights chief says Israel used ""wholly disproportionate"" force against Palestinian border protests which have left over 100 people dead. Zeid Raad al-Hussein told a meeting in Geneva that Gazans were effectively ""caged in a toxic slum"" and Gaza's occupation by Israel had to end. Israel's ambassador said Gaza's militant Islamist rulers had deliberately put people in harm's way. The UN's Human Rights Council voted to set up an independent investigation. Some 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces on Monday in the seventh consecutive week of border protests, largely orchestrated by Hamas, which politically controls the Gaza Strip. It was the deadliest day in Gaza since a 2014 war between Israel and militants there. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? 'Hear our message': Gaza border violence in pictures Life in the Gaza Strip The protests had been dubbed the Great March of Return, in support of the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they or their ancestors fled from or were forced to leave in the war which followed Israel's founding in 1948. The Israeli government, which has long ruled out a mass return of Palestinians, said terrorists wanted to use the protests as cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. While most Palestinians have demonstrated at a distance from the border, others threw rocks and incendiary devices towards the fence and tried to break through. Israel's troops responded with what it calls ""riot dispersal means"", such as tear gas, and live fire which Israel permits under certain circumstances. This includes when there is a threat to soldiers' lives and when attempts are made to break down the fence. Mr Zeid told the emergency session on Gaza that the ""stark contrast in casualties on both sides is... suggestive of a wholly disproportionate response"" by Israel. An Israeli soldier was ""reportedly wounded, slightly, by a stone"" on Monday, he said, while 43 Palestinians were killed at the site of the protests. Seventeen more Palestinians were killed away from what he called the ""hot spots"". Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the deaths He said there had been ""little evidence of any [Israeli] attempt to minimise casualties"". Israel's actions might, he said, ""constitute 'wilful killings' - a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention"", an international law designed to protect civilians under occupation. Mr Zeid said he supported a call for an ""international, independent and impartial"" investigation into the violence in Gaza, adding that ""those responsible for violations must in the end be held accountable"". ""The occupation must end,"" he said, ""so the people of Palestine can be liberated, and the people of Israel liberated from it. ""End the occupation, and the violence and insecurity will largely disappear."" Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. Although it withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005, the UN still considers the territory occupied because Israel retains control over the territory's air space, coastal waters and shared border. Israel's Ambassador Aviva Raz Shechter rejected the blame, saying it was ""Israel, certainly not Hamas"" which tried to avoid harming civilians. Israel's ambassador accused the Council of bias against her country She said the UN Human Rights Council had returned to its ""worst form of anti-Israel obsession"". The US ChargÃ© d'Affaires Theodore Allegra agreed, saying the ""one-sided action proposed by the Council today only further shows that the Human Rights Council is indeed a broken body"". Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words Tens of thousands of Palestinians have held weekly protests at the border in the lead-up to the 15 May anniversary of the mass displacement of Palestinians from land which became Israel in the war which followed Israel's founding in 1948. A senior member of Hamas, Salah Bardawil, has said 50 of those killed on Monday ""were from Hamas"". Israel has said it knew of ""at least 24 terrorists"" killed that day. It said most were ""active operatives"" from Hamas, and some from the Islamic Jihad militant group.

Both the 47-year-old woman, Stephanie Adams, and the boy, Vincent, were pronounced dead at the scene, the Gotham Hotel in midtown Manhattan. She was in a bitter custody battle with her estranged husband over the child, according to local media. Ms Adams had checked into a 25th-floor penthouse suite on Thursday evening. Police told reporters the woman and boy fell 23 floors and landed on a second-floor balcony in the back courtyard of the hotel on Friday morning. Police are investigating the circumstances but officers' radio communications suggested that suicide might be a factor, the New York Times reported.

They said one but then they realised there [were] two."" According to her website, Ms Adams was Playboy's Miss November 1992 and once dated Hollywood actor Robert De Niro. She was in a child custody battle with ex-husband Charles Nicolai, who owns a Manhattan chiropractic clinic, report local media. The estranged couple had appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday morning,reports the New York Post,external. A judge reportedly denied Ms Adams permission to take her and Mr Nicolai's son to Europe for the summer so she could see her boyfriend.

The New York Post profiled Ms Adams in 2013, saying she ran an online beauty products company, managed the finances in her husband's office and had two business degrees.

"Sir Eric Pickles is among those going to the House of Lords Downing Street has nominated nine new Conservative peers, including a number of former ministers, to sit in the House of Lords. Among those put forward for a peerage are former communities secretary Sir Eric Pickles and former trade and industry secretary Peter Lilley. The move follows a series of government defeats in the Lords, where Theresa May does not have a majority, over Brexit. The Democratic Unionists will get one new peer while Labour will get three. The Lib Dems, which have more than 100 peers in the unelected chamber, said it was a ""desperate bid"" by Theresa May to quell opposition to her Brexit policy. The full list of Conservative nominations is: Sir Eric Pickles, former communities secretary Peter Lilley, former trade and industry secretary Sir Edward Garnier, former solicitor general Sir Alan Haselhurst, former deputy Commons speaker John Randall, former deputy chief whip Andrew Tyrie, former Commons Treasury committee chairman Amanda Sater, former deputy chair of the Conservative Party Catherine Meyer, founder and chief executive of Action Against Abduction Diana Barran, founder and chief executive of Safe Lives All six of the MPs on the list stood down at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. Of the former MPs nominated, Mr Lilley is the only prominent Brexiteer. The government has suffered 15 defeats in the Lords during the passage of its flagship EU Withdrawal Bill, by majorities ranging from about 30 votes to more than 100. Peers have snubbed Theresa May by calling for negotiations on remaining within a customs union with the EU and staying within the European Economic Area. Peter Lilley and Sir Edward Garnier are among other Tory nominees They could be asked to vote on these issues again if their amendments to the Bill are overturned by MPs. Other crucial Brexit legislation, relating to subjects such as trade and immigration, has yet to be considered by Parliament. At the moment, 244 of the 780 peers in the House of Lords take the Conservative whip, more than any other party but well short of the number required to give the government a majority. Amanda Sater is a former Tory deputy chair and unsuccessful parliamentary candidate Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has nominated the party's former longstanding general secretary Iain McNicol, veteran campaigner and ex-councillor Martha Osamor - whose daughter Kate is a member of the shadow cabinet - and socialist author and activist Pauline Bryan. The list, which has to be approved by the Queen, is completed by former DUP MP Dr William McCrea, a Free Presbyterian minister who was MP for Mid Ulster between 1983 and 1997 and for South Antrim between 2000 and 2015. Friday's appointments have to be vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission although the body does not have the powers to reject individuals. Sir Eric, a former leader of Bradford Council who served as MP for Brentwood and Ongar for 25 years and in the cabinet for five years, tweeted that he was ""looking forward to returning to Westminster"".

Lord Newby, the leader of the Lib Dems in the House of Lords, said it was a ""cynical response"" from the PM to losing a string of votes in recent weeks. ""The PM is running scared of the mounting criticism of her disastrous handling of Brexit,"" he said. The PM has faced calls to limit the number of new peers she appoints amid anger at the size of the unelected chamber, which has 130 more members than the Commons. Lord Fowler, the former Conservative cabinet minister who is now Lords Speaker, said he welcomed the PM's ""restraint"" in keeping numbers down - pointing out that 35 peers had either retired or died since the 2017 general election. ""The size of the House is falling, and our aim is to continue that progress,"" he said. ""The relatively modest size of today's list when compared with those under several previous prime ministers has demonstrated a welcome commitment to that pledge.""

"Troy Thomas (left) and Nathan Gilmaney have been convicted of murder Two teenage criminals who stabbed a charity youth worker to death during a ""four-hour spree of violence"" have been convicted of murder. Moped riders Nathan Gilmaney, 19, and Troy Thomas, 18, from Maida Vale, west London, killed Abdul Samad, 28, as they tried to rob as many people as possible on the evening of 16 October. The pair, described as ""21st Century highwaymen"" in court, had admitted manslaughter but denied murder. They are due to be sentenced in June. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC told the Old Bailey the defendants were ""highwaymen of the 21st Century who thought they had the right to threaten and rob whoever they found, who attacked their targets in a brazen and shocking manner... for no reason other than simple aggression and blood lust"". He added: ""By the end of their four-hour spree of violence, they had committed nine knife-point robberies, gratuitously stabbed four of their defenceless victims and  killed Abdul Samad."" Abdul Samad died after staggering home having been stabbed in the chest Mr Samad handed over valuables when confronted in St Mary's Terrace, Paddington, but Gilmaney got off his moped and stabbed him in the chest anyway. He collapsed on the doorstep of his home in front of his parents. Paramedics took him to hospital where he later died. The court heard the defendants were unmoved by the plight of their victim and prowled the streets for their next target minutes later. Thomas admitted robbing the victims, but denied responsibility for the violence. Gilmaney had pleaded guilty to the robberies and violence, and admitted manslaughter, but claimed he did not intend really serious harm. The jury found Thomas guilty of unlawful wounding and three counts of wounding with intent. The defendants were caught on CCTV in a lift, having taken their balaclavas and helmets off, as they attended an address to sell their stolen goods CCTV footage on the night shows Gilmaney filling up their scooter with petrol Mr Samad was due to marry his girlfriend Sultana Ahmed.

"From choosing the cake to the flowers and even the chair-covers, anyone who's ever planned a wedding knows it can be eye-wateringly expensive. But when it comes to royal weddings - with all the VIPs, security and extra extravagance - the bill runs into millions. So what do we know about the expected cost of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, and how much will the taxpayer be paying towards it? The wedding will be held in Windsor. And crowds in excess of 100,000 people are expected to descend on the town. Invitations have been sent to 600 guests, with a further 200 invited to the couple's evening reception On top of that, 1,200 members of the public will attend the grounds of Windsor Castle. Managing these sorts of numbers requires substantial planning. And security will almost certainly be the biggest single cost. In 2011, Â£6.35m was spent on security for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding The Home Office wouldn't comment when Reality Check contacted it, saying revealing policing costs could compromise ""national security"". Likewise, when we rang Thames Valley Police, it said: ""We aren't going to give you any data I'm afraid - even though we know you love numbers."" However, we do know Â£6.35m was spent by the Metropolitan Police (ie the taxpayer) on security for Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. That's based on aFreedom of Information request released to the Press Association.,external But it's difficult to draw a direct comparison with Prince Harry and Ms Markle's wedding - the location and guest numbers are different. Kensington Palace hasn't released any details of what it plans to spend on the wedding. That's not really a surprise given that the official cost of Prince William and Catherine's wedding has never been revealed. That leaves us with unofficial estimates and as such they need to be treated with some caution. Bridebook.co.uk, a wedding planning service, saysthe total cost of the wedding could be Â£32m,external- including the cost of security. It put the cost of the cake at Â£50,000, the florist at Â£110,000, the catering at Â£286,000, and so on and so on. Reality Check contacted the company's owner, Hamish Shephard, to ask about the methodology used to arrive at the estimate. He said the Â£32m figure had been based on the assumption that the Royal Family had paid for everything at market rate. But in the absence of any official data, this is still guesswork - however well informed. For example, we don't know if suppliers would offer a substantial discount for the privilege of providing their services for a royal wedding. Ms Markle will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The cost of security for the wedding will be met by the taxpayer. Initially, Thames Valley Police will have to absorb the cost itself. But the force will be eligible to apply for special grant funding from the Home Office after the event in order to claim back some of the costs. Special grant funding is a separate pool of money forces can apply for if they have to police events outside their usual remit. Royal wedding 2018: all you need to know Queen to receive Â£6m pay increase from public funds Reality Check: What does the Queen cost us? As for the rest of the total, the Royal Family has said it will be paying for the private elements of the wedding. Every year the Royal Family gets a chunk of money from theannual Sovereign Grant,external, paid directly by the Treasury. The grant is calculated on a percentage of the profits from theCrown Estate portfolio,external, which includes much of London's West End. This year it's worth Â£82m. Some members of the Royal Family benefit from additional income. For example, Prince Charles gets money from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a portfolio of land, property and financial investments. But it's not clear which ""pots"" the palace will choose to fund the wedding from. Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, and claims the overall cost of the monarchyis far higher than Â£82m,external, hassubmitted a petition,externalagainst taxpayers' money being spent on the wedding.

"This video can not be played The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport More than 100 people have died after a Boeing 737 airliner crashed near Cuba's main airport in Havana, the country's worst air disaster in decades. Three women were pulled alive from the wreckage, but are said to be in a critical condition. The plane, which was nearly 40 years old, was carrying 105 passengers and six crew members. Cuban authorities have launched an investigation, and two days of national mourning have been declared. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguin on the east of the island. All six crew members on board were Mexican and the majority of the passengers were Cuban, with five foreigners reported to be among them. Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline ""There has been an unfortunate aviation accident. The news is not very promising, it seems that there is a high number of victims,"" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said after visiting the crash site. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground describe seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near Havana's main airport. ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Wreckage was spread over a large area Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people survived the crash but one died after being transported to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39. ""She is alive but very burnt,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. Three women were pulled from the wreckage Both the Argentine and Mexican governments have confirmed nationals from their countries were among the dead. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de AviaciÃ³n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. Crowds of shocked onlookers gathered at the crash site The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico has said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. According to industry research,last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travelwith no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.

"A former Playboy model has plunged to her death with her seven-year-old son from the window of a New York City hotel. Both the 47-year-old woman, Stephanie Adams, and the boy, Vincent, were pronounced dead at the scene, the Gotham Hotel in midtown Manhattan. She was in a bitter custody battle with her estranged husband over the child, according to local media. Ms Adams had checked into a 25th-floor penthouse suite on Thursday evening. Police told reporters the woman and boy fell 23 floors and landed on a second-floor balcony in the back courtyard of the hotel on Friday morning. Police are investigating the circumstances but officers' radio communications suggested that suicide might be a factor, the New York Times reported. A waiter at the hotel's restauranttold the New York Daily News,external: ""One of the guests of the hotel they called the lobby. ""They said, 'We saw a dead body.' They said one but then they realised there [were] two."" According to her website, Ms Adams was Playboy's Miss November 1992 and once dated Hollywood actor Robert De Niro. She was in a child custody battle with ex-husband Charles Nicolai, who owns a Manhattan chiropractic clinic, report local media. The estranged couple had appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday morning,reports the New York Post,external. A judge reportedly denied Ms Adams permission to take her and Mr Nicolai's son to Europe for the summer so she could see her boyfriend. Police are questioning hotel staff and witnesses Police had reportedly been called to their home several times in recent months. On her website,external, she said she authored New Age books, astrology calendars and tarot cards. The New York Post profiled Ms Adams in 2013, saying she ran an online beauty products company, managed the finances in her husband's office and had two business degrees.

"An autopsy carried out on the infant has revealed she died from a gunshot wound (file picture) A two-year-old girl found with fatal injuries in Belgium after a police chase on Thursday died from a gunshot wound to the face, prosecutors say. The girl was in a van carrying 30 Kurdish migrants which had been pursued for an hour in southern Belgium. The chase, which began on a motorway near the town of Namur, involved a scuffle, police said. A police spokesman said they did not know whether the fatal shot had been fired by a police officer. A police investigation has been launched into how the girl died, including whether there were guns in the van. An initial report from the emergency services had stated mistakenly that the cause of death was a head injury. ""The autopsy determined the cause of death was a bullet that entered the cheek,"" prosecutor Frederic Bariseau told the AFP news agency. Belgian media reported that the girl, who was with her mother, had been held out of a van window -apparently to keep the police at a distance. Local prosecutors told the BBC they could not confirm the reports. Groups advocating for asylum seekers' rights held a protest in Brussels condemning the police The chase began just outside Namur in the early hours of Thursday morning. The van drove west for several kilometres, evading police. Eventually it collided with another vehicle near Mons. Police say the driver had jumped out to avoid being identified, and allowed the van to come to a stop itself. It took 15 police cars and some 30 police to bring the incident to an end at around 03:00 (01:00 GMT) on Thursday. Police believe the van was linked to a people smuggling operation. The dead girl belonged to a family housed in a migrant community at Grande-Synthe, near Dunkirk in France, French authorities said. The 30 migrants found in the vehicle, 26 of whom are adults, are in custody and are still being interviewed. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"A group of former cabinet ministers is planning a public intervention to try to show that the Conservative parliamentary party would support a ""sensible"" Brexit. Justine Greening, Amber Rudd and Damian Green want to show the prime minister that she would have sufficient support to face down Brexit hardliners in her party. Newsnight understands that their message has been supported in private by Julian Smith, the government chief whip. In a pointed intervention, Mr Smith reportedly told members of the cabinet's Brexit cabinet sub-committee that they should, according to one witness, ""get real"" about the numbers in parliament. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? What is left to agree in the Brexit Treaty? UK promises 'significant' Brexit paper The former cabinet ministers, who supported Remain in the EU referendum, have decided to act after concluding that it will not be possible to agree a Brexit deal that is accepted by all wings of the Conservative parliamentary party. Talks with the Brexit-supporting European Research Group (ERG), led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, have persuaded members of the new group that there is little chance of finding common ground. The group has won the support of some former Leave supporters, though none of these is so far willing to go public. One senior Leaver supporting the new initiative told Newsnight: ""The prime minister will have to face down the ERG... maybe she also has to sack a cabinet minister."" In their discussions the group has decided that Theresa May has crucial numbers at Westminster at two levels: In the event of a vote of confidence in her leadership, the prime minister would have the support of at least half of the 316 Tory MPs. That would be enough to survive a confidence vote which the ERG could, theoretically, trigger with the support of just 48 MPs. Parliament as a whole would reject a no deal Brexit. It is calculated that up to 300 of the opposition and independent MPs would join at least 100 Tory MPs in voting down a no deal, passing the 322 MPs needed to secure a parliamentary majority. A no deal end to the Brexit negotiations is seen as unlikely. But members of the new group believe that highlighting the prospect of such scenario - and how it would be rejected in parliament - can be used to persuade Theresa May that she would have a strong hand if she decided to challenge MPs advocating a no deal. One senior figure in the new group told Newsnight: ""The prime minister is going to have to make a decision. If she comes down on the side of the ERG to keep 60 of them happy that will be unacceptable to us and our numbers are larger. ""In the coming weeks we will be showing what the mainstream is thinking - Leavers and Remainers. This is about identifying a locus, where the mainstream lies to allow the prime minister to land this in the right place."" This video can not be played ""Those that are arguing from an ideological perspective are in the wrong place,"" argues Antoinette Sandbach MP Antoinette Sandbach, the Conservative MP for Eddisbury who supported Remain, told Newsnight: ""The decision was taken [in the referendum] that we would leave the political institutions of the EU but not how. That question of how we leave is incredibly important and why we need a pragmatic Brexit that preserves that close economic partnership whilst leaving the political institutions."" Ms Sandbach criticised Boris Johnson who recently described the so called ""customs partnership"", which has been supported by Theresa May, as ""crazy"". The MP said: ""My constituents don't like cabinet ministers openly rubbishing the plans of the prime minister in public. They want a sensible and considered compromise. Those that are arguing from an ideological perspective are in the wrong place compared to the vast majority of us at Westminster."" Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP who was a prominent Leave campaigner, said that the vast majority of Conservative MPs want a Brexit to restore sovereign control to the UK but which also provides for the ""closest relationship with our European neighbours"". This video can not be played ""No deal is plainly better than a bad deal,"" argues Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan But Mr Hannan warned that the UK may be forced to accept a no deal. ""No deal is plainly better than a bad deal... Imagine that you were buying a car and you said to the car dealer: 'I am definitely going to walk out of this showroom with your vehicle, now let's sit down and haggle about the price.' That would be a ridiculous position."" A source in the ERG dismissed the proposed intervention. The source pointed out that seven Brexit-leaning Conservative MPs, who are not in the ERG, would withdraw their support from Theresa May if she negotiated a deal they found unacceptable. This would cancel out her parliamentary majority which she assembled last year with support from the DUP. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like?

A Sheffield schoolgirl who survived the Manchester Arena attack has invited the grandmother of one of the victims to attend the royal wedding with her. Instead of asking her mother, 12-year-old Amelia Thompson asked Sharon Goodman to attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding this weekend. Mrs Goodman lost her granddaughter Olivia Campbell-Hardy in the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. Amelia said she made the gesture ""just to put a smile on her face"". Read more stories from South Yorkshire Her mother Lisa Newton said she didn't mind her daughter not inviting her if it would make someone else happy. ""Obviously the 22 people that died can never be forgotten,"" Mrs Newton said. ""Their family lost something so precious and I've still got Amelia, we can still experience things like that on Saturday."" Lisa Newton said she was proud of her daughter Amelia Thompson's decision Mrs Newton said her daughter would take a candle to Windsor Castle and light it in St George's Chapel on 22 May to mark a year since the attack. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device as 14,000 people streamed out of the concert. More than 700 people were injured. Amelia is one of 1,200 public invitees to Saturday's wedding. Those present will be able to watch the arrival and departure of the bride and groom, Kensington Palace has said. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wedding begins at 12:00 BST on Saturday In total, 2,640 people will be given access to the grounds for the wedding. Charity workers, school children, royal household members and Windsor residents are among those invited.

"This video can not be played The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport More than 100 people have died after a Boeing 737 airliner crashed near Cuba's main airport in Havana, the country's worst air disaster in decades. Three women were pulled alive from the wreckage, but are said to be in a critical condition. The plane, which was nearly 40 years old, was carrying 105 passengers and six crew members. Cuban authorities have launched an investigation, and two days of national mourning have been declared. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguin on the east of the island. All six crew members on board were Mexican and the majority of the passengers were Cuban, with five foreigners reported to be among them. Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline ""There has been an unfortunate aviation accident. The news is not very promising, it seems that there is a high number of victims,"" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said after visiting the crash site. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground describe seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near Havana's main airport. ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Wreckage was spread over a large area Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people survived the crash but one died after being transported to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39. ""She is alive but very burnt,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. Three women were pulled from the wreckage Both the Argentine and Mexican governments have confirmed nationals from their countries were among the dead. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de AviaciÃ³n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. Crowds of shocked onlookers gathered at the crash site The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico has said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. According to industry research,last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travelwith no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.

"This video can not be played Monday was Gaza's deadliest day of violence in years The UN human rights chief says Israel used ""wholly disproportionate"" force against Palestinian border protests which have left over 100 people dead. Zeid Raad al-Hussein told a meeting in Geneva that Gazans were effectively ""caged in a toxic slum"" and Gaza's occupation by Israel had to end. Israel's ambassador said Gaza's militant Islamist rulers had deliberately put people in harm's way. The UN's Human Rights Council voted to set up an independent investigation. Some 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces on Monday in the seventh consecutive week of border protests, largely orchestrated by Hamas, which politically controls the Gaza Strip. It was the deadliest day in Gaza since a 2014 war between Israel and militants there. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? 'Hear our message': Gaza border violence in pictures Life in the Gaza Strip The protests had been dubbed the Great March of Return, in support of the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they or their ancestors fled from or were forced to leave in the war which followed Israel's founding in 1948. The Israeli government, which has long ruled out a mass return of Palestinians, said terrorists wanted to use the protests as cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. While most Palestinians have demonstrated at a distance from the border, others threw rocks and incendiary devices towards the fence and tried to break through. Israel's troops responded with what it calls ""riot dispersal means"", such as tear gas, and live fire which Israel permits under certain circumstances. This includes when there is a threat to soldiers' lives and when attempts are made to break down the fence. Mr Zeid told the emergency session on Gaza that the ""stark contrast in casualties on both sides is... suggestive of a wholly disproportionate response"" by Israel. An Israeli soldier was ""reportedly wounded, slightly, by a stone"" on Monday, he said, while 43 Palestinians were killed at the site of the protests. Seventeen more Palestinians were killed away from what he called the ""hot spots"". Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the deaths He said there had been ""little evidence of any [Israeli] attempt to minimise casualties"". Israel's actions might, he said, ""constitute 'wilful killings' - a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention"", an international law designed to protect civilians under occupation. Mr Zeid said he supported a call for an ""international, independent and impartial"" investigation into the violence in Gaza, adding that ""those responsible for violations must in the end be held accountable"". ""The occupation must end,"" he said, ""so the people of Palestine can be liberated, and the people of Israel liberated from it. ""End the occupation, and the violence and insecurity will largely disappear."" Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. Although it withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005, the UN still considers the territory occupied because Israel retains control over the territory's air space, coastal waters and shared border. Israel's Ambassador Aviva Raz Shechter rejected the blame, saying it was ""Israel, certainly not Hamas"" which tried to avoid harming civilians. Israel's ambassador accused the Council of bias against her country She said the UN Human Rights Council had returned to its ""worst form of anti-Israel obsession"". The US ChargÃ© d'Affaires Theodore Allegra agreed, saying the ""one-sided action proposed by the Council today only further shows that the Human Rights Council is indeed a broken body"". Palestinian Nakba explained in 100 and 300 words Tens of thousands of Palestinians have held weekly protests at the border in the lead-up to the 15 May anniversary of the mass displacement of Palestinians from land which became Israel in the war which followed Israel's founding in 1948. A senior member of Hamas, Salah Bardawil, has said 50 of those killed on Monday ""were from Hamas"". Israel has said it knew of ""at least 24 terrorists"" killed that day. It said most were ""active operatives"" from Hamas, and some from the Islamic Jihad militant group.

"The host of Catfish has been accused of sexual misconduct by someone who appeared on the show in 2015 Production of MTV show Catfish has been suspended following claims of sexual harassment against its host, Nev Schulman. The allegations surfaced after a former participant on the show posted a YouTube video last week claiming she was harassed.

For those who don't watch the show, Catfish follows Nev Schulman as he investigates people using fake online profiles. He's being accused of inappropriate conduct by a woman who appeared on the cyber-dating series in 2015. In a YouTube video uploaded on 12 May, the woman claims Nev ""picked apart"" her sexuality as a lesbian and propositioned her for sex. ""The behaviour described in this video did not happen,"" Nev said in a statement. ""I'm fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth. ""I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions - but these claims are false,"" he added.

Eight different ways to spend royal wedding day Royal wedding: All you need to know By Hanna Yusuf, BBC News The two women, dressed in union jack gear, summed up the mood for one of the many TV crews. ""Excited, excited, excited is what we are!"" they said. Behind them, the castle; in front of them, a line of shops that, for the past few days, have been bound together by bunting. On top of the stores, lucky residents sit beside open windows, drinks in hand, looking at the view that many have been camping out for: the road leading to the castle gate. Other buildings have bright lights and correspondents' backs lining their balconies. On a sunny day, the lights seem unexpectedly stark. All eyes peer inside every car that drives by, looking for - hoping for - a glimpse of the royal couple. In front of the castle, two women take a defiant selfie - despite the best efforts of an officer. ""Keep it moving please!"" he says. Ms Markle will spend herlast night before the weddingwith her mother at the luxury Cliveden House Hotel, in Buckinghamshire, about nine miles north of Windsor Castle.

"John Bercow has been Speaker since 2009 Commons Speaker John Bercow has acknowledged that ""strong and differing views were expressed"" in the House of Commons, after claims he called a cabinet minister ""a stupid woman"". The Daily Telegraph reported he made the comments about Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom under his breath. Mr Bercow's office said it would not comment on ""suggested accounts of private conversations"". No 10 said the remarks, if proven to be true, would be ""unacceptable"". Downing Street said that if an official complaint was made, it should be properly investigated. Mrs Leadsom said, in her role as the government's representative in Parliament, she was focused on ensuring that ""anyone who is bullied or treated unfairly"" was ""able to come forward and have their concerns and complaints dealt with in a rigorous and fair manner"". Bercow investigation blocked by MPs Bercow defiant as MP questions his future BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the allegations would add to pressure on Mr Bercow following allegations of bullying from former members of staff, which he has denied. Thestory in the Telegraph,externalandthe Sun,externalsuggests Mr Bercow muttered insults under his breath following prime minister's questions on Wednesday. Asked to respond, the Speaker's office said: ""Wednesday was an unusual and controversial day in how business was handled in the House by the government and some strong and differing views were expressed on all sides on the subject. Ms Leadsom is in charge of scheduling government business in the Commons ""The Speaker treats his colleagues with respect and strives at every turn to facilitate the House of Commons."" On Wednesday, the Commons Standards Committee voted against an investigation by Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone into the allegations of bullying made against Mr Bercow. The Speaker's former private secretary, Angus Sinclair, has said Mr Bercow shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. Allegations have also been made about Mr Bercow's behaviour towards Kate Emms, who worked as his private secretary in 2010-2011. In recent weeks Mr Bercow has faced calls to resign because of allegations of bullying staff who worked for him; they are claims he has firmly denied. But separately there is talk in Westminster about how long he'll stay on in the job. That's because when he was voted into the post in June 2009, Mr Bercow said he'd do the role for no more than nine years. His critics are quick to point out that date is fast approaching. Added together, it all means questions are being asked about when exactly he will go. In reality, it is very difficult to force the Speaker out. Unless they go voluntarily it would likely come down to a case of whether or not the individual maintains the confidence of MPs. It means if they weren't shamed into walking, a critical mass of MPs backing a motion of no confidence would be needed to see them go. It's not clear at this stage that Mr Bercow is under that kind of threat. A spokesman for Mr Bercow has said there is ""no substance"" to these allegations. Mr Bercow's alleged comments about Mrs Leadsom came following a row between Labour and ministers over the scheduling of a Commons statement on the state takeover of the East Coast Main Line rail franchise. Labour complained to Mr Bercow that the statement had been deliberately scheduled to limit time for its own ""opposition day"" debates on the legacy of the Grenfell Tower fire and the release of Brexit documents. In response, Mr Bercow chided Mrs Leadsom and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, saying nothing would stop him from upholding the rights of backbenchers to hold the government to account. As Commons leader, Mrs Leadsom is responsible for scheduling government business in the Commons. Some Labour MPs, including veteran Barry Sheerman, have come to the defence of the Speaker, arguing that ministers were to blame for breaching parliamentary protocol. Allow Twitter content?

"Every royal wedding is different. But every royal wedding is an opportunity, in some way, to relaunch the Royal Family. Big weddings like this come along pretty rarely and they are now the object of global fascination. So it represents a great opportunity to say: ""This is who the Royal Family are these days."" But this is a very different royal wedding. It's different because of the style of the arrangements for the day itself. From small things, like the cake (not a traditional big heavy fruitcake covered with bullet-proof icing), to bigger things, like a gospel choir performing at the service. To more remarkable decisions, like the invitation to 1,200 members of the public to enjoy the occasion in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The Royal Wedding is being embraced as a people's celebration After the death in 1997 of Prince Harry's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, she was described by the-then Prime Minister Tony Blair as ""the people's princess"". This may not be ""the people's wedding"", but it is about as close to it as any royal wedding has got. Right from the start, the couple said they wanted to make this a more inclusive event - and they have done a fair bit, by royal standards, to make that happen. It will look and feel different from the royal weddings that came before. And, of course, the wedding is also different because of the bride - very different. Royal Wedding: the final countdown Previous royal weddings Meghan Markle: profile It's not that she is a commoner. There have now been a fair few non-aristocrats marrying into the family over the years. Nor is it that she is divorced, although it was only 82 years ago that a future king abdicated so that he could marry a divorcee - and 50-odd years ago that the late Princess Margaret relinquished the love of her life because he was divorced. Meghan Markle's family is not accustomed to the royal way of doing things Nor is it that Meghan is American - marrying foreigners is par for the course for the British Royal Family. The shambles over who would walk Ms Markle down the aisle is reminder of another, stark, difference - hers is a family, who don't appear to know the rules about becoming a member of the Royal Family, or - if they do - clearly couldn't care less. But it is the fact that she is, in her own words, ""biracial"" - that her mother is African American - that is breathtaking, some might say revolutionary, for the Royal Family. And there's more. She has (or had) a job! She has (or had) a public profile! She is a very effective communicator, arguably better than any member of the Royal Family. What's more, she is a self-confessed feminist, a high-profile member of the #MeToo generation. So the arrival of Meghan Markle marks a huge change for what is still a clearly traditional and, some would say, pretty hidebound institution. There has been talk of her modernising - or even saving - the monarchy. The Royal Family continuously needs to renew itself, and it has proved pretty adept at that. Ms Markle is certainly dragging them into the Instagram age, but just how much she can change it we will have to wait and see. She has said previously: ""I never wanted to be a lady who lunches, I always wanted to be a lady who works."" Well, the royal role is lunches. And teas. And opening hospitals and attending charity functions. And looking good, and nodding a lot, and not saying much beyond asking what people do and commenting on the weather. Don't get me wrong, it is important work - hard work, at times, often boring work, I imagine. But it is not what she is used to. So we wait to see - does Meghan change the Royal Family? Or does the Royal Family change her?

"Charlie Deutsch was found to be a little less than one and a half times the legal alcohol limit A top jockey who drove away from police at up to 114mph after a roadside breath test has been jailed for 10 months. The drama unfolded when Charlie Deutsch, 21, was pulled over in Cheltenham after a night out in March. He took six attempts to blow into a breathalyser before he was arrested, Gloucester Crown Court heard. At this point Deutsch ran back to his Audi, which had other jockeys inside, and sped off. He was then pursued by police for nearly five miles. The court heard how Sgt Marcus Forbes-George had tried to stop him at the roadside by smashing the driver's door to take the ignition key, and the officer hurt his arm during his attempt to immobilise the fleeing jockey. Deutsch's vehicle was eventually stopped with a stinger, the court heard. During the chase, in the early hours of 30 March, he drove the wrong way around a roundabout and on the wrong side of the road. Deutsch (in red), who has ridden 90 winners as a jump jockey, fell at Becher's Brook in this year's Grand National The jockey, from Beckford Road in Tewkesbury, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving while over the legal alcohol limit and escaping from police custody. In mitigation, the court was told by Deutsch's lawyer he was a ""sensible young man"" who had ""done something remarkably stupid"". Sentencing the young horseman, Recorder James Watson QC told him his conduct had been ""outrageous"". ""Those who resist arrest involving violent struggles and cause injury to police officers must not expect a custodial sentence to be suspended,"" he said. Deutsch,who fell while riding Houblon Des Obeaux in this Year's Grand National, was also disqualified from driving for 17 months. Where did your Grand National horse finish?

"This video can not be played How the Texas school shooting unfolded Ten people have been killed and 10 others injured after a student opened fire at a Texas high school, the state governor said. The attacker, who was arrested and charged with murder, was identified asDimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old pupil at Santa Fe High School. He allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons. Most of the dead are students, police said. Santa Fe High School shooting as it happened Texas Governor Greg Abbott said ""various kinds of explosive devices"" had been found at the school, 40 miles (65km) south of Houston, and off-campus. They included ""a CO2 device"" and ""a Molotov cocktail"", he said. Mr Abbott said police found information on the suspect's diary, computer, and mobile phone suggesting that he planned the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. The governor said the teenager ""gave himself up"" because ""he didn't have the courage to commit the suicide"". This video can not be played Student: 'I saw a girl that got shot' Santa Fe Police Chief Jeff Powell advised residents to be aware of any suspicious objects they find. ""Do not touch any items that look out of place,"" he said. Santa Fe school police officer John Barnes has been named among the injured. He was in a critical condition and undergoing surgery, local media reported. Also on Friday, one woman died and another was injured in a shooting outside a high school graduation ceremony in in Atlanta. So far this year, more than 5,000 people have died in shooting incidents in the United States, according to monitoring group the Gun Violence Archive. This video can not be played ""It broke my heart to see what was going on"" Students said the shooter entered an art class and opened fire shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT). ""There was someone that walked in with a shotgun and started shooting,"" one witness told KTRK-TV, ""and this girl got shot in the leg."" Allow Twitter content?

Another student, Damon Rabon, told CBS he looked out of his classroom after hearing loud bangs and saw the shooter. ""Black trench coat, short kind of guy, had a sawed-off shotgun,"" he said. There were 1,400 students in the school at the time of the attack, according to Lt Gov Dan Patrick. Paul BlakeinSanta Fe Hundreds of people gathered at sunset on Friday on a large open lawn near to the school, for a vigil to remember the dead. The sound of preachers and politicians was intermittently drowned out by wailing and sobs from attendees - still in shock at the violence that had come to this small town of 18,000. John Overbeck, a final-year student at Santa Fe High School, said he saw a man fall to the ground as he fled the gunman. ""I don't know how to feel. I don't know if it's hit me yet. When something like this happens, it's just so easy to be distracted from it,"" he told the BBC. ""I feel like when I'm isolated later, I'm going to break down."" Much of the area around the school remained cordoned off to the public on Friday evening. Behind the police tape, in the school's car park, vehicles belonging to students and staff sat where they had been left that morning, before the shooting began. President Donald Trump, speaking at a prison reform event at the White House, described the attack as ""absolutely horrific"". Allow Twitter content?

""My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves, and to others,"" he said. He ordered flags to be flown at half-mast at the White House and all public and military buildings. Two weeks ago, the US president reiterated his call to arm teachers with guns during a speech in Dallas to the National Rifle Association. This video can not be played Trump: 'This has been going on for too long' Governor Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools"". ""It's impossible to describe the magnitude of the evil of someone who would attack innocent children in a school,"" he said. First Lady Melania Trump tweeted: ""My heart goes out to Santa Fe and all of Texas today."" One professional athlete from the state - JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans NFL team - has offered to pay the funeral expenses of the victims, according to US media reports. The Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes: President Trump moved to ban so-called bump stocks, used in last year's Las Vegas shooting Congress is considering the ""Stop School Violence Act"" to provide increased security such as metal detectors in schools Mr Trump has endorsed arming teachers- a long-held position of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Gun control advocates have criticised what they see as minor changes,and have continued political support for the NRA. Earlier this week,a police officer was able to stop a former student who opened fire at an Illinois high schoolbefore anyone was injured. The worst school shooting in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in Virginia, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured by Sueng-Hui Cho, who committed suicide after the attack. There have been more deaths in US school shootings so far in 2018 than there have been deaths in the US military,according to an analysis by the Washington Post,external. Authorities said journals kept by Mr Pagourtzis, 17, showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. But Mr Abbott told reporters that, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Mr Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday. This video can not be played Dimitrios Pagourtzis is read his rights after his arrest ""Unlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,"" Mr Abbott said. ""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On April 30 he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"". He is being held at Galveston County Jail on a charge of capital murder.

"Zoe Carter-Mackay walked herself down the aisle when she married James Dumbell Kensington Palace described the news thatMeghan Markle's father may not walk her down the aisleas a ""deeply personal moment"" for the actress. But while Ms Markle may not have opted for this break with tradition, an increasing number of women are choosing not to be ""given away"" by their parents. Zoe Carter-Mackay, who walked herself down the aisle, says that before getting married she and her husband-to-be asked themselves which traditions ""felt right"" and which felt ""weird"". ""That was the starting point for thinking whether - as a 35-year-old - I should be given away by my dad to another man,"" she says. ""My parents divorced when I was 14 - I have a great relationship with my dad but I also have four parents now, as both remarried. ""I think a lot of women who have divorced parents think whether their mum or their brother might walk them down the aisle. ""For me it just felt right that I would walk myself - I wasn't being given away. When I came to end of the aisle I gave my dad a kiss, which was acknowledging my respect for him."" Royal wedding: Meghan's father may not attend ceremony 'I walked my heart donor's daughter down the aisle' A recent YouGov poll showed that 69% of Britons remain in favour of fathers walking their daughters down the aisle - though that figure is down from 82% in 2014. Sarah George, of Bride magazine, argues the principles behind the tradition are ""outdated and old fashioned"". ""Nowadays, we see more variations,"" she says, ""with some opting to go it alone or with a pet by their side, walking arm-in-arm with their mother or a sibling, or most unconventionally of all - arriving at the altar with their husband- or wife-to-be."" Fathers traditionally walked their daughters down the aisle as a symbolic gesture stemming from the idea that daughters were considered the property of their fathers. Daughters were exchanged for a dowry or bride price, after which they became the property and financial responsibility of their husband. In England, the idea that women were property began to be eroded in the 14th Century following a series of laws introduced by King Richard II establishing both men and women's individual employment rights. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 formally ended the concept by enshrining in law married women's ability to independently own and control property in the UK. Dr Kathleen Puech was accompanied down the aisle by both parents when she married her husband 20 years ago - and feels it is time to ""move past the point when a woman is given by one man to another man"". ""I don't agree with the system of a man giving away a woman to another man,"" she says. ""It's fundamentally wrong and we need to change it. ""Women need to realise it is wrong and we need to stand up for ourselves. ""Ideally, I think a woman should give herself away. She's making this step, not her parents, but if you want to keep a bit of tradition you can have both parents."" This video can not be played Arthur Thomas describes feelings after walking his heart donor's daughter down the aisle The change in attitudes towards weddings is not limited to ceremony entrances, either. Multiple best men and maid of honour speeches are not uncommon while many women are opting to keep their own names. ""I actually grew up in India,"" says Dr Puech. ""Lots of my Indian friends haven't changed their names and yet all of my female British and Irish friends have - it's odd, as India is meant to be far less progressive."" ""It's not even just weddings,"" adds Ms Carter-Mackay. ""I think there's a lot of questioning the way things have always been.  I think a lot of them are based around stereotypes and gender roles. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with traditions but I'm a mix of traditional and modern and it's fine to cherry-pick what feels right to you.""

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has said he will explore ""new measures"" to prevent future school shootings. What could be on the table?

God be with the victims and with the victims' families."" The Washington Post has just reported that more Americans have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while serving in the military. The newspaper compiled Department of Defense statistics and their own record of murders in US schools to find that nearly twice as many people were killed in schools than in the military.

Steven McCraw, from the Texas state troopers, said officers had followed protocol in responding to reports of an active shooter. ""When you get these calls, every police officer, no matter where you are, has to immediately engage the active shooter. Period. ""There's no alternative. Because every second means someone else is going to die. In this situation we had that."" Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick says the police chief of Santa Fe was on his way to the school when the shots broke out. The police chief managed to pull the injured officer, who has been identified by local media as John Barnes, to safety after he was critically wounded. He, as well as a Texas state trooper, fired on the suspect as they were rescuing the wounded officer, officials say. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz is now speaking at the news conference in Santa Fe. ""There have been too damn many murderers. Texas has seen too many of these,"" he says referring to a bombing spree in the state and a shooting at a church, both of which have occurred within the past year. Governor Greg Abbott has said he will hold round-table discussions next week to create new measures to ""make sure this tragedy is never repeated again"" in the state. These include speeding up background checks and granting more resources to school districts.  The Texas governor says warrants have been issued for two residences, but that authorities are taking their time to search the homes due to the danger of explosives. Several explosive devices have already been detected, one of which was a ""Molotov cocktail"", the governor says. The shooter had intended to take his own life, he says, but changed his mind during the attack. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Several explosive devices have already been found in and around the school, police say.

"This video can not be played How the Texas school shooting unfolded Ten people have been killed and 10 others injured after a student opened fire at a Texas high school, the state governor said. The attacker, who was arrested and charged with murder, was identified asDimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old pupil at Santa Fe High School. He allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons. Most of the dead are students, police said. Santa Fe High School shooting as it happened Texas Governor Greg Abbott said ""various kinds of explosive devices"" had been found at the school, 40 miles (65km) south of Houston, and off-campus. They included ""a CO2 device"" and ""a Molotov cocktail"", he said. Mr Abbott said police found information on the suspect's diary, computer, and mobile phone suggesting that he planned the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. The governor said the teenager ""gave himself up"" because ""he didn't have the courage to commit the suicide"". This video can not be played Student: 'I saw a girl that got shot' Santa Fe Police Chief Jeff Powell advised residents to be aware of any suspicious objects they find. ""Do not touch any items that look out of place,"" he said. Santa Fe school police officer John Barnes has been named among the injured. He was in a critical condition and undergoing surgery, local media reported. Also on Friday, one woman died and another was injured in a shooting outside a high school graduation ceremony in in Atlanta. So far this year, more than 5,000 people have died in shooting incidents in the United States, according to monitoring group the Gun Violence Archive. This video can not be played ""It broke my heart to see what was going on"" Students said the shooter entered an art class and opened fire shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT). ""There was someone that walked in with a shotgun and started shooting,"" one witness told KTRK-TV, ""and this girl got shot in the leg."" Allow Twitter content?

One student told local network KHOU-11 that a teacher who realised what was happening activated a fire alarm to evacuate the building. Dakota Shrader, a student, told CBS News that everyone began running outside when the alarms went off. This video can not be played Student: 'I just ran as fast as I could' ""Next thing you know everybody looks, and you hear boom, boom, boom, and I just ran as fast as I could to the nearest floor so I could hide, and I called my mom."" Another student, Damon Rabon, told CBS he looked out of his classroom after hearing loud bangs and saw the shooter. ""Black trench coat, short kind of guy, had a sawed-off shotgun,"" he said. There were 1,400 students in the school at the time of the attack, according to Lt Gov Dan Patrick. Paul BlakeinSanta Fe Hundreds of people gathered at sunset on Friday on a large open lawn near to the school, for a vigil to remember the dead. The sound of preachers and politicians was intermittently drowned out by wailing and sobs from attendees - still in shock at the violence that had come to this small town of 18,000. John Overbeck, a final-year student at Santa Fe High School, said he saw a man fall to the ground as he fled the gunman. ""I don't know how to feel. I don't know if it's hit me yet. When something like this happens, it's just so easy to be distracted from it,"" he told the BBC. ""I feel like when I'm isolated later, I'm going to break down."" Much of the area around the school remained cordoned off to the public on Friday evening. Behind the police tape, in the school's car park, vehicles belonging to students and staff sat where they had been left that morning, before the shooting began. President Donald Trump, speaking at a prison reform event at the White House, described the attack as ""absolutely horrific"". Allow Twitter content?

""My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves, and to others,"" he said. He ordered flags to be flown at half-mast at the White House and all public and military buildings. Two weeks ago, the US president reiterated his call to arm teachers with guns during a speech in Dallas to the National Rifle Association. This video can not be played Trump: 'This has been going on for too long' Governor Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools"". ""It's impossible to describe the magnitude of the evil of someone who would attack innocent children in a school,"" he said. First Lady Melania Trump tweeted: ""My heart goes out to Santa Fe and all of Texas today."" One professional athlete from the state - JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans NFL team - has offered to pay the funeral expenses of the victims, according to US media reports. The Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes: President Trump moved to ban so-called bump stocks, used in last year's Las Vegas shooting Congress is considering the ""Stop School Violence Act"" to provide increased security such as metal detectors in schools Mr Trump has endorsed arming teachers- a long-held position of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Gun control advocates have criticised what they see as minor changes,and have continued political support for the NRA. Earlier this week,a police officer was able to stop a former student who opened fire at an Illinois high schoolbefore anyone was injured. The worst school shooting in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in Virginia, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured by Sueng-Hui Cho, who committed suicide after the attack. There have been more deaths in US school shootings so far in 2018 than there have been deaths in the US military,according to an analysis by the Washington Post,external. Authorities said journals kept by Mr Pagourtzis, 17, showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. But Mr Abbott told reporters that, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Mr Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday. This video can not be played Dimitrios Pagourtzis is read his rights after his arrest ""Unlike Parkland, unlike Sutherland Springs, there were not those types of warning signs,"" Mr Abbott said. ""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On April 30 he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"". He is being held at Galveston County Jail on a charge of capital murder.

"Troy Thomas (left) and Nathan Gilmaney have been convicted of murder Two teenage criminals who stabbed a charity youth worker to death during a ""four-hour spree of violence"" have been convicted of murder. Moped riders Nathan Gilmaney, 19, and Troy Thomas, 18, from Maida Vale, west London, killed Abdul Samad, 28, as they tried to rob as many people as possible on the evening of 16 October. The pair, described as ""21st Century highwaymen"" in court, had admitted manslaughter but denied murder. They are due to be sentenced in June. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC told the Old Bailey the defendants were ""highwaymen of the 21st Century who thought they had the right to threaten and rob whoever they found, who attacked their targets in a brazen and shocking manner... for no reason other than simple aggression and blood lust"". He added: ""By the end of their four-hour spree of violence, they had committed nine knife-point robberies, gratuitously stabbed four of their defenceless victims and  killed Abdul Samad."" Abdul Samad died after staggering home having been stabbed in the chest Mr Samad handed over valuables when confronted in St Mary's Terrace, Paddington, but Gilmaney got off his moped and stabbed him in the chest anyway. He collapsed on the doorstep of his home in front of his parents. Paramedics took him to hospital where he later died. The court heard the defendants were unmoved by the plight of their victim and prowled the streets for their next target minutes later. Thomas admitted robbing the victims, but denied responsibility for the violence. Gilmaney had pleaded guilty to the robberies and violence, and admitted manslaughter, but claimed he did not intend really serious harm. The jury found Thomas guilty of unlawful wounding and three counts of wounding with intent. The defendants were caught on CCTV in a lift, having taken their balaclavas and helmets off, as they attended an address to sell their stolen goods CCTV footage on the night shows Gilmaney filling up their scooter with petrol Mr Samad was due to marry his girlfriend Sultana Ahmed. Ms Ahmed said in a statement her boyfriend was ""the change we needed to see in the world"" and said he ""lived for his job of helping children"". His mother Layla Begum said the death left her whole family ""broken"". In a statement provided to the Metropolitan Police, she added: ""I often feel like a dead woman walking around my home.""

GQ's ""comedy issue"" features Saturday Night Live's Kate McKinnon, comedian Sarah Silverman and actress Issa Rae with their arms and legs misplaced in an apparent Photoshop disaster.

""GQ would like to apologize to Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Sarah Silverman for the egregious mistakes made in the process of creating the cover for our 2018 comedy issue,"" the magazine said in a statement.

Had it been approved, the island could have become the first place in the British Isles to allow assisted dying. After a three-day debate, the proposals were rejected. The plans would have prompted a lengthy consultation period before a legal framework was presented back to the island's politicians. More on Guernsey's assisted dying debate However, politicians did agree to a review of palliative and end-of-life care due to an anticipated ""substantial increase"" in healthcare needs for the island's ageing population. ""Measures necessary to improve quality of life and health outcomes for all islanders towards the end of their lives"" will be investigated. Politicians who supported the introduction of assisted dying said they were ""disappointed"" with the result, although described it as ""not entirely unexpected"". Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying which campaigns for assisted dying in the UK, said despite the defeat the debate had shown there was ""immense public support for change"".

Commenting on social media, Sarah Griffith who runs the charity Bridge2 in Guernsey, said she would be becoming a member of Dignitas as a result of the vote, adding ""I was hoping I would not have to make that decision but now I have to."" She added that it was a shame it had taken assisted dying proposals to prompt the States of Guernsey to improve its palliative care programme. Anti-euthanasia campaign group Care Not Killing said it welcomed the ""powerful rejection"" of the proposals. The group's campaign director Dr Peter Saunders described the plans for assisted dying as ""dangerous"" and said island politicians had recognised ""the erosion of so called safeguards"" in other places which had allowed assisted dying, including the US. Deputy Gavin St Pier, the island's most senior politician and champion of the proposals, said: ""The important thing is we've brought this topic up the agenda, it hasn't been debated (in Guernsey) for 14 years, we've now had a debate, a conclusion has been reached - we accept that result."" Heidi Soulsby, president of the Committee for Health and Social Care, said although rejecting the proposals was right, she does not know anyone who would be ""pleased"" with the result of the emotive debate. During the debate she said she was sure an assisted dying regime ""would eventually come to pass"" in the island, but now was not the time.

"The government is considering sending hundreds more British troops to Afghanistan, the BBC understands. The defence secretary has written to Theresa May recommending the UK boosts its military presence in the country - but no decision has been made. The UK currently has more than 600 troops in capital Kabul helping train Afghan security forces. It followscalls by US President Donald Trump and Natofor allies to join him in sending more troops to the country. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said he understood that Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson recommended sending up to 400 more army personnel into Afghanistan, joining the 600 already there training Afghan soldiers. The UK troops would help train Afghan forces and not be in combat. Any announcement was likely to coincide with the Nato summit in July, our correspondent added. Afghanistan profile: Timeline Who are the Taliban? In 2017, theUS announced a planto send in thousands more troops, which would bring the US total to about 15,000. It is part of a strategy to help fight the Taliban and deal with the rising threat from the Islamic State group. The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014 after being involved in the conflict since 2001. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of joint forces command who led campaigns in Afghanistan, said the UK ""has to recognise that the decision to leave in 2014... hasn't worked"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the national army and air force in Afghanistan were ""not strong enough"" to defeat the Taliban alone. The decision to increase troops would ""send an important message to our allies, and the Taliban,"" he added. ""The only way this war is going to end is when the Taliban realise they can't fight their way back to government. They have to resort to dialogue."" In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said the UK's military contribution was kept under constant review. It said Britain's support to Afghanistan on security, development and governance was ""crucial to building a stable state and reducing the terrorist threat to the UK"". The reports come asMinistry of Defence figures, published on Thursday,,externalshow the size of the Army is at its smallest for more than 200 years. The UK's regular army has just over 77,000 troops - well short of its target strength of 82,000. According to Labour, the figures mark a ""shocking failure"" by the government to recruit and retain the personnel needed by the UK. But the MoD said it remains committed to ensuring Britain's Armed Forces have the right skills to face intensifying global threats. Jonathan Beale said the struggle to fill ranks was due to factors including a pay freeze, the end of combat operations in Afghanistan and the Army's recruitment process, which has seen glitches and delays in its computer application system.

"This video can not be played Trump on Kim meeting: 'North Korea would be very rich' President Donald Trump has said the US is not pursuing the ""Libya model"" for the denuclearisation of North Korea. Mr Trump said Kim Jong-un would stay in power if he made a deal, and hinted he could be deposed if he refused. Libya's Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003. He was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Most analysts say North Korea was angered by the prospect of a Libya scenario precisely because of what happened to Gaddafi. The comparison was made by Mr Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. Analysis: This is Kim's warning shot to the White House North Korea crisis in 300 words It led the North to threaten to pull out of the summit with Mr Trump in Singapore on 12 June. As Mr Bolton looked on, the US president said: ""The Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea. ""The model, if you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,"" Mr Trump said. ""He'd be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country, his country would be very rich."" What Kim wants On the planned summit, Mr Trump said: ""Nothing has changed on North Korea that we know of. We have not been told anything. ""And if it does that's fine and if it doesn't I think we'll probably have a very successful meeting."" John Bolton looked on as President Trump made his feelings clear North Korea's suggestion that it might pull out of the US summit pointed the finger squarely at Mr Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said Wednesday's statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. North Korea was apparently referencing an interview Mr Bolton gave comparing it to ""the Libya model"" of denuclearisation. In 2003, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up his country's programmes of weapons of mass destruction in an announcement that surprised the world. Most US sanctions on Libya were lifted within a few months and diplomatic ties between the countries restored. The North African country came in from the cold. But in 2011 the authoritarian leader was toppled by rebels and militiamen backed by Nato. He was later captured and killed by rebel forces. The Muammar Gaddafi story Also on Thursday, North Korea said it would not resume talks with the South until issues between the two are resolved.

Pyongyang appears to be putting pressure on both the US and South Korea and refusing to talk until some concessions are made, she adds. At the summit between the leaders of North and South Korea on 27 April both sides agreed to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. But Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament.

"Victim Ozell Pemberton's former school released a tribute to the 16-year-old A 17-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a boy who was stabbed on a busy shopping street. The victim, named locally as Ozell Pemberton, 16, was found injured at about 15:30 BST on Thursday at Lower Parade in the main shopping area of Sutton Coldfield, north of Birmingham. West Midlands Police said the suspect handed himself into a police station in the early hours and remains in custody. The attack reportedly took place near a McDonald's and a group of bus stops. Midlands Live: Tribute to father of hit-and-run death brothers; Fake speed camera removed after Facebook abuse Police said there had been disorder in the area at the time and several people were seen fleeing. The ambulance service said despite its ""tremendous efforts"", Ozell was confirmed dead at the scene. Police said he has has not yet been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. But a tribute to Ozell was released by his former school earlier. Ozell was stabbed at 15:30 BST on Thursday in a busy shopping area ""We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic death of one of our former pupils and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" a spokesperson for Greenwood Academy, Castle Vale, said. ""For our part, we are providing counselling and support to our pupils and staff to help them through this difficult time."" Staff said he last attended the school in November 2015. Lower Parade is the main shopping street in Sutton Coldfield Councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity ward, described the violence as ""appalling"". He added: ""My sympathies go out to this person's family and their friends. ""I think people want to feel safe; it's really important that police take action very quickly."" Unfortunately fatal stabbings in Birmingham are nothing new. This crime happened in the affluent area of Sutton Coldfield and in the middle of the afternoon. The age of the victim is also unnerving; just 16 and killed as a result of what officers call ""disorder"" involving several people. At a time when police resources are stretched in the region and crime rates are soaring, there is a palpable fear among some residents who are repeatedly saying that they just don't feel safe anymore. That fear is particularly prevalent among the older generation, but the victims in many of these violent cases are young men and boys. @sima_kotecha,external Part of Lower Parade remains sealed off for investigations to be carried out. West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Murray, said: ""This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of everyone in the community, are with the boy's family at this truly devastating time. ""A dedicated team of homicide detectives has worked non-stop on the investigation since yesterday and has made good progress."" Teenage boy killed in stabbing Schools 'should teach stabbing first aid' 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' Mr Murray added: ""We need parents, community leaders, schools and young people themselves to pass the message that it is never OK to carry or use a knife."" David Jamieson, the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said ""much more needs to be done"". ""This is another stark reminder of the importance and responsibility we all have in ending violence in our communities,"" he said. Mr Jamieson said he was spending an extra Â£2m ""tackling violence"" over the next two years. The number of fatal knife crime offences in the West Midlands in 2017 was 22, double that of 2015 The total number of knife crime offences reported to police in 2017 was 4,955 In 2016, that number was 4,278; while in 2015 the figure was 3,466 Source: West Midlands Police Teenage boy killed in stabbing Schools 'should teach stabbing first aid' 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' More than 350 knife crimes in schools More than 2,000 weapons seized in schools Why are more youths carrying knives?

"From choosing the cake to the flowers and even the chair-covers, anyone who's ever planned a wedding knows it can be eye-wateringly expensive. But when it comes to royal weddings - with all the VIPs, security and extra extravagance - the bill runs into millions. So what do we know about the expected cost of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, and how much will the taxpayer be paying towards it? The wedding will be held in Windsor. And crowds in excess of 100,000 people are expected to descend on the town. Invitations have been sent to 600 guests, with a further 200 invited to the couple's evening reception On top of that, 1,200 members of the public will attend the grounds of Windsor Castle. Managing these sorts of numbers requires substantial planning. And security will almost certainly be the biggest single cost. In 2011, Â£6.35m was spent on security for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding The Home Office wouldn't comment when Reality Check contacted it, saying revealing policing costs could compromise ""national security"". Likewise, when we rang Thames Valley Police, it said: ""We aren't going to give you any data I'm afraid - even though we know you love numbers."" However, we do know Â£6.35m was spent by the Metropolitan Police (ie the taxpayer) on security for Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. That's based on aFreedom of Information request released to the Press Association.,external But it's difficult to draw a direct comparison with Prince Harry and Ms Markle's wedding - the location and guest numbers are different. Kensington Palace hasn't released any details of what it plans to spend on the wedding. That's not really a surprise given that the official cost of Prince William and Catherine's wedding has never been revealed. That leaves us with unofficial estimates and as such they need to be treated with some caution. Bridebook.co.uk, a wedding planning service, saysthe total cost of the wedding could be Â£32m,external- including the cost of security. It put the cost of the cake at Â£50,000, the florist at Â£110,000, the catering at Â£286,000, and so on and so on. Reality Check contacted the company's owner, Hamish Shephard, to ask about the methodology used to arrive at the estimate. He said the Â£32m figure had been based on the assumption that the Royal Family had paid for everything at market rate. But in the absence of any official data, this is still guesswork - however well informed. For example, we don't know if suppliers would offer a substantial discount for the privilege of providing their services for a royal wedding. Ms Markle will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The cost of security for the wedding will be met by the taxpayer. Initially, Thames Valley Police will have to absorb the cost itself. But the force will be eligible to apply for special grant funding from the Home Office after the event in order to claim back some of the costs. Special grant funding is a separate pool of money forces can apply for if they have to police events outside their usual remit. Royal wedding 2018: all you need to know Queen to receive Â£6m pay increase from public funds Reality Check: What does the Queen cost us? As for the rest of the total, the Royal Family has said it will be paying for the private elements of the wedding. Every year the Royal Family gets a chunk of money from theannual Sovereign Grant,external, paid directly by the Treasury. The grant is calculated on a percentage of the profits from theCrown Estate portfolio,external, which includes much of London's West End. This year it's worth Â£82m. Some members of the Royal Family benefit from additional income. For example, Prince Charles gets money from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a portfolio of land, property and financial investments.

"Suspected cases are being treated at isolation hospitals in the Democratic Republic of Congo An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not yet an international public health emergency, the World Health Organization has said. It said there was a ""strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control"". At least 45 people are believed to have been infected in the current outbreak and 25 deaths are being investigated. Cases emerged in a rural area with one now confirmed in the north-western city of Mbandaka. The city of about one million people is a transport hub on the River Congo, prompting fears that the virus could now spread further, threatening the capital Kinshasa and surrounding countries. Ebola is an infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal. It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid, and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. Why Ebola keeps coming back Why Ebola is so dangerous How not to catch Ebola At an emergency meeting, WHO experts said that""the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not currently been met"".,external Had they decided otherwise, a larger response to the outbreak would have been triggered. This video can not be played Some simple techniques can help prevent spread of Ebola. Although Ebola had already spread to an urban area, the experts said they believed the outbreak could be brought under control. They also stressed that it was ""particularly important there should be no international travel or trade restrictions"". The WHO said it had identified more than 500 people who had potentially come into contact with Ebola patients in the country. It said they would be closely monitored for symptoms of the disease and were likely to be among the first to be given an Ebola vaccine, which - although still in the experimental stage - proved effective during a trial. The WHO said some health workers had become infected with Ebola. WHO has previously admitted that it was too slow to respond to a deadly Ebola outbreakin West Africa from 2014-2016 that killed more than 11,000 people. Mapping the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: ""I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?'"" ""They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear,"" he added. Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes. Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency. It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever. ""But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed,"" said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port. Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. WHO says that of the 45 Ebola cases reported, 14 are confirmed, 21 are probable, and 10 are suspected. They were recorded in Congo's Equateur province. Mbandaka is the provincial capital. Mr Salama said that isolation and rudimentary management facilities had been set up in the city. He said the disease could have been taken there by people who attended the funeral of an Ebola victim in Bikoro, south of Mbandaka, before travelling to the city. On Wednesday more than 4,000 doses of an experimental vaccine sent by the WHO arrived in Kinshasa with another batch expected soon. These would be given as a priority to people in Mbandaka who had been in contact with those suspected of carrying the Ebola virus before people in any other affected area, Mr Salama said. The vaccine, from pharmaceutical firm Merck, is unlicensed but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa outbreak. However, it needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C, which is a challenge in DR Congo because electricity supplies are unreliable. WHO said health workers had identified 430 people who may have had contact with the disease and were working to trace more than 4,000 contacts of Ebola patients who had spread across north-west DR Congo. Many of these people were in remote areas, Mr Salama said. This is the ninth outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo - it was named after the country's Ebola river. Ebola can be introduced into the human population through contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. These can include chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelope and porcupines. It is not possible to eradicate all the animals who might be a host for Ebola. As long as humans come in contact with them, there is always a possibility that Ebola could return. Was bushmeat behind the 2014 Ebola outbreak?

"The host of Catfish has been accused of sexual misconduct by someone who appeared on the show in 2015 Production of MTV show Catfish has been suspended following claims of sexual harassment against its host, Nev Schulman. The allegations surfaced after a former participant on the show posted a YouTube video last week claiming she was harassed. Nev denies the allegations, saying what he's been accused of ""did not happen"". In a statement to the New York Daily News, MTV said it's conducting a ""thorough investigation"". For those who don't watch the show, Catfish follows Nev Schulman as he investigates people using fake online profiles. He's being accused of inappropriate conduct by a woman who appeared on the cyber-dating series in 2015. In a YouTube video uploaded on 12 May, the woman claims Nev ""picked apart"" her sexuality as a lesbian and propositioned her for sex. ""The behaviour described in this video did not happen,"" Nev said in a statement. ""I'm fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth. ""I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions - but these claims are false,"" he added. Nev Schulman (right) with co-host Max Joseph Nev originally shot to fame with his 2010 documentary Catfish. The film follows Nev's story as he builds a relationship with a woman who uses fake social media profiles to interact with him. The concept became the basis for the MTV reality show, which began in 2012. Its seventh season came out in January. MTV is working with third party production company Critical Content to investigate the claims against Nev Schulman. Filming is suspended until the investigation is completed.

"Candida auris is responsible for increasing invasive fungal infections in hospitals Scientists are warning that levels of resistance to treatments for fungal infections are growing, which could lead to more outbreaks of disease. Intensive-care and transplant patients and those with cancer are most at risk because their immune systems cannot fight off the infections. Writing inScience,external, researchers said new treatments were urgently needed. Fungal infections had some of the highest mortality rates of infectious diseases, an expert said. An international team, led by researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Exeter, found a huge increase in resistance to antifungal drugs worldwide over the past 30-40 years. Prof Matthew Fisher, professor of epidemiology at Imperial College London, said this was probably down to farmers spraying their affected crops with the same drugs used to treat fungal infections in patients. The ""unintentional by-product of this 'dual use' of drugs in the field and the clinic"" was that drugs were no longer working in patients who were unwell, he said. ""There are fungi in the air all the time, in every lung-full of air we breathe,"" Prof Fisher said. ""Bodies with a fully functioning immune system do an amazing job of curing the infection - but it can become an invasive fungal infection in others and [this] needs a drug."" He said the number of people at risk from fungal infections was rising rapidly as a result of increased numbers: people with HIV the elderly patients in hospital The review said improvements were needed in how existing drugs were used, as well as an increased focus on the discovery of new treatments, in order to avoid a ""global collapse"" in the fight against fungal infections. Prof Sarah Gurr, from the University of Exeter, said: ""Emerging resistance to antifungal drugs has largely gone under the radar, but without intervention, fungal conditions affecting humans, animals and plants will become increasingly difficult to counteract."" Prof Gordon Brown, director of the Medical Research Council Centre for Medical Mycology, said some fungal infections had mortality rates of more than 50%. He said: ""Given the high rates of mortality of these infections, these disturbing trends suggest that even our limited ability to treat these diseases is being severely compromised."" Prof Brown said we were also seeing the rise of new multidrug-resistant fungi such asCandida auris. Candida aurisis responsible for increasing rates of invasive fungal infections in hospitals around the world - but there are very few treatments for it. The review said it was resistant to all antifungal drugs and ""presents a threat to intensive-care units"" because it could survive normal efforts at decontamination.

"Police were called to the Crows Road/Harts Lane area of Barking A 24-year-old man has been stabbed to death in east London. Police were called to Crows Road, Barking, at 23:31 BST on Thursday and found the injured victim. The Metropolitan Police said: ""He was given first aid by officers prior to the arrival of paramedics but sadly was pronounced dead at the scene."" Formal identification is still to take place but the victim's next of kin have been informed. No arrests have been made. London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the stabbing as ""devastating"" and said his thoughts are with the victim's friends and family. ""There is no honour in staying silent. To stop stabbings and violent crime, we must work together,"" he said. MP for Barking Dame Margaret Hodge offered her ""deepest condolences to the young man's family""in a post on Twitter,external.

"Victim Ozell Pemberton's former school released a tribute to the 16-year-old A 17-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a boy who was stabbed on a busy shopping street. The victim, named locally as Ozell Pemberton, 16, was found injured at about 15:30 BST on Thursday at Lower Parade in the main shopping area of Sutton Coldfield, north of Birmingham. West Midlands Police said the suspect handed himself into a police station in the early hours and remains in custody. The attack reportedly took place near a McDonald's and a group of bus stops. Midlands Live: Tribute to father of hit-and-run death brothers; Fake speed camera removed after Facebook abuse Police said there had been disorder in the area at the time and several people were seen fleeing. The ambulance service said despite its ""tremendous efforts"", Ozell was confirmed dead at the scene. Police said he has has not yet been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. But a tribute to Ozell was released by his former school earlier. Ozell was stabbed at 15:30 BST on Thursday in a busy shopping area ""We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic death of one of our former pupils and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" a spokesperson for Greenwood Academy, Castle Vale, said. ""For our part, we are providing counselling and support to our pupils and staff to help them through this difficult time."" Staff said he last attended the school in November 2015. Lower Parade is the main shopping street in Sutton Coldfield Councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity ward, described the violence as ""appalling"". He added: ""My sympathies go out to this person's family and their friends. ""I think people want to feel safe; it's really important that police take action very quickly."" Unfortunately fatal stabbings in Birmingham are nothing new. This crime happened in the affluent area of Sutton Coldfield and in the middle of the afternoon. The age of the victim is also unnerving; just 16 and killed as a result of what officers call ""disorder"" involving several people. At a time when police resources are stretched in the region and crime rates are soaring, there is a palpable fear among some residents who are repeatedly saying that they just don't feel safe anymore. That fear is particularly prevalent among the older generation, but the victims in many of these violent cases are young men and boys. @sima_kotecha,external Part of Lower Parade remains sealed off for investigations to be carried out. West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Murray, said: ""This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of everyone in the community, are with the boy's family at this truly devastating time. ""A dedicated team of homicide detectives has worked non-stop on the investigation since yesterday and has made good progress."" Teenage boy killed in stabbing Schools 'should teach stabbing first aid' 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' Mr Murray added: ""We need parents, community leaders, schools and young people themselves to pass the message that it is never OK to carry or use a knife."" David Jamieson, the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said ""much more needs to be done"". ""This is another stark reminder of the importance and responsibility we all have in ending violence in our communities,"" he said. Mr Jamieson said he was spending an extra Â£2m ""tackling violence"" over the next two years. The number of fatal knife crime offences in the West Midlands in 2017 was 22, double that of 2015 The total number of knife crime offences reported to police in 2017 was 4,955 In 2016, that number was 4,278; while in 2015 the figure was 3,466 Source: West Midlands Police Teenage boy killed in stabbing Schools 'should teach stabbing first aid' 'I realised I don't need to carry a knife' More than 350 knife crimes in schools More than 2,000 weapons seized in schools Why are more youths carrying knives?

"Sergei Skripal was exposed to a nerve agent from the Novichok group in Salisbury Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal has been discharged from hospital, two months after being poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury. The 66-year-old was found slumped on a park bench in the city on 4 March, with his daughter Yulia. They were taken to Salisbury District Hospital's intensive care unit, where they were stabilised after being exposed to Novichok. Ms Skripal was released on 9 April and was moved to a secure location. It is not known whether Mr Skripal has been taken to the same location as his daughter. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said he understood that Mr Skripal is able to walk, and has talked to police at length, but is not completely recovered. He said police sources indicated that the investigation could take months of carefully piecing together movements of people and cars from mobile phone records, CCTV, automatic number plate recognition and passenger flight records. The Metropolitan Police said its investigation into the attack continued and it would not ""be discussing any protective or security arrangements that are in place"". This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back at cases of high-profile Russians targeted on foreign soil Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said treating the Skripals had been ""a huge and unprecedented challenge"". She added: ""This is an important stage in his recovery, which will now take place away from the hospital."" Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko welcomed the news that Mr Skripal had been discharged, and repeated his demand for consular access to the former spy and his daughter. At a news conference at his official residence in London, Mr Yakovenko said: ""We are happy that he is all right."" The Russian ambassador has previously claimed the UK is violating international law by not granting access to the Skripals. ""If they don't want our assistance, that's fine, but we want to see them physically,"" he said. Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats in response to the attack in Salisbury,but Mr Yakovenko and others remain,external. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Russia 'targeted' Yulia Skripal's email DS Nick Bailey - the police officer who first attended the Skripals on the day of the poisoning - was also treated for exposure to the nerve agent, butwas discharged in March. Clinicians at the hospital had to keep the Skripals alive while their bodies could produce more enzymes to replace those that had been poisoned. By Leila Nathoo, BBC News home affairs correspondent When Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left in a critical condition, it seemed improbable that the two would survive. Now, less than three months on, both have been discharged from hospital. Their personal safety will be a priority for the police - the two have been taken to a secure location. Detectives are continuing to investigate the attempted murder of the Skripals, though so far no suspects have been named. They will have spoken at length to both Sergei and Yulia about what happened and why they may have been targeted. But police say they are still working to establish the full facts of the attack. The UK government has blamed Russia for the attack, with Prime Minister Theresa May describing the incident as ""brazen"" and ""despicable"". But the Russian government denied any involvement and has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to speak at a conference in Paris on Friday intended to fight against impunity for the use of chemical weapons. Speaking before the conference, he said: ""Assad's brutality in Syria and the attempted murders in Salisbury pose a grave threat to the Chemical Weapons Convention and to the rules-based order that keeps us all safe."" Yulia and Sergei Skripal were taken to Salisbury District Hospital after being found slumped on a bench In 2006 Mr Skripal, a former Russian colonel, was jailed in Russia for 13 years for passing on the  identities of Russian spies in Europe to the UK intelligence services. But in 2010 he was part of a prisoner swap between Moscow and the United States. He eventually settled in Salisbury. When Ms Skripal was released she refused assistance from the Russian embassy, who claim they had been denied consular access to a Russian national. Recently the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, publicly blamed Russia for the ""reckless"" poisoning, accusing the Kremlin of ""flagrant breaches of international rules"". Specialist officers in protective suits retrieved samples from multiple sites in Salisbury The investigation into the nerve agent attack saw the closure of areas of Salisbury, as police and specialist investigators identified where the Skripals were poisoned. The highest concentration of the Novichok was found at the Skripals' front door. A multimillion pound operation to decontaminate nine locations in the city is under way. Two places that the Skripals visited - the Mill pub and a Zizzi restaurant - are among the places deemed to be still at risk. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel?

"LGIM's Helena Morrissey says the fund ""empowers us all to use our money to help firms to progress"" The first investment fund aimed at encouraging gender diversity among UK firms has been launched by Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM). The L&G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund (GIRL) will favour shares in firms that have the best record on gender diversity. It will score and rank companies according to four different measures, including women on the board. Only one of the UK's biggest 350 firms achieved full marks for diversity. Renewables Infrastructure Group, the investment specialist, achieved a top score of 100 for the number of women on its board, among its executives, in management and in the workforce. Companies are expected to reach a minimum of 30% representation of women in these four measures, said LGIM. MPs pressure City firms over diversity Firms urged to put more women in top jobs Other companies in the index, which was devised by LGIM, to score 85 or above were Merlin Entertainments, information company Ascential, JD Williams-owner N Brown, Next and Marks & Spencer. LGIM said the fund,externalwas expected to ""raise gender diversity standards in companies across the UK equity market, by allocating more to companies that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity"". ""The fund aims to empower investors to make a difference to the companies in which they invest and wider society,"" it added. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at LGIM,  ""Gender inequality is one of the key issues of our time - and one that generates so much frustration. ""Rather than feeling trapped or despondent, let's do something about it. I'm excited about the launch of the GIRL Fund, which empowers us all to use our money to help companies to progress. ""When we invest in the success of women, we are investing in the success of business. Collectively, we can help achieve gender equality and improve gender diversity in the UK,"" she added. LGIM will put Â£50m of its own money into the fund, which will be open to both institutional and retail investors.

"In 2016-17, a total of 19% of students in higher education in the UK were from outside the country, according to official figures A Home Office advisory committee has ditched research assessing the impact of international students after academics labelled it ""unethical"". The survey, set up by the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which informs Home Office policy, asked for students' views on international classmates. But it could be completed by anyone and some said it posed ""loaded"" questions. A Mac spokesman stressed the survey was ""not designed to be discriminatory"", but confirmed it was being withdrawn. ""Following online commentary it has become apparent to us that we will be unable to use the responses to the survey,"" the spokesman said. The committee defended the survey, saying it was ""simply an attempt to ask students for their experiences"" and ""had the potential to show a very positive view of international students in the UK"". However, on Thursday, it concluded the survey ""cannot now be used to add to our evidence base"". Prof Tanja Bueltmannâ, a professor of migration history at Northumbria University, said the survey was ""completely invalid and must never be used as evidence to inform policy"". She said she had urged the Home Office and the committee to scrap it or disregard it. ""Initially, I thought it must be some sort of fake thing - because of the nature of the questions,"" she said. It asked students to assess whether the impact of international students on their course was negative, positive or neutral. It also asked if students lived with any international students or studied with any on their course. The survey was being posted by universities, who were encouraging students to fill it in and was due to close at the end of May. It was also being shared on Twitter, by vice-chancellors from the Universities UK group, which later announced that it would no longer be sharing it. Allow Twitter content?

A Universities UK spokesman said: ""Due to legitimate concerns raised about a Migration Advisory Committee survey on international students, we will not be sharing it further. ""While it's important that policy-makers hear from students about international students' positive impact, views must be sought appropriately."" UUK vice-chancellors will also be deleting all tweets of the survey. Prof Bueltmann said: ""In principle there's nothing wrong with a survey on the impact of international students, but say you look Asian and you're actually British, but the student standing next to you thinks you're Asian?"" This could mean the person is basing their views on the wrong information, she suggested. An online message replaced the survey after it had been closed Her view was mirrored by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which questioned whether the survey was ""encouraging baseless speculation about those who seem different?"". The National Union of Students called the survey ""inherently flawed"". The Union's international students' officer, Yinbo Yu, said asking students to gauge international student numbers ""seemingly based on appearance"" was ""not only shockingly insensitive, but it does not reflect the reality of our diverse yet cohesive university communities"". Prof Bueltmannâ also suggested that those who had a view that immigration was a bad thing would have been more likely to fill it in. ""It's a bit like with Tripadvisor, you're more likely to fill it in if you've had a bad experience,"" she said. ""The survey unquestionably contains loaded/leading questions that force respondents to problematise international students in a way that they may never have naturally done. ""If I had done this as a research project, I'd be in trouble with my ethics committee now."" She added that the whole design of the survey was flawed because anyone could fill it in, and repeatedly if they used different computers. Posting on Twitter, Matthias Eberl, engagement lead at Cardiff University's Systems Immunity Research Institute, said: ""A student survey that's openly accessible to anyone and can be filled in multiple times. Whatever the results from this survey, they are utterly meaningless."" A lawyer, Ewan Kennedyâ, also completed the survey, saying he found it ""very odd"". He said he ""went through it as an experiment and it shot off at the end without needing any identifier - oops!"" The survey was part of work commissioned by former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, after the government came under pressure to remove international students from net migration targets. In her commissioning letter of August 2017, she said the committee had never undertaken a full assessment of the impact of international students. ""We would like to have an objective assessment of the impact of international students which includes consideration of both EU and non-EU students at all levels of education,"" the letter said. ""This assessment should go beyond the direct impact of students in the form of tuition fees and spending, including consideration of their impact on the labour market and the provision and quality of education provided to domestic students. ""This should give the government an improved evidence base for any future decisions whilst the ONS goes through the process of reviewing the contribution it thinks students are making to net migration."" Before the survey was decommissioned, a spokesman for the Mac had said it was part of its ongoing work looking at the impact of international students in the UK.

"This video can not be played Trump on Kim meeting: 'North Korea would be very rich' President Donald Trump has said the US is not pursuing the ""Libya model"" for the denuclearisation of North Korea. Mr Trump said Kim Jong-un would stay in power if he made a deal, and hinted he could be deposed if he refused. Libya's Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003. He was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Most analysts say North Korea was angered by the prospect of a Libya scenario precisely because of what happened to Gaddafi. The comparison was made by Mr Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. Analysis: This is Kim's warning shot to the White House North Korea crisis in 300 words It led the North to threaten to pull out of the summit with Mr Trump in Singapore on 12 June. As Mr Bolton looked on, the US president said: ""The Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea. ""The model, if you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,"" Mr Trump said. ""He'd be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country, his country would be very rich."" What Kim wants On the planned summit, Mr Trump said: ""Nothing has changed on North Korea that we know of. We have not been told anything. ""And if it does that's fine and if it doesn't I think we'll probably have a very successful meeting."" John Bolton looked on as President Trump made his feelings clear North Korea's suggestion that it might pull out of the US summit pointed the finger squarely at Mr Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said Wednesday's statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. North Korea was apparently referencing an interview Mr Bolton gave comparing it to ""the Libya model"" of denuclearisation. In 2003, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up his country's programmes of weapons of mass destruction in an announcement that surprised the world. Most US sanctions on Libya were lifted within a few months and diplomatic ties between the countries restored. The North African country came in from the cold. But in 2011 the authoritarian leader was toppled by rebels and militiamen backed by Nato. He was later captured and killed by rebel forces. The Muammar Gaddafi story Also on Thursday, North Korea said it would not resume talks with the South until issues between the two are resolved. Pyongyang has been angered by continuing US-South Korea joint military exercises which it sees as a rehearsal for invasion. It cancelled planned high-level talks with South Korea earlier this week. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. In a statement, chief negotiator Ri Son-gwon reverted to the angry language the North has used before, describing South Korean authorities as incompetent and senseless in comments reported by state news agency KCNA. He also criticised South Korea for allowing ""human scum"" (a reference to a North Korean defector) to speak at the Seoul National Assembly. This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man Thursday's criticism of South Korea marks yet another shift in tone from Pyongyang just weeks before the planned US summit, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says. Pyongyang appears to be putting pressure on both the US and South Korea and refusing to talk until some concessions are made, she adds. At the summit between the leaders of North and South Korea on 27 April both sides agreed to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. But Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told MPs on Thursdaythere was a gap between North Korea and the US on ""how to pull off denuclearisation"",,externalaccording to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. North Korea said last week it would begin dismantling its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri between 23-25 May, but there was no mention of allowing foreign experts access to the site. On a recent visit to North Korea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed that any claim of denuclearisation by the North would require a ""robust verification"" programme by the US and other nations. US offers to help rebuild N Korea economy if it denuclearises North Korea's nuclear programme explained Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"John Bercow has been Speaker since 2009 Commons Speaker John Bercow has acknowledged that ""strong and differing views were expressed"" in the House of Commons, after claims he called a cabinet minister ""a stupid woman"". The Daily Telegraph reported he made the comments about Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom under his breath. Mr Bercow's office said it would not comment on ""suggested accounts of private conversations"". No 10 said the remarks, if proven to be true, would be ""unacceptable"". Downing Street said that if an official complaint was made, it should be properly investigated. Mrs Leadsom said, in her role as the government's representative in Parliament, she was focused on ensuring that ""anyone who is bullied or treated unfairly"" was ""able to come forward and have their concerns and complaints dealt with in a rigorous and fair manner"". Bercow investigation blocked by MPs Bercow defiant as MP questions his future BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the allegations would add to pressure on Mr Bercow following allegations of bullying from former members of staff, which he has denied. Thestory in the Telegraph,externalandthe Sun,externalsuggests Mr Bercow muttered insults under his breath following prime minister's questions on Wednesday. Asked to respond, the Speaker's office said: ""Wednesday was an unusual and controversial day in how business was handled in the House by the government and some strong and differing views were expressed on all sides on the subject. Ms Leadsom is in charge of scheduling government business in the Commons ""The Speaker treats his colleagues with respect and strives at every turn to facilitate the House of Commons."" On Wednesday, the Commons Standards Committee voted against an investigation by Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone into the allegations of bullying made against Mr Bercow. The Speaker's former private secretary, Angus Sinclair, has said Mr Bercow shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. Allegations have also been made about Mr Bercow's behaviour towards Kate Emms, who worked as his private secretary in 2010-2011. In recent weeks Mr Bercow has faced calls to resign because of allegations of bullying staff who worked for him; they are claims he has firmly denied. But separately there is talk in Westminster about how long he'll stay on in the job. That's because when he was voted into the post in June 2009, Mr Bercow said he'd do the role for no more than nine years. His critics are quick to point out that date is fast approaching. Added together, it all means questions are being asked about when exactly he will go. In reality, it is very difficult to force the Speaker out. Unless they go voluntarily it would likely come down to a case of whether or not the individual maintains the confidence of MPs. It means if they weren't shamed into walking, a critical mass of MPs backing a motion of no confidence would be needed to see them go. It's not clear at this stage that Mr Bercow is under that kind of threat. A spokesman for Mr Bercow has said there is ""no substance"" to these allegations. Mr Bercow's alleged comments about Mrs Leadsom came following a row between Labour and ministers over the scheduling of a Commons statement on the state takeover of the East Coast Main Line rail franchise. Labour complained to Mr Bercow that the statement had been deliberately scheduled to limit time for its own ""opposition day"" debates on the legacy of the Grenfell Tower fire and the release of Brexit documents. In response, Mr Bercow chided Mrs Leadsom and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, saying nothing would stop him from upholding the rights of backbenchers to hold the government to account. As Commons leader, Mrs Leadsom is responsible for scheduling government business in the Commons. Some Labour MPs, including veteran Barry Sheerman, have come to the defence of the Speaker, arguing that ministers were to blame for breaching parliamentary protocol. Allow Twitter content?

"Suspected cases are being treated at isolation hospitals in the Democratic Republic of Congo An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not yet an international public health emergency, the World Health Organization has said. It said there was a ""strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control"". At least 45 people are believed to have been infected in the current outbreak and 25 deaths are being investigated. Cases emerged in a rural area with one now confirmed in the north-western city of Mbandaka. The city of about one million people is a transport hub on the River Congo, prompting fears that the virus could now spread further, threatening the capital Kinshasa and surrounding countries. Ebola is an infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal. It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid, and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. Why Ebola keeps coming back Why Ebola is so dangerous How not to catch Ebola At an emergency meeting, WHO experts said that""the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not currently been met"".,external Had they decided otherwise, a larger response to the outbreak would have been triggered. This video can not be played Some simple techniques can help prevent spread of Ebola. Although Ebola had already spread to an urban area, the experts said they believed the outbreak could be brought under control. They also stressed that it was ""particularly important there should be no international travel or trade restrictions"". The WHO said it had identified more than 500 people who had potentially come into contact with Ebola patients in the country. It said they would be closely monitored for symptoms of the disease and were likely to be among the first to be given an Ebola vaccine, which - although still in the experimental stage - proved effective during a trial. The WHO said some health workers had become infected with Ebola. WHO has previously admitted that it was too slow to respond to a deadly Ebola outbreakin West Africa from 2014-2016 that killed more than 11,000 people. Mapping the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: ""I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?'"" ""They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear,"" he added. Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes. Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency. It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever. ""But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed,"" said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port. Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. WHO says that of the 45 Ebola cases reported, 14 are confirmed, 21 are probable, and 10 are suspected. They were recorded in Congo's Equateur province. Mbandaka is the provincial capital. Mr Salama said that isolation and rudimentary management facilities had been set up in the city. He said the disease could have been taken there by people who attended the funeral of an Ebola victim in Bikoro, south of Mbandaka, before travelling to the city. On Wednesday more than 4,000 doses of an experimental vaccine sent by the WHO arrived in Kinshasa with another batch expected soon. These would be given as a priority to people in Mbandaka who had been in contact with those suspected of carrying the Ebola virus before people in any other affected area, Mr Salama said. The vaccine, from pharmaceutical firm Merck, is unlicensed but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa outbreak. However, it needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C, which is a challenge in DR Congo because electricity supplies are unreliable. WHO said health workers had identified 430 people who may have had contact with the disease and were working to trace more than 4,000 contacts of Ebola patients who had spread across north-west DR Congo. Many of these people were in remote areas, Mr Salama said. This is the ninth outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo - it was named after the country's Ebola river. Ebola can be introduced into the human population through contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. These can include chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelope and porcupines. It is not possible to eradicate all the animals who might be a host for Ebola. As long as humans come in contact with them, there is always a possibility that Ebola could return. Was bushmeat behind the 2014 Ebola outbreak?

"LGIM's Helena Morrissey says the fund ""empowers us all to use our money to help firms to progress"" The first investment fund aimed at encouraging gender diversity among UK firms has been launched by Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM). The L&G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund (GIRL) will favour shares in firms that have the best record on gender diversity. It will score and rank companies according to four different measures, including women on the board. Only one of the UK's biggest 350 firms achieved full marks for diversity. Renewables Infrastructure Group, the investment specialist, achieved a top score of 100 for the number of women on its board, among its executives, in management and in the workforce. Companies are expected to reach a minimum of 30% representation of women in these four measures, said LGIM. MPs pressure City firms over diversity Firms urged to put more women in top jobs Other companies in the index, which was devised by LGIM, to score 85 or above were Merlin Entertainments, information company Ascential, JD Williams-owner N Brown, Next and Marks & Spencer. LGIM said the fund,externalwas expected to ""raise gender diversity standards in companies across the UK equity market, by allocating more to companies that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity"". ""The fund aims to empower investors to make a difference to the companies in which they invest and wider society,"" it added. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at LGIM,  ""Gender inequality is one of the key issues of our time - and one that generates so much frustration. ""Rather than feeling trapped or despondent, let's do something about it. I'm excited about the launch of the GIRL Fund, which empowers us all to use our money to help companies to progress. ""When we invest in the success of women, we are investing in the success of business. Collectively, we can help achieve gender equality and improve gender diversity in the UK,"" she added. LGIM will put Â£50m of its own money into the fund, which will be open to both institutional and retail investors.

"This video can not be played Charlotte Hogg on learning lessons after Bank 'mistake' Charlotte Hogg has spoken of learning lessons after the ""mistake"" that ended her career at the Bank of England. A former deputy governor - and tipped to take the top job - she says in her first interview that the experience made her a ""different kind of leader"". She left the bank for not declaring her brother was a senior executive at Barclays, something that might be perceived as a conflict of interest. It was a difficult time and ""I wouldn't wish it on anybody"", she told the BBC. Since her resignation in March 2017, Ms Hogg has remained out of the public eye. In the interview Ms Hogg reveals she has learned lessons from the ""mistake"", and argues it is important that people are allowed to move on after making errors - and still be successful. ""I wouldn't wish it on anybody, but there are many worse things that happen to us in life,"" Ms Hogg, who is now the chief executive of Visa Europe, told me. ""I think all the experiences one goes through in life, you learn something from. ""When something very difficult happens and you are enormously well supported by your colleagues who are wonderful and also by your friends, that enables you to bounce back. ""I think it also has made me a different kind of leader in the organisation I'm in today. ""I hope it makes me a more positive one actually, because when something bad happens and you bounce back you see the possibilities in life and that's a wonderful place to be. ""The other thing is whenever I see someone going through a rough time, I try to reach out. ""I hoped I did it before, but I'm pretty certain I'd do it every time now."" Ms Hogg repeated her apology from her resignation letter which was published at the time she quit. ""I think I've said everything I needed to when I resigned but I apologise for the mistake I made and I apologised to my colleagues and you know, we all moved on,"" she said. ""I owned up to having made a mistake and I set the bar for what I thought the consequences of that should be."" Her departure was a blow for the governor, Mark Carney, and his drive for a more diverse bank. The Monetary Policy Committee, the Bank's interest rate setting body of which she was a member, now has only one woman among its nine rate setters. And earlier this week Ben Broadbent, one of the four male deputy governors at the Bank, apologised after describing the economy as ""menopausal"", a word he admitted had ageist and sexist overtones. At the time of her resignation, George Osborne, the former chancellor, asked whether a senior male executive at the Bank would have been treated the same way if he failed to register that his sister worked in the financial services sector. I asked Ms Hogg whether she agreed. ""I don't think it profits anybody, or it certainly doesn't profit me, to think about that,"" she replied. ""It's more how do you set the rules for yourself and how do you live by them, and how do you learn from that, and I'm very happy to be where I am."" I asked Ms Hogg what message she might give her 20-year-old-self - and younger women now just starting their careers. ""We need to give women in our society the opportunity to contribute in any way they want, whether it's financial services or in schools,"" she said. ""And if by seeing one person who's gone through a bit of a bump, but has learnt through that, helps them to find whatever their path is in life, then that would be a good thing. ""I mean, we're human. ""I doubt any of us could look through all of our lives and say that it's entirely without mistakes, or could we say that those mistakes haven't helped us to grow perhaps more than things that have gone well for us."" Ms Hogg said that Visa - which has a gender pay gap of 10%, low compared with many banks for example - has made improving diversity a key challenge. ""As a leader of Visa, I want it to be a more diverse organisation. ""It already is - last year it was 25% senior women, today it's 33% and we're going up from there. ""It's not just about gender, it's about all forms of opinion and all forms of protected characteristics, but it's a good start, so I think I have a responsibility and I hope I live up to that.""

"This video can not be played PIP: 'What is going on with the welfare system?' Three-quarters of disabled people who challenged a decision to stop or reduce their main benefit were successful in Wales last year, figures have shown. A charity said the 8,000 successes ""clearly demonstrates fundamental flaws"" in assessing disabled people's needs were not being addressed. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said new evidence could be provided at tribunals. But one successful claimant warned the issue could drive people to suicide. Steven Evans from Newport has cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis and is a wheelchair user. Disability benefits system 'lacks trust' PIPs: Benefit claimants share their stories New benefits system 'demeaning, degrading' He was sent a letter in January from the DWP advising him to apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which was replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA). He said his first application was lost in the post, so a friend helped him fill in a second one. The DWP said he was sent another three letters advising him to attend an assessment, but he did not see the letters, and even if he had, could not have opened them because of his cerebral palsy. When his benefits were stopped he asked for all correspondence to be sent to a local charity, so he did not miss any further letters. Personal Independence Payment appeals in Wales But Mr Evans said his Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) payments were also then halted because there were two addresses for him on their system. As part of his appeal against both sets of payments, his GP said his medical notes stating his abilities meant it was ""unethical"" that he should endure further investigation relating to welfare payments. During that time, Mr Evans racked up more than Â£3,500 of debt as a result of the stopped payments, but has now received all of the money he is owed by the DWP. However, he feels other disabled people will be at risk of serious mental health problems if the DWP does not do more to check whether removing benefits is appropriate. ""What the hell is going on with the welfare system that is meant to be supporting me as a vulnerable person?"" Mr Evans said. ""It's not doing that. People will commit suicide because they're not listening, they're not doing their job with common sense."" Employment and Support Allowance appeals in Wales The figures, obtained by BBC Wales showed only the south west of England had higher success rates (76%) than Wales while other places around the UK varied between 59% and 68% but had higher numbers appealing. Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, called on the UK government to ""get a grip"" on the situation. He said: ""Disabled people rely on these financial lifelines to live independently and be part of their community. ""Without urgent action, vast numbers will continue to be denied this support unfairly."" A DWP spokesman said: ""Decisions are made following consideration of all the information provided by the claimant, including supporting evidence from their GP or medical specialist. ""In the majority of successful appeals, decisions are overturned because people have submitted more oral or written evidence."" PIPs are for those who need help with extra costs associated with long-term illness or disability and pays up to Â£139.75 per week. ESAs, worth up to Â£73.10 per week, is designed to replace older forms of support, such as incapacity benefit. Both benefits require an assessment of the claimant - which can include a face-to-face appointment - to decide how someone's illness or disability impacts on the cost of their day-to-day lives. The DWP said said many people on the old DLA benefit were not assessed for years, whereas PIP assesses people regularly to ensure they receive the right level of help.

"For some, Saturday will be spent preparing for street parties, wearing the union jack as a cape, and praying that the weather behaves itself. But for others it can be a reminder of a hatred of crowds, bunting and the pomp and ceremony that goes with a royal wedding. If you're in the latter camp, here are some different ways to spend the day. For those who want to be glued to the TV, but don't want to watch the royal wedding, the FA Cup offers a brilliant alternative. Sports lovers can revel in the grudge match between Chelsea and Man Utd. But with a 17:15 BST (10:15 ET) kick-off, it will be hard to avoid the royal wedding altogether as the nuptials commence at midday. The royal wedding has also caused havoc with the Duke of Cambridge's schedule. As president of the Football Association, Prince William usually hands out the FA Cup to the winning side. But he will miss this year's match at Wembley in favour of his brother's wedding. And for those who follow Scottish football, the Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Motherwell will kick-off at 15:00. Gough's cave in the Cheddar Gorge is a perfect place to get away from social media Wherever you go on royal wedding day, you may be unable to escape the nuptials because of news updates and photos posted to your mobile phone by friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. One option might be to go underground - literally. The lack of phone signal in the cave systems around Cheddar Gorge in Somerset provide the perfect location for those trying to avoid posts about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It's also a fun and educational day out for the whole family. If you're unable to get to Somerset, White Scar Cave in North Yorkshire offers a suitable alternative. If you're in the US, Mammoth Cave in Kentucky has more than 400 miles of passageways, and no phone signal. A non-Brit's guide to the royal wedding Royal wedding: All you need to know If you don't have a set of subterranean caves to peruse, maybe the cinema is the best way to go. You can sit in the darkened room for two hours, safe in the knowledge that the audience shouldn't be following events in Windsor. In the UK and US weekend releases include Deadpool 2, the drama On Chesil Beach and a family comedy about a canine police dog called Show Dogs. News of Meghan Markle's marriage to Prince Harry has piqued America's interest in the Royal Family. Coverage of the events in Windsor on the main TV networks has even surpassed the UK's offerings, making it increasingly difficult for Royal-sceptics in the USA to avoid the nuptials. Luckily basketball offers a welcome distraction for some, as the Boston Celtics take on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the east conference play-offs. The Celtics lead in the series 2-0, but the Cavs have reached the final the last three years, and have NBA All-Star LeBron James at their disposal. The game starts at 20:30 ET. One of the best ways to avoid coverage of the royal wedding is to hunker down under your duvet, and indulge in a bit of extra sleep. For US readers this will be a piece of cake as the wedding begins at 07:00 ET, but people in the UK using this method might want to invest in an eye mask as the ceremony will start at midday. Channel 4 sitcom The Windsors will be spoofing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding If your blood boiled at the thought of the royal wedding, you might be able to take some solace in the fact that it's being mocked on national television. Channel 4 comedy The Windsors, a parody soap opera of the royal family, will return for a one-off special to commemorate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's special day. It was already broadcast on Tuesday, but there will be a re-run of the sitcom at midnight on Saturday. This video can not be played Josh Warrington has no respect for 'cocky' IBF champion Lee Selby If matrimonial harmony is not your thing, watching two men slug it out in a boxing match might be a viable alternative. Lee Selby, otherwise known as The Barry Boy Assassin, will be defending his IBF world featherweight title against Josh Warrington. The fight is taking place on Saturday night at Elland Road in Leeds. If you want to be around others who don't want anything to do with the royal wedding, Republic, who campaign for the abolition of the monarchy, are hosting an international convention on the future of republican movements across Europe. The event in London will include MPs Tommy Sheppard and Emma Dent Coad, and speakers from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Allow Twitter content?

During coverage of royal occasions, there can sometimes be hours where nothing of any significance happens. Veteran broadcaster and BBC News presenter Simon McCoy is well versed in covering the royals and has won plaudits online for his blunt presenting patter.

Parents with an anathema for all things royal can take their children out to do chores A royal wedding might make some want to eat their teeth but it can come with its advantages. While many people crowd around TVs and revel in eating tepid finger food, others can take advantage of the lack of queues.

"In 2016-17, a total of 19% of students in higher education in the UK were from outside the country, according to official figures A Home Office advisory committee has ditched research assessing the impact of international students after academics labelled it ""unethical"". The survey, set up by the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which informs Home Office policy, asked for students' views on international classmates. But it could be completed by anyone and some said it posed ""loaded"" questions. A Mac spokesman stressed the survey was ""not designed to be discriminatory"", but confirmed it was being withdrawn. ""Following online commentary it has become apparent to us that we will be unable to use the responses to the survey,"" the spokesman said. The committee defended the survey, saying it was ""simply an attempt to ask students for their experiences"" and ""had the potential to show a very positive view of international students in the UK"". However, on Thursday, it concluded the survey ""cannot now be used to add to our evidence base"". Prof Tanja Bueltmannâ, a professor of migration history at Northumbria University, said the survey was ""completely invalid and must never be used as evidence to inform policy"". She said she had urged the Home Office and the committee to scrap it or disregard it. ""Initially, I thought it must be some sort of fake thing - because of the nature of the questions,"" she said. It asked students to assess whether the impact of international students on their course was negative, positive or neutral. It also asked if students lived with any international students or studied with any on their course. The survey was being posted by universities, who were encouraging students to fill it in and was due to close at the end of May. It was also being shared on Twitter, by vice-chancellors from the Universities UK group, which later announced that it would no longer be sharing it. Allow Twitter content?

A Universities UK spokesman said: ""Due to legitimate concerns raised about a Migration Advisory Committee survey on international students, we will not be sharing it further. ""While it's important that policy-makers hear from students about international students' positive impact, views must be sought appropriately."" UUK vice-chancellors will also be deleting all tweets of the survey. Prof Bueltmann said: ""In principle there's nothing wrong with a survey on the impact of international students, but say you look Asian and you're actually British, but the student standing next to you thinks you're Asian?"" This could mean the person is basing their views on the wrong information, she suggested. An online message replaced the survey after it had been closed Her view was mirrored by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which questioned whether the survey was ""encouraging baseless speculation about those who seem different?"". The National Union of Students called the survey ""inherently flawed"". The Union's international students' officer, Yinbo Yu, said asking students to gauge international student numbers ""seemingly based on appearance"" was ""not only shockingly insensitive, but it does not reflect the reality of our diverse yet cohesive university communities"". Prof Bueltmannâ also suggested that those who had a view that immigration was a bad thing would have been more likely to fill it in. ""It's a bit like with Tripadvisor, you're more likely to fill it in if you've had a bad experience,"" she said. ""The survey unquestionably contains loaded/leading questions that force respondents to problematise international students in a way that they may never have naturally done. ""If I had done this as a research project, I'd be in trouble with my ethics committee now."" She added that the whole design of the survey was flawed because anyone could fill it in, and repeatedly if they used different computers. Posting on Twitter, Matthias Eberl, engagement lead at Cardiff University's Systems Immunity Research Institute, said: ""A student survey that's openly accessible to anyone and can be filled in multiple times. Whatever the results from this survey, they are utterly meaningless."" A lawyer, Ewan Kennedyâ, also completed the survey, saying he found it ""very odd"". He said he ""went through it as an experiment and it shot off at the end without needing any identifier - oops!"" The survey was part of work commissioned by former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, after the government came under pressure to remove international students from net migration targets. In her commissioning letter of August 2017, she said the committee had never undertaken a full assessment of the impact of international students. ""We would like to have an objective assessment of the impact of international students which includes consideration of both EU and non-EU students at all levels of education,"" the letter said. ""This assessment should go beyond the direct impact of students in the form of tuition fees and spending, including consideration of their impact on the labour market and the provision and quality of education provided to domestic students. ""This should give the government an improved evidence base for any future decisions whilst the ONS goes through the process of reviewing the contribution it thinks students are making to net migration."" Before the survey was decommissioned, a spokesman for the Mac had said it was part of its ongoing work looking at the impact of international students in the UK.

"Which? said consumers had been let down by false speed claims for broadband services Which? says many UK households get half the broadband speed they pay for. Customers on a 38Mbps service received average speeds of 19Mbps, according to its findings, taken from 235,000 uses of its broadband speed checker tool. And those on super-fast packages of up to 200Mbps were on average only able to receive speeds of 52Mbps. From 23 May, broadband providers will no longer be able to advertise ""up to"" speeds unless that speed is received by 50% of their customers at peak times. ""This change in the rules is good news for customers who have been continuously let down by unrealistic adverts and broadband speeds that won't ever live up to expectations,"" said Alex Neill, Which?'s managing director of home services. ""We know that speed and reliability of service really matter to customers. ""And we will be keeping a close eye on providers to make sure they follow these new rules and finally deliver the service that people pay for."" Others felt that the changes, which were demanded following a study by the Advertising Standards Authority, did not go far enough. CityFibre is one of a handful of providers that want the ASA to ban providers from using the word ""fibre"" in adverts if the connections they offer partially rely on a copper connection from the street cabinet to the home. Founder and chief executive Greg Mesch said: ""Although we welcome the new rules on advertising speeds coming into force, the ASA hasn't gone far enough to stop consumers from being misled by broadband adverts. ""Fundamentally, the service you get is about more than speed, as capacity and reliability are now as just critical.

"The two leaders are due to meet in Singapore on 12 June North Korea is making its demands clear. This has very little to do with military drills and more to do with the Sunday talk shows in the US during which John Bolton, President Donald Trump's national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, outlined what might be on offer if Kim Jong-un gave up his nuclear weapons. The North Koreans have been watching and they do not like what they have heard. The whole reason the state has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival. So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya - as John Bolton did on Sunday - is not going to offer much comfort. The regime collapsed and its leader did not survive. The root of the problem is one of language and interpretation. For months, the world has heard that North Korea is willing to denuclearise and many analysts in South Korea raised their eyebrows. They warned that there was a gap between what the US and North Korea would mean by that. America wants North Korea to give up its weapons over a set period of time and only then will it be given economic rewards. They also want the process to be quick, perhaps over a couple of years. North Korea's definition of denuclearisation is very different. It has always talked in terms of the entire peninsula. That means the US has to act too - perhaps cutting the number of troops based in South Korea or also getting rid of the nuclear umbrella it uses to protect the region. If the state is going to give up its weapons it will also want security guarantees North Korea crisis in 300 words Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Go Myong-Hyun from the Asan Institute thinks Donald Trump has ""finally met his match"" when it comes to geopolitical negotiations. ""The US appears to have been coming up with additional and more stringent demands that North Korea didn't like.  What they're saying is if you keep giving demands that we don't like, we are willing to walk way."" There are, however, signs some sort of a deal can still be done. John Delury, professor of history at Yonsei University, is optimistic. He described this as a ""hiccup"" but believes the situation could be defused with the right message. This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man ""North Korea didn't say it wasn't going to give up its nukes. It said we are not going to denuclearise if you're going to hold a gun to our head. They're not going to give up this deterrent for nothing. They're saying this process is going to have to be reciprocal and you're going to have to do stuff just like we do stuff."" This announcement is a warning shot to the Trump administration. North Korea is obviously aware how much President Trump wants this summit, as Go Myong-Hyun points out. ""He's been spending a couple of weeks taking credit for the positive outcome. North Korea has realised President Trump's political capital is invested in this. Another way of putting it is he is trapped in this process. If President Trump doesn't stop making demands and not offering anything in return then he's going to lose his summit."" This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies The ""taking credit' part has also irritated Pyongyang. There were signs of it during the US secretary of state's latest visit to the North Korean capital. At one point, a senior official turned to Mike Pompeo after a warm toast and reminded him that this process had not come about due to the Trump administration's maximum pressure strategy or sanctions. The release of three Americans from prison was a major concession by North Korea North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength. It may also feel that it is making all the concessions. It has suspended all missile tests and released the three US detainees. Kim Jong-un met President Moon and the pair signed a declaration, and they are about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media. So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal it does not like has been a step too far. Many will say this move is straight out the Pyongyang playbook. That North Korea has a history of walking away from talks and deals. It does. It also has a lot more experience at this kind of diplomacy than the current US administration. The development will hand sceptics more ammunition to say that this time is not different, as so many had hoped. And that after all the smiles and handshakes and walks in the garden with President Moon, Kim Jong-un remains untrustworthy. That makes the next few steps even more difficult. South Korea and the US must decide how to respond. Do they cave in and offer a concession? Perhaps scale down the military exercises? Or do they tough this one out and hope Kim Jong-un wants this historic summit with the US president just as much as the other way around?

"European companies have invested heavily in Iran's energy sector The EU has begun reviving legislation that will allow European companies to continue doing business with Iran, despite US sanctions, officials say. The so-called ""blocking statute"" was introduced in 1996 to circumvent US sanctions on Cuba but was never used. An updated version of the measure should be in force before 6 August, when the first sanctions take effect. It will prohibit European companies from complying with the penalties and permit compensation for affected firms.

It was the first time the duchess has been seen in public since introducing Prince Louis, her third child, to the world on the steps of St Mary's Hospital in London little over three weeks ago. The rehearsal in Windsor drew hundreds of children, parents and pets who were keen to get into the party mood early.

But in the run up to the wedding, he became caught up in controversy after allegedly staging photographs with the paparazzi. The pictures showed Mr Markle - apparently unaware he was being photographed - carrying out preparations for the wedding, including being measured for a suit. On Monday, Mr Markle reportedly told US celebrity news website TMZ that he would not attend the ceremony to avoid embarrassing his daughter. TMZ later reported that Mr Markle wanted to be there - although it might not be possible because of health concerns. In a third report, the website said that health issues and planned surgery would prevent him from attending after all.

This video can not be played Charmaine: 'The Royals are an element of positivity' By Hanna Yusuf, BBC News, in Windsor As the sun came up, Windsor seemed deceptively quiet, with only police officers, their sniffer dogs and journalists on the streets. By 08:00 BST, crowds in union jack hats started gathering beside barriers and waited along the Long Walk for the rehearsal to begin. There was a huge police presence. Officers lined all the streets - with an officer every 10 metres. On Saturday, there will be even more - one officer for every five metres. Children, parents and pets were already in the party spirit, dressed in red, white and blue, and waving union jacks. As the carriages drew close, the public pulled out their smartphones to capture it all on camera. Afterwards, crowds headed to Windsor town centre, which was swarming with royal fans, tourists, reporters and a few royal impersonators. One Prince Charles impersonator was giving out pizza, saying it was Prince Harry's favourite, and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage was spotted having a pint in a pub. The party, it seems, has come to town, and the world is invited. Mr Markle, who lives in Mexico, used to work as a lighting director on programmes including the 1980s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Doria Ragland divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. Mr Markle, who has two children from his first marriage - Samantha and Thomas - filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: ""It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura.""

"Authorities will hold a post mortem examination to find out what led to the girl's death (file pic) A two-year-old girl was found with fatal injuries after a van carrying 30 Kurdish migrants was chased by police for an hour in southern Belgium. Police say the girl died soon afterwards and have revealed that there was a scuffle and shots were fired. The chase began on the E42 motorway outside the town of Namur. The van drove west for several kilometres, evading police. Eventually it collided with another vehicle near Mons and the girl was found. It took 15 police cars and some 30 police to bring the incident to an end at around 03:00 (01:00 GMT) on Thursday. Belgian media have reported that the girl, who was with her mother, had been held out of a van window apparently to keep the police at a distance. Local prosecutors told the BBC they could not confirm the reports. When the van finally stopped police said people emerged from the vehicle and moved towards them. After a struggle, officials said that police fired shots but stressed the girl was not hit by gunfire. At least 30 people were inside the van, including children, they said. Police in France say people smugglers were involved, but that was not confirmed by local officials. Hours after the incident in the early hours of Thursday, a group of some 60 migrants reacted by blocking a motorway near Dunkirk, south of the Belgian border in France. Migrants staying at the nearby Grande-Synthe camp had known the girl who had died as she was part of a family who had been staying in the gym, said French police. Allow Twitter content?

Twenty people were detained and the migrants then returned to Grande-Synthe, where some were searched by French CRS riot police. Belgian authorities said a post mortem examination would take place to find out what had caused her death. It was not clear whether the driver had got away but a number of the passengers would be interviewed, they said. A police patrol had tried to stop the van because it was being driven in a strange manner. A police check then indicated it was carrying false number plates, reports said. A minister in the French-speaking Wallonia-Brussels government, AndrÃ© Flahaut, sent his condolences to the girl's family. ""The politics of chasing migrants is bound to end in drama,"" he said on Twitter. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"This video can not be played Acid attack: Mark van Dongen ex-partner cleared of murder A woman has been cleared of murdering her former partner in an acid attack which led him to end his life. Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015. Fifteen months later he ended his life by euthanasia in a Belgian hospital. He was paralysed from the neck down and had lost a leg, ear and eye. At Bristol Crown Court, Wallace was found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent. 'I realised his skin was melting' The fashion student, originally from South Africa, was cleared by the jury of both murder and manslaughter. During the three-week trial Wallace told the jury Mr van Dongen, 29, had put the acid in a glass for her to drink. The pair had met five years earlier on a dating website for people with HIV, as both had the condition. This video can not be played Audio clips of Berlinah Wallace's police interview Mr van Dongen had returned to her flat in Ladysmith Road, Westbury Park, on the night of 22 September 2015 to reiterate that their turbulent relationship was over but decided to stay the night. The trial heard Wallace threw a glass of acid over him as he lay in his boxer shorts on their bed, and shouted: ""If I can't have you no-one will."" Screaming in agony, he staggered out on to the street where he was found by alarmed neighbours who dialled 999. The bed where Mark van Dongen was lying when Wallace threw the acid at him Harrowing recordings of his suffering as they attempted to help him were played to the court during the trial. Meanwhile, instead of calling an ambulance, Wallace sat on the sofa in her flat and called another ex-boyfriend. She will be sentenced on Wednesday. This video can not be played Mark van Dongen's family talk about the impact of an acid attack Speaking through an interpreter outside court, Mark's father Cornelius van Dongen described his son as his ""best friend"" and ""a loving brother"" who had made the family proud with the good results he achieved as a civil engineer. ""Mark was so brave when confronted with the hellish pain and disabilities inflicted on him but eventually it all became too much for him to bear,"" he said. ""He died in dignity and will live on in the hearts of his family and friends."" He said the court process had been ""a difficult and emotional experience"". Mr van Dongen added: ""I am very disappointed in the outcome of this trial. There are only losers in this case. I hope that Mark can now rest in peace."" Speaking outside Bristol Crown Court, Cornelius van Dongen said there were ""only losers in this case"" Det Insp Paul Catton, who led the investigation for Avon and Somerset Police, said the attack was borne out of jealousy, resulting in Mr van Dongen suffering ""the most inconceivable pain imaginable"". ""He went from being a healthy young man with his whole life ahead of him to having extensive and repeated surgery on the most hideous injuries just to keep him alive. ""In the end, his pain was so devastating, so catastrophic, he sought the assistance of doctors to help him die."" The force has announced a Domestic Homicide Review will take place to examine the circumstances which led up to Mr van Dongen's death. Wallace said she thought the substance she threw was water Prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam acknowledged this was not a typical murder case but said it needed to be tried because Mr van Dongen's suffering had led him to end his own life. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, where his family live. Mr Vaitilingam said: ""It was exactly why she did it, to scar him for life, to make him less of a man and unable to have a relationship with another woman. ""It's the first time a jury has had to decide if an attacker is guilty of the murder where the victim has chosen to end his own life by euthanasia because of the terrible condition he was left in by the attack. ""Murder is made out if the attacker intended to kill them or cause them really serious harm. ""The doctors in Belgium granted euthanasia because of his unbearable physical and psychological suffering."" What was the basis of bringing a murder charge in this extraordinary case? The answer lies in the way the law of murder applies the concept of causation. If an accused person attacks a victim, intending to kill or cause serious harm, their actions alone may not result in death. However, they can be convicted of murder if their acts can fairly be said to have made a ""significant"" contribution to the victim's death. For example if someone stabs a person in a shop and they run across the road to escape, but are hit and killed by an oncoming car, the attacker can be found guilty of murder. The intentional stabbing is a ""significant"" cause of death even though it is the car driver that ends the victim's life. If the jury had found Berlinah Wallace had thrown the acid intending to kill or seriously harm Mark Van Dongen, and that her act was a significant cause of his death, it would have been open to them to find her guilty of murder. Clearly they did not find this to be the case. 'I realised his skin was melting' Acid victim's agony heard in 999 call.

"Delaying a summer-born child's entry to primary school has little impact on attainment, research suggests. Children born in England between April and August, whose start in Reception was put back a year, did only marginally better in Year 1 tests, according to a government study. The number of applications to councils for delayed entry has risen sharply. Head teachers' unions want clearer guidance on whether delayed school entry for summer-born children works. Department for Education researchers looked at results achieved in the Phonics Screening Check, taken by pupils at the end of Year 1. Pupils whose school start was delayed a year in 2014 and 2015 scored on average 0.7 marks higher than other summer-born children. The researchers say the difference is not statistically significant. Pupils who were not summer-born outperformed both the delayed and normal admission summer-born pupils. Times table check trialled ahead of roll-out Summer-born pupils' late start wins MPs' backing The analysis also found parents with higher incomes were significantly more likely to request a delayed school start for their child. It also found the majority of applications, 74%, were from white British families. Children in England usually start school in the September after they turn four but parents of children born between 1 April and 31 August can request to delay entry for a year. Typically, this would mean a child starting school in Year 1, forfeiting Reception year. If a parent wishes to delay their child's admission to school until compulsory school age, at five, and be admitted into Reception, a request needs to be made to their local authority, for their child to be admitted out of their normal age group. Councils are required to make a decision in the child's best interests, taking account of parents' views and information about the child's development. Pauline Hull, of the Summer Born Campaign which has called for more flexible admissions, welcomed the report but said ""the most important comparison is how much better these children are faring having started school at age five, rather than age four, and the DfE research does not address this. ""The focus on phonics testing doesn't consider social and emotional benefits of delayed entry which is of significant importance to parents."" Anne Frank's 'dirty jokes' uncovered Row over World Cup 'flirting manual' How long are you going to live? The Department for Education surveyed 152 local authorities in England about their admissions policy. Of the 92 who responded, 1,750 requests were made to delay school entry in 2016-17, up 84% on the previous year. Overall, 75% of requests were granted. Ten of the local authorities said they had a policy of automatically agreeing all requests made to delay entry while 23 said they only agreed requests where parents presented strong evidence. The majority said they still expected parents to make a case as to why their child should start Reception late. Some councils said they were concerned that parents would delay entry for their child because it might benefit them in other ways, rather than because there was a genuine need. ""When a parent does not get a place at their preferred school they will delay their child's entry simply to get another chance to get a place at a particular school,"" said one. In a separate survey of parents from Liverpool, Hertfordshire, Devon, and Lewisham, who had all delayed their child's entry into Reception, 79% had a household income of Â£25,000 or more. Almost half earned more than Â£50,000 annually. 97% feared their child was not ready for school 38% cited a medical condition or developmental delay 13% said a lack of places in their preferred school was a factor Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It's about taking a sensible and human approach based on the individual needs of the child in question. ""The flexibility required in order to accommodate the needs of some children born between April and August each year can cause some organisational and financial issues for schools but they are not insurmountable and more guidance from the government has certainly helped."" Julie McCulloch, Director of Policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, called for ""a consistent approach across the country"" and urged the DfE to ""review this matter to develop a policy based on emerging evidence over the impact of delayed entry to school and what works best for children"". A DfE spokeswoman said ""the phonics check measures a specific skill and doesn't tell us anything about a child's development more widely"". ""We know the Reception year is an important part of school life and we want to make sure no child misses that year of their education because they have summer birthdays.""
