"Some fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England will be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. Instead those eligible - including NHS and care staff - will be able to take daily tests, the government said. A list of critical workers is due to be published, but the PM said it included food, utility and border staff. It follows mounting criticism of the impact of self-isolation on industry. Those eligible will be specifically named on a letter from a government department. ""This is not a blanket exemption for any sector or role,"" a government spokesman said. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms and was announced as most remaining curbs in England ended on Monday, including face mask laws. Meanwhile, a further 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing How many people can I meet now? Check your area's vaccine stats Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that test, trace and isolate was still an ""essential"" part of the government's Covid response. He said close contacts of positive cases were five times more likely to contract Covid and that a ""continuing sacrifice"" would be required. Speaking while isolating at his country residence, Mr Johnson said workers involved in the supply of food, water and electricity, as well as staff on the border and on the railways, would be among those exempt from self-isolation. But he said this would be for work purposes only and involve a ""very, very small number of named critical workers"" with employers contacted by letter. He added that the government did not want to ""extend it too widely because this is one of the few shots we've got left in our locker to stop the chain reaction of the spread of Covid"". Although it was unclear exactly which jobs would be eligible, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier confirmed the change would apply to health and social care workers in England. In Scotland, NHS staff will shortly receive similar guidance on self-isolation, deputy chief medical officer Dr Dave Caesar said. It came as Mr Zahawiconfirmed a limited group of children, many with underlying conditions, would be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as possible in England. He also confirmed that proof of full vaccinationwould be required in ""large crowded settings""such as nightclubs from the end of September in England - after all over-18s have had the chance to receive both vaccine doses. What's happening with the self-isolation rules? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Should I be working at home or going in? Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. An upcoming change from 16 August will mean people who are fully vaccinated will be able to skip isolation by taking a daily Covid test. Under-18s will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are contact traced. Similar rules are due to come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mr Johnson, along with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is self-isolating after being in close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid,who tested positive over the weekendafter feeling unwell on Friday evening. The PM appeared at Monday's news conference via video call from Buckinghamshire, alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam and the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in Downing Street. Amid a surge in infections linked to the Delta virus variant, a BBC analysis previously showed more than 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween 7 July and 16 August. Figures last week showed more than 530,000 contact tracing alerts were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales between 1 July and 7 July. People can also be told to self-isolate through a separate process run by NHS Test and Trace backed by laws. Pub chains, supermarkets and other businesses havewarned of the crippling effectblanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. Theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber said on Monday that self-isolation ruleshad forced the cancellation of performancesof his new West End show Cinderella. Each UK nation is in charge of its own coronavirus regulations. Englandended most of its remaining restrictionson Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbsas it moved to level zero. Some restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday,bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate appis being prepared for launchnext week amid a ""final push"" to get younger people vaccinated. The number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a ""weekend effect"". The number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period. The number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded.

"The Duke of Sussex will share ""mistakes and lessons learned"" during his life in a memoir to be published next year. Announcing the deal with publishers Penguin Random House, Prince Harry said he would reflect ""the highs and lows"" and be ""accurate and wholly truthful"". Harry, who alongside his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last year, will donate proceeds to charity. The BBC has been told the duke has recently spoken privately with his family about writing the book. A spokesperson for the duke added that he would not be expected to obtain permission for the project from Buckingham Palace. They did not provide additional details on what share of the proceeds would be donated to charity. And Penguin did not disclose the terms of its deal, which includes an audio book and international rights. Harry: Heavy drinking masked pain of mumâs death Duchess of Sussex to publish children's book Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my family The duke, 36, said in a statement: ""I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become."" He added: ""I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story - the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned - I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. ""I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a first hand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful."" Markus Dohle, of Penguin Random House, described the duke as being among ""world-renowned leaders, icons, and change-makers we have been privileged to publish over the years"". A press release described the book as ""intimate and heartfelt"" and ""honest and moving"". It added: ""Prince Harry will offer an honest and captivating personal portrait, one that shows readers that behind everything they think they know lies an inspiring, courageous, and uplifting human story."" The Sussexes have established an organisation called Archewell, which has production arms alongside a non-profit foundation. In May, it was announced that theDuchess of Sussex would publish a children's book, the Bench, about father-son relationships, as seen through the eyes of mothers with the same publisher. It was said to be inspired by the bond between Harry and their son. Harry and Meghan, 39, now live in the US with their two-year-old son Archie, and theirdaughter Lilibet, who was born in California on 4 June. The couple's son, Archie, was born in the UK before they settled in the US Earlier this month, the duke joined his older brother, the Duke of Cambridge,at Kensington Palace to unveil a statue of Diana, Princess of Waleson what would have been their mother's 60th birthday. Harry has previously spoken of whathe has described as his family's unwillingnessto talk about his mother's death and of his use of drink and drugs to cope with the pain of losing her. He has also said he wanted to""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering""of his upbringing with his own children.

"Video conferencing firm Zoom has struck a multibillion dollar deal to buy a cloud-based call centre operator in a bet on the future of hybrid working. The firm announced the $14.7bn (Â£10.7bn) acquisition of Five9in a blog post,externalon Sunday. Zoom boss Eric Yuan said the deal would allow its customers to ""reimagine the way they do business"". It marks the firm's biggest takeover, and comes even though staff are beginning to return to the office. Investors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as social distancing restrictions lift and more people are vaccinated. The pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight. Zoom has said it does not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong. The company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (Â£2.66bn). In the last three months of 2020, sales were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m,it said in March. This video can not be played From pet and child interruptions to catching fire, here's a look at the times online meetings went wrong The firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, said the acquisition of Five9 marked a shift in strategy. It is now prioritising its cloud-calling product Zoom Phone and conference-hosting product Zoom Rooms. ""This acquisition is... positioning us to accelerate Zoom's growth and play an even stronger role in driving the digital future, bringing companies and their customers closer together,"" its founder Eric Yuan said. Five9's call centre software is used by more than 2,000 clients such as Under Armour, Lululemon and Olympus, and the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 having been approved by the boards of both companies. ""This is a high-priced deal which appears to attempt to build out the Zoom Phone offering,"" said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. But he added: ""Paying such a high price for a non-differentiated offering smacks of attempts to move into adjacent markets as Zoom fatigue sets in."" A question mark has been raised over the future of hybrid working, although other tech firms such as Google and Microsoft have invested in their video-conferencing offer during the pandemic. But others such asglobal workspace provider IWG have saidthat they expect working from home some of the time will become the norm - especially as firms will be looking to save money and be more environmentally-friendly by using less office space.

"Ben & Jerry's has said it will stop selling its ice cream in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The US company said sales ""in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT)"" were ""inconsistent with our values"". Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the move was ""morally wrong"" and would prove to be ""financially wrong"". The West Bank and East Jerusalem have been under Israeli control since the 1967 Middle East war. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements there. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Patel takes on Ben and Jerry's over migrant boats The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained US moves to rebuild relations with Palestinians In a statement shared to its Twitter and Instagram pages on Monday, Ben & Jerry's said its decision reflected the concerns of ""fans and trusted partners"". The changes would be made by allowing current licensing arrangements to expire at the end of next year, it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We have a longstanding partnership with our licensee, who manufactures Ben & Jerry's ice cream in Israel and distributes it in the region,"" the statement said. ""We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year."" Ben & Jerry's also runs two ""scoop shops"" in Israel and said it would distribute its goods in Israel through a different agreement, the details of which would be announced ""when we're ready"". UK firm Unilever, which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000, says the decision was taken and announced by Ben & Jerry's and its independent board, but it remained ""fully committed"" to maintaining a presence in Israel. Ben & Jerry's Israeli licensee was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper as saying: ""Global Ben & Jerry's decided not to renew the agreement with us in another year and a half in light of our refusal [to comply] with their demand and stop selling throughout Israel."" ""We call on the Israeli government and consumers not to permit a boycott of Israel... Ice cream is not part of politics."" Israeli politicians reacted furiously to the announcement. ""The boycott of Israel - a democracy surrounded by islands of terror - reflects a complete loss of bearings. The boycott does not work and will not work, and we will fight it with all our might,"" Mr Bennett said. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set up the company in 1978 Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called Ben & Jerry's move a ""disgraceful capitulation"" to anti-Semitism and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians. ""Over 30 states in the United States have passed anti-BDS legislation in recent years. I plan on asking each of them to enforce these laws against Ben & Jerry's,"" he said. A spokesman for BDS, Mahmoud Nawajaa, it welcomed Ben & Jerry's decision and called on the company ""to end all its procedures with the apartheid Israel"". Ben & Jerry's  - which was founded in 1978 by best friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield - has a track record of campaigning on social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.

"Olivia Breen is set to compete at the Paralympics in Tokyo next month Double world champion para-athlete Olivia Breen said she was left angry and speechless after being told to wear ""more appropriate"" shorts. Breen, 24, says an official at the English Championships on Sunday told her the briefs were ""too short and revealing"". The sprinter and long jumper said she was highlighting the incident to stop it happening to others. ""It made me feel really angry and it's very wrong,"" said Breen. ""You know they can't comment on what we can and can't wear."" Breen won a world championship gold medal in the T35-38 4x100m class in 2015 and again in 2017 in the T38 long jump and has been wearing the same style of competition briefs from her sponsor throughout her career. ""They are like high-waisted bikini bottoms,"" she toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme. ""I've worn them for nine years, I've never had a problem and we should feel comfortable with what we wear. ""We want to be as light as possible when we're competing, not having to feel heavy, and to feel comfortable. ""We should just wear what we're entitled to wear."" Allow Instagram content?

Breen, who also won a bronze medal at the London 2012 Paralympics, told the programme the incident occurred after she competed in the long jump in Bedford. ""I'd just finished my competition and was thanking the officials for their help and their support and this official came up to me and said 'can I talk to you?' and I was like yeah, what's the problem? ""She said 'I think what you're wearing is very revealing and I think you should consider buying shorts'. I didn't know what to say I was left speechless and my first thought process was 'are you joking?'."" Full-body suits make young gymnasts feel safe Norway fined for 'improper clothing' Breen believes male athletes would not face similar scrutiny or criticism but, after posting about the incident on social media, said other females have told her they have suffered similar experiences. ""I've never personally felt self-conscious, but yesterday made me feel very angry and obviously from the response on Instagram and Twitter that I've had, it has happened to a lot of young girls and athletes and it needs to change,"" she added. ""I think people haven't spoken out about it because they feel afraid and I want people to feel confident and speak out about it because it's wrong what happened and this needs to stop happening to us. ""I'm just going to take it as far as I can. I really want to get the message out there and I obviously want to make a change in female sport so people can't make comments again about what we can and can't wear."" Another British athlete, shot putter Amelia Stricker, said officials who made such ""unnecessary"" comments should not officiate, a point of view Breen shares. ""Yes I do very strongly [agree],"" she said. ""They do an amazing job and I really appreciate their support but they can't make comments on what we wear. They are there to do their job and help us, not by commenting on what we wear, regardless."" An England Athletics spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the post and will be investigating as a matter of urgency. The wellbeing of all participants in athletics is of the utmost importance and everyone should feel comfortable to compete and participate in the sport."" BBC Wales Sport has learned Breen has since spoken to England Athletics and they will be investigating the incident.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson ""put his own interests ahead of people's lives"" Boris Johnson was reluctant to tighten Covid restrictions as cases rose last autumn because he thought people dying from it were ""essentially all over 80"", Dominic Cummings has claimed. He also said the prime minister had messaged him to say: ""I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff."" Mr Johnson had wanted to let Covid ""wash through the country"" rather than destroy the economy, Mr Cummings said. The claims came in an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It is the first time Mr Cummings - Mr Johnson's former chief adviser - has given a one-on-one TV interview during his career in politics. In response, Downing Street said the prime minister had taken the ""necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice"" throughout the pandemic. And the government had prevented the NHS ""from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns"", a spokesperson added. Kuenssberg on Cummings interview: His words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings Dominic Cummings: Who is the PM's former adviser? In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Cummings also said that, near the start of the pandemic last year, Mr Johnson had wanted to keep his weekly face-to-face meetings with the Queen going - but he had to warn his boss that she might die if she caught coronavirus. And he defended his controversial decision to drive to his parents' farm in County Durham after the first lockdown started, but admitted he had not ""come clean"" about all the reasons behind it, including ""security concerns"" around his family home in London. This is the first major interview Mr Cummings has given, buthe has answered MPs' questions on the government's response to Covid. The claims made at that session were explosive, but he's since been criticised for failing to provide the evidence to back up some of those assertions. Dominic Cummings: The Interview will be broadcast in the UK on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and it will beavailable on BBC iPlayerand BBC Sounds Covid cases dipped last summer but began to rise rapidly again as autumn started, prompting a debate within government about what measures were needed. Mr Cummings told the BBC that he, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty had pushed for tougher restrictions from mid-September - Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty declined to comment. Mr Cummings went on to allege Mr Johnson had said: ""No, no no, no, no, I'm not doing it."" The prime minister had ""parts of the media and Tory party screaming"" not to increase restrictions and ""always referred"" to the Daily Telegraph, for which he had previously written a column, as ""my real boss"", Mr Cummings said. Dominic Cummings quit as the PM's chief adviser last autumn following a Downing Street power struggle On 13 October, with Covid deaths having risen to more than 100 a day, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmercalled for a ""circuit-breaker"" lockdownof two to three weeks, but the government decided against this. In a WhatsApp message sent on 15 October, shared with the BBC, Mr Johnson appears to have described himself as ""slightly rocked by some of the data on Covid fatalities"". The ""median age"" for those dying was between 81 and 82 for men and 85 for women, the prime minister allegedly wrote, adding: ""That is above life expectancy. So get Covid and Live longer. ""Hardly anyone under 60 goes into hospital... and of those virtually all survive. And I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff. Folks I think we may need to recalibrate... There are max 3m in this country aged over 80."" He reportedly went on to write: ""It shows we don't go for nationwide lockdown."" But on 31 October the prime ministerannounced a four-week lockdownfor England to begin on 5 November, saying this was needed to protect the NHS as figures suggested deaths could reach ""several thousand a day"" without ""tough action"". Speaking on Tuesday, Business Minister Paul Scully defended the PM's actions during the autumn, adding that economic restrictions also had an impact on people's health and lives and ""you have to take all of those factors into account"". He said the 17-day so-calledfirebreak lockdownin Wales, introduced around two weeks before England's autumn lockdown, ""didn't have a particularly big effect at the time"". ""These decisions are not quite as black and white as necessarily we can make them now,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. Looking back to the start of the pandemic, Mr Cummings told the BBC he had intervened to stop Mr Johnson continuing to see the Queen, then aged 93, for weekly face-to-face meetings. Mr Cummings claimed that, on 18 March last year, the PM had said: ""I'm going to see the Queen... That's what I do every Wednesday. Sod this. I'm going to go and see her."" Boris Johnson's face-to-face meetings with the Queen did not restart until June this year He added that he had told Mr Johnson: ""There's people in this office who are isolating. You might have coronavirus. I might have coronavirus. ""You can't go and see the Queen. What if you go and see her and give the Queen coronavirus? You obviously can't go."" He continued: ""I just said, 'If you give her coronavirus and she dies, what are you going to [do]? You can't do that. You can't risk that. That's completely insane.' ""And [the PM] said - he basically just hadn't thought it through - 'Yeah...I can't go'."" Downing Street denied that this incident took place and Buckingham Palace declined to comment. On 27 March last year, four days after the first lockdown began, Mr Cummings drove his wife and son from London to his parents' farm in County Durham. While staying there, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. When these details were revealed they provoked huge anger - and accusations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In his BBC interview, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" Dominic Cummings faced the press in the Downing Street garden last May He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". ""What I should have done is either just resigned and said nothing about anything,"" he said, ""or I should have spoken to my family and said, 'Listen, we're just gonna have to come clean about the whole thing.'"" Mr Cummings was repeatedly challenged throughout the interview to back up his version of events. He says many of his claims will be corroborated if there is a public inquiry. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said NHS workers, patients, and the relatives of Covid victims would find Mr Cummings's interview ""shocking and difficult to hear"". ""The revelations are further evidence that the prime minister has made the wrong calls time and again at the expense of public health,"" he added. ""Boris Johnson is reckless, unfit to govern and a public inquiry cannot be delayed"". A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Since the start of the pandemic, the prime minister has taken the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice. ""The government he leads has delivered the fastest vaccination rollout in Europe, saved millions of jobs through the furlough scheme and prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns. ""The government is entirely focused on emerging cautiously from the pandemic and building back better."" Sir Iain Duncan Smith - who briefly employed Mr Cummings as an adviser when he was Conservative leader, said the prime minister should be judged on the decisions he made, rather than the processes that led up to them. Of Mr Cummings, he said: ""He obviously is a very bitter man, I know I employed him, I sacked him. I know exactly how he works, this will go on for some time.""

"Everyone knows Dominic Cummings's name, and usually not for flattering reasons. Having covered politics for nearly 20 years, it is at the heart of my job to get to know senior figures in all the political parties, and advisers in government and in opposition. But I have never known a backroom figure who has caused such rage, or who has enjoyed stirring up his opponents quite as much. It's no secret that he has fallen out with Boris Johnson in spectacular style. It's hard to think of a bust-up and betrayal that's been as vicious and sustained. PM blocked lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings Mr Cummings has written thousands of words about what he sees as Mr Johnson's flaws already. He gave seven hours of brutally unrelenting evidence to MPs about the many things that he believes went wrong during the government's handling of the pandemic. The former aide is an important witness to recent history but has his own agenda, and has been accused of trying to rewrite that history to give himself a more flattering role. Mr Cummings has never before though agreed to sit down and account for his own role in the pandemic, and also be questioned about his own efforts helping Mr Johnson in office, securing a Brexit deal and a huge election victory, or his time as boss of the Vote Leave campaign. Dominic Cummings spent seven hours setting out his grievances during a recent session with MPs Indeed, the first time that he promised he would do an interview, one day, was after the referendum in 2016, when we asked if he would answer questions about how he ran that campaign, how it behaved, and how it won. In the five years that followed so much has happened that has changed the UK. Cummings's detractors would say he is responsible for much of the political trauma. He became a household name because of the public outrage at his journey out of lockdown. No-one was closer to the prime minister in government for more than a year. Aside from Mr Johnson himself, perhaps no one else's decisions and judgements counted as much over a crucial period. Arguably, no one other political campaigner's view of the world made such a difference to the country in recent times. And certainly, no one other political adviser has inspired such venom, attracted such conspiracy theories, and launched thousands of memes. There are many people in the Conservative Party who believe his credibility is shot because of how he has explicitly tried to attack Mr Johnson in recent months. MPs have already expressed frustration that, in their view, he hasn't provided overwhelming evidence of the explosive claims he's already made. Given his own reputation for provocation and playing with reality as a campaigner, it's not unreasonable to wonder if he can be believed now. Dominic Cummings is not known as a formal dresser His arguments at times can seem contradictory, even though it feels like he has clear scripts in his head that he wants to follow. Mr Cummings styles himself as someone who only wants to do what he thinks is the right thing, whatever it takes, and doesn't care very much what anyone else thinks. Despite his normal sartorial choices - crumpled shirts, beanie hats and tracksuit bottoms while in No 10 - he cared enough when we sat down this month to wear a new shirt for our interview, fresh with creases from the packet. He arrived wearing a baseball cap along with his face mask, to avoid being spotted, and pages of scrawled notes in preparation. And rather than slink off into infamy, five years after he first said he would talk, we sat down and spoke for hours with the cameras rolling. The interview might make you want to throw rocks at the TV. He might provoke you, in the way that winding his opponents up became his political trademark. His picture of what went on in Downing Street might alarm you too. But his claims are very much his version of events. They might help you understand more, for better or worse, what has really gone in in the last few years and what his extraordinary fallout with Mr Johnson was really about. Whatever you think of Dominic Cummings, when big things happened, he was in the room.

"This video can not be played By the end of September, full vaccination will be required in order to enter nightclubs, says the PM People attending nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September, the government says. Latest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have not had their first jab. Currently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask clubbers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity. But Boris Johnson said he was concerned by the continuing risk of transmission. The announcement came on the day nightclubs in England were allowed to reopen after 16 months of closure. The prime minister told a press conference on Monday: ""I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing. ""As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission. ""And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s have had their chance to be double jabbed we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather."" Nightclubs reopen but what next for the industry? Covid passport plan for nightclubs 'concerning' Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said nightclubs and other such venues could be ""potential super spreading events"" because of crowds in close contact. ""I would expect that with opening of nightclubs, we'll continue to see an increase in cases, and we will see outbreaks related to specific nightclubs as well,"" he said. How have you been affected by issues covered in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Nightclubs are still closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Welsh government said it would never mandate the use of vaccination certificates but that businesses would be free to ask for them. Across the UK, 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It's easy to understand how a loud and busy nightclub could be the perfect stomping ground for Covid. Having lots of people packed closely together, snogging, singing and shouting in a confined space with relatively poor ventilation creates ideal conditions for a virus carried in our spit to spread. Add in the fact that many of those attending may not have had two or even one dose of a vaccine that helps protect against catching and transmitting the virus, and you could have a super-spreading event on your hands. The Netherlands recently tried reopening its clubs and quickly decided to close them again amid rising infection rates. Its governmentsaid most of the new infections occurred in nightlife settings and parties with large numbers of people,external. For now, it is asking its citizens to use their common sense and act responsibly; keeping gatherings small and manageable. Time will tell if the UK might go the same way. Many nightclubs have shut down during the pandemic and the industry reacted angrily to the prime minister's announcement. ""So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then,"" said Michael Kill, boss of the Night Time Industries Association. ""Leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months having to make more changes to the way they operate - this is still a bad idea. ""80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to implement Covid passports, worrying about difficulties with enforcing the system and a reduction in spontaneous consumers, as well as being put at a competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that aren't subject to the same restrictions and yet provide similar environments."" Boss of UK Hospitality Kate Nicholls called the announcement ""a hammer blow"" for a struggling industry trying to rebuild. One major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, and Fiction, said clubs had become a political football. Boss Peter Marks said: ""Mandatory Covid passports may make sense one day once the entire adult population has been offered vaccines, but does government really think this threat will entice the 'vaccine wary' to take the vaccine? They will just stay later in the pubs and hold their parties in their houses."" Mark Harper MP, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative backbenchers, also criticised the plans, saying the government was ""effectively moving to compulsory vaccination."" Speaking in the House of Commons, he called on the government to bring forward the evidence for the policy in September ahead of any vote, saying he didn't think the evidence from pilot schemes supported the idea. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi MP promised to share the evidence with the Commons, ""working with the nightclub industry or at-risk large scale events that are indoors"".

"This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy a return to the dancefloor Plans to make Covid vaccine passports mandatory at nightclubs are ""deeply concerning,"" Greater Manchester's night-time economy advisor has said. Full vaccination will be acondition of entry to clubsand other venues with large crowds from September. Sacha Lord, who runs the Warehouse Project club nights, said the government ""appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation"". The government said it had launched a hospitality strategy to help. The announcement came on the day nightclubs were allowed to reopen after almost 18 months of closure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a press conference earlier: ""I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing. ""As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission."" Mr Lord said the industry had been taken by surprise by the latest announcement. ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to,"" he said. ""With this one move, the Government appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" What Covid rules have changed? PM urges caution as restrictions eased Cheers and celebrations as clubbers return He added: ""How will nightclubs now compete against pubs and bars down the road where these restrictions aren't needed, or attract punters who can just as easily have a house party without these enforcements in place. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place."" Sacha Lord runs the Warehouse Project club nights and Parklife festival Earlier, he told BBC Breakfast hospitality businesses remain ""on a cliff edge"" He said over the last 18 months businesses had seen how the government ""has really not understood"" their needs and how they operate. He added: ""The ten o'clock curfew is a perfect example, pushing hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets at exactly the same time. That did far worse than good. ""We saw ridiculous substantial meal rules - the Scotch egg rule. ""I took them to the High Court to compel them to drop that, which saved many businesses and jobs across the whole of the UK. ""So time and time again, we have seen so many mistakes."" A government spokesperson said: ""We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality industry - including the night-time economy. ""[This] is why, on top of our unprecedented Â£352bn package of business support, just last week we launched our hospitality strategy to help the sector recover as well as boost resilience long-term.""

"Lord Lloyd-Webber with the cast and crew of the Cinderella production Andrew Lloyd Webber has said the theatre industry is ""on its knees"" due to self-isolation Covd-19 rules. He was speaking after the opening two nights of his new show Cinderella were cancelled because some cast and crew members were told to self-isolate. He said the current system was ""completely, completely untenable"" and pleaded with the government to listen. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said he was ""deeply disappointed"" to hear about Cinderella's closure. ""Whilst the need to self isolate is an economy wide issue, I recognise the particular challenges it presents to the arts and I'm strongly making the case for that in government,"" Mr Dowden added.

Monday and Tuesday's Cinderella performances at the Gillian Lynne theatre in London were halted after a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 at the weekend, resulting in close contacts having to self-isolate. That positive test had already led to two preview performances being scrapped on Saturday. Another West End musical, The Prince of Egypt, also announced it had to cancel shows on Monday and Tuesday after a single positive Covid-19 case within the company. It will put on socially-distanced performances on Wednesday and Thursday before retuning to full capacity on Friday. Anda theatre in Hull has had to cancel its first full-capacity performances since last yearafter cast members tested positive for Covid-19. Hull New Theatre had been due to stage a short run of smash-hit West End show Six the Musical this week. The shows have now been rescheduled to next April. Lord Lloyd-Webber said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson ""doesn't seem to grasp what we're about in theatre"". Lord Lloyd-Webber's Gillian Lynne Theatre in London is playing host to the show He said that close contacts of the positive case had been given additional PCR tests, as had anyone due to perform on Monday night. All those tests came back negative. It's not clear when the show will now open. A spokesman for the production told the BBC: ""It's hard to see a route forward under the current rules, but we will do everything we can to come back."" Lord Lloyd-Webber said he is determined to open Cinderella in London and has so far ignored ""siren voices"" suggesting he moves it to Broadway. ""I'm not going to do that, I can't do that,"" he said. ""I'm a Brit and we've got a fantastic cast and so we will open here, but who knows? 2084? I don't know."" Lord Lloyd Webber added: ""We cannot function with this current system. We can't isolate every time somebody may or may not have it. It just simply doesn't work. ""Please, please will this government for once listen to us. Listen. We do know what we're doing, we do. Just listen and knock all these platitudes and endless, endless blunt instruments that don't apply across the board."" Lord Lloyd-Webber added Mr Dowden ""does his best"" but ""I don't think he's really able to be that effective"". ""This is the last chance for this government to show they have the remotest interest in theatre,"" he said. ""I do worry at the end of the day that the government doesn't regard theatre as anything other than nice to have. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He added: ""It's so vital this government understands the economics of what they're doing, let alone the idiocy. But not everyone was sympathetic to Lord Lloyd-Webber's situation, including theatre critic Mark Shenton. ""No one MADE him try to open a new musical in a pandemic.

""Our sound is recognised around the world and I just don't think our leaders give it the respect it deserves. ""We were first to close and last to open, our leaders are so out of touch."" There's a concern that the past 18 months will have an impact on new talent coming through ""A lot of people's mental health has been affected massively,"" is the worry for Radio 1 DJ Arielle Free. ""It's not all about getting mashed up with your mates, it's pure escapism."" Club owners and promoters say lockdown has pushed them and their finances to the edge. Take the Welly club in Hull for example, it went out of business after more than a hundred years in July 2020. ""My bank manager thinks it's madness to buy this place"" says Aaron Mellor owner of Tokyo Industries which owns a chain of venues across the North of England. ""We're humans and we need this kind of social interaction."" He doesn't think the government values his type of venue. Hacienda nightclub in 1990 ""They're stuck in a world of the 1990s. We're generating new music, creative talent and music is one of our last great exports."" ""We're also a viable commercial business, one pound in every three that goes over the bar goes to the government and we employ a lot of young people."" The government says it's spent billions supporting the cultural industry. ""Nightclubs still have access to our unprecedented Â£352bn package of support, including the furlough scheme, loan guarantees, protection from eviction, Restart Grants worth up to Â£18,000 and business rates relief,"" a Government spokesperson said. ""Thanks to the success of our vaccination programme, all remaining businesses will be able to reopen, such as nightclubs, at Step 4."" After all the gloom there is hope according to DJ and promoter Yousef who put on the government test events in Liverpool. ""The appetite from the raver is unprecedented. They want to get out and party which means they want to buy tickets. So hopefully that's the springboard required."" ""It's going to be a big year for dance music in general.""

"This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy a return to the dancefloor Plans to make Covid vaccine passports mandatory at nightclubs are ""deeply concerning,"" Greater Manchester's night-time economy advisor has said. Full vaccination will be acondition of entry to clubsand other venues with large crowds from September. Sacha Lord, who runs the Warehouse Project club nights, said the government ""appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation"". The government said it had launched a hospitality strategy to help. The announcement came on the day nightclubs were allowed to reopen after almost 18 months of closure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a press conference earlier: ""I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing. ""As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission."" Mr Lord said the industry had been taken by surprise by the latest announcement. ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to,"" he said. ""With this one move, the Government appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" What Covid rules have changed? PM urges caution as restrictions eased Cheers and celebrations as clubbers return He added: ""How will nightclubs now compete against pubs and bars down the road where these restrictions aren't needed, or attract punters who can just as easily have a house party without these enforcements in place. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place."" Sacha Lord runs the Warehouse Project club nights and Parklife festival Earlier, he told BBC Breakfast hospitality businesses remain ""on a cliff edge"" He said over the last 18 months businesses had seen how the government ""has really not understood"" their needs and how they operate. He added: ""The ten o'clock curfew is a perfect example, pushing hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets at exactly the same time. That did far worse than good. ""We saw ridiculous substantial meal rules - the Scotch egg rule. ""I took them to the High Court to compel them to drop that, which saved many businesses and jobs across the whole of the UK. ""So time and time again, we have seen so many mistakes."" A government spokesperson said: ""We appreciate the significant impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality industry - including the night-time economy. ""[This] is why, on top of our unprecedented Â£352bn package of business support, just last week we launched our hospitality strategy to help the sector recover as well as boost resilience long-term.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended lifting nearly all of England's Covid restrictions despite rising cases, saying: ""If not now, when?"" There are no limits on how many people can meet, the 1m-plus distancing rule is over and face coverings are optional But only the fully vaccinated will be allowed to enter nightclubs and other big events by end of September, PM says The sector has reacted with anger, with Michael Kill, of the Night Time Industries Association, calling it ""an absolute shambles"" Stock markets across UK, Europe and US dropped sharply on fears rising cases will hamper economic recovery The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning Americans against travelling to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says lifting all coronavirus restrictions is ""reckless"" Children over 12 at higher risk of getting ill with Covid will be offered the jab So will some healthy children over 12 who live with vulnerable people and those on the cusp of turning 18 In Scotland, rules are also changing, with looser limits on indoor gatherings, but masks will remain compulsory in shops and on public transport There have been a further 39,950 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in UK and 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Mr Johnson, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating Edited by Claire Heald, Martha Buckley and Vanessa Barford It's been a busy day of coronavirus news and we're getting ready to head off for the evening. Before we do, here's what you need to know:         The night time industry has been ""taken by surprise"" by the announcement that it will become a requirement to be fully vaccinated in order to attend  clubs and other crowded venues in England, says Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. He says: ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to. Surely these answers should have been given at the same time as this announcement."" He continues: ""Where does this leave festivals or live music events
catering specifically for teenagers or children who aren't being
vaccinated? Does this now mean young people, who have already suffered hugely
during this pandemic, now won't be able to experience the thrill of seeing
their favourite artist on stage? ""With this one move, the Government
appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" He adds that there are ""questions over how these checks will be enforced"" and about the financial impact of nightclubs competing with pubs and bars without such restrictions. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place,"" he adds. Small music clubs should be treated the same as similar-sized bars and clubs when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification, the boss of music industry body Live has said. Greg Parmley was reacting to the announcement that people in Englandwill need to be fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubsand other venues with large crowds from the end of September. ""The government has had several different positions on Covid certification in the last six months and we will need to see more detail before we can understand the full impact for the live music industry,"" he says. ""Many festivals and large venues are already adopting some level of Covid certification, and as responsible event organisers, will continue to do so."" But he adds: ""What we are absolutely clear about, however, is that venues such as small music clubs should not be treated any differently to other similar-sized hospitality businesses such as bars and restaurants when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification."" It may have been the day that most Covid restrictions were lifted in England, but many people have remained wary. Andy Walsh runs a bakery and
coffee shop in the Cumbria market town of Cockermouth. He says businesses in
the area have been very cautious about lifting remaining restrictions. ""I donât know a single shop
in Cockermouth thatâs relaxed its Covid measures today,"" he says. ""Weâll still
have screens up, mask wearing, and social distancing in our bakery. Weâve had
no negative feedback about it from customers. ""If the government opens things
up, then we all have to take responsibility for ourselves."" It's been a difficult two
weeks for Andyâs business. Half of his staff have been self-isolating at home
after they were pinged by the NHS app. The rest of his team have been working
extra hours to keep things going. Itâs a blow for an area that
relies on hospitality and tourism. Walsh says: ""Weâre a resilient town and
have dealt with massive floods over the past 15 years. But this is incredibly
challenging."" The town has had to cope with floods, most notably in 2009,when unprecedented rainfall devastated the area. Tarah WelshBBC London This video can not be played Small businesses were some of the hardest hit by lockdown restrictions, so market traders Russell Cox and Joan Thompson were very happy to see restrictions lifted in the Stratford Centre in east London today. Joan, who runs a small jewellery stall, says it's good to see people again but she hopes they will be cautious about gathering in large groups.   Sark, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands, has its first known case of coronavirus. The person was already in self-isolation before testing positive for Covid-19 over the weekend. The individual, who travelled to Sark, has had no contact with others and poses a minimal risk to the island, officials say. A States of Guernsey statement reads: ""The person was a traveller and tested negative on arrival. ""They later developed symptoms while in self-isolation and subsequently tested positive. ""Initial contact tracing has established that the individual has no contacts and no other individuals are being required to self-isolate as a result of this case."" You can read the full story here. Adults who have been fully vaccinated through the NHS now don't need to self-isolate when they return from most amber-list countries. Children also don't have to quarantine. But each country has its own rules to follow - both at the border and once you make it to your hotel, villa or campsite. Some of the key rules in place in seven destinations popular with UK holidaymakersare set out here. And you can read more broadly aboutthe rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries here. But remember, rules can change quickly, so it's important to check theForeign Office guidance,externaland government and tourist websites for your destination. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says Covid passports are a ""hammer blow on a day when nightclubs, a sector that has been closed by the government for 16 months, were finally given hope that they could start to trade viably and make progress towards rebuilding and paying off accrued debts"". She says the proof of vaccination is ""a costly burden that runs the risk of creating flashpoints between staff and customers, as well as raising potential issues with equalities legislation and the handling of customer data"". She says ministers asked the sector just last week to work with them on a voluntary scheme, so this new policy is ""devastating and risks hitting these fragile businesses and derailing their recovery and costing thousands of jobs"".  Most legal restrictions on social contact have been lifted in England. There are no longer limits on how many people can meet indoors and nightclubs have reopened. The lifting of restrictions comes as cases and hospitalisations due to Covid are rising. Patients at a hospital in Nottingham have urged the public to ""be careful"" as the changes come into place. This video can not be played Covid patients urge public to ""be careful"" as restrictions ease Nichola MandilJuba The health authorities in South Sudan say they have closed all Covid-19 vaccination centres after running out of jabs. The country received 132,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through the Covax delivery scheme but 72,000 were donated to neighbouring Kenya over concerns they would expire before use. South Sudan had a slow vaccination rollout and the ministry says the doses that remained were used to vaccinate more than 50,000 people with a first dose and 4,000 with a second dose. ""We have deployed successfully 95% of the 60,000 doses that remained with us, with a wastage of about 4%, and this is within acceptable range,"" Dr John Rumunu Pasquale, a director-general in the health ministry said. ""Now all our centres have closed,"" he added. He said that three Covid-19 variants of concern were circulating in South Sudan â the Alpha, Delta and Beta variants. Conservative backbencher, David Davis, is making his feelings clear about the new rules for nightclubs and crowded venues from September. Writing on Twitter, he says it is ""difficult to see how the government has properly tested the science or practicality of this"", adding, ""It is astonishing they are excluding test status."" He adds, ""Vaccination is sensible. But is entirely wrong to force and coerce people in to having them."" BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Louise Holly owns nightclub Mash in Cambridge and is a director of Chalk in Brighton. Both venues are opening tonight for the first time and have sold out. Speaking before the government's surprise announcement about clubs needing to ask customers for Covid passports from the end of September, Louise said she was ""really excited"" to be reopening after 16 months of closure. ""We will be trying to be extra-vigilant. We've spent an awful lot of money on our air conditioning, we've got hand sanitising points in the venue. We're just really looking forward to it."" Louise said her father was in intensive care for a month with coronavirus so she was ""really mindful of the risks"". ""It's going to be a really interesting night from all perspectives to see how it goes."" The
MP Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative
backbenchers, is critical of the plan to bring in proof of
vaccination for nightclubs and other crowded venues from the end of September. Speaking
in the Commons he says it is effectively moving to a situation of compulsory vaccination. He's calling on ministers  to bring forward the evidence for the policy ahead of any vote because he says he does not think the evidence from pilot schemes supports the idea.   The latest UK Covid data came through not long before the briefing and our Visual and Data Journalism Team have been busy updating our graphics. A further 39,950 cases have been reported, and another 19 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The average number of confirmed cases over the past seven days is 46,024. According tothe government's coronavirus dashboard,external, 87.9% of adults have had their first dose of a vaccine and 68.5% have had two doses. Fewer people are being admitted to hospital than last autumn but that number is rising. Nightclub owners are reacting angrily to news that Covid passports will be made mandatory in their venues from the end of September. Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time
Industries Association, says so-called ""freedom day"" for night clubs ""lasted
around 17 hours"" and the situation is ""an absolute shambles"". He said only a week ago Health Secretary Sajid Javid said vaccine passports would not be compulsory. And he says night clubs that have been planning for
reopening for months will now have to make more changes to the way they operate. 80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to
implement Covid passports, he adds, because they are worrying it will be hard to enforce and put customers off going clubbing spontaneously. The new rules put them ""at a
competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that arenât subject to the same
restrictions and yet provide similar environments"" he adds. âThe governmentâs own report into vaccine passports found they were more
trouble than theyâre worth â so what could possibly explain the about-turn,
just as millions across the UK experience their first taste of a night out in a
year and a halfâ¦?â Amy GladwellBBC News Online Thousands of holidaymakers are in
Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall - one of the countyâs busiest resorts. Louis Gardner, mayor of Newquay,
says many businesses are desperate to reopen fully, but there is a
""completely opposing section"" of the town that is ""very
nervous"". Nick Hayman, partner at the
Fistral Beach Bar overlooking the townâs biggest beach, says they are braced
for a busy day. He
says almost a third of the bar's 60-strong workforce are off at any one time
having been ""pinged"" by the NHS Test and Trace service. ""It's
really frustrating as we've got customers down here and we can't give them
proper service,"" he says. Danny Mayer, 41, and Heather Wright, 29, are on holiday with their son Jacob, eight, from Dundee, Scotland. They say they are ""laid back"" about Covid as they are fully vaccinated and are already enjoying not wearing masks. But Leonard and Doreen Cross, both in their late 80s, say the government has been âtoo hastyâ in ditching restrictions. Leonard Cross, who lives in Newquay with his wife, says: âBecause the Delta variant is so prevalent I think it is premature. If another variant comes along, goodness knows where we go from there.â Analysis Helen CattPolitical correspondent This was quite a news-packed briefing. There was a pretty bullish defence of the decision to lift restrictions in England at this point from both the prime minister and Jonathan Van Tam, who talked about this as being the ""sweet spot"". Boris Johnson also, as expected, stressed the importance of self-isolation with a statistic that I'm not sure we've heard before about close contacts being five times more likely to be infected. But less than 24 hours after restrictions lifted there was also a threat of a return of more rules with a ""plan"" to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs and other crowded spaces from the end of September. That's likely to cause a lot more discussion and is not quite the message that perhaps many were expecting today.  A sharp rise in Covid Delta variant cases in Israel shows the need for caution when ending restrictions, says Dr Asher Salmon, deputy director general of the country's health ministry. Israel had led the way with its vaccine programme and was able to lift many restrictions but there is now a surge in new cases. Dr Salmon toldBBC World Newsthat Israel was now considering what to do next. He thought it was better to take slower action rather than having to suddenly lift and then impose restrictions. ""Our main lesson is first be humble and then be very cautious,"" he said. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister says she is ""quite disturbed"" by some of the scenes in England following a relaxation of coronavirus regulations. Michelle O'Neill says Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to lifting all legal restrictions is""reckless"". She says: ""This isn't England, we have always set our own path throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so. ""I would be quite disturbed by some of the imagery which I've witnessed in the last 24 hours - that includes people getting together whenever cases are clearly on the rise."" O'Neill says she expects to receive advice from the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser on whether some restrictions can be lifted on 26 July and says any decisions will be ratified at Thursdays' Executive. ""I am yet to see that information so I can't say definitively around what will happen next,"" she says. ""It's very clear, and people are alarmed again. People are worried about the rising cases so need to be very careful to mind themselves and mind others around them."" Stock markets across the UK, Europe and the US have dropped sharply amid fears that rising numbers of Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. London's FTSE 100fell 2.6% to below the 7,000 level, led by broadcaster ITV and British Airways-owner IAG. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by more than 2% while major share indexes in France and Germany also fell. In England, most remaining Covid restrictions were lifted on Monday. However, new cases are continuing to rise in several countries fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus. Read our full story Â© 2025 BBC.

"Some fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England will be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. Instead those eligible - including NHS and care staff - will be able to take daily tests, the government said. A list of critical workers is due to be published, but the PM said it included food, utility and border staff. It follows mounting criticism of the impact of self-isolation on industry. Those eligible will be specifically named on a letter from a government department. ""This is not a blanket exemption for any sector or role,"" a government spokesman said. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms and was announced as most remaining curbs in England ended on Monday, including face mask laws. Meanwhile, a further 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing How many people can I meet now? Check your area's vaccine stats Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that test, trace and isolate was still an ""essential"" part of the government's Covid response. He said close contacts of positive cases were five times more likely to contract Covid and that a ""continuing sacrifice"" would be required. Speaking while isolating at his country residence, Mr Johnson said workers involved in the supply of food, water and electricity, as well as staff on the border and on the railways, would be among those exempt from self-isolation. But he said this would be for work purposes only and involve a ""very, very small number of named critical workers"" with employers contacted by letter. He added that the government did not want to ""extend it too widely because this is one of the few shots we've got left in our locker to stop the chain reaction of the spread of Covid"". Although it was unclear exactly which jobs would be eligible, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier confirmed the change would apply to health and social care workers in England. In Scotland, NHS staff will shortly receive similar guidance on self-isolation, deputy chief medical officer Dr Dave Caesar said. It came as Mr Zahawiconfirmed a limited group of children, many with underlying conditions, would be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as possible in England. He also confirmed that proof of full vaccinationwould be required in ""large crowded settings""such as nightclubs from the end of September in England - after all over-18s have had the chance to receive both vaccine doses. What's happening with the self-isolation rules? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Should I be working at home or going in? Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. An upcoming change from 16 August will mean people who are fully vaccinated will be able to skip isolation by taking a daily Covid test. Under-18s will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are contact traced. Similar rules are due to come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mr Johnson, along with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is self-isolating after being in close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid,who tested positive over the weekendafter feeling unwell on Friday evening. The PM appeared at Monday's news conference via video call from Buckinghamshire, alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam and the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in Downing Street. Amid a surge in infections linked to the Delta virus variant, a BBC analysis previously showed more than 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween 7 July and 16 August. Figures last week showed more than 530,000 contact tracing alerts were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales between 1 July and 7 July. People can also be told to self-isolate through a separate process run by NHS Test and Trace backed by laws. Pub chains, supermarkets and other businesses havewarned of the crippling effectblanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. Theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber said on Monday that self-isolation ruleshad forced the cancellation of performancesof his new West End show Cinderella. Each UK nation is in charge of its own coronavirus regulations. Englandended most of its remaining restrictionson Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbsas it moved to level zero. Some restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday,bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate appis being prepared for launchnext week amid a ""final push"" to get younger people vaccinated. The number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a ""weekend effect"". The number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period. The number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded.

"The attack affected about a quarter of a million Microsoft Exchange servers The UK, US and EU have accused China of carrying out a major cyber-attack earlier this year. The attack targeted Microsoft Exchange servers, affecting at least 30,000 organisations globally. Western security services believe it signals a shift from a targeted espionage campaign to a smash-and-grab raid, leading to concerns Chinese cyber-behaviour is escalating. The Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) has also been accused of wider espionage activity and a broader pattern of ""reckless"" behaviour. China has previously denied allegations of hacking and says it opposes all forms of cyber-crime. The unified call-out of Beijing shows the gravity with which this case has been taken. Western intelligence officials say aspects are markedly more serious than anything they have seen before. It began in January when hackers from a Chinese-linked group known as Hafnium began exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange. They used the vulnerability to insert backdoors into systems which they could return to later. The UK said the attack was likely to enable large-scale espionage, including the acquisition of personal information and intellectual property. It was mainly carried out against specific systems which aligned with Hafnium's previous targets, such as defence contractors, think tanks and universities. BACKGROUND: Microsoft accuses China over cyber-attacks ANALYSIS: Microsoft hacks put Biden in a bind WATCH: FBI launches new mission to cyber-crime ""We believe that cyber-operators working under the control of Chinese intelligence learned about the Microsoft vulnerability in early January, and were racing to exploit the vulnerability before [it] was widely identified in the public domain,"" a security source told the BBC. If this had been all, it would have been just another espionage operation. But in late February something significant changed. The targeted attack became a mass pile-in when other China-based groups began to exploit the vulnerability. The targets scaled up to encompass key industries and governments worldwide. It had turned from targeted espionage to a massive smash-and-grab raid. Western security sources believe Hafnium obtained advance knowledge that Microsoft intended to patch or close the vulnerability, and so shared it with other China-based groups to maximise the benefit before it became obsolete. It was the recklessness of the decision to spread the vulnerability that helped drive the decision to call out the Chinese publicly, officials say. The UK is also understood to have raised the issue of Chinese cyber-activity in private with Beijing over an extended period, including handing over dossiers of evidence. Microsoft went public about the vulnerability on 2 March and offered a patch to close it. At this point, more hackers around the world had realised its value and piled in. Around a quarter of a million systems globally were left exposed - often small or medium-sized businesses and organisations - and at least 30,000 were compromised. This video can not be played China is denying allegations that its military is responsible for cyber attacks on global companies Western governments accuse the MSS of using hackers for hire and want it to sever ties with them. The UK Foreign Office said the Chinese government had ""ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when caught"". The White House said it reserved the right to take additional actions against China over its cyber activities. The EU, meanwhile, said the hack had ""resulted in security risks and significant economic loss for our government institutions and private companies"". But Western spies are still struggling to understand why Chinese behaviour has changed. If the hackers were authorised to escalate, it would suggest a step-change in what the country is willing to do and raise the fear that they no longer care about being caught. That is partly why so many governments have joined together to signal their concerns. Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have joined Nato in issuing a statement in ""solidarity"". The countries also called out wider Chinese behaviour which it linked to two groups known as APT 40 and APT 31, which are believed to be linked to the MSS. Despite the strong language, there are no signs of fresh sanctions against China. In contrast, new sanctions were placed on Russia forthe recent SolarWinds campaignwhich many experts believe was less serious than the Microsoft Exchange campaign linked to China. Some officials, however, hope China is more sensitive than Russia to international pressure. The US Department of Justice has announced criminal charges against four MSS hackers which it said were linked to a long-term campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors in a least a dozen countries. Ultimately, Western security sources believe the MSS is behind all the activity revealed today and hope co-ordinated international action will put pressure on their activities.

"Olivia Breen is set to compete at the Paralympics in Tokyo next month Double world champion para-athlete Olivia Breen said she was left angry and speechless after being told to wear ""more appropriate"" shorts. Breen, 24, says an official at the English Championships on Sunday told her the briefs were ""too short and revealing"". The sprinter and long jumper said she was highlighting the incident to stop it happening to others. ""It made me feel really angry and it's very wrong,"" said Breen. ""You know they can't comment on what we can and can't wear."" Breen won a world championship gold medal in the T35-38 4x100m class in 2015 and again in 2017 in the T38 long jump and has been wearing the same style of competition briefs from her sponsor throughout her career. ""They are like high-waisted bikini bottoms,"" she toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme. ""I've worn them for nine years, I've never had a problem and we should feel comfortable with what we wear. ""We want to be as light as possible when we're competing, not having to feel heavy, and to feel comfortable. ""We should just wear what we're entitled to wear."" Allow Instagram content?

Breen, who also won a bronze medal at the London 2012 Paralympics, told the programme the incident occurred after she competed in the long jump in Bedford. ""I'd just finished my competition and was thanking the officials for their help and their support and this official came up to me and said 'can I talk to you?' and I was like yeah, what's the problem? ""She said 'I think what you're wearing is very revealing and I think you should consider buying shorts'. I didn't know what to say I was left speechless and my first thought process was 'are you joking?'."" Full-body suits make young gymnasts feel safe Norway fined for 'improper clothing' Breen believes male athletes would not face similar scrutiny or criticism but, after posting about the incident on social media, said other females have told her they have suffered similar experiences. ""I've never personally felt self-conscious, but yesterday made me feel very angry and obviously from the response on Instagram and Twitter that I've had, it has happened to a lot of young girls and athletes and it needs to change,"" she added. ""I think people haven't spoken out about it because they feel afraid and I want people to feel confident and speak out about it because it's wrong what happened and this needs to stop happening to us. ""I'm just going to take it as far as I can. I really want to get the message out there and I obviously want to make a change in female sport so people can't make comments again about what we can and can't wear."" Another British athlete, shot putter Amelia Stricker, said officials who made such ""unnecessary"" comments should not officiate, a point of view Breen shares. ""Yes I do very strongly [agree],"" she said. ""They do an amazing job and I really appreciate their support but they can't make comments on what we wear. They are there to do their job and help us, not by commenting on what we wear, regardless."" An England Athletics spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the post and will be investigating as a matter of urgency. The wellbeing of all participants in athletics is of the utmost importance and everyone should feel comfortable to compete and participate in the sport."" BBC Wales Sport has learned Breen has since spoken to England Athletics and they will be investigating the incident.

"Some fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England will be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. Instead those eligible - including NHS and care staff - will be able to take daily tests, the government said. A list of critical workers is due to be published, but the PM said it included food, utility and border staff. It follows mounting criticism of the impact of self-isolation on industry. Those eligible will be specifically named on a letter from a government department. ""This is not a blanket exemption for any sector or role,"" a government spokesman said. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms and was announced as most remaining curbs in England ended on Monday, including face mask laws. Meanwhile, a further 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing How many people can I meet now? Check your area's vaccine stats Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that test, trace and isolate was still an ""essential"" part of the government's Covid response. He said close contacts of positive cases were five times more likely to contract Covid and that a ""continuing sacrifice"" would be required. Speaking while isolating at his country residence, Mr Johnson said workers involved in the supply of food, water and electricity, as well as staff on the border and on the railways, would be among those exempt from self-isolation. But he said this would be for work purposes only and involve a ""very, very small number of named critical workers"" with employers contacted by letter. He added that the government did not want to ""extend it too widely because this is one of the few shots we've got left in our locker to stop the chain reaction of the spread of Covid"". Although it was unclear exactly which jobs would be eligible, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier confirmed the change would apply to health and social care workers in England. In Scotland, NHS staff will shortly receive similar guidance on self-isolation, deputy chief medical officer Dr Dave Caesar said. It came as Mr Zahawiconfirmed a limited group of children, many with underlying conditions, would be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as possible in England. He also confirmed that proof of full vaccinationwould be required in ""large crowded settings""such as nightclubs from the end of September in England - after all over-18s have had the chance to receive both vaccine doses. What's happening with the self-isolation rules? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Should I be working at home or going in? Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. An upcoming change from 16 August will mean people who are fully vaccinated will be able to skip isolation by taking a daily Covid test. Under-18s will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are contact traced. Similar rules are due to come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mr Johnson, along with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is self-isolating after being in close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid,who tested positive over the weekendafter feeling unwell on Friday evening. The PM appeared at Monday's news conference via video call from Buckinghamshire, alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam and the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in Downing Street. Amid a surge in infections linked to the Delta virus variant, a BBC analysis previously showed more than 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween 7 July and 16 August. Figures last week showed more than 530,000 contact tracing alerts were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales between 1 July and 7 July. People can also be told to self-isolate through a separate process run by NHS Test and Trace backed by laws. Pub chains, supermarkets and other businesses havewarned of the crippling effectblanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. Theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber said on Monday that self-isolation ruleshad forced the cancellation of performancesof his new West End show Cinderella. Each UK nation is in charge of its own coronavirus regulations. Englandended most of its remaining restrictionson Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbsas it moved to level zero. Some restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday,bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate appis being prepared for launchnext week amid a ""final push"" to get younger people vaccinated. The number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a ""weekend effect"". The number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period. The number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded.

"Sami Sabet, Carina Price, Hasmukh Shingadia, Jerry Hosi and Timothy Brentnall outside the court The Court of Appeal has cleared 12 more former subpostmasters who were wrongly convicted of offences during the Post Office Horizon scandal. It brings the total of judgements overturned to 59, but hundreds more are hoping for similar decisions. Between 1999 and 2015, they were sacked or prosecuted after money appeared to vanish from accounts at their branches. The problems were caused by the Horizon computer system in Post Office branches which turned out to be flawed. Some subpostmasters were imprisoned after being convicted of stealing money. In April, 39 people had verdicts against them overturned,following on from the overturning of six other convictionsin December. More people have been affected by this than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. The Horizon system was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. Horizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people. Three judges quashed the convictions of Robert Ambrose, Hasmukh Shingadia, John Armstrong, Timothy Brentnall, Jerry Hosi, Gurdeep Singh Dhale, John Dickson, Abiodun Omotoso, Malcolm Watkins, Sami Sabet, Carina Price and Rizwan Manjra. Their appeals were unopposed by the Post Office. At a hearing in March, the court heard subpostmasters' lives were ""irreparably ruined"", with some losing marriages, jobs and homes after they were prosecuted by the Post Office. An independent inquiry is being held into the affair. The Horizon system was designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch One of the 12, Hasmukh Shingadia, came under particular scrutiny as he was a guest the the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. He ran the local Post Office and shop in Upper Bucklebury, West Berkshire, and had become friends with the family of Kate Middleton, seeing her grow up and selling her sweets at the shop. He repaid the shortfall to the Post Office, was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service. Mr Shingadia said: ""What has happened to people has been appalling. Those who were in charge of the Post Office must be held to account at a Public Inquiry now, and dealt with appropriately from whatever that inquiry uncovers."" Having spoken to many who have had their convictions overturned it's not possible to over-state the importance of this news to the 12 individuals who have had their lives and careers shattered by wrongful convictions. Many faced time in prison, bankruptcy, and were unable to find new work because of their criminal records. But for hundreds of others in the same position, hoping to wipe their criminal records clean, today also brings more worrying news. Although the 12 who have had their names cleared were unopposed, another 15 people's cases are being opposed by the Post Office. A judge will now decide whether the Court will grant permission to appeal against those convictions, which may not happen until the Autumn. Although the Post Office has said they urge ""anybody who believes that they may have a relevant case to come forward"", it's clearly not going to be the straightforward process that many had hoped for. After years of fighting the Post Office at every turn to clear their names the battles are not over yet. Monday's cases were the fourth group represented by Hudgell Solicitors to see their appeals through to a successful conclusion. Neil Hudgell said it had been another significant day in court for a group of people who suffered badly. They ""did no wrong, were bullied into admitting to crimes they had not committed, made to pay back large sums of money they had not taken and who saw their lives irreparably damaged as a result"".  he said. He added: ""This group again includes people who spent time in prison. Sadly, what happened to each individual and their families can never be reversed. That makes it all the more important for it to be recognised by the Post Office and the courts."" A Post Office spokesperson said: ""Post Office is sincerely sorry for past failures and we welcome the Court's decision today to quash convictions without delay in the appeals we supported. ""We are making strenuous efforts to fairly address historical miscarriages of justice, including an extensive review of prosecutions since 1999 to identify and disclose all material which might affect the safety of convictions. ""We are also transforming our organisation to prevent such events ever happening again and to re-set our relationship with postmasters.""

"Asian stock markets fell on Tuesday, tracking sharp declines seen in Europe and the US on Monday that were triggered by fears that rising Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1% to hit its lowest level in six months, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also lost 1%. On Monday, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average had tumbled by more than 2%. But shares in London and the rest of Europe started stronger on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 index rebounded 1%, while other major European indexes saw similar rises. Monday's sharp falls came as investors became increasingly jittery about the rise in the number of Covid cases in some countries,fuelled by the Delta variant. Japanese shares have now fallen for five sessions in a row over concerns about the spread of the variant and that the Tokyo Olympics could worsen the health crisis. ""Investors are concerned that the rapid spread of the Delta variant will derail the trajectory of the global recovery, notably in Asia which still has relatively low vaccination rates and where some widely used vaccines do not appear overly effective against it,"" Jeff Halley, senior market analyst, from Oanda told the BBC. ""I believe we are in for a messy week ahead, with markets being driven around by sentiment and not data, as the international economic calendar is very quiet."" Meanwhile, businesses in the UK have described how they are cutting opening hours, closing shops or may have to reduce production as employees are forced to self-isolate after being alerted by the NHS Covid-19 app. Price rises speed up again as economy unlocks Fears of workers on the face masks frontline ""Optimism which had been on the horizon just a few weeks ago has again been obscured by dark clouds, especially with the snap decision toenforce a 10-day quarantine for arrivals from France,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Monday. ""With some scientists warning that infections could reach 200,000 a day by September, there is now a feeling that the UK could be staring at a fresh autumn lockdown,"" she added. At a media briefing, US President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated in order to ensure the economy can remain open. Covid infections linked to the Delta variant have been increasing, but concerns among US investors spiked after Los Angeles imposed an indoor mask mandate again over the weekend. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% in its worst session of 2021. Commenting on how markets performed on Monday, President Biden said: ""That's not how I judge economic growth."" His comments came after data published last week showed prices in the US spiked again in June, driven higher by the cost of used cars and food increasing. Mr Biden said that the increase in inflation was expected to be temporary, but he understood that unchecked inflation over the long term would pose a ""real challenge"" to the economy.

"This video can not be played By the end of September, full vaccination will be required in order to enter nightclubs, says the PM People attending nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather in England will need to be fully vaccinated from the end of September, the government says. Latest figures show 35% of 18 to 30-year-olds have not had their first jab. Currently nightclubs and other crowded venues are only encouraged to ask clubbers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result or immunity. But Boris Johnson said he was concerned by the continuing risk of transmission. The announcement came on the day nightclubs in England were allowed to reopen after 16 months of closure. The prime minister told a press conference on Monday: ""I don't want to have to close nightclubs again as they have elsewhere. But it does mean nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing. ""As we said last week, we do reserve the right to mandate certification at any point if it's necessary to reduce transmission. ""And I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s have had their chance to be double jabbed we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather."" Nightclubs reopen but what next for the industry? Covid passport plan for nightclubs 'concerning' Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said nightclubs and other such venues could be ""potential super spreading events"" because of crowds in close contact. ""I would expect that with opening of nightclubs, we'll continue to see an increase in cases, and we will see outbreaks related to specific nightclubs as well,"" he said.

The Welsh government said it would never mandate the use of vaccination certificates but that businesses would be free to ask for them. Across the UK, 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It's easy to understand how a loud and busy nightclub could be the perfect stomping ground for Covid. Having lots of people packed closely together, snogging, singing and shouting in a confined space with relatively poor ventilation creates ideal conditions for a virus carried in our spit to spread. Add in the fact that many of those attending may not have had two or even one dose of a vaccine that helps protect against catching and transmitting the virus, and you could have a super-spreading event on your hands. The Netherlands recently tried reopening its clubs and quickly decided to close them again amid rising infection rates. Its governmentsaid most of the new infections occurred in nightlife settings and parties with large numbers of people,external. For now, it is asking its citizens to use their common sense and act responsibly; keeping gatherings small and manageable. Time will tell if the UK might go the same way. Many nightclubs have shut down during the pandemic and the industry reacted angrily to the prime minister's announcement. ""So, 'freedom day' for nightclubs lasted around 17 hours then,"" said Michael Kill, boss of the Night Time Industries Association. ""Leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months having to make more changes to the way they operate - this is still a bad idea. ""80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to implement Covid passports, worrying about difficulties with enforcing the system and a reduction in spontaneous consumers, as well as being put at a competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that aren't subject to the same restrictions and yet provide similar environments."" Boss of UK Hospitality Kate Nicholls called the announcement ""a hammer blow"" for a struggling industry trying to rebuild. One major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, and Fiction, said clubs had become a political football. Boss Peter Marks said: ""Mandatory Covid passports may make sense one day once the entire adult population has been offered vaccines, but does government really think this threat will entice the 'vaccine wary' to take the vaccine? They will just stay later in the pubs and hold their parties in their houses."" Mark Harper MP, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative backbenchers, also criticised the plans, saying the government was ""effectively moving to compulsory vaccination."" Speaking in the House of Commons, he called on the government to bring forward the evidence for the policy in September ahead of any vote, saying he didn't think the evidence from pilot schemes supported the idea. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi MP promised to share the evidence with the Commons, ""working with the nightclub industry or at-risk large scale events that are indoors"".

"Video conferencing firm Zoom has struck a multibillion dollar deal to buy a cloud-based call centre operator in a bet on the future of hybrid working. The firm announced the $14.7bn (Â£10.7bn) acquisition of Five9in a blog post,externalon Sunday. Zoom boss Eric Yuan said the deal would allow its customers to ""reimagine the way they do business"". It marks the firm's biggest takeover, and comes even though staff are beginning to return to the office. Investors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as social distancing restrictions lift and more people are vaccinated. The pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight. Zoom has said it does not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong. The company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (Â£2.66bn). In the last three months of 2020, sales were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m,it said in March. This video can not be played From pet and child interruptions to catching fire, here's a look at the times online meetings went wrong The firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, said the acquisition of Five9 marked a shift in strategy. It is now prioritising its cloud-calling product Zoom Phone and conference-hosting product Zoom Rooms. ""This acquisition is... positioning us to accelerate Zoom's growth and play an even stronger role in driving the digital future, bringing companies and their customers closer together,"" its founder Eric Yuan said. Five9's call centre software is used by more than 2,000 clients such as Under Armour, Lululemon and Olympus, and the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 having been approved by the boards of both companies. ""This is a high-priced deal which appears to attempt to build out the Zoom Phone offering,"" said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. But he added: ""Paying such a high price for a non-differentiated offering smacks of attempts to move into adjacent markets as Zoom fatigue sets in."" A question mark has been raised over the future of hybrid working, although other tech firms such as Google and Microsoft have invested in their video-conferencing offer during the pandemic. But others such asglobal workspace provider IWG have saidthat they expect working from home some of the time will become the norm - especially as firms will be looking to save money and be more environmentally-friendly by using less office space.

"Some fully vaccinated people in critical roles in England will be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. Instead those eligible - including NHS and care staff - will be able to take daily tests, the government said. A list of critical workers is due to be published, but the PM said it included food, utility and border staff. It follows mounting criticism of the impact of self-isolation on industry. Those eligible will be specifically named on a letter from a government department. ""This is not a blanket exemption for any sector or role,"" a government spokesman said. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms and was announced as most remaining curbs in England ended on Monday, including face mask laws. Meanwhile, a further 39,950 cases were recorded on Monday alongside another 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Zoom bets billions on home working continuing How many people can I meet now? Check your area's vaccine stats Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference that test, trace and isolate was still an ""essential"" part of the government's Covid response. He said close contacts of positive cases were five times more likely to contract Covid and that a ""continuing sacrifice"" would be required. Speaking while isolating at his country residence, Mr Johnson said workers involved in the supply of food, water and electricity, as well as staff on the border and on the railways, would be among those exempt from self-isolation. But he said this would be for work purposes only and involve a ""very, very small number of named critical workers"" with employers contacted by letter. He added that the government did not want to ""extend it too widely because this is one of the few shots we've got left in our locker to stop the chain reaction of the spread of Covid"". Although it was unclear exactly which jobs would be eligible, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier confirmed the change would apply to health and social care workers in England. In Scotland, NHS staff will shortly receive similar guidance on self-isolation, deputy chief medical officer Dr Dave Caesar said. It came as Mr Zahawiconfirmed a limited group of children, many with underlying conditions, would be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as possible in England. He also confirmed that proof of full vaccinationwould be required in ""large crowded settings""such as nightclubs from the end of September in England - after all over-18s have had the chance to receive both vaccine doses. What's happening with the self-isolation rules? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Should I be working at home or going in? Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. An upcoming change from 16 August will mean people who are fully vaccinated will be able to skip isolation by taking a daily Covid test. Under-18s will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are contact traced. Similar rules are due to come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Mr Johnson, along with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is self-isolating after being in close contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid,who tested positive over the weekendafter feeling unwell on Friday evening. The PM appeared at Monday's news conference via video call from Buckinghamshire, alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam and the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in Downing Street. Amid a surge in infections linked to the Delta virus variant, a BBC analysis previously showed more than 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween 7 July and 16 August. Figures last week showed more than 530,000 contact tracing alerts were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales between 1 July and 7 July. People can also be told to self-isolate through a separate process run by NHS Test and Trace backed by laws. Pub chains, supermarkets and other businesses havewarned of the crippling effectblanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. Theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber said on Monday that self-isolation ruleshad forced the cancellation of performancesof his new West End show Cinderella. Each UK nation is in charge of its own coronavirus regulations. Englandended most of its remaining restrictionson Monday, while Scotland also eased some curbsas it moved to level zero. Some restrictions were lifted in Wales on Saturday,bringing an end to social-distancing outside. In Northern Ireland, a new Covid-19 certificate appis being prepared for launchnext week amid a ""final push"" to get younger people vaccinated. The number of daily Covid cases is often lower at the beginning of the week due to reporting delays and a ""weekend effect"". The number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid in the last seven days was 39.5% higher than the previous week, government data showed, with 4,317 admissions over the latest period. The number of deaths in the last seven days was 48% higher than the previous week, with 296 recorded.

"Iceland and Greene King say they have had to shut shops and pubs due to staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Iceland said that after keeping all of its stores open during lockdown, it has now had to shut some because 1,000 staff have been ""pinged"" by the app. Chief executive Richard Walker said: ""The great irony is that we're now all getting vaccinated."" Greene King has closed 33 pubs in the past week due to staff self-isolating. Boss Nick Mackenzie said the pubs group also had to shorten opening hours at some sites. He added that across the hospitality industry about one in five team members have been affected, ""and therefore it is causing a real issue for us setting up a business on a daily basis"". Recent figures showed more than 500,000 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the app in the week to 7 July, up 46% on the previous week. People who have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 must self-isolate for 10 days. Business lobby group the CBI has warned that ""crippling staff shortages"" risk hampering an economic recovery. Vauxhall confirmed on Monday that it has reduced its daily shifts from three to two at its Luton plant ""because of increasing numbers of employees who have been contacted by the app"". A spokesman for the carmaker said Vauxhall was about to embark on its yearly three-week shutdown from Friday, 23 July. By the time the Luton plant restarts in August it hopes ""the situation will have improved"". Others in the car industry have also been affected by high levels of staff self-isolating. Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could affect production. Vauxhall plant cuts shifts due to staff isolating 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets PM urges caution as Covid rules ease in England How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Meanwhile, a group representing some of the UK's biggest ports said staff shortages caused by people having to self-isolate after being contacted by the NHS app represented ""one of the most significant threats to ports' resilience in recent years"". The UK Major Ports Group (UKMPG), which represents Felixstowe, the Port of Liverpool, Southampton and others, says that absence rates caused by staff self-isolating are at 10% at some ports. ""Whilst ports are maintaining all the controls on site that have - so far - kept ports open through the pandemic, we have no control over what happens in the wider world,"" said Tim Morris, chief executive of UKMPG. Iceland's Mr Walker said that as well closing some stores, the chain has also had to reduce opening hours in some circumstances. ""The concern is that as this thing rises exponentially as we've just been hearing. It could get a lot worse a lot quicker,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Walker said 4% of Iceland's 30,000-strong workforce was now absent. ""In fact, we've just announced employing an additional 2,000 people on top of that to give us a deeper pool of labour, because so many people are now getting pinged."" The number of Covid cases in England and Wales surpassed 50,000 on both Friday and Saturday, the highest number since mid-January. On Monday, England lifted final Covid restrictions, including the legal requirement to wear a face covering to prevent the spread of the virus. Wales is expected to scrap most rules on 7 August though this will not include face masks. Scotland has moved to the lowest level of restrictions of Covid restrictions but face coverings must be worn for a further three weeks. Northern Ireland will decide on Thursday to ease rules on seven days' time. PureGym's chief executive, Humphrey Cobbold, said his business had managed to keep all of its sites open despite rising numbers of employees forced to self-isolate, but it had been difficult. ""Up to 25%, in some areas, of our staff have been asked to self-isolate,"" he told the BBC. ""Through flexibility and sharing of labour across sites, we've been able to keep sites open so far but it's been a very close call in certain circumstances."" Kate Lester, founder and chief executive of Diamond Logistics, which runs a UK network of fulfilment and delivery centres, said the company has had to delay opening a new site at Motherwell in Scotland because between 20% and 25% of staff are off work. ""We're actually having to delay that launch for over a month which deprives our new network partner of his income and in addition to that it deprives his clients of vital logistics services,"" she said. Today is potentially a big day for many businesses. Capacity limits are gone; venues can fill up if they want to. That means many pubs and restaurants, for example, have the chance of turning a profit again. Bosses have longed for this day since the pandemic began. But they face another growing problem. As infections rise, so too are the number of people told they must self-isolate after coming into contact with a positive case. This is causing a staffing problem for many, many firms. Venues and stores have had to close. Opening hours have been curtailed. There is a clamour from companies, demanding the government immediately change the self-isolation rules to exempt people who have had both Covid-19 vaccines and test negative. The regime is due to be overhauled in a month's time. However, business leaders fear many more staff will be told to stay at home and therefore businesses will be forced to close at a time when they hoped to making money again. The CBI has called for an immediate end to the 10-day self-isolation period for people who have been fully vaccinated. It also said daily lateral flow tests could help people who have not received both jabs get back to work. From 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are ""pinged"" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak wereforced to U-turn on a decision not to self-isolateafter coming into contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid on Saturday. Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak had said initially that they would not need to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead. But this sparked a backlash from opposition parties and businesses. Greene King's Mr Mackenzie said the government needed to bring the ""test and release"" scheme forward to allow more people to come into work and ""get us back to normal again"".

"The attack affected about a quarter of a million Microsoft Exchange servers The UK, US and EU have accused China of carrying out a major cyber-attack earlier this year. The attack targeted Microsoft Exchange servers, affecting at least 30,000 organisations globally. Western security services believe it signals a shift from a targeted espionage campaign to a smash-and-grab raid, leading to concerns Chinese cyber-behaviour is escalating. The Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) has also been accused of wider espionage activity and a broader pattern of ""reckless"" behaviour. China has previously denied allegations of hacking and says it opposes all forms of cyber-crime. The unified call-out of Beijing shows the gravity with which this case has been taken. Western intelligence officials say aspects are markedly more serious than anything they have seen before. It began in January when hackers from a Chinese-linked group known as Hafnium began exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange. They used the vulnerability to insert backdoors into systems which they could return to later. The UK said the attack was likely to enable large-scale espionage, including the acquisition of personal information and intellectual property. It was mainly carried out against specific systems which aligned with Hafnium's previous targets, such as defence contractors, think tanks and universities. BACKGROUND: Microsoft accuses China over cyber-attacks ANALYSIS: Microsoft hacks put Biden in a bind WATCH: FBI launches new mission to cyber-crime ""We believe that cyber-operators working under the control of Chinese intelligence learned about the Microsoft vulnerability in early January, and were racing to exploit the vulnerability before [it] was widely identified in the public domain,"" a security source told the BBC. If this had been all, it would have been just another espionage operation. But in late February something significant changed. The targeted attack became a mass pile-in when other China-based groups began to exploit the vulnerability. The targets scaled up to encompass key industries and governments worldwide. It had turned from targeted espionage to a massive smash-and-grab raid. Western security sources believe Hafnium obtained advance knowledge that Microsoft intended to patch or close the vulnerability, and so shared it with other China-based groups to maximise the benefit before it became obsolete. It was the recklessness of the decision to spread the vulnerability that helped drive the decision to call out the Chinese publicly, officials say. The UK is also understood to have raised the issue of Chinese cyber-activity in private with Beijing over an extended period, including handing over dossiers of evidence. Microsoft went public about the vulnerability on 2 March and offered a patch to close it. At this point, more hackers around the world had realised its value and piled in. Around a quarter of a million systems globally were left exposed - often small or medium-sized businesses and organisations - and at least 30,000 were compromised. This video can not be played China is denying allegations that its military is responsible for cyber attacks on global companies Western governments accuse the MSS of using hackers for hire and want it to sever ties with them. The UK Foreign Office said the Chinese government had ""ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when caught"". The White House said it reserved the right to take additional actions against China over its cyber activities. The EU, meanwhile, said the hack had ""resulted in security risks and significant economic loss for our government institutions and private companies"". But Western spies are still struggling to understand why Chinese behaviour has changed. If the hackers were authorised to escalate, it would suggest a step-change in what the country is willing to do and raise the fear that they no longer care about being caught. That is partly why so many governments have joined together to signal their concerns. Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have joined Nato in issuing a statement in ""solidarity"". The countries also called out wider Chinese behaviour which it linked to two groups known as APT 40 and APT 31, which are believed to be linked to the MSS. Despite the strong language, there are no signs of fresh sanctions against China. In contrast, new sanctions were placed on Russia forthe recent SolarWinds campaignwhich many experts believe was less serious than the Microsoft Exchange campaign linked to China. Some officials, however, hope China is more sensitive than Russia to international pressure. The US Department of Justice has announced criminal charges against four MSS hackers which it said were linked to a long-term campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors in a least a dozen countries. Ultimately, Western security sources believe the MSS is behind all the activity revealed today and hope co-ordinated international action will put pressure on their activities.

"Rights activists, journalists and lawyers around the world have been targeted with phone malware sold to authoritarian governments by an Israeli surveillance firm, media reports say. They are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of the company, NSO Group, leaked to major news outlets. It was not clear where the list came from - or how many phones had actually been hacked. NSO denies any wrongdoing. It says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. It said the original investigation which led to the reports, by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International, was ""full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories"". But it added that it would ""continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action"". The allegations about use of the software, known as Pegasus, were carried on Sunday by the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde and 14 other media organisations around the world. Pegasus infects iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. Media outlets working on the investigation said they had identified more than 1,000 people spanning over 50 countries whose numbers were on the list. They include politicians and heads of state, business executives, activists, and several Arab royal family members. More than 180 journalists were also found to be on the list, from organisations including CNN, the New York Times and Al Jazeera. Who are the alleged victims of Pegasus spyware? Many of the numbers were clustered in 10 countries:Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabiaand theUnited Arab Emirates, according to the reports. When contacted by the outlets involved in the investigation, spokespeople for these countries either denied that Pegasus was used or denied that they had abused their powers of surveillance. It was not clear how many of the devices on the list had actually been targeted, but forensic analysis of 37 of the phones showed there had been ""attempted and successful"" hacks, the Washington Post reported. This included people close toSaudijournalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in October 2018 while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. His body was then dismembered. The investigation found that spyware was installed on his fiancÃ©e's phone days after his murder, and that his wife's phone was targeted with spyware between September 2017 and April 2018. This video can not be played Whatâs it like to have spyware on your phone? The NSO Group said its technology was ""not associated in any way with the heinous murder"". The phone ofMexicanjournalist Cecilio Pineda Birto also appeared twice on the list, including in the month before he was murdered, the investigation found. His phone disappeared from the scene of the murder so a forensic examination was not possible. NSO said that even if his phone was targeted, that did not mean that data collected was connected with his murder. The phones of twoHungarianinvestigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were found to have been successfully infected with the spyware. Mr Panyi told Forbidden stories that learning of the hack was ""devastating"". ""There are some people in this country who consider a regular journalist as dangerous as someone suspected of terrorism,"" he said. The Hungarian government was ""not aware of any alleged data collection"", a spokesperson told the Guardian. InIndia, more than 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and two ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government werereported to be on the list. This included thekey opposition figure Rahul Gandhi,with two mobile phone numbers belonging to him found in the list. Mr Gandhi no longer has the devices so it was not possible to analyse them to determine if he had been hacked. India's government has denied using unauthorised surveillance. More details about who has been targeted are expected to be released in the coming days. WhatsApp sued NSO in 2019, alleging the company was behind cyber-attacks on 1,400 mobile phones involving Pegasus. At the time, NSO denied any wrongdoing, but the company has been banned from using WhatsApp. The allegations here are not new. What is new is the scale of the targeting of innocent people that's allegedly taking place. Nearly 200 reporters from 21 countries have their phone numbers on this list, and more names of high-profile public figures are expected to be revealed. There are plenty of unknowns in these allegations - including where the list comes from and how many of the phone numbers were actively targeted with spyware. NSO Group has once again come out swinging and denies all accusations. However, it's a blow for the company, which is actively trying to reform its reputation. Only two weeks ago it released its first ""transparency report"" detailing human right policies and pledges. Amnesty International brushed the 32-page document off as a ""sales brochure"". These latest allegations will do further damage to its image, but they won't hurt the company financially. There are very few private companies able to produce the sort of invasive spy tools that NSO sells, and clearly the largely unregulated market for the software is booming.

"Sami Sabet, Carina Price, Hasmukh Shingadia, Jerry Hosi and Timothy Brentnall outside the court The Court of Appeal has cleared 12 more former subpostmasters who were wrongly convicted of offences during the Post Office Horizon scandal. It brings the total of judgements overturned to 59, but hundreds more are hoping for similar decisions. Between 1999 and 2015, they were sacked or prosecuted after money appeared to vanish from accounts at their branches. The problems were caused by the Horizon computer system in Post Office branches which turned out to be flawed. Some subpostmasters were imprisoned after being convicted of stealing money. In April, 39 people had verdicts against them overturned,following on from the overturning of six other convictionsin December. More people have been affected by this than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. The Horizon system was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage, it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. Horizon-based evidence was used by the Post Office to successfully prosecute 736 people. Three judges quashed the convictions of Robert Ambrose, Hasmukh Shingadia, John Armstrong, Timothy Brentnall, Jerry Hosi, Gurdeep Singh Dhale, John Dickson, Abiodun Omotoso, Malcolm Watkins, Sami Sabet, Carina Price and Rizwan Manjra. Their appeals were unopposed by the Post Office. At a hearing in March, the court heard subpostmasters' lives were ""irreparably ruined"", with some losing marriages, jobs and homes after they were prosecuted by the Post Office. An independent inquiry is being held into the affair. The Horizon system was designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch One of the 12, Hasmukh Shingadia, came under particular scrutiny as he was a guest the the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. He ran the local Post Office and shop in Upper Bucklebury, West Berkshire, and had become friends with the family of Kate Middleton, seeing her grow up and selling her sweets at the shop. He repaid the shortfall to the Post Office, was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service. Mr Shingadia said: ""What has happened to people has been appalling. Those who were in charge of the Post Office must be held to account at a Public Inquiry now, and dealt with appropriately from whatever that inquiry uncovers."" Having spoken to many who have had their convictions overturned it's not possible to over-state the importance of this news to the 12 individuals who have had their lives and careers shattered by wrongful convictions. Many faced time in prison, bankruptcy, and were unable to find new work because of their criminal records. But for hundreds of others in the same position, hoping to wipe their criminal records clean, today also brings more worrying news. Although the 12 who have had their names cleared were unopposed, another 15 people's cases are being opposed by the Post Office. A judge will now decide whether the Court will grant permission to appeal against those convictions, which may not happen until the Autumn. Although the Post Office has said they urge ""anybody who believes that they may have a relevant case to come forward"", it's clearly not going to be the straightforward process that many had hoped for. After years of fighting the Post Office at every turn to clear their names the battles are not over yet. Monday's cases were the fourth group represented by Hudgell Solicitors to see their appeals through to a successful conclusion. Neil Hudgell said it had been another significant day in court for a group of people who suffered badly. They ""did no wrong, were bullied into admitting to crimes they had not committed, made to pay back large sums of money they had not taken and who saw their lives irreparably damaged as a result"".  he said. He added: ""This group again includes people who spent time in prison. Sadly, what happened to each individual and their families can never be reversed. That makes it all the more important for it to be recognised by the Post Office and the courts."" A Post Office spokesperson said: ""Post Office is sincerely sorry for past failures and we welcome the Court's decision today to quash convictions without delay in the appeals we supported. ""We are making strenuous efforts to fairly address historical miscarriages of justice, including an extensive review of prosecutions since 1999 to identify and disclose all material which might affect the safety of convictions. ""We are also transforming our organisation to prevent such events ever happening again and to re-set our relationship with postmasters.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged caution as most legal restrictions on social contact are lifted in England. There are now no limits on how many people can meet or attend events; nightclubs reopened at midnight; and table service will not be necessary in pubs and restaurants. Face coverings will be recommended in some spaces, but not required by law. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said government experts had recommended that only some under-18s be vaccinated. The prime minister is due to hold a news conference at 17:00 BST via video link as he, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating - amid warnings that cases of Covid will surge. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi defended the U-turn which saw the prime minister and chancellor self-isolating, after initially saying they would take part in a pilot programme to take daily tests instead. Mr Zahawi insisted that Mr Johnson only ""considered"" joining the pilot scheme, adding: ""No one is taking anyone for fools."" How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? Nightclubs reopen at midnight to new challenges Limited recommendation for under-18 Covid jabs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""chaos, confusion and cronyism"", with the prime minister and chancellor undermining the self-isolation rules at a critical moment. He saida ""reckless free-for-all"" now risked plunging the country back into restrictions. ""The government has once again lost control of the virus. They need to think again on their reckless plan before it's too late,"" he said. Some scientists are predicting that UK infections - currently at about 50,000 a day - could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer. But with more than 68% of UK adults fully vaccinated, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in earlier peaks. In avideo posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon,,externalthe prime minister said now was the ""right moment"" to move to the final stage of England's roadmap out of lockdown. ""If we don't do it now we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it?"" he said, adding that the virus would have the ""advantage of the cold weather"" in autumn and winter. ""But we've got to do it cautiously. We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer: Johnson and Sunak changed isolation decision because they'd been ""busted"" Nadhim Zahawi said 90% of the most vulnerable had been vaccinated and it was right for people to take ""personal and corporate responsibility"" over measures such as wearing masks. ""We're doing the right thing to get as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible,"" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that the end of the school term would reduce the spread of the virus. He also said he had received the recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about vaccinating children aged 12 to 17 and would make a statement to Parliament on Monday afternoon. The committee has recommendedgiving the vaccine to children with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, children who live with someone vulnerable and those who are close to turning 18, he said. This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy their first night out in 16 months As restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs - and large events - will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated, have natural immunity from infection or have a recent negative test. At Fibre in Leeds, owner Terry George said several customers were unvaccinated or had only had one jab so far. He added the government had not provided the tools to scan for vaccination status. While some clubgoers said they were a little nervous, most were overjoyed. ""It's been literally the best night of our lives. We've been waiting for this since we turned 18. This has been like life has come back to normal all of a sudden,"" said Mollie, 20. By Hannah Morrison, BBC Newsbeat at Fibre nightclub in Leeds The countdown began, midnight struck, confetti cannons went off and the queue erupted into cheers and screams of joy. Then the doors opened and hundreds of people poured into Fibre - a nightclub in the centre of Leeds. No proof of a negative test required, no Covid passports needed here, just the option of hand sanitiser on the door. It was straight onto the dance floor for most people; arms in the air singing along to the DJ's carefully selected first track - Ultra Nate's Free. No-one was wearing masks and it felt like everything was normal again. No-one wanted to talk about rising cases of coronavirus or the risks - they just wanted to dance. And for the first time in 16 months they could. UK-wideguidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed.Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus. As the legal requirement for masks ended, signs at Manchester Piccadilly station urged travellers to continue wearing them, but several people declined. England's nationwide mask requirement will end, although face coverings are still recommended Mark Dawson, on his way to Scunthorpe for work, said: ""I'll do what the government tells me to do but if they say I don't have to, I won't."" Transport for London said it was seeing 85% of passengers wearing masks across its network and there had been no surge in commuters returning to the office. by Harry Low at Farringdon station Confusion was the word on almost everybody's lips inthe first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced. Around three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. As passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. Christopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. ""The whole island should be under the same rules,"" he said. According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, almost two-thirds of adults across Great Britain intend to continue wearing masks in shops and on public transport, following England's lifting of legal restrictions. Scotland also eased restrictions on Monday - with pubs and restaurants able to open until midnight. However, limits on group meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed, and face coverings will still be mandatory. Restrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July. Meanwhile, the surge in infections - with 48,161 cases reported on Sunday and more than 50,000 on Saturday - has raised concerns about health impacts and the number of people self-isolating. Contact tracing and self-isolation requirements remain in place. Supermarket Iceland and pub company Greene King are the latest businesses toshut some of their sites because too many staff had received alerts to self-isolateby the NHS Covid app for England and Wales. Recent figures show that more than half a million alerts were sent out in the first week of July, whileabsences from schoolhave also surged. Some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in Englandwill be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? An announcement by the health secretary on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus sentMr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak into self-isolation. No 10 initially said they would not have to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing - sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining. On Monday, Mr Zahawi said Downing Street and the Cabinet Office would no longer be part of the pilot scheme. But he said he was ""very much briefed"" that Transport for London, Network Rail and Heathrow had been part of the pilot, despite TfL saying they had been waiting to hear more about it from the government.

"Amanda Harris is using a wheelchair, trike, and crutches to navigate the path A lack of information about disabled access at some of Wales' tourism destinations is a ""restriction on freedom"", says a campaign group. Disability Wales said some locations were seen as no-go areas for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues. The problem has been highlighted by one partially paralysed woman, who is attempting to navigate the Wales Coastal Path. Amanda Harris has started working with path teams to identify improvements. The 47-year-old was badly injured in a cycling accident seven years ago. She has become determined to complete the 870-mile (1,400km) coastal challenge, using a wheelchair, trike, and crutches when necessary. The man who sold his house to trek Wales Runner beats Wales Coast Path record ""A few years ago, after my injury I thought perhaps I wouldn't be able to get out and explore these places,"" said Ms Harris, who lives in Rhondda Cynon Taf. A view over the beach at Llangrannog, Ceredigion, from the Wales Coast Path Her injury means she can only walk for short distances and she uses a wheelchair. ""It is all about improving information. There is a lack of information at the moment,"" she said. ""I've been relying on people to tell me what's accessible and what's not. ""And that's quite hard because I don't know if it's accessible for me. ""Every mobility problem is different, so what someone sees is accessible might not be to me. ""So, it's about getting that information out there so people can see what the terrain is like and make a decision for themselves."" Amanda Harris has completed 50 miles so far on the Wales Coastal Path Miranda Evans, policy and programmes manager at Disability Wales, said the issue ""takes away disabled people's freedom"". ""There needs to be a solution that doesn't restrict disabled people's access, because it also affects parents, carers and other family members,"" she said. ""On certain beauty spots, and along the coastal path, disabled people might have to turn around and go home because they can't progress on their routes. ""It destroys the experience and knocks people's confidence, and they're not likely to venture that far afield again because it's very restrictive."" Plan to create 'Europe's longest walking tunnel' Barefoot walker conquers Lake District peaks challenge The campaign group said it wanted better information online ""at our fingertips"". Tricia Cottnam is the officer for the south Wales section of the coastal path which covers the route between Gower in the west and Chepstow in the east. ""What we are trying to do is get as many people as possible to use the path,"" she said. ""There are going to be limitations because of its very nature."" Part of the Wales Coast Path at Overton on the Gower Peninsula Opened in 2012, the path became the first in the world to stretch the length of entire nation's coast from the Dee estuary in Flintshire, to the Severn estuary in Monmouthshire. ""You will come across rocky surfaces on cliffs, steep gradients and sand dunes but that's the nature and the beauty of the coast path,"" said Ms Cottnam. ""But there are small changes we can make, where we can explain about the gradients, explain about the type of surface there might be, what type of gates or stiles are on parts of the path, so people can decide whether to make that journey or not. ""And it's all about description and not prescription. It can't be one size fits all. We must be flexible."" For Ms Harris, a former patient at Cardiff's Rookwood Hospital, the challenge of the path is proving harder than she expected. She has completed 50 miles so far (80km), and has been raising money for Horatio's Garden, which creates gardens in NHS spinal injury centres, and the Rookwood Spur charity. The money will provide a tranquil space for spinal injury patients at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, which is where the new Welsh Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Centre is being located, to replace facilities at the Rookwood site. Family designs disability-friendly campervan What new codes in supermarkets mean ""There's already areas which I think could be improved such as access alongside stiles and dropped curbs in some places, and I've already fed that information back to Wales Coast Path,"" said Ms Harris. ""I know certain areas in the Gower, Pembrokeshire, LlÅ·n Peninsula, aren't going to be accessible for me but I have a team of helpers who will do these parts I can't do. ""It's going to be a great journey. ""I'm loving that I'm finding places that are accessible and getting that information out there and improving the situation for a lot of people.""

"Rights activists, journalists and lawyers around the world have been targeted with phone malware sold to authoritarian governments by an Israeli surveillance firm, media reports say. They are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of the company, NSO Group, leaked to major news outlets. It was not clear where the list came from - or how many phones had actually been hacked. NSO denies any wrongdoing. It says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. It said the original investigation which led to the reports, by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International, was ""full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories"". But it added that it would ""continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action"". The allegations about use of the software, known as Pegasus, were carried on Sunday by the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde and 14 other media organisations around the world. Pegasus infects iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. Media outlets working on the investigation said they had identified more than 1,000 people spanning over 50 countries whose numbers were on the list. They include politicians and heads of state, business executives, activists, and several Arab royal family members. More than 180 journalists were also found to be on the list, from organisations including CNN, the New York Times and Al Jazeera. Who are the alleged victims of Pegasus spyware? Many of the numbers were clustered in 10 countries:Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabiaand theUnited Arab Emirates, according to the reports. When contacted by the outlets involved in the investigation, spokespeople for these countries either denied that Pegasus was used or denied that they had abused their powers of surveillance. It was not clear how many of the devices on the list had actually been targeted, but forensic analysis of 37 of the phones showed there had been ""attempted and successful"" hacks, the Washington Post reported. This included people close toSaudijournalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in October 2018 while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. His body was then dismembered. The investigation found that spyware was installed on his fiancÃ©e's phone days after his murder, and that his wife's phone was targeted with spyware between September 2017 and April 2018. This video can not be played Whatâs it like to have spyware on your phone? The NSO Group said its technology was ""not associated in any way with the heinous murder"". The phone ofMexicanjournalist Cecilio Pineda Birto also appeared twice on the list, including in the month before he was murdered, the investigation found. His phone disappeared from the scene of the murder so a forensic examination was not possible. NSO said that even if his phone was targeted, that did not mean that data collected was connected with his murder. The phones of twoHungarianinvestigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were found to have been successfully infected with the spyware. Mr Panyi told Forbidden stories that learning of the hack was ""devastating"". ""There are some people in this country who consider a regular journalist as dangerous as someone suspected of terrorism,"" he said. The Hungarian government was ""not aware of any alleged data collection"", a spokesperson told the Guardian. InIndia, more than 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and two ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government werereported to be on the list. This included thekey opposition figure Rahul Gandhi,with two mobile phone numbers belonging to him found in the list. Mr Gandhi no longer has the devices so it was not possible to analyse them to determine if he had been hacked. India's government has denied using unauthorised surveillance. More details about who has been targeted are expected to be released in the coming days. WhatsApp sued NSO in 2019, alleging the company was behind cyber-attacks on 1,400 mobile phones involving Pegasus. At the time, NSO denied any wrongdoing, but the company has been banned from using WhatsApp. The allegations here are not new. What is new is the scale of the targeting of innocent people that's allegedly taking place. Nearly 200 reporters from 21 countries have their phone numbers on this list, and more names of high-profile public figures are expected to be revealed. There are plenty of unknowns in these allegations - including where the list comes from and how many of the phone numbers were actively targeted with spyware. NSO Group has once again come out swinging and denies all accusations. However, it's a blow for the company, which is actively trying to reform its reputation. Only two weeks ago it released its first ""transparency report"" detailing human right policies and pledges. Amnesty International brushed the 32-page document off as a ""sales brochure"". These latest allegations will do further damage to its image, but they won't hurt the company financially. There are very few private companies able to produce the sort of invasive spy tools that NSO sells, and clearly the largely unregulated market for the software is booming.

"This video can not be played Carlos Ghosn talks to BBC business editor Simon Jack An American father and son have been sentenced for their role in ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn's escape from Japan in 2019. The Tokyo court sentenced US Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor to two years in prison. His son Peter was handed a term of one year and eight months. The pair were extradited from the US over claims they smuggled Mr Ghosn out of Japan in a luggage box on a private jet as he awaited trial. Japanese prosecutors had been seeking prison terms of two years and 10 months for Michael Taylor and two years and six months for Peter. They were accused of orchestrating Mr Ghosn's escape to Lebanon from western Japan's Kansai airport in December 2019 and receiving $1.3m (Â£950,000) for their services. Both had earlier pleaded guilty to the charges and said that they regretted their actions. The fall of the god of cars Private security specialist Michael Taylor and his son Peter fought a months-long battle to avoid extradition over the case,before the US Supreme Court handed them over to the Japanese authorities in March. The former Nissan boss is now an international fugitive living in his childhood home of Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan. Mr Ghosn was on bail while awaiting trial on four counts of financial misconduct, which he denies, when he managed to slip past authorities in a case and onto a private jet, the court heard. US prosecutors called his escape ""one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history"". Michael Taylor and his son Peter posed as musicians to help Carlos Ghosn escape After his arrival in Lebanon, Mr Ghosn said he was a ""hostage"" in Japan, left with a choice between dying there or running. A Turkish court convicted an executive of Turkish jet company MNG and two pilots over their role in flying him out of Japan. Mr Ghosn was first arrested on charges of financial misconduct in November 2018 for allegedly under-reporting his pay package for the five years to 2015. In an exclusive interview with the BBC broadcast earlier this month, Mr Ghosn told of how he disguised himself to slip unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, why a large music equipment box was chosen to smuggle him out of Japan and the elation he felt when he finally landed in his native Lebanon.

"Some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to carry on working if exposed to someone with Covid, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages. Staff, including social care, will be exempted from isolating in ""exceptional circumstances"", when absences could lead to a ""significant risk of harm"". They will need to show a negative PCR test and take daily lateral flow tests. It comes amid a surge in cases and a rise in people told to self-isolate. More than 500,000 alerts telling people to quarantinewere sent by the NHS Covid-19 appin England and Wales in the first week of July, withsupermarkets among the latest businessesto say they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff. Those ""pinged"" by the app are advised to self-isolate for 10 days, but those contacted by NHS Test and Trace in England via text, email or phone can be fined if they do not self-isolate. PM urges caution as Covid rules ease in England NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets What's happening with the self-isolation rules? The Department of Health and Social Care says the measure is being introduced to ""alleviate pressure on NHS and social care services"". The exemption will apply to both staff who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace and those advised to self-isolate by the app. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""As we learn to live with this virus, it's important that we ensure frontline staff can keep providing the best possible care and support to people up and down the country. ""These new rules will fortify our collective defences against this awful virus, by allowing fully vaccinated frontline NHS and social care staff to continue to work when needed."" The qualifying criteria will be determined on a case-by-case basis following a risk assessment, the government said. Dr Jenny Harries, UK Health Security Agency chief executive, said guidance had been issued for situations ""where there is a significant risk to health or safety resulting from staff absence or a critical service cannot run"".

"Oil producing nations have agreed to increase their output, with the aim of reducing prices and easing pressure on the world economy. The Opec cartel and partners such as Russia will boost supply from August after prices climbed to two-and-half-year highs during the pandemic. The move should have an impact on petrol prices at the pump, which have also rocketed. The price of Brent crude oil is up 43% this year to almost $74 a barrel. Last year, Opec and its partners cut production by a record 10 million barrels per day (bpd) amid a pandemic-induced slump in demand and collapsing prices. However, this year the price of oil has surged as economies have reopened, contributing to rising inflation in some countries and threatening to put the brakes on the global recovery. The growing rivalry that's pushing up oil prices Oil prices climb back to pre-pandemic levels Oil producers have been seeking to ease the cuts, but a row between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates threatened to derail the plans earlier in July. Abu Dhabi had blocked a proposal by Riyadh and Moscow to extend output curbs to 2022 after they rejected its demand to produce more oil. The unusually public dispute between the close allies had raised fears about the stability of the ""Opec +"" cartel, which controls more than 50% of the world's oil supplies. Under the new deal, Opec and partners have agreed to increase supply by a further two million barrels per day from August until December 2021 to help stabilise the market. Higher output quotas have also been agreed for several members from May 2022, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and Iraq. The cartel said it would phase out by September 2022 oil production cuts that were brought in last year. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told public television channel Rossia 24 that the members had been ""constructive"" and found ""consensus"". ""The pandemic is not yet overcome, but we are seeing that thanks to vaccination all over the world, demand for our production is recovering as is the use of cars and air planes,"" he said. ""It is therefore very important for us to fulfil our responsibilities and allow a recovery of the world economy.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended lifting nearly all of England's Covid restrictions despite rising cases, saying: ""If not now, when?"" There are no limits on how many people can meet, the 1m-plus distancing rule is over and face coverings are optional But only the fully vaccinated will be allowed to enter nightclubs and other big events by end of September, PM says The sector has reacted with anger, with Michael Kill, of the Night Time Industries Association, calling it ""an absolute shambles"" Stock markets across UK, Europe and US dropped sharply on fears rising cases will hamper economic recovery The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning Americans against travelling to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says lifting all coronavirus restrictions is ""reckless"" Children over 12 at higher risk of getting ill with Covid will be offered the jab So will some healthy children over 12 who live with vulnerable people and those on the cusp of turning 18 In Scotland, rules are also changing, with looser limits on indoor gatherings, but masks will remain compulsory in shops and on public transport There have been a further 39,950 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in UK and 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Mr Johnson, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating Edited by Claire Heald, Martha Buckley and Vanessa Barford It's been a busy day of coronavirus news and we're getting ready to head off for the evening. Before we do, here's what you need to know:         The night time industry has been ""taken by surprise"" by the announcement that it will become a requirement to be fully vaccinated in order to attend  clubs and other crowded venues in England, says Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. He says: ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to. Surely these answers should have been given at the same time as this announcement."" He continues: ""Where does this leave festivals or live music events
catering specifically for teenagers or children who aren't being
vaccinated? Does this now mean young people, who have already suffered hugely
during this pandemic, now won't be able to experience the thrill of seeing
their favourite artist on stage? ""With this one move, the Government
appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" He adds that there are ""questions over how these checks will be enforced"" and about the financial impact of nightclubs competing with pubs and bars without such restrictions. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place,"" he adds. Small music clubs should be treated the same as similar-sized bars and clubs when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification, the boss of music industry body Live has said. Greg Parmley was reacting to the announcement that people in Englandwill need to be fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubsand other venues with large crowds from the end of September. ""The government has had several different positions on Covid certification in the last six months and we will need to see more detail before we can understand the full impact for the live music industry,"" he says. ""Many festivals and large venues are already adopting some level of Covid certification, and as responsible event organisers, will continue to do so."" But he adds: ""What we are absolutely clear about, however, is that venues such as small music clubs should not be treated any differently to other similar-sized hospitality businesses such as bars and restaurants when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification."" It may have been the day that most Covid restrictions were lifted in England, but many people have remained wary. Andy Walsh runs a bakery and
coffee shop in the Cumbria market town of Cockermouth. He says businesses in
the area have been very cautious about lifting remaining restrictions. ""I donât know a single shop
in Cockermouth thatâs relaxed its Covid measures today,"" he says. ""Weâll still
have screens up, mask wearing, and social distancing in our bakery. Weâve had
no negative feedback about it from customers. ""If the government opens things
up, then we all have to take responsibility for ourselves."" It's been a difficult two
weeks for Andyâs business. Half of his staff have been self-isolating at home
after they were pinged by the NHS app. The rest of his team have been working
extra hours to keep things going. Itâs a blow for an area that
relies on hospitality and tourism. Walsh says: ""Weâre a resilient town and
have dealt with massive floods over the past 15 years. But this is incredibly
challenging."" The town has had to cope with floods, most notably in 2009,when unprecedented rainfall devastated the area. Tarah WelshBBC London This video can not be played Small businesses were some of the hardest hit by lockdown restrictions, so market traders Russell Cox and Joan Thompson were very happy to see restrictions lifted in the Stratford Centre in east London today. Joan, who runs a small jewellery stall, says it's good to see people again but she hopes they will be cautious about gathering in large groups.   Sark, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands, has its first known case of coronavirus. The person was already in self-isolation before testing positive for Covid-19 over the weekend. The individual, who travelled to Sark, has had no contact with others and poses a minimal risk to the island, officials say. A States of Guernsey statement reads: ""The person was a traveller and tested negative on arrival. ""They later developed symptoms while in self-isolation and subsequently tested positive. ""Initial contact tracing has established that the individual has no contacts and no other individuals are being required to self-isolate as a result of this case."" You can read the full story here. Adults who have been fully vaccinated through the NHS now don't need to self-isolate when they return from most amber-list countries. Children also don't have to quarantine. But each country has its own rules to follow - both at the border and once you make it to your hotel, villa or campsite. Some of the key rules in place in seven destinations popular with UK holidaymakersare set out here. And you can read more broadly aboutthe rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries here. But remember, rules can change quickly, so it's important to check theForeign Office guidance,externaland government and tourist websites for your destination. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says Covid passports are a ""hammer blow on a day when nightclubs, a sector that has been closed by the government for 16 months, were finally given hope that they could start to trade viably and make progress towards rebuilding and paying off accrued debts"". She says the proof of vaccination is ""a costly burden that runs the risk of creating flashpoints between staff and customers, as well as raising potential issues with equalities legislation and the handling of customer data"". She says ministers asked the sector just last week to work with them on a voluntary scheme, so this new policy is ""devastating and risks hitting these fragile businesses and derailing their recovery and costing thousands of jobs"".  Most legal restrictions on social contact have been lifted in England. There are no longer limits on how many people can meet indoors and nightclubs have reopened. The lifting of restrictions comes as cases and hospitalisations due to Covid are rising. Patients at a hospital in Nottingham have urged the public to ""be careful"" as the changes come into place. This video can not be played Covid patients urge public to ""be careful"" as restrictions ease Nichola MandilJuba The health authorities in South Sudan say they have closed all Covid-19 vaccination centres after running out of jabs. The country received 132,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through the Covax delivery scheme but 72,000 were donated to neighbouring Kenya over concerns they would expire before use. South Sudan had a slow vaccination rollout and the ministry says the doses that remained were used to vaccinate more than 50,000 people with a first dose and 4,000 with a second dose. ""We have deployed successfully 95% of the 60,000 doses that remained with us, with a wastage of about 4%, and this is within acceptable range,"" Dr John Rumunu Pasquale, a director-general in the health ministry said. ""Now all our centres have closed,"" he added. He said that three Covid-19 variants of concern were circulating in South Sudan â the Alpha, Delta and Beta variants. Conservative backbencher, David Davis, is making his feelings clear about the new rules for nightclubs and crowded venues from September. Writing on Twitter, he says it is ""difficult to see how the government has properly tested the science or practicality of this"", adding, ""It is astonishing they are excluding test status."" He adds, ""Vaccination is sensible. But is entirely wrong to force and coerce people in to having them."" BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Louise Holly owns nightclub Mash in Cambridge and is a director of Chalk in Brighton. Both venues are opening tonight for the first time and have sold out. Speaking before the government's surprise announcement about clubs needing to ask customers for Covid passports from the end of September, Louise said she was ""really excited"" to be reopening after 16 months of closure. ""We will be trying to be extra-vigilant. We've spent an awful lot of money on our air conditioning, we've got hand sanitising points in the venue. We're just really looking forward to it."" Louise said her father was in intensive care for a month with coronavirus so she was ""really mindful of the risks"". ""It's going to be a really interesting night from all perspectives to see how it goes."" The
MP Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative
backbenchers, is critical of the plan to bring in proof of
vaccination for nightclubs and other crowded venues from the end of September. Speaking
in the Commons he says it is effectively moving to a situation of compulsory vaccination. He's calling on ministers  to bring forward the evidence for the policy ahead of any vote because he says he does not think the evidence from pilot schemes supports the idea.   The latest UK Covid data came through not long before the briefing and our Visual and Data Journalism Team have been busy updating our graphics. A further 39,950 cases have been reported, and another 19 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The average number of confirmed cases over the past seven days is 46,024. According tothe government's coronavirus dashboard,external, 87.9% of adults have had their first dose of a vaccine and 68.5% have had two doses. Fewer people are being admitted to hospital than last autumn but that number is rising. Nightclub owners are reacting angrily to news that Covid passports will be made mandatory in their venues from the end of September. Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time
Industries Association, says so-called ""freedom day"" for night clubs ""lasted
around 17 hours"" and the situation is ""an absolute shambles"". He said only a week ago Health Secretary Sajid Javid said vaccine passports would not be compulsory. And he says night clubs that have been planning for
reopening for months will now have to make more changes to the way they operate. 80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to
implement Covid passports, he adds, because they are worrying it will be hard to enforce and put customers off going clubbing spontaneously. The new rules put them ""at a
competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that arenât subject to the same
restrictions and yet provide similar environments"" he adds. âThe governmentâs own report into vaccine passports found they were more
trouble than theyâre worth â so what could possibly explain the about-turn,
just as millions across the UK experience their first taste of a night out in a
year and a halfâ¦?â Amy GladwellBBC News Online Thousands of holidaymakers are in
Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall - one of the countyâs busiest resorts. Louis Gardner, mayor of Newquay,
says many businesses are desperate to reopen fully, but there is a
""completely opposing section"" of the town that is ""very
nervous"". Nick Hayman, partner at the
Fistral Beach Bar overlooking the townâs biggest beach, says they are braced
for a busy day. He
says almost a third of the bar's 60-strong workforce are off at any one time
having been ""pinged"" by the NHS Test and Trace service. ""It's
really frustrating as we've got customers down here and we can't give them
proper service,"" he says. Danny Mayer, 41, and Heather Wright, 29, are on holiday with their son Jacob, eight, from Dundee, Scotland. They say they are ""laid back"" about Covid as they are fully vaccinated and are already enjoying not wearing masks. But Leonard and Doreen Cross, both in their late 80s, say the government has been âtoo hastyâ in ditching restrictions. Leonard Cross, who lives in Newquay with his wife, says: âBecause the Delta variant is so prevalent I think it is premature. If another variant comes along, goodness knows where we go from there.â Analysis Helen CattPolitical correspondent This was quite a news-packed briefing. There was a pretty bullish defence of the decision to lift restrictions in England at this point from both the prime minister and Jonathan Van Tam, who talked about this as being the ""sweet spot"". Boris Johnson also, as expected, stressed the importance of self-isolation with a statistic that I'm not sure we've heard before about close contacts being five times more likely to be infected. But less than 24 hours after restrictions lifted there was also a threat of a return of more rules with a ""plan"" to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs and other crowded spaces from the end of September. That's likely to cause a lot more discussion and is not quite the message that perhaps many were expecting today.  A sharp rise in Covid Delta variant cases in Israel shows the need for caution when ending restrictions, says Dr Asher Salmon, deputy director general of the country's health ministry. Israel had led the way with its vaccine programme and was able to lift many restrictions but there is now a surge in new cases. Dr Salmon toldBBC World Newsthat Israel was now considering what to do next. He thought it was better to take slower action rather than having to suddenly lift and then impose restrictions. ""Our main lesson is first be humble and then be very cautious,"" he said. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister says she is ""quite disturbed"" by some of the scenes in England following a relaxation of coronavirus regulations. Michelle O'Neill says Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to lifting all legal restrictions is""reckless"". She says: ""This isn't England, we have always set our own path throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so. ""I would be quite disturbed by some of the imagery which I've witnessed in the last 24 hours - that includes people getting together whenever cases are clearly on the rise."" O'Neill says she expects to receive advice from the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser on whether some restrictions can be lifted on 26 July and says any decisions will be ratified at Thursdays' Executive. ""I am yet to see that information so I can't say definitively around what will happen next,"" she says. ""It's very clear, and people are alarmed again. People are worried about the rising cases so need to be very careful to mind themselves and mind others around them."" Stock markets across the UK, Europe and the US have dropped sharply amid fears that rising numbers of Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. London's FTSE 100fell 2.6% to below the 7,000 level, led by broadcaster ITV and British Airways-owner IAG. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by more than 2% while major share indexes in France and Germany also fell. In England, most remaining Covid restrictions were lifted on Monday. However, new cases are continuing to rise in several countries fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus. Read our full story Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers cheer on their first night out in 16 months Nightclubs in England have reopened but there's a warning the industry has been ""decimated"". Club owners say ministers ""just don't care"" about the sector and figures given to Radio 1 Newsbeat by UK Hospitality show a quarter have closed in the past six years. Its records show there were 1,694 in 2015 and 1,203 in February this year. The government says it has done ""everything it can"" to support the industry. In 2015half had closedin the previous decade and experts warn many have been left in a limbo by delays to ending lockdown. ""Many have closed but have been in a hibernation state,"" says Kate Nicholls from the trade body. ""They have survived the black swan of Covid but have still got the recovery to overcome and the level of debt businesses will exit with will mean many will fall over in the next two years."" Hundreds of people turned out at Fibre in Leeds for their first club night out since the start of the pandemic ""It's a shame the government doesn't understand that we are Â£30bn industry,"" says Simeon Aldred from, one of the biggest venues in the country, Printworks London. ""I don't think we are forgotten, they just don't care,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""It's been exhausting with the government saying start, now stop, now start, now stop and every time that happens we lose tens of millions of pounds."" Big name DJs like Jax Jones say they feel abandoned ""My life in the space of 24 hours came to a halt,"" Jax Jones tell Newsbeat from his recording studio. ""It feels like we are second class citizens, we provide a big revenue for the government and we are a big cultural hub for this country. ""Our sound is recognised around the world and I just don't think our leaders give it the respect it deserves. ""We were first to close and last to open, our leaders are so out of touch."" There's a concern that the past 18 months will have an impact on new talent coming through ""A lot of people's mental health has been affected massively,"" is the worry for Radio 1 DJ Arielle Free. ""It's not all about getting mashed up with your mates, it's pure escapism."" Club owners and promoters say lockdown has pushed them and their finances to the edge. Take the Welly club in Hull for example, it went out of business after more than a hundred years in July 2020. ""My bank manager thinks it's madness to buy this place"" says Aaron Mellor owner of Tokyo Industries which owns a chain of venues across the North of England. ""We're humans and we need this kind of social interaction."" He doesn't think the government values his type of venue. Hacienda nightclub in 1990 ""They're stuck in a world of the 1990s. We're generating new music, creative talent and music is one of our last great exports."" ""We're also a viable commercial business, one pound in every three that goes over the bar goes to the government and we employ a lot of young people."" The government says it's spent billions supporting the cultural industry. ""Nightclubs still have access to our unprecedented Â£352bn package of support, including the furlough scheme, loan guarantees, protection from eviction, Restart Grants worth up to Â£18,000 and business rates relief,"" a Government spokesperson said. ""Thanks to the success of our vaccination programme, all remaining businesses will be able to reopen, such as nightclubs, at Step 4."" After all the gloom there is hope according to DJ and promoter Yousef who put on the government test events in Liverpool. ""The appetite from the raver is unprecedented. They want to get out and party which means they want to buy tickets. So hopefully that's the springboard required."" ""It's going to be a big year for dance music in general.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged caution as most legal restrictions on social contact are lifted in England. There are now no limits on how many people can meet or attend events; nightclubs reopened at midnight; and table service will not be necessary in pubs and restaurants. Face coverings will be recommended in some spaces, but not required by law. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said government experts had recommended that only some under-18s be vaccinated. The prime minister is due to hold a news conference at 17:00 BST via video link as he, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating - amid warnings that cases of Covid will surge. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi defended the U-turn which saw the prime minister and chancellor self-isolating, after initially saying they would take part in a pilot programme to take daily tests instead. Mr Zahawi insisted that Mr Johnson only ""considered"" joining the pilot scheme, adding: ""No one is taking anyone for fools."" How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? Nightclubs reopen at midnight to new challenges Limited recommendation for under-18 Covid jabs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""chaos, confusion and cronyism"", with the prime minister and chancellor undermining the self-isolation rules at a critical moment. He saida ""reckless free-for-all"" now risked plunging the country back into restrictions. ""The government has once again lost control of the virus. They need to think again on their reckless plan before it's too late,"" he said. Some scientists are predicting that UK infections - currently at about 50,000 a day - could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer. But with more than 68% of UK adults fully vaccinated, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in earlier peaks. In avideo posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon,,externalthe prime minister said now was the ""right moment"" to move to the final stage of England's roadmap out of lockdown. ""If we don't do it now we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it?"" he said, adding that the virus would have the ""advantage of the cold weather"" in autumn and winter. ""But we've got to do it cautiously. We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer: Johnson and Sunak changed isolation decision because they'd been ""busted"" Nadhim Zahawi said 90% of the most vulnerable had been vaccinated and it was right for people to take ""personal and corporate responsibility"" over measures such as wearing masks. ""We're doing the right thing to get as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible,"" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that the end of the school term would reduce the spread of the virus. He also said he had received the recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about vaccinating children aged 12 to 17 and would make a statement to Parliament on Monday afternoon. The committee has recommendedgiving the vaccine to children with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, children who live with someone vulnerable and those who are close to turning 18, he said. This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy their first night out in 16 months As restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs - and large events - will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated, have natural immunity from infection or have a recent negative test. At Fibre in Leeds, owner Terry George said several customers were unvaccinated or had only had one jab so far. He added the government had not provided the tools to scan for vaccination status. While some clubgoers said they were a little nervous, most were overjoyed. ""It's been literally the best night of our lives. We've been waiting for this since we turned 18. This has been like life has come back to normal all of a sudden,"" said Mollie, 20. By Hannah Morrison, BBC Newsbeat at Fibre nightclub in Leeds The countdown began, midnight struck, confetti cannons went off and the queue erupted into cheers and screams of joy. Then the doors opened and hundreds of people poured into Fibre - a nightclub in the centre of Leeds. No proof of a negative test required, no Covid passports needed here, just the option of hand sanitiser on the door. It was straight onto the dance floor for most people; arms in the air singing along to the DJ's carefully selected first track - Ultra Nate's Free. No-one was wearing masks and it felt like everything was normal again. No-one wanted to talk about rising cases of coronavirus or the risks - they just wanted to dance. And for the first time in 16 months they could. UK-wideguidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed.Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus. As the legal requirement for masks ended, signs at Manchester Piccadilly station urged travellers to continue wearing them, but several people declined. England's nationwide mask requirement will end, although face coverings are still recommended Mark Dawson, on his way to Scunthorpe for work, said: ""I'll do what the government tells me to do but if they say I don't have to, I won't."" Transport for London said it was seeing 85% of passengers wearing masks across its network and there had been no surge in commuters returning to the office. by Harry Low at Farringdon station Confusion was the word on almost everybody's lips inthe first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced. Around three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. As passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. Christopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. ""The whole island should be under the same rules,"" he said. According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, almost two-thirds of adults across Great Britain intend to continue wearing masks in shops and on public transport, following England's lifting of legal restrictions. Scotland also eased restrictions on Monday - with pubs and restaurants able to open until midnight. However, limits on group meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed, and face coverings will still be mandatory. Restrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July. Meanwhile, the surge in infections - with 48,161 cases reported on Sunday and more than 50,000 on Saturday - has raised concerns about health impacts and the number of people self-isolating. Contact tracing and self-isolation requirements remain in place. Supermarket Iceland and pub company Greene King are the latest businesses toshut some of their sites because too many staff had received alerts to self-isolateby the NHS Covid app for England and Wales. Recent figures show that more than half a million alerts were sent out in the first week of July, whileabsences from schoolhave also surged. Some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in Englandwill be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? An announcement by the health secretary on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus sentMr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak into self-isolation. No 10 initially said they would not have to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing - sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining. On Monday, Mr Zahawi said Downing Street and the Cabinet Office would no longer be part of the pilot scheme. But he said he was ""very much briefed"" that Transport for London, Network Rail and Heathrow had been part of the pilot, despite TfL saying they had been waiting to hear more about it from the government.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended lifting nearly all of England's Covid restrictions despite rising cases, saying: ""If not now, when?"" There are no limits on how many people can meet, the 1m-plus distancing rule is over and face coverings are optional But only the fully vaccinated will be allowed to enter nightclubs and other big events by end of September, PM says The sector has reacted with anger, with Michael Kill, of the Night Time Industries Association, calling it ""an absolute shambles"" Stock markets across UK, Europe and US dropped sharply on fears rising cases will hamper economic recovery The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning Americans against travelling to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says lifting all coronavirus restrictions is ""reckless"" Children over 12 at higher risk of getting ill with Covid will be offered the jab So will some healthy children over 12 who live with vulnerable people and those on the cusp of turning 18 In Scotland, rules are also changing, with looser limits on indoor gatherings, but masks will remain compulsory in shops and on public transport There have been a further 39,950 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in UK and 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Mr Johnson, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating Edited by Claire Heald, Martha Buckley and Vanessa Barford It's been a busy day of coronavirus news and we're getting ready to head off for the evening. Before we do, here's what you need to know:         The night time industry has been ""taken by surprise"" by the announcement that it will become a requirement to be fully vaccinated in order to attend  clubs and other crowded venues in England, says Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. He says: ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to. Surely these answers should have been given at the same time as this announcement."" He continues: ""Where does this leave festivals or live music events
catering specifically for teenagers or children who aren't being
vaccinated? Does this now mean young people, who have already suffered hugely
during this pandemic, now won't be able to experience the thrill of seeing
their favourite artist on stage? ""With this one move, the Government
appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" He adds that there are ""questions over how these checks will be enforced"" and about the financial impact of nightclubs competing with pubs and bars without such restrictions. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place,"" he adds. Small music clubs should be treated the same as similar-sized bars and clubs when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification, the boss of music industry body Live has said. Greg Parmley was reacting to the announcement that people in Englandwill need to be fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubsand other venues with large crowds from the end of September. ""The government has had several different positions on Covid certification in the last six months and we will need to see more detail before we can understand the full impact for the live music industry,"" he says. ""Many festivals and large venues are already adopting some level of Covid certification, and as responsible event organisers, will continue to do so."" But he adds: ""What we are absolutely clear about, however, is that venues such as small music clubs should not be treated any differently to other similar-sized hospitality businesses such as bars and restaurants when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification."" It may have been the day that most Covid restrictions were lifted in England, but many people have remained wary. Andy Walsh runs a bakery and
coffee shop in the Cumbria market town of Cockermouth. He says businesses in
the area have been very cautious about lifting remaining restrictions. ""I donât know a single shop
in Cockermouth thatâs relaxed its Covid measures today,"" he says. ""Weâll still
have screens up, mask wearing, and social distancing in our bakery. Weâve had
no negative feedback about it from customers. ""If the government opens things
up, then we all have to take responsibility for ourselves."" It's been a difficult two
weeks for Andyâs business. Half of his staff have been self-isolating at home
after they were pinged by the NHS app. The rest of his team have been working
extra hours to keep things going. Itâs a blow for an area that
relies on hospitality and tourism. Walsh says: ""Weâre a resilient town and
have dealt with massive floods over the past 15 years. But this is incredibly
challenging."" The town has had to cope with floods, most notably in 2009,when unprecedented rainfall devastated the area. Tarah WelshBBC London This video can not be played Small businesses were some of the hardest hit by lockdown restrictions, so market traders Russell Cox and Joan Thompson were very happy to see restrictions lifted in the Stratford Centre in east London today. Joan, who runs a small jewellery stall, says it's good to see people again but she hopes they will be cautious about gathering in large groups.   Sark, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands, has its first known case of coronavirus. The person was already in self-isolation before testing positive for Covid-19 over the weekend. The individual, who travelled to Sark, has had no contact with others and poses a minimal risk to the island, officials say. A States of Guernsey statement reads: ""The person was a traveller and tested negative on arrival. ""They later developed symptoms while in self-isolation and subsequently tested positive. ""Initial contact tracing has established that the individual has no contacts and no other individuals are being required to self-isolate as a result of this case."" You can read the full story here. Adults who have been fully vaccinated through the NHS now don't need to self-isolate when they return from most amber-list countries. Children also don't have to quarantine. But each country has its own rules to follow - both at the border and once you make it to your hotel, villa or campsite. Some of the key rules in place in seven destinations popular with UK holidaymakersare set out here. And you can read more broadly aboutthe rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries here. But remember, rules can change quickly, so it's important to check theForeign Office guidance,externaland government and tourist websites for your destination. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says Covid passports are a ""hammer blow on a day when nightclubs, a sector that has been closed by the government for 16 months, were finally given hope that they could start to trade viably and make progress towards rebuilding and paying off accrued debts"". She says the proof of vaccination is ""a costly burden that runs the risk of creating flashpoints between staff and customers, as well as raising potential issues with equalities legislation and the handling of customer data"". She says ministers asked the sector just last week to work with them on a voluntary scheme, so this new policy is ""devastating and risks hitting these fragile businesses and derailing their recovery and costing thousands of jobs"".  Most legal restrictions on social contact have been lifted in England. There are no longer limits on how many people can meet indoors and nightclubs have reopened. The lifting of restrictions comes as cases and hospitalisations due to Covid are rising. Patients at a hospital in Nottingham have urged the public to ""be careful"" as the changes come into place. This video can not be played Covid patients urge public to ""be careful"" as restrictions ease Nichola MandilJuba The health authorities in South Sudan say they have closed all Covid-19 vaccination centres after running out of jabs. The country received 132,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through the Covax delivery scheme but 72,000 were donated to neighbouring Kenya over concerns they would expire before use. South Sudan had a slow vaccination rollout and the ministry says the doses that remained were used to vaccinate more than 50,000 people with a first dose and 4,000 with a second dose. ""We have deployed successfully 95% of the 60,000 doses that remained with us, with a wastage of about 4%, and this is within acceptable range,"" Dr John Rumunu Pasquale, a director-general in the health ministry said. ""Now all our centres have closed,"" he added. He said that three Covid-19 variants of concern were circulating in South Sudan â the Alpha, Delta and Beta variants.

There are now no limits on how many people can meet or attend events; nightclubs reopened at midnight; and table service will not be necessary in pubs and restaurants. Face coverings will be recommended in some spaces, but not required by law. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said government experts had recommended that only some under-18s be vaccinated. The prime minister is due to hold a news conference at 17:00 BST via video link as he, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating - amid warnings that cases of Covid will surge. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi defended the U-turn which saw the prime minister and chancellor self-isolating, after initially saying they would take part in a pilot programme to take daily tests instead. Mr Zahawi insisted that Mr Johnson only ""considered"" joining the pilot scheme, adding: ""No one is taking anyone for fools."" How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? Nightclubs reopen at midnight to new challenges Limited recommendation for under-18 Covid jabs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""chaos, confusion and cronyism"", with the prime minister and chancellor undermining the self-isolation rules at a critical moment. He saida ""reckless free-for-all"" now risked plunging the country back into restrictions. ""The government has once again lost control of the virus. They need to think again on their reckless plan before it's too late,"" he said. Some scientists are predicting that UK infections - currently at about 50,000 a day - could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer. But with more than 68% of UK adults fully vaccinated, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in earlier peaks. In avideo posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon,,externalthe prime minister said now was the ""right moment"" to move to the final stage of England's roadmap out of lockdown. ""If we don't do it now we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it?"" he said, adding that the virus would have the ""advantage of the cold weather"" in autumn and winter. ""But we've got to do it cautiously. We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer: Johnson and Sunak changed isolation decision because they'd been ""busted"" Nadhim Zahawi said 90% of the most vulnerable had been vaccinated and it was right for people to take ""personal and corporate responsibility"" over measures such as wearing masks. ""We're doing the right thing to get as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible,"" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that the end of the school term would reduce the spread of the virus. He also said he had received the recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about vaccinating children aged 12 to 17 and would make a statement to Parliament on Monday afternoon. The committee has recommendedgiving the vaccine to children with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, children who live with someone vulnerable and those who are close to turning 18, he said. This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy their first night out in 16 months As restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs - and large events - will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated, have natural immunity from infection or have a recent negative test. At Fibre in Leeds, owner Terry George said several customers were unvaccinated or had only had one jab so far. He added the government had not provided the tools to scan for vaccination status. While some clubgoers said they were a little nervous, most were overjoyed. ""It's been literally the best night of our lives. We've been waiting for this since we turned 18. This has been like life has come back to normal all of a sudden,"" said Mollie, 20. By Hannah Morrison, BBC Newsbeat at Fibre nightclub in Leeds The countdown began, midnight struck, confetti cannons went off and the queue erupted into cheers and screams of joy. Then the doors opened and hundreds of people poured into Fibre - a nightclub in the centre of Leeds. No proof of a negative test required, no Covid passports needed here, just the option of hand sanitiser on the door. It was straight onto the dance floor for most people; arms in the air singing along to the DJ's carefully selected first track - Ultra Nate's Free. No-one was wearing masks and it felt like everything was normal again. No-one wanted to talk about rising cases of coronavirus or the risks - they just wanted to dance. And for the first time in 16 months they could. UK-wideguidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed.Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus. As the legal requirement for masks ended, signs at Manchester Piccadilly station urged travellers to continue wearing them, but several people declined. England's nationwide mask requirement will end, although face coverings are still recommended Mark Dawson, on his way to Scunthorpe for work, said: ""I'll do what the government tells me to do but if they say I don't have to, I won't."" Transport for London said it was seeing 85% of passengers wearing masks across its network and there had been no surge in commuters returning to the office. by Harry Low at Farringdon station Confusion was the word on almost everybody's lips inthe first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced. Around three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. As passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. Christopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. ""The whole island should be under the same rules,"" he said. According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, almost two-thirds of adults across Great Britain intend to continue wearing masks in shops and on public transport, following England's lifting of legal restrictions. Scotland also eased restrictions on Monday - with pubs and restaurants able to open until midnight. However, limits on group meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed, and face coverings will still be mandatory. Restrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July. Meanwhile, the surge in infections - with 48,161 cases reported on Sunday and more than 50,000 on Saturday - has raised concerns about health impacts and the number of people self-isolating. Contact tracing and self-isolation requirements remain in place. Supermarket Iceland and pub company Greene King are the latest businesses toshut some of their sites because too many staff had received alerts to self-isolateby the NHS Covid app for England and Wales. Recent figures show that more than half a million alerts were sent out in the first week of July, whileabsences from schoolhave also surged. Some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in Englandwill be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? An announcement by the health secretary on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus sentMr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak into self-isolation. No 10 initially said they would not have to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing - sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining. On Monday, Mr Zahawi said Downing Street and the Cabinet Office would no longer be part of the pilot scheme. But he said he was ""very much briefed"" that Transport for London, Network Rail and Heathrow had been part of the pilot, despite TfL saying they had been waiting to hear more about it from the government.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended lifting nearly all of England's Covid restrictions despite rising cases, saying: ""If not now, when?"" There are no limits on how many people can meet, the 1m-plus distancing rule is over and face coverings are optional But only the fully vaccinated will be allowed to enter nightclubs and other big events by end of September, PM says The sector has reacted with anger, with Michael Kill, of the Night Time Industries Association, calling it ""an absolute shambles"" Stock markets across UK, Europe and US dropped sharply on fears rising cases will hamper economic recovery The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning Americans against travelling to the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says lifting all coronavirus restrictions is ""reckless"" Children over 12 at higher risk of getting ill with Covid will be offered the jab So will some healthy children over 12 who live with vulnerable people and those on the cusp of turning 18 In Scotland, rules are also changing, with looser limits on indoor gatherings, but masks will remain compulsory in shops and on public transport There have been a further 39,950 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in UK and 19 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Mr Johnson, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating Edited by Claire Heald, Martha Buckley and Vanessa Barford It's been a busy day of coronavirus news and we're getting ready to head off for the evening. Before we do, here's what you need to know:         The night time industry has been ""taken by surprise"" by the announcement that it will become a requirement to be fully vaccinated in order to attend  clubs and other crowded venues in England, says Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. He says: ""I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I am deeply concerned by the discriminatory nature for those who either can't have the vaccine for medical reasons or age, or who do not want to. Surely these answers should have been given at the same time as this announcement."" He continues: ""Where does this leave festivals or live music events
catering specifically for teenagers or children who aren't being
vaccinated? Does this now mean young people, who have already suffered hugely
during this pandemic, now won't be able to experience the thrill of seeing
their favourite artist on stage? ""With this one move, the Government
appears to have wiped out live gigs for a whole generation."" He adds that there are ""questions over how these checks will be enforced"" and about the financial impact of nightclubs competing with pubs and bars without such restrictions. ""I have been in the nightlife and events industry for over 25 years, but I cannot see any reason why anyone would now want to enter this sector with such financially damaging restrictions in place,"" he adds. Small music clubs should be treated the same as similar-sized bars and clubs when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification, the boss of music industry body Live has said. Greg Parmley was reacting to the announcement that people in Englandwill need to be fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubsand other venues with large crowds from the end of September. ""The government has had several different positions on Covid certification in the last six months and we will need to see more detail before we can understand the full impact for the live music industry,"" he says. ""Many festivals and large venues are already adopting some level of Covid certification, and as responsible event organisers, will continue to do so."" But he adds: ""What we are absolutely clear about, however, is that venues such as small music clubs should not be treated any differently to other similar-sized hospitality businesses such as bars and restaurants when it comes to the need for Covid vaccine certification."" It may have been the day that most Covid restrictions were lifted in England, but many people have remained wary. Andy Walsh runs a bakery and
coffee shop in the Cumbria market town of Cockermouth. He says businesses in
the area have been very cautious about lifting remaining restrictions. ""I donât know a single shop
in Cockermouth thatâs relaxed its Covid measures today,"" he says. ""Weâll still
have screens up, mask wearing, and social distancing in our bakery. Weâve had
no negative feedback about it from customers. ""If the government opens things
up, then we all have to take responsibility for ourselves."" It's been a difficult two
weeks for Andyâs business. Half of his staff have been self-isolating at home
after they were pinged by the NHS app. The rest of his team have been working
extra hours to keep things going. Itâs a blow for an area that
relies on hospitality and tourism. Walsh says: ""Weâre a resilient town and
have dealt with massive floods over the past 15 years. But this is incredibly
challenging."" The town has had to cope with floods, most notably in 2009,when unprecedented rainfall devastated the area. Tarah WelshBBC London This video can not be played Small businesses were some of the hardest hit by lockdown restrictions, so market traders Russell Cox and Joan Thompson were very happy to see restrictions lifted in the Stratford Centre in east London today. Joan, who runs a small jewellery stall, says it's good to see people again but she hopes they will be cautious about gathering in large groups.   Sark, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands, has its first known case of coronavirus. The person was already in self-isolation before testing positive for Covid-19 over the weekend. The individual, who travelled to Sark, has had no contact with others and poses a minimal risk to the island, officials say. A States of Guernsey statement reads: ""The person was a traveller and tested negative on arrival. ""They later developed symptoms while in self-isolation and subsequently tested positive. ""Initial contact tracing has established that the individual has no contacts and no other individuals are being required to self-isolate as a result of this case."" You can read the full story here. Adults who have been fully vaccinated through the NHS now don't need to self-isolate when they return from most amber-list countries. Children also don't have to quarantine. But each country has its own rules to follow - both at the border and once you make it to your hotel, villa or campsite. Some of the key rules in place in seven destinations popular with UK holidaymakersare set out here. And you can read more broadly aboutthe rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries here. But remember, rules can change quickly, so it's important to check theForeign Office guidance,externaland government and tourist websites for your destination. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says Covid passports are a ""hammer blow on a day when nightclubs, a sector that has been closed by the government for 16 months, were finally given hope that they could start to trade viably and make progress towards rebuilding and paying off accrued debts"". She says the proof of vaccination is ""a costly burden that runs the risk of creating flashpoints between staff and customers, as well as raising potential issues with equalities legislation and the handling of customer data"". She says ministers asked the sector just last week to work with them on a voluntary scheme, so this new policy is ""devastating and risks hitting these fragile businesses and derailing their recovery and costing thousands of jobs"".  Most legal restrictions on social contact have been lifted in England. There are no longer limits on how many people can meet indoors and nightclubs have reopened. The lifting of restrictions comes as cases and hospitalisations due to Covid are rising. Patients at a hospital in Nottingham have urged the public to ""be careful"" as the changes come into place. This video can not be played Covid patients urge public to ""be careful"" as restrictions ease Nichola MandilJuba The health authorities in South Sudan say they have closed all Covid-19 vaccination centres after running out of jabs. The country received 132,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through the Covax delivery scheme but 72,000 were donated to neighbouring Kenya over concerns they would expire before use. South Sudan had a slow vaccination rollout and the ministry says the doses that remained were used to vaccinate more than 50,000 people with a first dose and 4,000 with a second dose. ""We have deployed successfully 95% of the 60,000 doses that remained with us, with a wastage of about 4%, and this is within acceptable range,"" Dr John Rumunu Pasquale, a director-general in the health ministry said. ""Now all our centres have closed,"" he added. He said that three Covid-19 variants of concern were circulating in South Sudan â the Alpha, Delta and Beta variants. Conservative backbencher, David Davis, is making his feelings clear about the new rules for nightclubs and crowded venues from September. Writing on Twitter, he says it is ""difficult to see how the government has properly tested the science or practicality of this"", adding, ""It is astonishing they are excluding test status."" He adds, ""Vaccination is sensible. But is entirely wrong to force and coerce people in to having them."" BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Louise Holly owns nightclub Mash in Cambridge and is a director of Chalk in Brighton. Both venues are opening tonight for the first time and have sold out. Speaking before the government's surprise announcement about clubs needing to ask customers for Covid passports from the end of September, Louise said she was ""really excited"" to be reopening after 16 months of closure. ""We will be trying to be extra-vigilant. We've spent an awful lot of money on our air conditioning, we've got hand sanitising points in the venue. We're just really looking forward to it."" Louise said her father was in intensive care for a month with coronavirus so she was ""really mindful of the risks"". ""It's going to be a really interesting night from all perspectives to see how it goes."" The
MP Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative
backbenchers, is critical of the plan to bring in proof of
vaccination for nightclubs and other crowded venues from the end of September. Speaking
in the Commons he says it is effectively moving to a situation of compulsory vaccination. He's calling on ministers  to bring forward the evidence for the policy ahead of any vote because he says he does not think the evidence from pilot schemes supports the idea.   The latest UK Covid data came through not long before the briefing and our Visual and Data Journalism Team have been busy updating our graphics. A further 39,950 cases have been reported, and another 19 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The average number of confirmed cases over the past seven days is 46,024. According tothe government's coronavirus dashboard,external, 87.9% of adults have had their first dose of a vaccine and 68.5% have had two doses. Fewer people are being admitted to hospital than last autumn but that number is rising. Nightclub owners are reacting angrily to news that Covid passports will be made mandatory in their venues from the end of September. Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time
Industries Association, says so-called ""freedom day"" for night clubs ""lasted
around 17 hours"" and the situation is ""an absolute shambles"". He said only a week ago Health Secretary Sajid Javid said vaccine passports would not be compulsory. And he says night clubs that have been planning for
reopening for months will now have to make more changes to the way they operate. 80% of nightclubs have said they do not want to
implement Covid passports, he adds, because they are worrying it will be hard to enforce and put customers off going clubbing spontaneously. The new rules put them ""at a
competitive disadvantage with pubs and bars that arenât subject to the same
restrictions and yet provide similar environments"" he adds. âThe governmentâs own report into vaccine passports found they were more
trouble than theyâre worth â so what could possibly explain the about-turn,
just as millions across the UK experience their first taste of a night out in a
year and a halfâ¦?â Amy GladwellBBC News Online Thousands of holidaymakers are in
Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall - one of the countyâs busiest resorts. Louis Gardner, mayor of Newquay,
says many businesses are desperate to reopen fully, but there is a
""completely opposing section"" of the town that is ""very
nervous"". Nick Hayman, partner at the
Fistral Beach Bar overlooking the townâs biggest beach, says they are braced
for a busy day. He
says almost a third of the bar's 60-strong workforce are off at any one time
having been ""pinged"" by the NHS Test and Trace service. ""It's
really frustrating as we've got customers down here and we can't give them
proper service,"" he says. Danny Mayer, 41, and Heather Wright, 29, are on holiday with their son Jacob, eight, from Dundee, Scotland. They say they are ""laid back"" about Covid as they are fully vaccinated and are already enjoying not wearing masks. But Leonard and Doreen Cross, both in their late 80s, say the government has been âtoo hastyâ in ditching restrictions. Leonard Cross, who lives in Newquay with his wife, says: âBecause the Delta variant is so prevalent I think it is premature. If another variant comes along, goodness knows where we go from there.â Analysis Helen CattPolitical correspondent This was quite a news-packed briefing. There was a pretty bullish defence of the decision to lift restrictions in England at this point from both the prime minister and Jonathan Van Tam, who talked about this as being the ""sweet spot"". Boris Johnson also, as expected, stressed the importance of self-isolation with a statistic that I'm not sure we've heard before about close contacts being five times more likely to be infected. But less than 24 hours after restrictions lifted there was also a threat of a return of more rules with a ""plan"" to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs and other crowded spaces from the end of September. That's likely to cause a lot more discussion and is not quite the message that perhaps many were expecting today.  A sharp rise in Covid Delta variant cases in Israel shows the need for caution when ending restrictions, says Dr Asher Salmon, deputy director general of the country's health ministry. Israel had led the way with its vaccine programme and was able to lift many restrictions but there is now a surge in new cases. Dr Salmon toldBBC World Newsthat Israel was now considering what to do next. He thought it was better to take slower action rather than having to suddenly lift and then impose restrictions. ""Our main lesson is first be humble and then be very cautious,"" he said. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister says she is ""quite disturbed"" by some of the scenes in England following a relaxation of coronavirus regulations. Michelle O'Neill says Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to lifting all legal restrictions is""reckless"". She says: ""This isn't England, we have always set our own path throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so. ""I would be quite disturbed by some of the imagery which I've witnessed in the last 24 hours - that includes people getting together whenever cases are clearly on the rise."" O'Neill says she expects to receive advice from the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser on whether some restrictions can be lifted on 26 July and says any decisions will be ratified at Thursdays' Executive. ""I am yet to see that information so I can't say definitively around what will happen next,"" she says. ""It's very clear, and people are alarmed again. People are worried about the rising cases so need to be very careful to mind themselves and mind others around them."" Stock markets across the UK, Europe and the US have dropped sharply amid fears that rising numbers of Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. London's FTSE 100fell 2.6% to below the 7,000 level, led by broadcaster ITV and British Airways-owner IAG. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by more than 2% while major share indexes in France and Germany also fell. In England, most remaining Covid restrictions were lifted on Monday. However, new cases are continuing to rise in several countries fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus. Read our full story Â© 2025 BBC.

"At Ocado's warehouses, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes. Ocado has cancelled thousands of orders after a fire at a fulfilment centre in south-east London on Friday. The online grocer said the blaze started when three of the robots that help pick its groceries collided at the Erith site. About 800 staff had to be evacuated and firefighters worked through the night to contain the incident. It is the second fire involving robots at Ocado. Its Andover facility burned down in 2019 after an electrical fault. Shares in the company slipped by about 3% in early trade on Monday. Ocado handles up to 150,000 orders a week at the Erith warehouse. The company said the firewould cause ""disruption to operations"",externalbut that it was ""working to restore normal service as soon as possible"". ""We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience. ""We would like to also thank the London Fire Brigade and all the other emergency services for their hard work and professionalism in dealing with this incident."" Ocado was the UK's third largest online grocer last year It said no one had been injured in the fire and all its staff were safe. The damage is limited to a small section of its warehouse, it added, although it could not say when the site would reopen. The retailer has contacted all affected customers, but there was a mixed reaction on social media. One angry customer tweeted: ""I'm sorry that there is a fire and glad that it appears no one is hurt, but why do I have to find out on twitter?"" Robots to take on more supermarket tasks 'Sprinklers turned off' in Ocado warehouse fire She added: ""This is the 3rd or 4th order in a row that has been messed up."" Others expressed support for the firm, with one tweeting: ""Whilst it may be inconvenient, some more compassion for the business and staff affected might be nice!"" Ocado's fulfilment centres are highly automated. At Erith, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes, which are then loaded on to trucks for delivery. However, a fault in a battery charging unit caused a robot to catch light at Ocado's Andover distribution centre in 2019. The site, which processed 30,000 orders a week at the time, burned for four days and was completely destroyed. It has since been rebuilt. This video can not be played Flames and smoke were seen from miles around during the fire in 2019 Ocado, which was the UK's third biggest online grocer last year, has seen huge growth during the pandemic, with sales up 40% in the first three months of the year.

"Rights activists, journalists and lawyers around the world have been targeted with phone malware sold to authoritarian governments by an Israeli surveillance firm, media reports say. They are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of the company, NSO Group, leaked to major news outlets. It was not clear where the list came from - or how many phones had actually been hacked. NSO denies any wrongdoing. It says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. It said the original investigation which led to the reports, by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International, was ""full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories"". But it added that it would ""continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action"". The allegations about use of the software, known as Pegasus, were carried on Sunday by the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde and 14 other media organisations around the world. Pegasus infects iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. Media outlets working on the investigation said they had identified more than 1,000 people spanning over 50 countries whose numbers were on the list. They include politicians and heads of state, business executives, activists, and several Arab royal family members. More than 180 journalists were also found to be on the list, from organisations including CNN, the New York Times and Al Jazeera. Who are the alleged victims of Pegasus spyware? Many of the numbers were clustered in 10 countries:Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabiaand theUnited Arab Emirates, according to the reports. When contacted by the outlets involved in the investigation, spokespeople for these countries either denied that Pegasus was used or denied that they had abused their powers of surveillance. It was not clear how many of the devices on the list had actually been targeted, but forensic analysis of 37 of the phones showed there had been ""attempted and successful"" hacks, the Washington Post reported. This included people close toSaudijournalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in October 2018 while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. His body was then dismembered. The investigation found that spyware was installed on his fiancÃ©e's phone days after his murder, and that his wife's phone was targeted with spyware between September 2017 and April 2018. This video can not be played Whatâs it like to have spyware on your phone? The NSO Group said its technology was ""not associated in any way with the heinous murder"". The phone ofMexicanjournalist Cecilio Pineda Birto also appeared twice on the list, including in the month before he was murdered, the investigation found. His phone disappeared from the scene of the murder so a forensic examination was not possible. NSO said that even if his phone was targeted, that did not mean that data collected was connected with his murder. The phones of twoHungarianinvestigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were found to have been successfully infected with the spyware. Mr Panyi told Forbidden stories that learning of the hack was ""devastating"". ""There are some people in this country who consider a regular journalist as dangerous as someone suspected of terrorism,"" he said. The Hungarian government was ""not aware of any alleged data collection"", a spokesperson told the Guardian. InIndia, more than 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and two ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government werereported to be on the list. This included thekey opposition figure Rahul Gandhi,with two mobile phone numbers belonging to him found in the list. Mr Gandhi no longer has the devices so it was not possible to analyse them to determine if he had been hacked. India's government has denied using unauthorised surveillance. More details about who has been targeted are expected to be released in the coming days. WhatsApp sued NSO in 2019, alleging the company was behind cyber-attacks on 1,400 mobile phones involving Pegasus. At the time, NSO denied any wrongdoing, but the company has been banned from using WhatsApp. The allegations here are not new. What is new is the scale of the targeting of innocent people that's allegedly taking place. Nearly 200 reporters from 21 countries have their phone numbers on this list, and more names of high-profile public figures are expected to be revealed. There are plenty of unknowns in these allegations - including where the list comes from and how many of the phone numbers were actively targeted with spyware. NSO Group has once again come out swinging and denies all accusations. However, it's a blow for the company, which is actively trying to reform its reputation. Only two weeks ago it released its first ""transparency report"" detailing human right policies and pledges. Amnesty International brushed the 32-page document off as a ""sales brochure"". These latest allegations will do further damage to its image, but they won't hurt the company financially. There are very few private companies able to produce the sort of invasive spy tools that NSO sells, and clearly the largely unregulated market for the software is booming.

"One of Aneurin Bevan's slogans - ""We will Tredegarise you"" - is on the wall A building that was pivotal in the formation of the NHS opens to the public later and it is hoped it will help rejuvenate a Blaenau Gwent town. Number 10, The Circle, was home to the Tredegar Medical Aid Society, which was used as a blueprint by Aneurin Bevan when he set up the National Health Service for the UK in 1948. However, the building became derelict. The Coalfields Regeneration Trust bought it in 2019 and hopes it will make Tredegar a ""destination town"". ""This small but important building helped pioneer healthcare as we know it today,"" the trust said. ""The NHS has been vital in the fight against Covid-19 and now more than ever we should celebrate the role a Welsh town played in helping inspire the creation of this vitally important service."" NHS birthplace hospital 'should be knocked down' Tredegar volunteers help hundreds of people Set up in 1890, the Tredegar Medical Aid Society aimed to provide healthcare free at the point of use for coal and iron workers and their families. The original sign for the building will go on display Despite the legacy it left,the building on The Circle was neglected, with Mr Bevan's old office turned into a store room and old artefacts left scattered around. Now, after being given a new lease of life through a Â£500,000 investment, it will celebrate the social and political history of the town. As well as explaining to visitors the history of the NHS, the new heritage centre will direct them to other nearby landmarks such as Bedwellty House, the Chartist Cave and the Aneurin Bevan memorial stones. Tredegar has many important landmarks, such as Bedwellty House, where political heavyweights including Mr Bevan and former Labour party leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock once debated ""The Coalfields Regeneration Trust purchased the building in recognition of its huge importance to the history of Tredegar and the formation of the NHS and its potential as a heritage centre to tell a great story and to help regenerate the town centre,"" said head of operations Alun Taylor. Set up to support former mining communities across the UK, the trust is planning similar initiatives in towns across the valleys.

"Hundreds of bags of rubbish were collected from Snowdonia in the last year The rise in people exploring the UK's beauty spots has seen a rise in countryside litter. With staycations on the rise because offoreign travel restrictions, a national park has asked litter-bugs to confess: ""Why did you mess up our mountains?"" Snowdonia National Park Authority hopes visitors who dropped litter will anonymously say why they did it in an online survey. Park bosses want to know why some people did not take their rubbish home. Wales' beauty spots have seen large visitor numbers during the coronavirus lockdown and Snowdonia, the 823-sq mile (2,130 sq km) area around Snowdon, has seen its fair share of litter. About 600,000 people a year climb Wales' highest peak, at the heart of Wales' oldest national park, but some do not take their rubbish home. Why litter is surging as lockdowns ease Mess left at beauty spots 'unacceptable' 200 bags of rubbish collected by volunteers About 200 bags of litter were collected from the slopes of Snowdon in the two months over the summer of 2020, according to agroup of volunteers who have helped with litter picks The park authority has said firepits, camping gear, cigarettes and even human waste have been just some things left behind by visitors. Volunteers have been helping keep the slopes of Snowdon litter free Now Angela Jones, the national park's partnerships manager, is hoping to learn why some people drop litter instead of taking it with them. Questions on the survey ask people why some left their camping equipment behind and who visitors think is responsible for clearing up any rubbish. ""The gathering insights bit is the tricky bit,"" said Ms Jones. ""We want to get the people who have done it tell us why."" Snowdon is the highest peak in Wales at 3,560ft (1,085m) Rubbish was dumped outside places like the Snowdon summit cafe The authority has been distributing the questionnaire using social media. ""We expect some crazy answers,"" added Ms Jones. ""But if we get enough people to fill it in, we can get a better understanding."" Allow Twitter content?

"Amanda Harris is using a wheelchair, trike, and crutches to navigate the path A lack of information about disabled access at some of Wales' tourism destinations is a ""restriction on freedom"", says a campaign group. Disability Wales said some locations were seen as no-go areas for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues. The problem has been highlighted by one partially paralysed woman, who is attempting to navigate the Wales Coastal Path. Amanda Harris has started working with path teams to identify improvements. The 47-year-old was badly injured in a cycling accident seven years ago. She has become determined to complete the 870-mile (1,400km) coastal challenge, using a wheelchair, trike, and crutches when necessary. The man who sold his house to trek Wales Runner beats Wales Coast Path record ""A few years ago, after my injury I thought perhaps I wouldn't be able to get out and explore these places,"" said Ms Harris, who lives in Rhondda Cynon Taf. A view over the beach at Llangrannog, Ceredigion, from the Wales Coast Path Her injury means she can only walk for short distances and she uses a wheelchair. ""It is all about improving information. There is a lack of information at the moment,"" she said. ""I've been relying on people to tell me what's accessible and what's not. ""And that's quite hard because I don't know if it's accessible for me. ""Every mobility problem is different, so what someone sees is accessible might not be to me. ""So, it's about getting that information out there so people can see what the terrain is like and make a decision for themselves."" Amanda Harris has completed 50 miles so far on the Wales Coastal Path Miranda Evans, policy and programmes manager at Disability Wales, said the issue ""takes away disabled people's freedom"". ""There needs to be a solution that doesn't restrict disabled people's access, because it also affects parents, carers and other family members,"" she said. ""On certain beauty spots, and along the coastal path, disabled people might have to turn around and go home because they can't progress on their routes. ""It destroys the experience and knocks people's confidence, and they're not likely to venture that far afield again because it's very restrictive."" Plan to create 'Europe's longest walking tunnel' Barefoot walker conquers Lake District peaks challenge The campaign group said it wanted better information online ""at our fingertips"". Tricia Cottnam is the officer for the south Wales section of the coastal path which covers the route between Gower in the west and Chepstow in the east. ""What we are trying to do is get as many people as possible to use the path,"" she said. ""There are going to be limitations because of its very nature."" Part of the Wales Coast Path at Overton on the Gower Peninsula Opened in 2012, the path became the first in the world to stretch the length of entire nation's coast from the Dee estuary in Flintshire, to the Severn estuary in Monmouthshire. ""You will come across rocky surfaces on cliffs, steep gradients and sand dunes but that's the nature and the beauty of the coast path,"" said Ms Cottnam. ""But there are small changes we can make, where we can explain about the gradients, explain about the type of surface there might be, what type of gates or stiles are on parts of the path, so people can decide whether to make that journey or not. ""And it's all about description and not prescription. It can't be one size fits all. We must be flexible."" For Ms Harris, a former patient at Cardiff's Rookwood Hospital, the challenge of the path is proving harder than she expected. She has completed 50 miles so far (80km), and has been raising money for Horatio's Garden, which creates gardens in NHS spinal injury centres, and the Rookwood Spur charity. The money will provide a tranquil space for spinal injury patients at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, which is where the new Welsh Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Centre is being located, to replace facilities at the Rookwood site. Family designs disability-friendly campervan What new codes in supermarkets mean ""There's already areas which I think could be improved such as access alongside stiles and dropped curbs in some places, and I've already fed that information back to Wales Coast Path,"" said Ms Harris. ""I know certain areas in the Gower, Pembrokeshire, LlÅ·n Peninsula, aren't going to be accessible for me but I have a team of helpers who will do these parts I can't do. ""It's going to be a great journey. ""I'm loving that I'm finding places that are accessible and getting that information out there and improving the situation for a lot of people.""

"Some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to carry on working if exposed to someone with Covid, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages. Staff, including social care, will be exempted from isolating in ""exceptional circumstances"", when absences could lead to a ""significant risk of harm"". They will need to show a negative PCR test and take daily lateral flow tests. It comes amid a surge in cases and a rise in people told to self-isolate. More than 500,000 alerts telling people to quarantinewere sent by the NHS Covid-19 appin England and Wales in the first week of July, withsupermarkets among the latest businessesto say they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff. Those ""pinged"" by the app are advised to self-isolate for 10 days, but those contacted by NHS Test and Trace in England via text, email or phone can be fined if they do not self-isolate. PM urges caution as Covid rules ease in England NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets What's happening with the self-isolation rules? The Department of Health and Social Care says the measure is being introduced to ""alleviate pressure on NHS and social care services"". The exemption will apply to both staff who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace and those advised to self-isolate by the app. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""As we learn to live with this virus, it's important that we ensure frontline staff can keep providing the best possible care and support to people up and down the country. ""These new rules will fortify our collective defences against this awful virus, by allowing fully vaccinated frontline NHS and social care staff to continue to work when needed."" The qualifying criteria will be determined on a case-by-case basis following a risk assessment, the government said. Dr Jenny Harries, UK Health Security Agency chief executive, said guidance had been issued for situations ""where there is a significant risk to health or safety resulting from staff absence or a critical service cannot run"".

The announcement comes asmost legal restrictions on social contact are being lifted in England.

"At Ocado's warehouses, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes. Ocado has cancelled thousands of orders after a fire at a fulfilment centre in south-east London on Friday. The online grocer said the blaze started when three of the robots that help pick its groceries collided at the Erith site. About 800 staff had to be evacuated and firefighters worked through the night to contain the incident. It is the second fire involving robots at Ocado. Its Andover facility burned down in 2019 after an electrical fault. Shares in the company slipped by about 3% in early trade on Monday. Ocado handles up to 150,000 orders a week at the Erith warehouse. The company said the firewould cause ""disruption to operations"",externalbut that it was ""working to restore normal service as soon as possible"". ""We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience. ""We would like to also thank the London Fire Brigade and all the other emergency services for their hard work and professionalism in dealing with this incident."" Ocado was the UK's third largest online grocer last year It said no one had been injured in the fire and all its staff were safe. The damage is limited to a small section of its warehouse, it added, although it could not say when the site would reopen. The retailer has contacted all affected customers, but there was a mixed reaction on social media. One angry customer tweeted: ""I'm sorry that there is a fire and glad that it appears no one is hurt, but why do I have to find out on twitter?"" Robots to take on more supermarket tasks 'Sprinklers turned off' in Ocado warehouse fire She added: ""This is the 3rd or 4th order in a row that has been messed up."" Others expressed support for the firm, with one tweeting: ""Whilst it may be inconvenient, some more compassion for the business and staff affected might be nice!"" Ocado's fulfilment centres are highly automated. At Erith, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes, which are then loaded on to trucks for delivery. However, a fault in a battery charging unit caused a robot to catch light at Ocado's Andover distribution centre in 2019. The site, which processed 30,000 orders a week at the time, burned for four days and was completely destroyed. It has since been rebuilt. This video can not be played Flames and smoke were seen from miles around during the fire in 2019 Ocado, which was the UK's third biggest online grocer last year, has seen huge growth during the pandemic, with sales up 40% in the first three months of the year. It also continues to strike technology licensing partnerships with grocery chains around the world, including Groupe Casino in France and Kroger in the US.

"Rights activists, journalists and lawyers around the world have been targeted with phone malware sold to authoritarian governments by an Israeli surveillance firm, media reports say. They are on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of the company, NSO Group, leaked to major news outlets. It was not clear where the list came from - or how many phones had actually been hacked. NSO denies any wrongdoing. It says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. It said the original investigation which led to the reports, by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International, was ""full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories"". But it added that it would ""continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action"". The allegations about use of the software, known as Pegasus, were carried on Sunday by the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde and 14 other media organisations around the world. Pegasus infects iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. Media outlets working on the investigation said they had identified more than 1,000 people spanning over 50 countries whose numbers were on the list. They include politicians and heads of state, business executives, activists, and several Arab royal family members. More than 180 journalists were also found to be on the list, from organisations including CNN, the New York Times and Al Jazeera. Who are the alleged victims of Pegasus spyware? Many of the numbers were clustered in 10 countries:Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabiaand theUnited Arab Emirates, according to the reports. When contacted by the outlets involved in the investigation, spokespeople for these countries either denied that Pegasus was used or denied that they had abused their powers of surveillance. It was not clear how many of the devices on the list had actually been targeted, but forensic analysis of 37 of the phones showed there had been ""attempted and successful"" hacks, the Washington Post reported. This included people close toSaudijournalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in October 2018 while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. His body was then dismembered. The investigation found that spyware was installed on his fiancÃ©e's phone days after his murder, and that his wife's phone was targeted with spyware between September 2017 and April 2018. This video can not be played Whatâs it like to have spyware on your phone? The NSO Group said its technology was ""not associated in any way with the heinous murder"". The phone ofMexicanjournalist Cecilio Pineda Birto also appeared twice on the list, including in the month before he was murdered, the investigation found. His phone disappeared from the scene of the murder so a forensic examination was not possible. NSO said that even if his phone was targeted, that did not mean that data collected was connected with his murder. The phones of twoHungarianinvestigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were found to have been successfully infected with the spyware. Mr Panyi told Forbidden stories that learning of the hack was ""devastating"". ""There are some people in this country who consider a regular journalist as dangerous as someone suspected of terrorism,"" he said. The Hungarian government was ""not aware of any alleged data collection"", a spokesperson told the Guardian. InIndia, more than 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and two ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government werereported to be on the list. This included thekey opposition figure Rahul Gandhi,with two mobile phone numbers belonging to him found in the list. Mr Gandhi no longer has the devices so it was not possible to analyse them to determine if he had been hacked. India's government has denied using unauthorised surveillance. More details about who has been targeted are expected to be released in the coming days. WhatsApp sued NSO in 2019, alleging the company was behind cyber-attacks on 1,400 mobile phones involving Pegasus. At the time, NSO denied any wrongdoing, but the company has been banned from using WhatsApp. The allegations here are not new. What is new is the scale of the targeting of innocent people that's allegedly taking place. Nearly 200 reporters from 21 countries have their phone numbers on this list, and more names of high-profile public figures are expected to be revealed. There are plenty of unknowns in these allegations - including where the list comes from and how many of the phone numbers were actively targeted with spyware. NSO Group has once again come out swinging and denies all accusations. However, it's a blow for the company, which is actively trying to reform its reputation. Only two weeks ago it released its first ""transparency report"" detailing human right policies and pledges. Amnesty International brushed the 32-page document off as a ""sales brochure"". These latest allegations will do further damage to its image, but they won't hurt the company financially. There are very few private companies able to produce the sort of invasive spy tools that NSO sells, and clearly the largely unregulated market for the software is booming.
