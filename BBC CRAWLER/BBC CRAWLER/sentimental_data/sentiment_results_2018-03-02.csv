"Thousands attended the service in Mr Graham's native Charlotte More than 2,000 mourners, including President Donald Trump, have attended the funeral of evangelical preacher Billy Graham in North Carolina.

"Here is the full text of Theresa May's Mansion House speech setting out her vision for the UK's relationship with the EU after Brexit. I am here today to set out my vision for the future economic partnership between the United Kingdom and the European Union. There have been many different voices and views in the debate on what our new relationship with the EU should look like. I have listened carefully to them all. But as we chart our way forward with the EU, I want to take a moment to look back. Eighteen months ago I stood in Downing Street and addressed the nation for my first time as Prime Minister. I made this pledge then, to the people that I serve: I know you're working around the clock, I know you're doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we'll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we'll listen not to the mighty but to you. When it comes to taxes, we'll prioritise not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won't entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. We are living through an important moment in our country's history. As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us. That pledge, to the people of our United Kingdom is what guides me in our negotiations with the EU. And for me that means five things: First, the agreement we reach with the EU must respect the referendum. It was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. And a vote for wider change, so that no community in Britain would ever be left behind again. But it was not a vote for a distant relationship with our neighbours. Second, the new agreement we reach with the EU must endure. After Brexit both the UK and the EU want to forge ahead with building a better future for our people, not find ourselves back at the negotiating table because things have broken down. Third, it must protect people's jobs and security. People in the UK voted for our country to have a new and different relationship with Europe, but while the means may change our shared goals surely have not - to work together to grow our economies and keep our people safe. Fourth, it must be consistent with the kind of country we want to be as we leave: a modern, open, outward-looking, tolerant, European democracy. A nation of pioneers, innovators, explorers and creators. A country that celebrates our history and diversity, confident of our place in the world; that meets its obligations to our near neighbours and far off friends, and is proud to stand up for its values. And fifth, in doing all of these things, it must strengthen our union of nations and our union of people. We must bring our country back together, taking into account the views of everyone who cares about this issue, from both sides of the debate. As Prime Minister it is my duty to represent all of our United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; north and south, from coastal towns and rural villages to our great cities. So these are the five tests for the deal that we will negotiate. Implementing the decision of the British people; reaching an enduring solution; protecting our security and prosperity; delivering an outcome that is consistent with the kind of country we want to be; and bringing our country together, strengthening the precious union of all our people. We are now approaching a crucial moment. There is no escaping the complexity of the task ahead of us. We must not only negotiate our exit from an organisation that touches so many important parts of our national life. We must also build a new and lasting relationship while, given the uncertainty inherent in this negotiation, preparing for every scenario. But we are making real progress. At the end of last year, we agreed the key elements of our withdrawal. We are in the process of turning that agreement into draft legal text.  We have made clear our concerns about the first draft the Commission published on Wednesday - but no-one should be in any doubt about our commitment to the Joint Report we agreed in December. We are close to agreement on the terms of an implementation period which was a key element of December's deal. Of course some points of difference remain - but I am confident these can be resolved in the days ahead. Both the UK and the EU are clear this implementation period must be time-limited and cannot become a permanent solution. But it is vital to give governments, businesses and citizens on both sides the time they need to prepare for our new relationship. With this agreed, I want both sides to turn all our attention and efforts to that new relationship. But before we can do that, we need to set out in more detail what relationship we want, building on my Lancaster House and Florence speeches. So last month, I spoke in Munich about the security partnership we seek. And today, I want to talk about the other pillar of that relationship: how we build our economic partnership. In my speech in Florence, I set out why the existing models for economic partnership either do not deliver the ambition we need or impose unsustainable constraints on our democracy. For example, the Norway model, where we would stay in the single market, would mean having to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety - and would also mean continued free movement. Others have suggested we negotiate a free trade agreement similar to that which Canada has recently negotiated with the EU - or trade on World Trade Organisation terms. But these options would mean a significant reduction in our access to each other's markets compared to that which we currently enjoy. And this would mean customs and regulatory checks at the border that would damage the integrated supply chains that our industries depend on and be inconsistent with the commitments that both we and the EU have made in respect of Northern Ireland. This is a wider issue in our negotiations and I want to dwell on this for a minute. Successive British governments have worked tirelessly - together with all the parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish Government - to bring about the historic achievement of peace. This is an achievement that we should all be proud of, and protect. That is why I have consistently put upholding the Belfast Agreement at the heart of the UK's approach. Our departure from the EU causes very particular challenges for Northern Ireland, and for Ireland.  We joined the EU together 45 years ago.  It is not surprising that our decision to leave has caused anxiety and a desire for concrete solutions. We have been clear all along that we don't want to go back to a hard border in Ireland. We have ruled out any physical infrastructure at the border, or any related checks and controls. But it is not good enough to say, 'We won't introduce a hard border; if the EU forces Ireland to do it, that's down to them'. We chose to leave; we have a responsibility to help find a solution. But we can't do it on our own. It is for all of us to work together. And the Taoiseach and I agreed when we met recently that our teams and the Commission should now do just that. I want to make one final point. Just as it would be unacceptable to go back to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, it would also be unacceptable to break up the United Kingdom's own common market by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea. My personal commitment to this is clear. As prime minister of the whole United Kingdom, I am not going to let our departure from the European Union do anything to set back the historic progress that we have made in Northern Ireland - nor will I allow anything that would damage the integrity of our precious Union. So existing models do not provide the best way forward for either the UK or the EU. But before I turn to what a new and better model might look like, I want to be straight with people - because the reality is that we all need to face up to some hard facts. We are leaving the single market.  Life is going to be different. In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now. How could the EU's structure of rights and obligations be sustained, if the UK - or any country - were allowed to enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations? So we need to strike a new balance. But we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway. The second hard fact is that even after we have left the jurisdiction of the ECJ, EU law and the decisions of the ECJ will continue to affect us. For a start, the ECJ determines whether agreements the EU has struck are legal under the EU's own law - as the US found when the ECJ declared the Safe Harbor Framework for data sharing invalid. When we leave the EU, the Withdrawal Bill will bring EU law into UK law. That means cases will be determined in our courts. But, where appropriate, our courts will continue to look at the ECJ's judgments, as they do for the appropriate jurisprudence of other countries' courts. And if, as part of our future partnership, Parliament passes an identical law to an EU law, it may make sense for our courts to look at the appropriate ECJ judgments so that we both interpret those laws consistently. As I said in Munich, if we agree that the UK should continue to participate in an EU agency the UK would have to respect the remit of the ECJ in that regard. But, in the future, the EU treaties and hence EU law will no longer apply in the UK. The agreement we reach must therefore respect the sovereignty of both the UK and the EU's legal orders. That means the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end. It also means that the ultimate arbiter of disputes about our future partnership cannot be the court of either party. The next hard fact is this. If we want good access to each other's markets, it has to be on fair terms. As with any trade agreement, we must accept the need for binding commitments - for example, we may choose to commit some areas of our regulations like state aid and competition to remaining in step with the EU's. The UK drove much of the policy in this area and we have much to gain from maintaining proper disciplines on the use of subsidies and on anti-competitive practices. Furthermore, as I said in Florence, we share the same set of fundamental beliefs; a belief in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights, and that trying to beat other countries' industries by unfairly subsidising one's own is a serious mistake. And in other areas like workers' rights or the environment, the EU should be confident that we will not engage in a race to the bottom in the standards and protections we set. There is no serious political constituency in the UK which would support this - quite the opposite. Finally, we need to resolve the tensions between some of our key objectives. We want the freedom to negotiate trade agreements with other countries around the world.  We want to take back control of our laws.  We also want as frictionless a border as possible between us and the EU - so that we don't damage the integrated supply chains our industries depend on and don't have a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. But there are some tensions in the EU's position too - and some hard facts for them to face as well. The Commission has suggested that the only option available to the UK is an 'off the shelf' model. But, at the same time, they have also said that in certain areas none of the EU's third country agreements would be appropriate. And the European Council's Guidelines aspire to a balanced, ambitious, and wide-ranging deal, with common rules in a number of areas to ensure fair and open competition. This would not be delivered by a Canada-style deal - which would not give them the breadth or depth of market access that they want. And it is hard to see how it would be in the EU's interests for the UK's regulatory standards to be as different as Canada's. Finally, we both need to face the fact that this is a negotiation and neither of us can have exactly what we want. But I am confident we can reach agreement. We both want good access to each other's markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes. But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance. As on security, what I am seeking is a relationship that goes beyond the transactional to one where we support each other's interests. So I want the broadest and deepest possible partnership - covering more sectors and co-operating more fully than any Free Trade Agreement anywhere in the world today. And as I will go on to describe we will also need agreements in a range of areas covering the breadth of our relationship. I believe this is achievable because it is in the EU's interests as well as ours. The EU is the UK's biggest market - and of course the UK is also a big market for the EU. And furthermore, we have a unique starting point, where on day one we both have the same laws and rules. So rather than having to bring two different systems closer together, the task will be to manage the relationship once we are two separate legal systems. To do so, and to realise this level of ambition, there are five foundations that must underpin our trading relationship. First, our agreement will need reciprocal binding commitments to ensure fair and open competition. Such agreements are part and parcel of any trade agreement. After all, why would any country enter into a privileged economic partnership without any means of redress if the other party engaged in anti-competitive practices? But the level of integration between the UK and EU markets and our geographical proximity mean these reciprocal commitments will be particularly important in ensuring that UK business can compete fairly in EU markets and vice versa. A deep and comprehensive agreement with the EU will therefore need to include commitments reflecting the extent to which the UK and EU economies are entwined. Second, we will need an arbitration mechanism that is completely independent - something which, again, is common to Free Trade Agreements. This will ensure that any disagreements about the purpose or scope of the agreement can be resolved fairly and promptly. Third, given the close relationship we envisage, we will need to have an ongoing dialogue with the EU, and to ensure we have the means to consult each other regularly. In particular we will want to make sure our regulators continue to work together; as they do with regulators internationally. This will be essential for everything from getting new drugs to patients quickly to maintaining financial stability. We start from the place where our regulators already have deep and long-standing relationships. So the task is maintaining that trust; not building it in the first place. Fourth, we will need an arrangement for data protection. I made this point in Munich in relation to our security relationship. But the free flow of data is also critical for both sides in any modern trading relationship too. The UK has exceptionally high standards of data protection. And we want to secure an agreement with the EU that provides the stability and confidence for EU and UK business and individuals to achieve our aims in maintaining and developing the UK's strong trading and economic links with the EU. That is why we will be seeking more than just an adequacy arrangement and want to see an appropriate ongoing role for the UK's Information Commissioner's Office. This will ensure UK businesses are effectively represented under the EU's new 'one stop shop' mechanism for resolving data protection disputes. And fifth, we must maintain the links between our people. EU citizens are an integral part of the economic, cultural and social fabric of our country. I know that UK nationals are viewed in entirely the same way by communities across the EU. And this is why at every stage of these negotiations, I have put the interests of EU citizens and UK nationals at the heart of our approach. We are clear that as we leave the EU, free movement of people will come to an end and we will control the number of people who come to live in our country. But UK citizens will still want to work and study in EU countries - just as EU citizens will want to do the same here, helping to shape and drive growth, innovation and enterprise. Indeed, businesses across the EU and the UK must be able to attract and employ the people they need. And we are open to discussing how to facilitate these valuable links. Reciprocal commitments to ensure fair and open competition, an independent arbitration mechanism, an ongoing dialogue, data protection arrangements and maintaining the links between our people. These are the foundations that underpin the ambition of this unique and unprecedented partnership. It will then need to be tailored to the needs of our economies. This follows the approach the EU has taken with its trade agreements in the past - and indeed with its own single market as it has developed. The EU's agreement with Ukraine sees it align with the EU in some areas but not others. The EU's agreement with South Korea contains provisions to recognise each others' approvals for new car models, whereas their agreement with Canada does not. Equally, the EU's agreement with Canada contains provisions to recognise each others' testing on machinery; its agreement with South Korea does not. The EU itself is rightly taking a tailored approach in what it is seeking with the UK. For example, on fisheries, the Commission has been clear that no precedents exist for the sort of access it wants from the UK. The fact is that every Free Trade Agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking. Moreover, with all its neighbours the EU has varying levels of access to the Single Market, depending on the obligations those neighbours are willing to undertake. What would be cherry-picking would be if we were to seek a deal where our rights and obligations were not held in balance. And I have been categorically clear that is not what we are going to do. I think it is pragmatic common sense that we should work together to deliver the best outcome for both sides. Let me start with how we do this for goods. This is the area where the single market is most established and both the UK and the EU have a strong commercial interest in preserving integrated supply chains that have built up over forty years of our membership. When it comes to goods, a fundamental principle in our negotiating strategy should be that trade at the UK-EU border should be as frictionless as possible. That means we don't want to see the introduction of any tariffs or quotas. And - as the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union set out in his speech in Vienna last week - we must ensure that, as now, products only need to undergo one series of approvals, in one country, to show that they meet the required regulatory standards. To achieve this we will need a comprehensive system of mutual recognition. The UK will need to make a strong commitment that its regulatory standards will remain as high as the EU's. That commitment, in practice, will mean that UK and EU regulatory standards will remain substantially similar in the future. Many of these regulatory standards are themselves underpinned by international standards set by non-EU bodies of which we will remain a member - such as the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which sets vehicle safety standards. Countries around the world, including Turkey, South Africa, South Korea, Japan and Russia, are party to the agreement. As I said in my speech in Florence this could be achieved in different ways. Our default is that UK law may not necessarily be identical to EU law, but it should achieve the same outcomes. In some cases Parliament might choose to pass an identical law - businesses who export to the EU tell us that it is strongly in their interest to have a single set of regulatory standards that mean they can sell into the UK and EU markets. If the Parliament of the day decided not to achieve the same outcomes as EU law, it would be in the knowledge that there may be consequences for our market access. And there will need to be an independent mechanism to oversee these arrangements. We will also want to explore with the EU, the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical for the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries: the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, and the European Aviation Safety Agency. We would, of course, accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those agencies and making an appropriate financial contribution. I want to explain what I believe the benefits of this approach could be, both for us and the EU. First, associate membership of these agencies is the only way to meet our objective of ensuring that these products only need to undergo one series of approvals, in one country. Second, these agencies have a critical role in setting and enforcing relevant rules. And if we were able to negotiate associate membership we would be able to ensure that we could continue to provide our technical expertise. Third, associate membership could permit UK firms to resolve certain challenges related to the agencies through UK courts rather than the ECJ. For example, in the case of Switzerland, associate membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency means that airworthiness certifications are granted by its own aviation authority, and disputes are resolved through its courts. Without its membership, Swiss airlines would need to gain their certifications through another member state or through the Agency, and any dispute would need to be resolved through the ECJ. Fourth it would bring other benefits too. For example, membership of the European Medicines Agency would mean investment in new innovative medicines continuing in the UK, and it would mean these medicines getting to patients faster as firms prioritise larger markets when they start the lengthy process of seeking authorisations. But it would also be good for the EU because the UK regulator assesses more new medicines than any other member state. And the EU would continue to access the expertise of the UK's world-leading universities. And, of course, Parliament would remain ultimately sovereign. It could decide not to accept these rules, but with consequences for our membership of the relevant agency and linked market access rights. Lastly to achieve as frictionless a border as possible and to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, we also need an agreement on customs. The UK has been clear it is leaving the Customs Union. The EU has also formed a customs union with some other countries. But those arrangements, if applied to the UK, would mean the EU setting the UK's external tariffs, being able to let other countries sell more into the UK without making it any easier for us to sell more to them, or the UK signing up to the Common Commercial Policy. That would not be compatible with a meaningful independent trade policy. It would mean we had less control than we do now over our trade in the world. Neither Leave nor Remain voters would want that. So we have thought seriously about how our commitment to a frictionless border can best be delivered. And last year, we set out two potential options for our customs arrangement. Option one is a customs partnership between the UK and the EU. At the border, the UK would mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world, applying the same tariffs and the same rules of origin as the EU for those goods arriving in the UK and intended for the EU. By following this approach, we would know that all goods entering the EU via the UK pay the right EU duties, removing the need for customs processes at the UK-EU border. But, importantly, we would put in place a mechanism so that the UK would also be able to apply its own tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the UK market. As we have set out previously, this would require the means to ensure that both sides can trust the system and a robust enforcement mechanism. Option two would be a highly streamlined customs arrangement, where we would jointly agree to implement a range of measures to minimise frictions to trade, together with specific provisions for Northern Ireland. First, measures to ensure the requirements for moving goods across borders are as simple as possible. This means we should continue to waive the requirement for entry and exit declarations for goods moving between the UK and the EU. And we should allow goods moving between the UK and the rest of the world to travel through the EU without paying EU duties and vice versa. Second, measures to reduce the risk of delays at ports and airports. For example, recognising each other's ""trusted traders"" schemes and drawing on the most advanced IT solutions so that vehicles do not need to stop at the border. Third, we should continue our cooperation to mitigate customs duty and security risks. And fourth, measures to reduce the cost and burden of complying with customs administrative requirements, including by maximising the use of automation. And recognising the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland, and our shared commitments to avoiding a hard border, we should consider further specific measures. 80% of North-South trade is carried out by micro, small and medium sized businesses. So for smaller traders - who as members of the community are most affected but whose economic role is not systemically significant for the EU market - we would allow them to continue to operate as they do currently, with no new restrictions. And for larger traders we would introduce streamlined processes, including a trusted trader scheme that would be consistent with our commitments. Both of these options for our future customs arrangement would leave the UK free to determine its own tariffs with third countries - which would simply not be possible in a customs union. I recognise that some of these ideas depend on technology, robust systems to ensure trust and confidence, as well as goodwill - but they are serious and merit consideration by all sides. So to conclude on goods, a fundamental principle in our negotiating strategy is that trade at the UK-EU border should be as frictionless as possible with no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We believe this can be achieved via a commitment to ensure that the relevant UK regulatory standards remain at least as high as the EU's and a customs arrangement. We recognise this would constrain our ability to lower regulatory standards for industrial goods. But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box. This approach to trade in goods is important for agriculture, food and drinks - but here other considerations also apply. We are leaving the Common Agricultural Policy and will want to take the opportunity that brings to reform our agriculture and fisheries management. The UK has among the highest environmental and animal welfare standards of any nation on earth. As we leave the EU we will uphold environmental standards and go further to protect our shared natural heritage. And I fully expect that our standards will remain at least as high as the EU's. But it will be particularly important to secure flexibility here to ensure we can make the most of the opportunities presented by our withdrawal from the EU for our farmers and exporters. We are also leaving the Common Fisheries Policy. The UK will regain control over our domestic fisheries management rules and access to our waters. But as part of our economic partnership we will want to continue to work together to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry. And we will also want to ensure open markets for each other's products. Just as our partnership in goods needs to be deeper than any other Free Trade Agreement, so in services we have the opportunity to break new ground with a broader agreement than ever before. We recognise that certain aspects of trade in services are intrinsically linked to the single market and therefore our market access in these areas will need to be different. But we should only allow new barriers to be introduced where absolutely necessary. We don't want to discriminate against EU service providers in the UK. And we wouldn't want the EU to discriminate against UK service providers. So we want to limit the number of barriers that could prevent UK firms from setting up in the EU and vice versa, and agree an appropriate labour mobility framework that enables UK businesses and self-employed professionals to travel to the EU to provide services to clients in person and that allows UK businesses to provide services to the EU over the phone or the internet. And we want to do the same for EU firms providing services to the UK. And given that UK qualifications are already recognised across the EU and vice versa - it would make sense to continue to recognise each other's qualifications in the future. There are two areas which have never been covered in a Free Trade Agreement in any meaningful way before - broadcasting and, despite the EU's own best efforts in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, financial services. But we have some ideas for how we can do this - and it is in all our interests to explore these. On broadcasting, we recognise that we cannot have exactly the same arrangements with the EU as we do now. Currently, because of the ""country of origin"" principle, a company based in the UK can be licence by Ofcom and broadcast into any EU member state and vice versa. The relevant directive will not apply to the UK, as we leave the EU, and relying solely on precedents will hurt consumers and businesses on both sides. The UK's creative hub leads to the development of products that European consumers want - the UK currently provides around 30% of the channels available in the EU. But equally, many UK companies have pan-European ownership, and there are 35 channels and on-demand services, which are offered in the UK but licensed in the EU. So we should explore creative options with an open mind, including mutual recognition which would allow for continued trans-frontier broadcasting - recognising the enriching role that British broadcasters and programme makers play, not only in British - but more broadly in our common European - culture. Similarly, on financial services, the Chancellor will be setting out next week how financial services can and should be part of a deep and comprehensive partnership. We are not looking for passporting because we understand this is intrinsic to the single market of which we would no longer be a member. It would also require us to be subject to a single rule book, over which we would have no say. The UK has responsibility for the financial stability of the world's most significant financial centre, and our taxpayers bear the risk, so it would be unrealistic for us to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety. But with UK located banks underwriting around half of the debt and equity issued by EU companies and providing more than Â£1.1 trillion of cross-border lending to the rest of the EU in 2015 alone, this is a clear example of where only looking at precedent would hurt both the UK and EU economies. As in other areas of the future economic partnership, our goal should be to establish the ability to access each others' markets, based on the UK and EU maintaining the same regulatory outcomes over time, with a mechanism for determining proportionate consequences where they are not maintained. But given the highly regulated nature of financial services, and our shared desire to manage financial stability risks, we would need a collaborative, objective framework that is reciprocal, mutually agreed, and permanent and therefore reliable for businesses. There are many other areas where the UK and EU economies are closely linked - including energy, transport, digital, law, science and innovation, and education and culture. On energy, we will want to secure broad energy co-operation with the EU. This includes protecting the single electricity market across Ireland and Northern Ireland - and exploring options for the UK's continued participation in the EU's internal energy market. We also believe it is of benefit to both sides for the UK to have a close association with Euratom. On transport, we will want to ensure the continuity of air, maritime and rail services; and we will want to protect the rights of road hauliers to access the EU market and vice versa. On digital, the UK will not be part of the EU's Digital Single Market, which will continue to develop after our withdrawal from the EU. This is a fast evolving, innovative sector, in which the UK is a world leader. So it will be particularly important to have domestic flexibility, to ensure the regulatory environment can always respond nimbly and ambitiously to new developments. We will want our agreement to cover civil judicial cooperation, where the EU has already shown that it can reach agreement with non-member states, such as through the Lugano Convention, although we would want a broader agreement that reflects our unique starting point. And our agreement will also need to cover company law and intellectual property, to provide further legal certainty and coherence. The UK is also committed to establishing a far-reaching science and innovation pact with the EU, facilitating the exchange of ideas and researchers. This would enable the UK to participate in key programmes alongside our EU partners. And we want to take a similar approach to educational and cultural programmes, to promote our shared values and enhance our intellectual strength in the world - again making an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved. In all these areas, bold and creative thinking can deliver new agreements that are in the very best interests of all our people - both in the UK and across the EU. And in the face of a worrying rise in protectionism, I believe such agreements can enable us to set an example to the world. For the world is watching. We should not think of our leaving the EU as marking an ending, as much as a new beginning for the United Kingdom and our relationship with our European allies. Change is not to be feared, so long as we face it with a clear-sighted determination to act for the common good. Nor is Brexit an end in itself. Rather, it must be the means by which we reaffirm Britain's place in the world and renew the ties that bind us here at home. And I know that the United Kingdom I treasure can emerge from this process a stronger, more cohesive nation. A United Kingdom which is a cradle for innovation; a leader in the industries of the future; a champion of free trade, based on high standards; a modern, outward-looking, tolerant country, proud of our values and confident of our place in the world. This is an optimistic and confident future which can unite us all. A Global Britain which thrives in the world by forging a bold and comprehensive economic partnership with our neighbours in the EU; and reaches out beyond our continent, to trade with nations across the globe. The approach I have set out today would: implement the referendum result, provide an enduring solution, protect our security and prosperity, helps us build the kind of country we want to be, and bring our country together by commanding the confidence of those who voted Leave and those who voted Remain. It is an approach to deliver for the whole of our United Kingdom and our wider family of overseas territories. I am in no doubt that whatever agreement we reach with the EU, our future is bright. The stability and continuity of centuries of self-government, our commitment to freedom under the rule of law, our belief in enterprise and innovation, but above all, the talent and genius of all our people - and especially our young people - are the seeds of our success in the future, as they have been the guarantors of our success in the past. I look forward to discussing our future partnership with our European friends. Because although we are leaving the EU - and in that regard we will become separate - we are all still European and will stay linked by the many ties and values we have in common. And because it is only by working together that we will find solutions that work for all our peoples. Yes, there will be ups and downs in the months ahead. As in any negotiation, no-one will get everything they want. We will not be buffeted by the demands to talk tough or threaten a walk out. Just as we will not accept the counsels of despair that this simply cannot be done. We will move forward by calm, patient discussion of each other's positions.  It is my responsibility as Prime Minister to provide that leadership for our country at this crucial time. By following the course I have set out today, I am confident we will get there and deliver the right outcome for Britain and the EU. A generation from now what will be remembered is not the rough and tumble of negotiation but whether we reached an enduring solution cast in the interests of the people we are all here to serve. So my message to our friends in Europe is clear. We know what we want. We understand your principles. We have a shared interest in getting this right. So let's get on with it.

"Yes, it was a long speech. Yes, the prime minister added a layer of detail to her Brexit plans. Yes, there were nuggets in there about how the negotiations might proceed, including, without much fanfare, what seemed to be a statement that the EU commission would help to find a solution the Irish border question, one of the most vexed of all. Yes, it did not provide encyclopaedic levels of information about exactly what the UK would propose. Yes, there were holes, only a few paragraphs on the biggest bit of the UK economy, services. Yes, there are still fundamental contradictions in the UK position. And yes, the Tory infighting of recent weeks that's simmered down today will return at the next moment of decision. One senior Tory told me we might have given up on cake and eating it, ''but we're now asking for half the cake''. And there was nothing today that suddenly revealed a real change in the government's thinking. That gives her critics cause for concern, and EU sources are emollient, rather than immediately won over. But the message that Theresa May wanted, and arguably needed to get across, was way beyond any of the detailed arguments that lead the Tory party, the EU, or both, down a cul-de-sac. This was not intended to be the final word. What the prime minister endeavoured to do instead was to say to the EU, let's do a deal. It won't be easy, I'm confessing to my party and the public that I won't get everything they want, but I get it, and now, after everything that's happened, let's talk. It is legitimate of course to ask why it has taken so long for the prime minister to put that forward. Well, the EU didn't want to talk about trade initially, wanting to sort out the cash first of all. And there have always been internal suspicions of her aims in the Tory party that have made moving forward extremely fraught. Her survival has been contingent. But some of this comes down to the prime minister, fond of asking for more and more briefing, more and more alternatives and discussion in committees, who is reluctant to do anything in a hurry. In the coming days much will be written along the lines of ''what took her so long''? The hope in No 10 is that the EU will welcome her newly pragmatic admission that we can't, after all that cake, really have it all. And importantly, after a fevered bout of internal jockeying, Theresa May today has been willing to tell both wings of her party they will have to compromise. Adding some detail to her approach she more firmly than before told Brexiteers they can't dictate all the terms. And there was a message to Conservative Remainers too that she won't back down on her central intentions to leave the single market and customs union. And for today, it seems enough. Both sides in the Tory tug-of-war have welcomed her carefully phrased lines. But accepting warnings of coming compromises is not the same as swallowing them when they happen. If, and likely when, the European Union pushes back her proposal, Theresa May's 'hard facts' will become harder choices for the Conservative Party. But today, she was a leader in an almost impossible political position straining to show what might just work. Politics is about principle, yes, but first and foremost what is possible. No 10 hopes that today, the prime minister will have shown the EU that is something she understands.

"Theresa May's speech was another key milestone in the Brexit process and for once business leaders did not leave totally disappointed. What business will most appreciate is that this was not a complacent speech. It acknowledged the scale and complexity of the task in hand and made some pragmatic concessions to the realities of trade with the EU. Most of those concessions will please the business community, but some may not satisfy members of her party. Perhaps the most eye-catching passage for business was the prime minister's indication that the UK would be prepared to pay to remain a member of some European regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency or the European Aviation Safety Authority. As the regulations change, the UK parliament could choose to enact an identical law - or not - but failing to do so would be in the knowledge that it might affect our membership of the agency. So parliament remains sovereign but in practice would probably not use that sovereignty in case we got booted out of the agency. That will sound suspiciously like rule taking to some Brexit firebrands. She also accepted that on goods regulations, UK standards would have to be at least as high as the EU's - so, no bonfire of regulation that frankly no one in the business world wanted anyway. On services, which accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy, she conceded that services had never been included in any meaningful way in previous deals and this accepted this part would be tough. The tone was strongest on financial services. She said that London was the most important financial centre in the world and the UK taxpayers take the risk of being its home - so the UK could never be a rule taker. She called for a collaborative, objective framework that was mutually agreed and permanent. That would mean ""equivalence"" (which the EU already grants to some third countries) is probably not good enough as it can be terminated at short notice. She said Phillip Hammond would expand upon the UK's ideas on this shortly. On customs, it seems that a new ""partnership"" with the EU has become the favourite option. This would require the UK to enforce both its own customs arrangements and act as agent for the EU when goods arrive in the UK bound for the EU. This option sounds mindbogglingly complex and business will need to see much more detail to be convinced that the government has a solid answer to a very important question for them - and the future of the border on island of Ireland. As Adam Marshall of the BCC said: ""The prime minister was clearer and more realistic than ever before on the political choices and economic trade-offs ahead."" The financial services lobby group, TheCityUK, praised her for making ""a detailed and practical proposition and it should put to rest any suggestion that the UK has not made its intentions and ambitions clear"". Was it cherry picking? To an extent - but she had a neat if simplistic answer to this. Every trade deal involves a bit of cherry picking and the EU does it too in its differing approaches to its deals with South Korea and Canada. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted: Mrs May also said the two sides were close to agreement on an implementation period. Some members of her own party would rather not agree to that until they know what they are implementing - but it will be music to the ears of many businesses who are close to pulling the trigger on contingency plans in case of a no deal scenario. That threat seemed to be in retreat in the prime minister's tone. While Nigel Farage called it a negotiating mistake, it will be a relief to most businesses.

"A 17-year-old boy who was ""hours away from committing an act of atrocity"" in Cardiff has been detained indefinitely and must serve at least 11 years. Lloyd Gunton was arrested after researching the security arrangements of a Justin Bieber concert, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The jury was told he plotted to commit mass murder in an Islamic State-inspired vehicle attack. Police investigated after he uploaded terror-related social media posts. Gunton, from near Llantrisant, south Wales, was arrested after he uploaded social media content to photo-sharing social media site Instagram in late June 2017 which promoted jihad and supported al-Qaeda. The former A-level student, who has an autism diagnosis, had published images of terrorists, as well as pictures of the so-called Islamic State flag, and photos encouraging a terrorist attack in Cardiff. Police found the password for the account was ""truck attack"". One post read: ""May Allah bring terrorism to Cardiff on 30th June."" He had researched how to carry out a vehicle ramming attack and how to stab and kill and had also looked into the security arrangements of the Justin Bieber concert in Cardiff's Principality Stadium. His internet history included searches for ""Isis beheading video"", ""how to create a terror attack"" and ""what does getting shot feel like"". When arrested, the teenager was found with a gutting knife and a hammer in his school rucksack, and the ""martyrdom letter"" said he was a ""soldier of the Islamic state"" and ""more attacks will follow"". He was found guilty of one charge of engaging in the preparation of a terrorist act, two charges of encouraging terrorism, and a further two charges of possessing terrorist information. He was detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure at Birmingham Crown Court and will be returned to a young offenders institution where he has been held since his conviction. An order banning his identification was lifted by the court. How terror teenager plotted city attack Judge Mark Wall QC told Gunton: ""At the time of your arrest you were within hours of committing an act of atrocity on the streets of Cardiff.

""I am sure that you planned not just the killing of one person but rather mass murder.""

"Firefighter Dan Cheetham trekked 15 miles through the snow a day early to get to his shift Firefighter Dan Cheetham is one of many people to prove not all heroes wear capes. Snow and freezing conditions have continued to cause misery for many across the UK while thearmy has been called in to helprescue drivers stuck in the snow. But it's not just those in the military who have been lending people in need a hand. Even so, the efforts of Dan Cheetham, a Lincolnshire firefighter who walked 15 miles through the snow on Thursday - a day early - to make sure he was on time for his shift, has won the admiration of colleagues and the public alike. ""We'd taken quite a lashing through the snow,"" he told the BBC. ""The community had pulled together but there were four foot drifts in some places making roads impassable by car. ""I knew I had a duty of care to my community. That made my mind up that I had to get into work. I wouldn't recommend going out in the snow but I'm used to walking and left as early as I did because it was safer to travel in daylight."" Dave Gilbert, Mr Cheetham's manager at Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said he was ""extremely proud of the efforts that [Mr Cheetham] has gone to to ensure we've got a full crew"". But Mr Cheetham, who was worked in the fire service for five years, said he thought some of his colleagues might have thought he was a bit ""loopy"". ""I had that many layers on I looked like the abominable snowman,"" he said. Nurse Lydia Howells used a home-made sign to bag a lift to work Lydia Howells, 28, is a recovery nurse at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. She works in the operating theatre. ""This morning I knew I had to get to work, but the car was totally snowed in and the busses weren't running so I decided to make myself a sign and hit the road walking,"" she told the BBC on Friday. ""At work I have seen how people have pulled together so I was hopeful someone would stop."" She set out wearing three coats and clutching a flask of hot water. Fortunately for Ms Howells, she was in the ""extremely windy and bitterly cold"" conditions for ""no more than two minutes"" before she was offered a lift. ""I was elated when someone pulled up,"" she said. ""It was a really nice gesture. The guy who picked me up had to let the people he worked for know what he was doing, so they didn't think he was skiving. ""I have no idea how I am going to get home after my shift, so I've brought pyjamas in case I end up staying at the hospital,"" she added. ""There was no question in my mind that I was going to get to work today. I needed to get in to look after patients."" Lydia Howells pictured with the driver who picked her up Glasgow-based surgeon Andy Renwick told BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday that one colleague walked from Anniesland to Paisley - almost eight miles - to operate on a cancer patient. ""I won't give her name because she would be genuinely upset with me,"" he said. ""She walked from Anniesland to Paisley - it took her two hours and 50 minutes. I saw her come in, she had snow goggles on, Gortexed up, top and bottom, snow shoes and walking poles."" Mr Renwick's colleague was due to operate on a patient with bowel cancer. ""She knew that had to be done and so she made extra effort to get in here to make sure that was actually delivered."" Emily O'Connor, a trainee obstetrician at Cork University Maternity Hospital, posted a picture on Twitter of her walk to work through the snow with a friend early on Thursday morning.

"The baby boy was taken to hospital by emergency service after being born at home in Balgedie A woman who went into labour in a remote village cut off by snow was helped by farmers and off-duty midwives after a call for help was made on social media. Ashleigh Lisa was trapped in her house at Balgedie near Kinross when she went into labour during the night. Off-duty midwives offered to help and were taken to the house by tractor after local farmers responded. Ashleigh had a baby boy at home after midwives arrived just in time. Emma Niven, whose husband Rob was one of the first to get involved with his tractor, said: ""It's just been the most magical morning. ""An emergency message went out on Facebook looking for midwives for our neighbour who was in the late stages of labour and was stuck. ""We just couldn't get her out and nobody could get to her so we got the tractors out and negotiated a couple of midwives and brought them to her just in time at a critical stage where the baby's head was actually stuck. ""So all has turned out well but oh my goodness what a morning."" A team of paramedics helped take the baby to hospital Bronda Henderson, the baby's grandmother, managed to get to her daughter's house through fields by tractor. She said: ""I can't believe it's happened but mother and baby are doing fine. ""We have two midwives here and our neighbour who is a doctor and everyone in the community has been fantastic. ""All the farmers and neighbours in the area have cleared roads and fields to get here. ""Its been absolutely amazing and I can't thank the community enough, they have been fantastic. ""I'm just relieved my daughter and my new grandson are OK and grateful to everyone around who tried so hard to get help here this morning, just remarkable.""

"From L-R: Umar Ahmed Haque, Abuthaher Mamun and Nadeem Patel in court A part-time religious teacher who tried to groom children to become future suicide attackers has been convicted of preparing acts of terrorism. Umar Ahmed Haque, 25, was dragged from the dock at the Old Bailey shouting support for the Islamic State group. He had been inspired to carry out an atrocity by the 2017 Westminster Bridge attack. He had taken limited steps towards fulfilling that plan and sought to radicalise children in a small mosque. Police believe he came into contact with more than 100 children, some of whom have received deradicalisation support. Haque was arrested two weeks before the London Bridge and Borough Market attack. Also convicted at the Old Bailey on Friday were: Abuthaher Mamun, accused of helping Haque research and finance the plans Haque's confidante, Muhammad Abid, who failed to alert the police Haque had also been charged with showing an extremist video to children at the Lantern of Knowledge School in east London, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on that count. He had already admitted charges of possessing IS-related extremist material and showing extremist videos to children at the Ripple Road mosque in Barking. A fourth defendant, Nadeem Patel, was found not guilty of conspiring with Haque to get hold of a gun for a terror plot. He admitted before the trial the illegal possession of a blank-firing gun. Big Ben and Heathrow Airport were among Haque's targets In hours of secret recordings from March 2017, played to the trial, Haque eulogised Khalid Masood, the man who had just carried out the first of 2017's terrorism attacks on London - and he outlined to his friend Muhammad Abid his ambitious plans to do the same with the help of radicalised London children. Haque told his friend that they would be a ""death squad sent by Allah"" and he aspired to attack Big Ben, Westfield shopping centres, Heathrow Airport and other locations, as well as the media, Shia Muslims, far-right groups and the Queen's guard. He bragged of enlisting children as young as 11 and the trial heard that he had played them so-called Islamic State videos showing beheadings to encourage them to buy into his ideology. ""I built such a closer trust [with the children] especially the Barking lot,"" claimed Haque. ""Just pray for my protection. No one has broken their vow."" Police found Haque had been teaching religion in two locations during the time he was under investigation: The Lantern of Knowledge school in east London, from 2015 to early 2016 The Ripple Road mosque in Barking from late 2016 until his arrest He had also taught from 2012 onwards at another east London Islamic school, but there was no evidence in the trial that he had sought to brainwash children during while there. He had no formal teaching qualifications. At Ripple Road mosque, where he worked as an administrator, Haque staged role-playing games in which boys as young as 11 were ordered to pretend to be part of an attack on London. Police say many of the children were too frightened to tell their parents  - particularly after Haque showed them a video of a decomposed boy, warning they would end the same way if they did not swear to become martyrs. The key evidence in the case came from six children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, but agreed to tell the police what had happened. In a video-recorded police interview, the court heard from a young boy. ""He is teaching us terrorism, like how to fight,"" he said. ""If you fight for the sake of Allah, on Judgment Day, when you get judged for your good deeds and bad deeds, fighting is good. ""He wants a group of 300 men. He's training us now so by the time I'm in Year 10 [14 to 15 years old] we will be physically strong enough to fight."" Haque may have radicalised about 110 children, 35 of which are receiving long-term safeguarding support, said Commander Dean Haydon, head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police. ""Haque paralysed those children through fear - showing them really distressing videos,"" he said, ""We faced a wall of silence as a result. It was very challenging to fully understand what was going on in those classrooms."" First page of the orange notebook recovered from Umar Haque's room Umar Haque became a priority for the security services after he was stopped from leaving the UK in April 2016 because of suspicions he was heading to Syria. The security services continued to monitor him, including recording his conversations, and police arrested him as his plans, and the research steps he had taken, emerged. The Old Bailey trial heard Haque had identified targets and began refining his plans, such as researching methods of attack. Police searches of Haque's home found a notebook detailing his beliefs in martyrdom and an attack to-do list including, ""purchase weapons, purchase a van, development recruitment pack"". His co-accused Abuthaher Mamun was charged with helping by trying to raise funds through investments. But it was only after Haque's arrest that clear evidence emerged of his contact with children. The BBC asked the Lantern of Knowledge school, which is Ofsted inspected, what it knew of Haque's activities but it declined to comment other than to stress that it treated the safety and welfare of the pupils with the utmost importance. ""The Lantern of Knowledge Educational Trust... adheres to statutory guidance for the safe recruitment of staff,"" it said. How Haque became a religious teacher at Ripple Road mosque is also unclear. He was employed as administrator but then began to teach religious lessons to children. The BBC has sought a response from the mosque's trustees but has not received one. Haque will be sentenced towards the end of March.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' European Union officials have said they will respond ""firmly"" if US President Donald Trump presses ahead with his plan for steep global duties on metals. EU trade chiefs are considering slapping 25% tariffs on around $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) of imports from the US, Reuters news agency reports. World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said: ""A trade war is in no one's interests."" The rhetoric ramped up as Mr Trump tweeted that ""trade wars are good"". International condemnation has greeted the US president's Thursday announcement that he plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminium next week. The European Union is reported to be considering retaliatory tariffs, targeting US steel, agriculture and other products. European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker promised to react firmly. ""We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,"" he said. Speaking to a German TV programme, he vowed: ""We will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levi's."" French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said there would ""only be losers"" in a US-EU trade war. Mr Le Maire vowed a ""strong, co-ordinated and united response from the EU"". Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade By Theo Leggett, business correspondent If trade wars really were good and easy to win, the World Trade Organisation probably wouldn't exist. Most countries believe that negotiations are best carried out and disputes settled through a rules-based system. Introducing trade barriers on a tit-for-tat basis has the potential to harm companies on both sides. But that's unlikely to bother Mr Trump. His campaign rhetoric drew heavily on the perceived threat to traditional US industries from foreign interlopers acting unfairly. He's simply continuing in that vein. And it's unlikely to register much with the steelworkers of Pennsylvania and Indiana. Concerned about their jobs and the future, many will welcome Mr Trump's comments. Mr Trump tweeted on Friday morning that the US was ""losing billions of dollars on trade"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". Allow Twitter content?

Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and ultimately raise prices for consumers. But US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross used a can of Campbell's Soup to defend the tariffs on Friday morning as ""no big deal"". He told CNBC the duties would have a negligible effect on the price of a tin, amounting to less than a cent. ""Who in the world is going to be too bothered?"" he said. The US buys 15% of UK steel exports Canada, Mexico, China, Japan and Brazil also say they are considering retaliatory steps. The prime minister of Canada - which exports more steel to the US than any other country - slammed the tariffs as ""absolutely unacceptable"". Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ontario he is ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". This video can not be played Pascal Lamy, ex-head of the World Trade Organisation, says US consumers will pay if tariffs go ahead A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said: ""If all countries followed the example of the United States, [it] will undoubtedly result in a serious impact on the international trade order."" The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Mr Trump's restrictions ""are likely to cause damage not only outside the US, but also to the US economy itself"". Kosei Shindo, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said that the move ""will create a negative chain reaction affecting not only steel but also other products considered to have national security implications"". Many US companies also expressed alarm, including beer brewers, which use aluminium for canned beverages. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the world's largest beer maker, warned that Mr Trump's plan is ""going to put jobs at risk and would be against the US consumer"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump has lamented the decline of the US steel industry, which since 2000 has seen production drop from 112m tons to 86.5m tons in 2016. The number of employees working in the sector has fallen over the same period from 135,000 to 83,600. But experts say far more Americans work in industries that depend on steel products, than are employed in steel plants. Steel mills in 2015 employed about 140,000 Americans, according to census data. But 6.5 million Americans work for manufacturers who make things using steel. US slaps tariffs on Chinese aluminium What could China do in a US trade war? What will Trump's 'America First' policy do?

"Theresa May has delivered her long-awaitedspeech on Brexit,external, giving more details of what she wants from the UK's future trade arrangements with the European Union. Here are some of the key lines from the speech. There was a time when government ministers were suggesting that this was going to be the easiest negotiation in history. That rhetoric has gone. The prime minister suggested that there would be difficult days ahead, and inevitable points of disagreement. The bottom line is that Mrs May still intends to take the UK out of the single market and the customs union. But she emphasised that both sides stand to gain from the successful negotiation of a new partnership, whereas the EU still sees Brexit not as a win-win but as a lose-lose. After the uproar ofthe past couple of days,the prime minister decided that she needed to address Northern Ireland early on. It was a re-statement of what was agreed last December - no hard border with the Republic, but no customs border with the rest of the UK either. The trouble is there wasn't much detail about how that circle can be squared. Later in the speech she did speak about the use of technology at the border and a streamlined customs arrangement or even a new-style customs partnership (but not a customs union). Scepticism about the UK position in Dublin, and elsewhere in Europe, won't have eased all that much. Yes, the prime minister says to the EU, you have a point - we can't just pick off the good bits (although there will be those who argue that she tries to do just that later in the speech). But there was an honest appraisal here of the ""hard facts"" - notably that market access will be less than it is now, and that the UK will still have to take account, in some respects, of the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It was a realistic appraisal of where any successful negotiation is likely to end. On the other hand, the prime minister insisted that the UK will still want to demonstrate that it has taken back control of its money, its border, and its laws. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, but there will be those who point out that the broadest and deepest possible partnership anywhere in the world today is enshrined in the EU's single market and customs union. It was striking in this speech how much of the current relationship Mrs May wants to keep - staying close, for example, to EU regulatory agencies, to environmental and consumer protection laws, and to EU policies on state aid and fair competition. But the prime minister also reserved the right to diverge from EU policies where necessary. In Brussels and elsewhere, that will still be seen as cherry-picking, and will be unacceptable to EU negotiators who are determined to protect theintegrity of the single market,external. This was important. A bonfire of EU regulations is not going to happen. And if the UK can successfully negotiate a new model of associate membership of EU agencies, that regulate chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the aviation industry, large sections of UK business will breathe a sigh of relief. Mrs May offered to pay for access to these agencies, and much of the expertise the EU relies upon is based in the UK. But there will still be disagreements about judicial oversight and the role of the European Court of Justice. It is another reminder of how much there is to negotiate in an extraordinarily short period of time, and why a transition period after Brexit will be so important. Mrs May called for a bold and creative agreement on services - a sector of over-riding importance to the UK economy. She mentioned two sectors in particular - broadcasting and financial services - that have never been properly covered in a free trade agreement before. Her argument is a familiar one - restricting access in all areas of economic activity will hurt you as much as it hurts us. She spoke of the UK and the EU maintaining the same regulations over time while accepting there would be ""consequences"" (loss of market access) if the UK chose a different path. On the one hand, it doesn't sound like ""ambitious managed divergence"" and that may not be acceptable to some supporters of Brexit in the UK. On the other hand, it does mean the UK sticking to some EU rules and not others - and that will not be acceptable in other capitals around Europe. Or as the prime minister said in her speech: ""This is a negotiation and neither of us can have exactly what we want.""

"A major search and rescue operation was launched after the explosion Two men have been arrested by police investigating an explosion in Leicester that killed five people. The men, in their 30s and from East Anglia, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause an explosion. Three members of the same family died when the shop and flat were destroyed on Sunday. Three other men, also in their 30s, werearrested on suspicion of manslaughter on Wednesdayand continue to be questioned by detectives. The latest arrests are also on suspicion of offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Mary Ragoobar and sons Sean (left) and Shane (right) were among the five victims Police earlier said they wanted to speak to any witnesses who saw people going in and out of the shop in the hours before the blast. Mary Ragoobar, 46, and sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, lived in the flat above the Polish supermarket. Five dead as explosion destroys shop Tributes paid to hospice volunteer Sean and Shane, along with along with Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, and Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was working in the shop at the time, have now been officially named as among the dead. The fifth body is still to be formally identified but is believed to be Mary, officers said. A date for an inquest has yet to be set. Five people were also taken to hospital after the blast, one of whom suffered critical injuries. Leah Reek (left) was visiting the flat and Viktorija Ijevleva was working in the shop below The first three arrested come from East Anglia, the North West and the East Midlands, police confirmed. Det Insp Michelle Keen said: ""It's vital that we speak to anyone who may have information about any people they saw coming and going into the supermarket in Hinckley Road in the hours leading up to the explosion. ""Was there anyone in acting strangely or in a suspicious manner? Did you see any vehicles parked up, or being driving in a strange manner in the area around the supermarket?"" She added: ""People lost their lives in the most horrific way on Sunday. We owe it to them to understand the cause of that explosion."" Police said the immediate area surrounding the scene would remain cordoned off for a number of weeks, while safety work was carried out.

"Three women, who say they were groomed into prostitution as teenagers, have won a High Court battle which means they will not have to tell future employers about their soliciting. Fiona Broadfoot said it was a disgrace that she had carried these convictions, while no men who had ""bought and used"" her had faced any consequences. The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) shows a person's criminal record. The Home Office said it was considering the court's decision. Ms Broadfoot, one of the claimants who waived her anonymity in this case, said it had been a long fight, but ""worth it"". ""Finally, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders - it's a vindication,"" she added. The women successfully argued that the disclosure of convictions for working in the sex trade many years ago was disproportionate and a breach of their Article 8 Human Rights - the right to a private life. This video can not be played Fiona Broadfoot spoke to the BBC's Today programme before the ruling, about why her convictions for soliciting have stopped her from moving on The ruling would bring about real change for sex trade survivors ""who should never have been criminalised in the first place"", their lawyer Harriet Wistrich said. Ms Broadfoot, who said she was a child when first put on the streets, said she had carried ""eight pages"" of convictions all her life. The judgment means that any convictions for soliciting will now be ""filtered out"" when it comes to DBS checks - although how this will be done is still to be determined. Allow Twitter content?

The ruling was welcomed by the founding leader of the Women's Equality Party, Sophie Walker, who credited the ""hard work and bravery"" of Ms Broadfoot.

""Unfortunately, the court were not persuaded by our argument that the practice discriminates against women or is in breach of duties with regard to trafficked women,"" she said.

"The couple has been arrested for wilful cruelty to a child A California couple has been arrested for keeping their children in a plywood box in a desert community.

The victims, ages 11, 13 and 14, were malnourished and had been living in the box for four years, according to the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. The couple were arrested for wilful cruelty to a child and await bail.

"Italian restaurant chain Prezzo plans to close about a third of its outlets in an attempt to rescue the business. The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. Prezzo is closing 94 restaurants - including all 33 outlets in its TexMex chain Chimichanga - leaving the firm with 208 sites. The closures aim to repair Prezzo's financial position and allow it to continue trading. Prezzo has entered a restructuring arrangement know as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over Â£300m. It is the latest of a number of restaurant chains to run into difficulties. Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants. Barbecoa, a smaller chain also owned by Jamie Oliver, went into administration earlier this month. The wider retail market is also suffering. The UK arm oftoy retailer Toys R Usandelectronics chain Maplinboth collapsed into administration this week. Businesses on the High Street are facing a tough environment.  Wage growth has not kept up with inflation, which has hit the spending power of shoppers. Business costs such as the National Living Wage are going up, and business rates will rise for many firms in April. Many firms are also facing increasing competition from online sales.

"The intelligence agencies have helped to foil a number of terrorist attacks Previously secret instructions issued by ministers confirm MI5 agents are authorised to engage in law-breaking, human rights campaigners have claimed. The intelligence watchdog has been told to keep under review guidance on use of agents ""who participate in criminality"" and in what cases it can be permitted. The ministerial order was made public following a long-running legal battle. Reprieve called for the guidance to be published, warning authorised crime was the ""most intrusive power"" possible. Campaigners welcomed the publication of a ministerial ""direction"" to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner about the Security Service, commonly known as MI5, which they said followed a seven-month legal fight. But they called for full disclosure of the rules governing the activities of MI5 agents, saying the public deserved to know about illegal activity being undertaken in the name of national security. The order has remained secret since it was first written into law in 2014. In a short written statement to Parliament, No 10 said it was instructing Lord Justice Fulford, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner (IPC), to ""keep under review the application of the security service guidelines on the use of agents who participate in criminality and the authorisations issued in accordance with them"". A 2016 report by the Intelligence Services Commissioner, a post which has since been merged into the IPC, suggested there may be occasions where agents engage in criminal activity in order to gather necessary intelligence ""for example membership of a proscribed organisation or handling stolen goods"". It said that although such activity could never be made lawful, it may be justified for operational reasons and in the ""greater good"" - although it recommended that MI5 should have to meet a public interest test. Far-right 'moving increasingly online' What does Brexit mean for Britain's spies? Although MI5 has never openly admitted infiltrating extremist groups, its director has said the ability of agents to ""work close"" to potential offenders has helped to prevent terrorist attacks. Reprieve said it was the first time ministers had acknowledged the existence of the guidance but they needed to publish it in full immediately. ""We are a long way from having transparency,"" its director Maya Foa said. ""The public and Parliament are still being denied the guidance that says when British spies can commit criminal offences and how far they can go.""

"Keeping lambs warm in the Aga is a long tradition on Ian O'Reilly's farm A farmer is helping his lambs survive the Beast from the East by popping them into his oven. Ian O'Reilly, from Rimington, Lancashire, said 10 minutes in his farmhouse Aga can be a life-saver. But he warned: ""Any more than that and you will be needing the mint sauce with them."" ""I thought one was going to need it yesterday but once we got him inside he was OK. We have a lambing shed to keep the vulnerable ones warm."" Mr O'Reilly, currently in the middle of lambing season, said the sharp fall in temperature presents a real danger to his flock. ""You usually tell a lamb whose core temperature has dropped as they appear listless and weak. ""Once we warm them up they are able to eat and that sustains their increased body temperature."" He said the biggest problem he faces in the current cold snap is not the volume of snow but the large drifts caused by the strong winds which have virtually cut his farm off. Mr O'Reilly said keeping lambs using the cast-iron heat-storing cooker has been a regular practice on the farm since the 1940s.

"Tim has a green cover over his tent in an effort to hide it from passers-by Tim, 22, has been calling a snowy field beside a motorway in north-west London home for the past two years. He lives in a tent that struggles to stay still against the wind on this bitterly cold night. He has an old duvet to keep himself warm and a green tarpaulin to remain as inconspicuous as possible. The sub-zero weather that has swept across the UK has not helped his plight. Tim sleeps rough in a field next to this motorway When temperatures fall below freezing, local authorities have a duty to provide emergency shelter for anyone who is sleeping rough. Tim is standing on the frosty ground in his bare feet. He appears to have frost and snow in his hair. UK snow: Latest updates for Thursday ""I think it's mould to be honest. I haven't got anywhere to shower, so that's how it's become unfortunately."" Tim was standing on the ground in his bare feet in -4Â°C Tim is one of the 4,751 peopleestimated to be sleeping rough in England, according to government figures. That is 15% more than last year. He says his local council has refused to offer him housing, as it believes he has made himself intentionally homeless. Tim says he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a condition that makes it difficult for him to live with other people. ""I've lived in house-shares before and have fallen out with people. They say that's my own fault."" Alan is a 42-year-old military veteran who has been sleeping rough for four years. He says he copes with the cold by turning to alcohol: ""I have a drink now and againâ¦ I don't do needles - I can show you my arms if you want. I don't deal with that rubbish. I just drink. It just gets me to sleep."" His hands tremble violently as he attempts to roll a cigarette. ""I would love to have a night in a shelter,"" says the former Army man, who went on to work as, among other things, a window cleaner. But he points out that when temperatures edge above zero again, he would be back out on the streets. He previously rejected homeless shelters because of the violence. ""It's rife because no-one's managing these things properly. I've been told by a lot of homeless people you're probably better off out here than you are in there."" Alan says he usually chooses to sleep in doorways because he doesn't like to bother people. He's aware of the risks and mentions thehomeless man who, last month, was found deadin Westminster, central London. ""Of course I am frightened of dying. I'm not worried about being attacked, the only thing that's going to hurt me is the weather."" Many rough sleepers become used to their situation and refuse help, support workers say Even during extreme weather rough sleepers are afraid of accepting support, says Jamie Shovlin, an assistant support worker at homeless charity Thames Reach. ""Some people get used to the streets - we call it entrenchment. They're committed to the streets, it's what they know. ""The longer they're out, the more difficult it is to convince them to come off the streets because what you're going to be able to offer them is not necessarily going to be what they want, [or] what they expect."" Mr Shovlin and his colleagues spend the nights during extreme weather seeking out homeless people who are often referred to them by members of the public, and convincing them to visit a shelter. This process takes time and even sub-zero temperatures or the risk of death is not enough to convince many homelesss people that they want to receive help. ""They might have entered into a similar situation previously and had a bad experience, so you're offering them an unknown situation, whereas their current argument would be they know how to deal with the streets,"" he says. Eventually, Mr Shovlin manages to convince Alan to come with him to a nearby shelter. Tim, however, refuses. He insists that he is fine and that -4Â°C is manageable. ""It's quite cold but I'm all right because I've got a duvet, and that helps a lot."" Alan and Tim's names have been changed.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' US President Donald Trump has said ""trade wars are good"", amid controversy over his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. He tweeted that the US was ""losing billions of dollars on trade"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". On Thursday he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. Canada and the EU said they would bring forward their own countermeasures. Mexico, China and Brazil have also said they are considering retaliatory steps. Allow Twitter content?

Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. The news sent shares down around the world on Friday, with Wall Street stock markets opening sharply lower. Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade In a tweet early on Friday, Mr Trump said the US would ""win big"" in a trade war. He later followed this up with further tweets, saying the US must ""protect our country and our workers"" and that the trade deficit left him with no choice on tariffs. Allow Twitter content?

The combative posts follow Thursday's assertion on Twitter,externalthat US steel and aluminium industries had been ""decimated"" by trade policies. ""We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer,"" he said. The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports. Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping from 112m tons to 86.5m tons in 2016, and the number of employees in steel work falling from 135,000 to 83,600 in the same period. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent If trade wars really were good and easy to win, the World Trade Organisation probably wouldn't exist. Most countries believe that negotiations are best carried out and disputes settled through a rules-based system. Introducing trade barriers on a tit-for-tat basis has the potential to harm companies on both sides. But that's unlikely to bother Mr Trump. His campaign rhetoric drew heavily on the perceived threat to traditional US industries from foreign interlopers acting unfairly. He's simply continuing in that vein. And it's unlikely to register much with the steelworkers of Pennsylvania and Indiana. Concerned about their jobs and the future, many will welcome Mr Trump's comments. Mr Trump's tariff announcement has been met with international condemnation, at a time when the US is renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico. Roberto Azevedo, head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said he was ""clearly concerned"" about Mr Trump's plans, saying a trade war ""is in no one's interests."" ""The potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial responses of others,"" he said. A spokesperson for 10 Downing Street said the UK is ""engaging"" with the US on what Mr Trump's tariff announcement means in practice. ""We are particularly concerned by any measures which would impact the UK steel and aluminium industries,"" the spokesperson said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, UK Steel's head of policy Richard Warren said the announced move would have a ""significant impact"" if it went ahead. UK unions worried by Trump tariff The US buys 15% of UK steel exports French economy minister Bruno Le Maire meanwhile said there would ""only be losers"" in a trade war between the US and the EU. Mr Le Maire did however also call for a ""strong, coordinated and united response from the EU"". European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker promised to react firmly. ""We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,"" he said. China also condemned the move, with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson saying: ""If all countries followed the example of the United States, [it] will undoubtedly result in a serious impact on the international trade order.""

"Fed up with the same old arguments? Feel like every day's news is a repeat of the clashes between Leave and Remain from 2016? Surely not, readers of this blog, who, I'm sure, trace every twist and turn with enormous enthusiasm? (OK, maybe not every single day). Well, on Friday, cabinet ministers and Number 10 hope that it will feel like things are finally moving on. After more than a year of the UK government being accused of aiming for an unrealistic shopping list from Brussels, hoping for lots of cake and eating every last crumb, on Friday - to employ the exhausted metaphor - a member of the Cabinet told me it will feel like ""Theresa May being honest with the public"", complete with some ""hard truths"". For the prime minister there are two priorities. Can Mrs May persuade the EU that she ""gets it""? The first, to show the European Union that what she wants is credible, that despite all the Tory infighting, the different demands from various factions in her party, that she gets it. ""We know what we want and we understand your principles, we have a shared interest in getting this right,"" she'll say. For months on the EU side there has been hunger for more acknowledgement from the UK that we cannot have everything and keep all the benefits of the EU membership that we fancy, with none of the cost. To that end, I understand that there will be much more than just language that promises a sense of realism but detail, including proposals potentially to keep associate membership of various European agencies in sectors of the economy like aviation or the pharmaceutical industry. One minister said: ""We will have to abide by the rules to get maximum access"" to the markets. Politically that's impossible for Theresa May at home, without the other element of what sound like increasingly detailed proposals: The right to do our own thing after Brexit, and have that assurance spelt out explicitly when we leave. It's expected the prime minister will outline more clearly her proposals for a system of independent arbitration so that the UK is no longer subject to the direct judgements of the European Court. She will, it's said, rule out a situation where the UK has to follow EU law with no say, as a simple ""rule taker"". We would theoretically therefore, have the right to choose not to be bound by EU rules where it doesn't suit. There are still huge questions over whether this whole approach is acceptable to the EU at all. The broad aim of ""managed divergence"" has been pushed back many times. But an admission from Theresa May that she won't get things all her own way could start to shift the dial. With the EU's tone hardening in recent days, insiders say the UK needs to show some of the government's red lines can fade to pink, if there is to be real progress in the talks. Will there be anything like the level of detail, or potential compromise spelled out that Brussels wants? Will Mr Barnier's team suddenly determine that the UK's approach is now workable? It is unlikely, surely, that one speech can suddenly transform the situation. But senior figures in government are hopeful this will be a step forward, even if it is ""incremental"", as one minister described it, that can get the wheels moving again. At the Cabinet meeting on Thursday every member present was invited to chip in their views, and Theresa May indicated that she would go away and perhaps make some final tweaks to the script. What won't change, even if a few of the phrases are sharpened or softened up, is the second priority she is trying to achieve. Alongside the message to the EU, is a message to the country. Don't expect new solutions to the Irish border, in the PM's speech It's not just in the Conservative Party that the debate over Brexit has been brutal.  Whether online or in real life, the tone has often been ugly, words and accusations hurled around like confetti, MPs being sent death threats, a passionate coarseness to the debate. Surely for most people, however they voted, that's not just divisive and unpleasant, but a total turn-off. In the speech therefore, the prime minister will try to bring the country together, to move on from those important, but tired arguments between Leave and Remain. I'm told she'll emphasise her commitment to the union too, and you're unlikely to lose a bet if you guess that she'll evokeher first big speech on the steps of Downing Street, her hope to use the referendum as a moment for bigger social change for the country. There is a danger of course with any""big speech"", that has been much anticipated, much discussed before a word has been uttered. Can it live up to its billing? Will it be heard as the prime minister intends it? Don't expect any new details or solutions to the Irish border, or the clamour for the customs union. The EU and Theresa May's opponents may well still feel irked that she has not untangled what they see as contradictions. But Number 10 hopes the speech will make a difference, and allow the fraught negotiations to move to the next phase.

Guests at the Academy Awards are not expected to replicatethe blackout seen at the Golden Globes in January. Rights activist Tarana Burke said the key was helping survivors of assault. Speaking at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood luncheon ahead of the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday, she told the BBC: ""We have real work to do."" Burke was the first to use the phrase ""Me Too"" as the name for her activist group to help those who had been sexually harassed and assaulted. It transformed into the #MeToo hashtag last year in the wake ofthe Hollywood sexual harassment scandal,external, and subsequently a broader movement. Ava DuVernay, Lupita Nyong'o and Janelle Monae attended the Essence Black Women in Hollywood luncheon Leaders of the Time's Up movement, which has emerged to counteract abuse and inequality,told US media on Thursday,externalthere would be no co-ordinated red carpet protest on Sunday. Instead, they said they had worked with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to plan ""a moment"" during the ceremony to reflect the campaign. Burke added: ""What happened at the Golden Globes was a unique action to an issue that affects people from around the world. ""It's not a gimmick. We have real work to do, making sure survivors have what they need to have to heal. Whether they do something for the Oscars or not doesn't matter to me."" Tessa Thompson and Lena Waithe were honoured at the event Speaking about the impact Me Too has had, she said: ""It's still a little bit overwhelming but I'm definitely humbled by all of this attention. ""I don't really have use for celebrity myself but as far as it elevates this platform and allows me the space to speak about sexual violence to people, then I'm deeply appreciative of that."" Female-led Oscar films âmore profitableâ How did #MeToo shape the Oscar nominations? The stars who did (and didn't) wear black to the Globes The 11th annual Black Women in Hollywood event, organised by Essence magazine, honoured four actresses - Tiffany Haddish, Lena Waithe, Danai Gurira and Tessa Thompson. Ava DuVernay, Lupita Nyong'o and Janelle Monae were among those walking the event's black carpet. Tiffany Haddish was presented with an award by Lil Rel Howery The cast of horror film Get Out, which is nominated for four Oscars, including best picture and best director for Jordan Peele, were also there. Betty Gabriel, who stars as maid Georgina, said: ""I'm a little biased but it's made a big impact. I think it's so unique and well done. ""It has such great vision, it's insane. It speaks to something that we're all aware of but don't really address. We all get something out of the film."" Asked whether the industry is changing, she said: ""I think so. I think it has changed and that's continuing. It's ongoing."" She's going to the Oscars, along with the rest of the cast of Get Out. ""It feels pretty cool. I'm looking forward to hanging out with Meryl Streep,"" Gabriel laughed. Get Out actress Betty Gabriel will be at the Oscars on Sunday She said she'd love Daniel Kaluuya to win best actor for his role as Chris, a man who gets trapped in a nightmare when he meets his girlfriend's family. Gabriel said of his role: ""He breaks your heart. It breaks it wide open."" Lil Rel Howery, who stars as Chris's friend Rod Williams, said of the film's success: ""It's surreal. When you go around Hollywood and see all these posters... I had to park my car when I saw this huge billboard with Daniel with the tears. I had to pull over and stare at it."" Five ways women made a mark in Oscar nominations All you need to know about the best picture nominees How the cast of Skins conquered Hollywood He said there has never been a better time to be black in Hollywood. ""It's such a good time to be a writer, to be a producer, to be black - unapologetic, not afraid to tell our stories. I'm proud of Jordan Peele to have the courage to tell such a crazy story. ""I'm so excited about the Oscars. I'm going to have this moment of looking around."" And as for Kaluuya's chances? ""Daniel's my friend - I think he's got a great chance. He deserves it.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Theresa May has warned that ""no-one will get everything they want"" out of Brexit negotiations but she is confident a deal can be done. Setting out UK hopes for a future EU economic partnership, Mrs May warned both sides had to accept ""hard facts"". Single market access would be ""less than it is now"" and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU said: ""Let's get on with it."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but it wants a transition period lasting around two years after to smooth the way for business. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Mrs May said she was confidentremaining differences over a draft EU legal agreementcould be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be that the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal - but she stressed that the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"". The speech contained a lot of detail on the kind of trading relationship Mrs May wants with the EU after Brexit. Banks located in the City of London will lose the right to trade across EU without country-by-country approval, so-called passporting. A new system will be brought in to allow ""the same regulatory outcomes over time"" Associate membership of EU medicines, chemical and aviation agencies, accepting their rules and making ""appropriate"" financial contributions Parliament would reserve the right to pass its own regulations in these areas but in the knowledge it could threaten co-operation with those bodies Continued participation in EU science, education and cultural programmes, close relationship with Euratom UK to explore continued participation in EU's internal energy market while protecting single energy market on the island of Ireland Independent arbitration mechanism for trade disputes to replace role currently played the European Court of Justice Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management Mutual recognition of broadcasting rules to allow UK channels to continue to be seen in Europe Ensure continuity of rail, maritime and aviation services and of hauliers' access to European markets Keeping UK regulatory standards ""as high as the EU's"" to ensure smooth trade and while UK law may not be ""identical"" to EU law ""it should achieve the same outcomes"" This video can not be played Corbyn: Speech offered ""no clarity and no real sense of priorities"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After 20 wasted months, Theresa May has once again failed to bring real clarity to the negotiations - and worryingly, she admitted that her approach will reduce our access to European markets. ""She read out a long list of problems but failed to provide solutions, particularly on the urgent question of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Attacking Mrs May's suggestion the UK could stick closely to EU state aid rules, he added:  ""Theresa May's only clear priority today seemed to be to tie the UK permanently to EU rules which are used to drive privatisation and block support for British industry."" By BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming A European civil servant said to me recently that Brexit was a fascinating intellectual exercise in rebuilding the existing elements of the UK/EU relationship but with Britain out of the club. Is that the same thing the prime minister proposed today, with the UK retaining associate membership of many of the EU's agencies, choosing to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice where needed, trading freely and maintaining broadly similar economic and social models? One geeky-sounding proposal in particular demonstrates how ambitious - and potentially tricky - this could be. Mrs May said she wanted a bespoke deal for sharing data that went beyond the EU's usual tool of judging third countries' laws to be of equivalent status to Europe's. Yesterday Michel Barnier rejected this idea in advance. The EU chief negotiator tweeted some lukewarm praise today (lukewarm will be more than enough for Downing Street). But the EU's formal reaction will come next week the European Council President Donald Tusk publishes his first draft of guidelines for the phase of Brexit talks where all of this will be tackled. The prime minister called for a free trade agreement covering most sectors of the economy, going further than the deal signed between Canada and the EU but stopping short of Norway which is a member of the European Economic Area. ""We need to strike a new balance. but we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway,"" she said. She again said a hard Irish border or a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be ""unacceptable"" and said it was for the UK and EU to ""work together"" on a solution. She suggested this could be either a customs partnership, where the UK ""mirrors"" EU requirements on goods from around the world, or a streamlined customs arrangement, using technology and ""trusted trader"" schemes to do away with the need for customs checks. Amid criticism from the EU that the UK was attempting to ""cherry-pick"" the best parts of the bloc's rules, she said: ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The speech got a positive reaction from Brexit-backing cabinet ministers, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeting: ""We will remain extremely close to our EU friends and partners - but able to innovate, to set our own agenda, to make our own laws and to do ambitious free trade deals around the world."" But pro-European Tory rebel Anna Soubry told the BBC that Leave voters would be right to question what was in it for them. ""The Brexit we are heading towards is very, very different to the one we were promised,"" she said. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed the speech, saying it provided ""clarity"" about  the UK leaving the single market and customs union and a ""recognition"" that trade-offs will inform future talks on a deal. But the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt was not impressed. He said: ""Theresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations, we can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post. While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake. "" The DUP, whom Mrs May relies on for key Commons votes, welcomed Mrs May's ""clear commitment that she will not countenance any new border being created in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom"". Leader Arlene Foster said she had ""set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK.  Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short."" Business group the CBI tweeted: ""Excellent news if UK can stay in key agencies like EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) - glad PM has focused on them."" The TUC said there was ""still a chasm between the prime minister's rhetoric and reality"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Theresa May has warned that ""no-one will get everything they want"" out of Brexit negotiations but she is confident a deal can be done. Setting out UK hopes for a future EU economic partnership, Mrs May warned both sides had to accept ""hard facts"". Single market access would be ""less than it is now"" and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU said: ""Let's get on with it."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but it wants a transition period lasting around two years after to smooth the way for business. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Mrs May said she was confidentremaining differences over a draft EU legal agreementcould be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be that the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal - but she stressed that the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"". The speech contained a lot of detail on the kind of trading relationship Mrs May wants with the EU after Brexit. Banks located in the City of London will lose the right to trade across EU without country-by-country approval, so-called passporting. A new system will be brought in to allow ""the same regulatory outcomes over time"" Associate membership of EU medicines, chemical and aviation agencies, accepting their rules and making ""appropriate"" financial contributions Parliament would reserve the right to pass its own regulations in these areas but in the knowledge it could threaten co-operation with those bodies Continued participation in EU science, education and cultural programmes, close relationship with Euratom UK to explore continued participation in EU's internal energy market while protecting single energy market on the island of Ireland Independent arbitration mechanism for trade disputes to replace role currently played the European Court of Justice Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management Mutual recognition of broadcasting rules to allow UK channels to continue to be seen in Europe Ensure continuity of rail, maritime and aviation services and of hauliers' access to European markets Keeping UK regulatory standards ""as high as the EU's"" to ensure smooth trade and while UK law may not be ""identical"" to EU law ""it should achieve the same outcomes"" This video can not be played Corbyn: Speech offered ""no clarity and no real sense of priorities"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After 20 wasted months, Theresa May has once again failed to bring real clarity to the negotiations - and worryingly, she admitted that her approach will reduce our access to European markets. ""She read out a long list of problems but failed to provide solutions, particularly on the urgent question of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Attacking Mrs May's suggestion the UK could stick closely to EU state aid rules, he added:  ""Theresa May's only clear priority today seemed to be to tie the UK permanently to EU rules which are used to drive privatisation and block support for British industry."" By BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming A European civil servant said to me recently that Brexit was a fascinating intellectual exercise in rebuilding the existing elements of the UK/EU relationship but with Britain out of the club. Is that the same thing the prime minister proposed today, with the UK retaining associate membership of many of the EU's agencies, choosing to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice where needed, trading freely and maintaining broadly similar economic and social models? One geeky-sounding proposal in particular demonstrates how ambitious - and potentially tricky - this could be. Mrs May said she wanted a bespoke deal for sharing data that went beyond the EU's usual tool of judging third countries' laws to be of equivalent status to Europe's. Yesterday Michel Barnier rejected this idea in advance. The EU chief negotiator tweeted some lukewarm praise today (lukewarm will be more than enough for Downing Street). But the EU's formal reaction will come next week the European Council President Donald Tusk publishes his first draft of guidelines for the phase of Brexit talks where all of this will be tackled. The prime minister called for a free trade agreement covering most sectors of the economy, going further than the deal signed between Canada and the EU but stopping short of Norway which is a member of the European Economic Area. ""We need to strike a new balance. but we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway,"" she said. She again said a hard Irish border or a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be ""unacceptable"" and said it was for the UK and EU to ""work together"" on a solution. She suggested this could be either a customs partnership, where the UK ""mirrors"" EU requirements on goods from around the world, or a streamlined customs arrangement, using technology and ""trusted trader"" schemes to do away with the need for customs checks. Amid criticism from the EU that the UK was attempting to ""cherry-pick"" the best parts of the bloc's rules, she said: ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The speech got a positive reaction from Brexit-backing cabinet ministers, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeting: ""We will remain extremely close to our EU friends and partners - but able to innovate, to set our own agenda, to make our own laws and to do ambitious free trade deals around the world."" But pro-European Tory rebel Anna Soubry told the BBC that Leave voters would be right to question what was in it for them. ""The Brexit we are heading towards is very, very different to the one we were promised,"" she said. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed the speech, saying it provided ""clarity"" about  the UK leaving the single market and customs union and a ""recognition"" that trade-offs will inform future talks on a deal. But the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt was not impressed. He said: ""Theresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations, we can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post. While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake. "" The DUP, whom Mrs May relies on for key Commons votes, welcomed Mrs May's ""clear commitment that she will not countenance any new border being created in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom"". Leader Arlene Foster said she had ""set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK.  Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short."" Business group the CBI tweeted: ""Excellent news if UK can stay in key agencies like EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) - glad PM has focused on them."" The TUC said there was ""still a chasm between the prime minister's rhetoric and reality"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Paul Moore entered no defence to the allegations A man has been convicted of the attempted murder of a Somali woman after knocking her over in his car and then going back to run her over as she lay helpless on the ground. Mother-of-nine Zaynab Hussein suffered life-changing injuries in the attack in Leicester last September. Her life was saved after extensive specialist surgery but she remains confined to a bed. Paul Moore, 21, from Leicester, was found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court. Jurors also convicted him of the attempted grievous bodily harm of a 12-year-old Somali girl, for trying to drive into her minutes after the first attack. Moore - who has previous convictions and was on bail for a charge of causing grievous bodily harm when he was arrested for the attack - looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out. In the hours leading up to the attack, which happened five days after the Parsons Green attack in London, Moore had been drinking heavily with friends. Scene of the attack: Zaynab Hussein hit the wall of this house, after Moore drove at her Mrs Hussein was returning home after dropping off her two youngest children at school when she was knocked down. She was thrown by the force of the impact into the wall of a house in the Beaumont Leys area of Leicester. In two witness statements provided from her hospital bed, she said she could feel blood on her forehead and had lost sensation in her limbs, believing them to be broken. She tried to reach her mobile phone to call family and was crying for help. Two drivers stopped to ask if she needed help, but then drove on. Mrs Hussein was left with a fractured pelvis, spine and multiple other injuries including severe breaks to her limbs. Two young men who had been in the car told police that Moore, who is unemployed, had told them he wanted to run someone over. After he first hit Mrs Hussein, sending her flying, the pair jumped out of the still-moving car. Moore performed a U-turn to return to the scene. He drove past Mrs Hussein and seeing her on the ground, he turned the car around, mounted the pavement and drove over her with all four wheels. He then drove off again and spotted a 12-year-old Somali girl, identified by him as a Muslim because of her headscarf, walking to school with her cousin. Moore drove at her, apparently mounting the pavement again, but this time he clipped her side, sending her bag flying. The girl was unharmed but shaken. During the trial, the jury heard that after the attack Moore turned up severely drunk at the home of his half-brother, Lewis Welsh, and told him in offensive, racist terms, why he had attacked the woman. Paul Moore in a picture taken weeks before his attack ""I don't think he knew what he was saying or doing. But he did tell me that he had ran over a 'Paki',"" said Mr Welsh. ""He tried to put it down to the London 7/7 bombings. He said he was proud of himself. He was rambling. He was doing the country a favour."" Mrs Hussein remains in pain and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries - including returning to hospital for more surgery. She and her husband are too scared to talk publicly about what happened but the wider Muslim community in the Beaumont Leys area remains in shock. Community in fear: Activists say Muslim women in Leicester are scared they too will be targeted ""Everyone has been talking about how this happened - and why,"" said Zuleika, a community activist in Leicester. She, like all the others the BBC spoke to, asked to remain anonymous because they are scared there could be another attack. ""We are just asking ourselves who is going to be next. We have found out about other parents who have been insulted because they are Muslim. Some of them are scared and afraid to raise their voice - for every woman in this community, we now have the same fear."" Paul Moore pleaded denied attempted murder but gave the court no defence to the accusation that his crime was motivated by hate. National statistics show that hate crime appears to have been rising over the last two years: There were 80,393 offences in 2016-17 in England and Wales That's up from 62,518 in 2015-16 The rise was the largest increase since the Home Office began recording the figures in 2011-12 Part of the rise was down to better reporting but police were also sure there were spikes after major moments of tension. The most significant of these were the EU Referendum in June 2016 and the terrorism attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. The Parsons Green London Underground attack came outside of the period for these statistics - but Moore's attempted murder of Mrs Hussein occurred five days later. Azhar Qayum of Mend, a campaign organisation tackling Islamophobia, said women were particularly vulnerable to attacks, alongside elderly men, because they tended to be more visible. ""What's happened to Mrs Hussen is very serious - but it is not an isolated case,"" he said. ""There has been a long line of very serious crimes like this. We have had the Islamophobic murder ofMohammed Saleemin Birmingham, we have the Islamophobic murder ofMushin Ahmed in Rotherham, an 81-year-old grandfather. ""And we have had the attack last year on worshippers at Finsbury Park. Although this is very serious, this level of seriousness is not isolated.""

"This video can not be played Passenger Robert Luther described how everyone was pretty cold and miserable Passengers were stuck for up to 14 hours when at least three trains ground to a halt as freezing conditions hit lines in the New Forest in Hampshire. But what is it like to be one of the unlucky few, spending the night in a cold carriage full of strangers with no way out? Robert Luther was among about 100 passengers on a five-carriage train which left London Waterloo bound for Weymouth early on Thursday evening. The electric train ground to a halt near New Milton, Hampshire, due to ice on the conductor rail. With the line blocked, other services backed up. The situation was ""unbelievable"", he said. ""A chap had a packet of biscuits - people shared what they've got. ""It's fortunate people had winter clothing - it looked like we were going on ski trip. We haven't had fresh water or heating since 8-9pm. ""The toilet pans were full up and we couldn't get off the train either. ""It shouldn't happen in this day and age, it's not as if we've got three-foot of snow on the tracks."" They were eventually rescued at about 08:00 GMT on Friday. Passengers posted pictures on social media showing their frustrations Phillip Brown, who was travelling home from London on a 17:05 South Western Railway service said: ""It prevents you from sleeping when you get that cold, so it was a case of walking up and down to get some temperature back and keep warm. ""People were taking it in their stride, but I felt sorry for the guard and the driver. They weren't getting any information."" Phillip Brown was given a free bottle of water when he eventually arrived at Bournemouth station after 14 hours on the train Harold Hanna, from Barton on Sea, was stuck with 50 other passengers on the line between Sway and New Milton. He said that, despite the chilly conditions, he had made some new friends as the ""Dunkirk spirit"" flourished among his fellow passengers. Others posted pictures on social media showing them trying to bed down for the night. Passengers tried to bed down for the night Martin Hemmingway was stuck on a CrossCountry train and had an altogether different experience. ""CrossCountry were brilliant,"" he said. We were fed and watered and warm through the night, I've nothing but praise for them. The staff were wonderful."" A 'rescue train' picked up stranded passengers South Western Railway issued a statement earlier apologising to passengers. It said: ""Passengers will be taken to Bournemouth station where we have staff waiting to give them hot food and drinks."" The firm said it ""sincerely apologised"" to the stranded passengers and organised a train to rescue them. The company said it would be closing down its service by 20:00 GMT on Friday and urged people not to attempt to travel.

"This video can not be played Carney calls for crypto-currency regulation Crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin should be regulated to crack down on illegal activities and protect the financial system, Mark Carney warned. The Bank of England governor said their inherent risks meant investments in digital currencies could lose money. ""The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system,""Mr Carney said in a speech,externalon Friday. Crypto-currencies do not yet pose risks to financial stability, he said. But he said that could change if more people began investing in them. Although some countries have banned them, Mr Carney said regulation would be a better approach. ""A better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system,"" he said. If the world of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin are the Wild West, a new sheriff just swaggered into town. Bank of England governor Mark Carney laid down the law today with a withering assessment of Bitcoin's qualifications to be described as money and a warning that, if allowed to grow unchecked, it could threaten financial stability. Sheriff Carney says it fails as money because it is wildly volatile, poorly understood, inefficient and not widely accepted. Digital currencies threaten stability because people may invest substantial amounts - mistakenly believing they are regulated - causing further loss of faith in the financial system if they collapse. The evangelists of crypto-currencies will dismiss Mr Carney's assessment as the predictable response of a financial establishment that Bitcoin threatens. If Governor Carney has his way, they will be saying: I fought the law and the law won. China has cracked down hard on crypto-currencies,banning initial coin offeringsandshutting down Bitcoin exchanges. Indonesia and Bangladesh have banned Bitcoin as a payment tool, and India's central bank hasissued a number of warnings about Bitcoin risks. However, Mr Carney said that the technology on which crypto-currencies are based ""could potentially catalyse innovations to serve the public better"". Blockchain technology could be used to make payments more flexible, efficient and reliable. ""They point the way to where the system has to go"" by allowing peer-to-peer transactions, he said. He said the Bank ""has an open mind"" about the eventual development of a central bank digital currency, but he said it ""shouldn't be a solution in search of a problem or an effort of central bankers to be down with the kids"". Digital currencies can allow anonymous transactions and carry risks including money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion. But in terms of regulation, ""if there's a will there's a way"", Mr Carney said. ""It's relatively straightforward."" Crypto-currency trade body Crypto UK said it supported new regulation, but said that policymakers should not try to adapt existing financial rules to digital currencies. ""This shouldn't be viewed as a crackdown, but an opportunity to establish parameters that protect consumers while encouraging the biggest and best crypto-currency businesses to make the UK their home,"" a spokesperson said.

"This video can not be played Gareth Williams' 999 call: ""She isn't pregnant. Oh, she's actually giving birth"" A woman who thought she was suffering from severe stomach pain gave birth to a baby boy while her partner was calling 999 for an ambulance. Baby Phillip Alan was born weighing 4lb 13oz to surprised Rhiannon Oldham, 30, from Pontypool, south Wales, who had no idea she was pregnant. She delivered the baby at the home she shares with Gareth Williams three days after their Valentine's Day engagement. The family have now met the ambulance crew who helped them. MOT examiner Mr Williams, 34, explained how how his wife had had stomach pains the day before his son had arrived. He called the Welsh Ambulance Service the following day when things became worse. Dad 'knelt in snow' to help deliver baby Mum thanks 999 call handler who helped save baby Baby is born at railway station ""I had to carry her from the bathroom to the bedroom, and that's when I could see that something strange was happening,"" he said. ""I called 999 and I told them there was something seriously wrong with my girlfriend, and within minutes Rhiannon had actually given birth. ""It was a huge shock because we had absolutely no idea that she was pregnant, but we're over the moon."" Call centre worker Ms Oldham said: ""Just before Christmas I had what I thought was heartburn but I just took a Rennie and got on with it. ""I'd put on weight over Christmas too, but I just put it down to overindulging. ""The last couple of weeks have been a blur. One minute we were planning for a wedding - now we're planning for a nursery."" Ambulance call handler Chelsie Holbrook, who took the couple's 999 call from its contact centre in Cwmbran, said: ""The alarm bells started to ring for me when Gareth said that Rhiannon had a large lump, and before we knew it she had actually given birth. ""I've delivered five babies in my time as a call handler, and this one's definitely up there in terms of the most dramatic."" Paramedic Paul Ockenden and student paramedic Sian Todd were first to arrive at the couple's home. Mr Ockenden said: ""It's fair to say they were a little shell shocked, but we set about making the necessary checks and then Gareth cut the cord.""

"This video can not be played Motorists and pedestrians in Ukraine struggle with snow after heavy falls Large parts of Europe have endured another night of freezing conditions as a Siberian weather system continues to bring chaos. Blizzards and heavy snowfall have closed roads, rail services and schools and forced the cancellations of hundreds of flights. The unusually cold spell is being felt as far south as the Mediterranean. The number of weather-related deaths rose to as many as 55 with 21 victims in Poland, most of them rough sleepers. It triggered a warning from the World Health Organization that the poor, the homeless and migrants would be hardest hit by the big freeze. ""Those most at risk of cold-related illness include elderly people, children, and people who have chronic diseases or physical or mental limitations,"" it said as a statement. Live updates: UK braced for more snow Troops rescue drivers from Storm Emma Reality Check: Is snow getting rarer? The weather system has been given various nicknames - in the UK it is ""the Beast from the East"" while the Dutch call it the ""Siberian bear"" and Swedes the ""snow cannon"". Snow has even appeared on the normally balmy beaches of the French Riviera. This video can not be played How to keep warm? Tips from cold countries Ireland remains braced for what is predicted to be its heaviest snowfall in decades as Storm Emma moves in from the south. Flights in and out of Dublin airport were suspended with service disruptions expected to continue until Saturday at the earliest. Heavy snow near Montpellier, southern France, made roads and pavements treacherous Some stranded families in Montpellier had to bed down in reception centres The airport in the Swiss city of Geneva was forced to shut down on Thursday morning but was reopened after the runway was cleared using snow ploughs. In France, about 2,000 drivers were stranded on a motorway near the city of Montpellier, with some complaining of being stuck for as long as 24 hours. Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was also hit by freezing winds with KLM airlines cancelling or delaying dozens of flights. Dublin Airport has been badly disrupted by snow and strong winds Some rail services operated by Eurostar between London, Paris and Brussels were axed. As well as those in Poland, weather-related casualties were reported as far south as Spain and Italy. Seven people have died since Sunday in Slovakia, AFP news agency reports, and six more in the Czech Republic in recent days. The homeless, like here in Berlin, are most at risk from the cold One of three victims in Spain was a homeless man who had been sleeping in an abandoned truck, officials said. Five people were reported dead in Lithuania, four in France, two each in Serbia, Italy, Slovenia and Romania and one each in the UK and the Netherlands, AFP added. In the French capital, Paris, authorities set up emergency shelters for the city's roughly 3,000 homeless. Ukraine, which has further snowstorms forecast in the days to come, has found itself in a fresh row with Russia over gas supplies. The Russian state-run gas giant Gazprom said it would not restart gas shipments - expected on Thursday - because agreements had not been finalised. The shipments would have been the first from Russia since 2015. It's snowing - Can I refuse to go to work?

Moscow and Kiev have been at loggerheads since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Some parts of Europe are expected to see temperatures rise over the next couple of days, although Ireland and parts of southern England are braced for the effects of Storm Emma which is moving up from Portugal and France. On Thursday, Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar urged people to stay indoors until the storm passed later on Friday.

"Former Tesco executives Chris Bush (left), John Scouler (centre) and Carl Rogberg (right) The Serious Fraud Office will seek a retrial of three former Tesco executives accused of fraud and false accounting. The original trial was halted at the start of February after Carl Rogberg, Tesco's former UK finance chief, suffered a heart attack. Mr Rogberg, Chris Bush, Tesco's former UK head, and former commercial food director John Scouler deny the charges. The case relates to a Â£246m accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. The three men are accused of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting between February and September 2014. Mr Rogberg's lawyer Neil O'May said that his client ""is extremely disappointed by this decision"".

In Ukraine, all schools and higher education institutions were told to close in an effort to save gas, after its Russian supplier refused to deliver more fuel. Energy giant Gazprom said it was severing its contracts with Ukraine after a Stockholm court ruled against it in a long-running legal battle. In Poland, most of the victims were rough sleepers. The deaths are partially attributed to a combination of the severe cold and alcohol consumption by homeless people, who drink hoping to warm up, the BBC's Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton reports. When the night time temperature is -15C (5F), as it has been all week in the Polish capital, this is a deadly combination, our correspondent adds.

"National Grid's first ""gas deficit warning"" for eight years has been withdrawn after supplies increased. The network operator issued the warning on Thursday, saying it might not have enough gas to meet demand due to the current cold snap gripping the UK. The warning was a call to the market to boost supplies. National Grid said it did not anticipate having to issue a new warning on Friday, but would do if supplies dropped off again. Army called in as Storm Emma hits the UK Latest updates as blizzards and snow hit the UK It's snowing - can I refuse to go to work? A National Grid spokesperson said:,external""The market has continued to respond over the last 24 hours and we have seen an increase of supplies into the network. ""As the extremely cold weather continues we expect to see high demand on the gas network, so we are continuing to monitor developments closely. ""Protecting customer supplies is always our first priority and we would like to reassure them that this high demand has not affected their domestic gas supplies"". The sub-zero temperatures and snowy conditions in the UK have caused a spike in demand for gas from consumers and businesses. National Grid has seen its highest demand for gas for six years in the past week. That increase in demand was coupled with unplanned outages to supplies coming from Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, leading to the National Grid warning. Suppliers responded to Thursday's warning by pumping more gas into the system, and some large businesses agreed with their energy suppliers to use less gas. National Grid can ask large businesses to scale back gas usage, but in this case, reductions in gas use by industry were done through commercial contracts with suppliers. Supplies to domestic consumers were not affected. In recent years the UK has become more reliant on gas imports. Gas-fired power stations are taking up the slack as coal-fired power stations are decommissioned. In addition, a large North Sea gas storage facility called Rough is in the process of being closed down due to safety concerns.

"This video can not be played Largest population of penguins found in Antarctic Peninsula Scientists have stumbled across a huge group of previously unknown AdÃ©lie penguins on the most northerly point of the Antarctic Peninsula. Numbering more than 1.5 million birds, they were first noticed when great patches of their poo, or guano, showed up in pictures taken from space. The animals are crammed on to a rocky archipelago called the Danger Islands. The researchers, who detail the discoveryin the journal Scientific Reports,external, say it is a total surprise. ""It's a classic case of finding something where no-one really looked! The Danger Islands are hard to reach, so people didn't really try that hard,"" team-member Dr Tom Hart from Oxford University, UK, told BBC News. King penguins face warming challenge Counting South Georgia's whales Poo sediments record 'penguin Pompeii' Drone pictures were one of the most efficient means of counting The scientists used an algorithm to search images from the American Landsat spacecraft for sites of possible penguin activity. Landsat does not return especially high-resolution pictures and so when the system flagged potential colonies, they had to be followed up with much sharper pictures for confirmation. ""And the sheer size of what we were looking at took our breath away,"" said Dr Heather Lynch from Stony Brook University, New York. ""We thought, 'Wow! If what we're seeing is true, these are going to be some of the largest AdÃ©lie penguin colonies in the world, and it's going to be well worth our while sending in an expedition to count them properly."" UK snow: Latest updates for Friday Teaching computing without computers Diabetes is 'five separate diseases' The drones flew grid lines over the penguin nests But, as the name implies, the Danger Islands are notoriously difficult to reach. Even in the austral summer, the ocean surrounding the archipelago is filled with the kind of thick sea-ice that ships try to avoid. However, in December 2015, the team did manage to get on the ground to begin its count. And one of the most effective techniques was to deploy drones, which flew above the birds to make large mosaics of their nesting sites. ""The drone lets you fly in a grid over the island, taking pictures once per second. You can then stitch them together into a huge collage that shows the entire landmass in 2D and 3D,"" explained Prof Hanumant Singh from Northeastern University. These are dangerous waters - hence the name of the islands Once again, trained software was called upon to do the actual counting. The survey revealed that the Danger Islands host in total 751,527 pairs of AdÃ©lie penguins, including the third and fourth largest colonies in the world. The result is of major significance because it would appear the archipelago has somehow avoided the recent AdÃ©lie declines documented elsewhere on the peninsula, particularly on its western side. Scientists suspect that decline has something to do with reductions in sea-ice, which is an important habitat for krill, the small crustaceans that form a key part of the penguin diet. Sea-ice is important to these birds because it is a recruitment habitat for krill Dr Hart commented: ""On the West Antarctic Peninsula, Adelie and chinstrap penguins are declining pretty fast, while Gentoo penguins are increasing. ""It's hard to know the causes. Clearly climate change and reduction in ice and krill play a part, but a decline in sea-ice also allows in shipping - fisheries in particular - which may exacerbate the problem. ""In the past we've looked at this on the West Antarctic Peninsula versus places like Elephant Island (further to the north). Finally getting into the Danger Islands and counting the penguins shows how robust populations are where the ice is intact."" And Dr Lynch added: ""The other point worth making is that these islands are right in the mix for a couple of marine protected areas that are being proposed. ""Whether they'll be in or out, we don't know but at least now the people making those decisions will understand how important this area is,"" she told BBC News. Dr Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey knows the team but was not involved in this study. He also uses satellites to identify and count animal groups. ""Despite our modern technologically advanced world there are still remote corners that we know very little about - usually because they are extremely difficult to get to,"" he said. ""Modern satellites are fantastic tools for exploring and studying these hard-to-access places. I am sure that there are many other natural discoveries to be made using these 'eyes in the sky'.""

"Could there be five types of diabetes rather than just two? Scientists say diabetes is five separate diseases, and treatment could be tailored to each form. Diabetes - or uncontrolled blood sugar levels - is normally split into type 1 and type 2. But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body's insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results,published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology,external, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Cluster 1 - severe autoimmune diabetes is broadly the same as the classical type 1 - it hit people when they were young, seemingly healthy and an immune disease left them unable to produce insulin Cluster 2 - severe insulin-deficient diabetes patients initially looked very similar to those in cluster 1 - they were young, had a healthy weight and struggled to make insulin, but the immune system was not at fault Cluster 3 - severe insulin-resistant diabetes patients were generally overweight and making insulin but their body was no longer responding to it Cluster 4 - mild obesity-related diabetes was mainly seen in people who were very overweight but metabolically much closer to normal than those in cluster 3 Cluster 5 - mild age-related diabetes patients developed symptoms when they were significantly older than in other groups and their disease tended to be milder Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""This is extremely important, we're taking a real step towards precision medicine. ""In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better."" The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Dr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was ""not a terribly accurate classification system"". She told the BBC: ""This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease."" But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as theincreased risk in South Asians,external. Dr Salem said: ""There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. ""Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow."" Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: ""Clearly this is only the first step. ""We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes."" Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help ""personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future"". She added: ""This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition.""

"This video can not be played Carney calls for crypto-currency regulation Crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin should be regulated to crack down on illegal activities and protect the financial system, Mark Carney warned. The Bank of England governor said their inherent risks meant investments in digital currencies could lose money. ""The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system,""Mr Carney said in a speech,externalon Friday. Crypto-currencies do not yet pose risks to financial stability, he said. But he said that could change if more people began investing in them. Although some countries have banned them, Mr Carney said regulation would be a better approach. ""A better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system,"" he said. If the world of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin are the Wild West, a new sheriff just swaggered into town. Bank of England governor Mark Carney laid down the law today with a withering assessment of Bitcoin's qualifications to be described as money and a warning that, if allowed to grow unchecked, it could threaten financial stability. Sheriff Carney says it fails as money because it is wildly volatile, poorly understood, inefficient and not widely accepted. Digital currencies threaten stability because people may invest substantial amounts - mistakenly believing they are regulated - causing further loss of faith in the financial system if they collapse. The evangelists of crypto-currencies will dismiss Mr Carney's assessment as the predictable response of a financial establishment that Bitcoin threatens. If Governor Carney has his way, they will be saying: I fought the law and the law won. China has cracked down hard on crypto-currencies,banning initial coin offeringsandshutting down Bitcoin exchanges. Indonesia and Bangladesh have banned Bitcoin as a payment tool, and India's central bank hasissued a number of warnings about Bitcoin risks. However, Mr Carney said that the technology on which crypto-currencies are based ""could potentially catalyse innovations to serve the public better"". Blockchain technology could be used to make payments more flexible, efficient and reliable. ""They point the way to where the system has to go"" by allowing peer-to-peer transactions, he said. He said the Bank ""has an open mind"" about the eventual development of a central bank digital currency, but he said it ""shouldn't be a solution in search of a problem or an effort of central bankers to be down with the kids"". Digital currencies can allow anonymous transactions and carry risks including money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion. But in terms of regulation, ""if there's a will there's a way"", Mr Carney said. ""It's relatively straightforward."" Crypto-currency trade body Crypto UK said it supported new regulation, but said that policymakers should not try to adapt existing financial rules to digital currencies. ""This shouldn't be viewed as a crackdown, but an opportunity to establish parameters that protect consumers while encouraging the biggest and best crypto-currency businesses to make the UK their home,"" a spokesperson said.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' The main trading partners of the US have reacted angrily after President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Canada and the EU said they would bring forward their own countermeasures to the steep new tariffs. Mexico, China and Brazil have also said they are weighing up retaliatory steps. Mr Trump tweeted that the US had been ""decimated by unfair trade and bad policy"". He said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%. However, critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately put up prices for consumers. The news sent shares in Asia down on Friday, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing more than 2% by mid-morning. Steel tariffs: what impact will they really have? What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade Shares in Japan's car-making giant Toyota were down more than 2% and Nippon Steel stocks down more than 4%. Toyota said the US decision would ""adversely impact automakers, the automotive supplier community and consumers"". On Friday, China urged the US to ""exercise restraint in using trade protection tools"". President Trump ordered an investigation into the industry last April under a clause of a 1962 law, which grants the White House authority to restrict imports in the face of a national security threat. The Commerce Department report found that imports were harming the domestic steel and aluminium industries, and could affect the defence industry, the Washington Post reported. The decision on imposing tariffs rests with the President and does not need Congressional approval. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the tariffs would put thousands of European jobs at risk. ""We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures,"" he said. ""The EU will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests."" In Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, trade minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said any tariffs would be ""unacceptable"". Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said Canada would take ""responsive measures"" if restrictions were imposed but did not give details. Richard Warren, head of policy at the UK Steel trade association, said the proposed hike would have a ""significant impact"" on the UK, as the US accounts for about 15%  of UK steel exports. In other reaction: Brazil, also a large steel exporter to the US, threatened ""multilateral or bilateral"" action to protect its interests Australia's trade minister Steven Ciobo said the imposition of such tariffs would distort trade ""and ultimately... lead to a loss of jobs"" Germany's steel industry federation, WV Stahl, said the US measures violated the rules of the World Trade Organization and would have a major impact on Germany's steel market On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: ""If all countries follow the example of the United States, this will undoubtedly result in a serious impact on the international trade order"", according to AFP news agency. Li Xinchuang, vice-secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Association, said the impact on China would not be big, adding: ""Nothing can be done about Trump. We are already numb to him."" Little Chinese steel directly reaches US ports, Reuters news agency notes, because of previous anti-dumping duties, designed to prevent countries from selling their products at prices deemed unfairly low. But US steel industry executives say Chinese steel is still widely shipped to the US through third countries. President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, Liu He, met the Trump administration on Thursday for ""frank and constructive"" talks, a White House official said. In early European trade, London dipped 0.5%, Paris fell 1.1% and Frankfurt dropped 1.3%, according to AFP news agency. In South Korea, America's third largest source of steel, shares in steelmaking giant Posco were down more than 3.5%. The benchmark Kospi index was down close to 1.5%. European steel factories, like this one in Germany, could be hit by the US tariffs In China, investors seemed less concerned about the new tariffs. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 1.7%, while the Shanghai Composite was down 0.7%. In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index had lost 1% by midday trade, dragged down by losses in commodities. Stocks in mining giant BHP Billiton were down more than 1.5%. Mr Trump pledged to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said had suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular China, for decades. ""When our country can't make aluminium and steel... you almost don't have much of a country,"" he said. ""We need great steel makers, great aluminium makers for defence."" The US is reliant on steel imports from more than 100 nations Mr Trump's announcement was slightly delayed amid reports of disagreement among his aides. More than a dozen metals executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp and Arcelor Mittal, stood alongside him as he made the announcement. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said that foreign countries were ""dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies"". Since taking office he has said cheap imports from China are harming the viability of industry in the US. The US imports four times more steel than it exports and is reliant on steel from more than 100 nations. The US Department of Energy says the steel industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis. But it is an industry significantly weaker than it was at the turn of the millennium. In 2000 the US produced 112m tons of steel - a figure that had fallen to 86.5m tons in 2016. In 2000, 135,000 people were employed in the industry - a figure that fell to 83,600 in 2016. US slaps tariffs on Chinese aluminium What could China do in a US trade war?

"Firefighter Dan Cheetham trekked 15 miles through the snow a day early to get to his shift Firefighter Dan Cheetham is one of many people to prove not all heroes wear capes. Snow and freezing conditions have continued to cause misery for many across the UK while thearmy has been called in to helprescue drivers stuck in the snow. But it's not just those in the military who have been lending people in need a hand. Even so, the efforts of Dan Cheetham, a Lincolnshire firefighter who walked 15 miles through the snow on Thursday - a day early - to make sure he was on time for his shift, has won the admiration of colleagues and the public alike. ""We'd taken quite a lashing through the snow,"" he told the BBC. ""The community had pulled together but there were four foot drifts in some places making roads impassable by car. ""I knew I had a duty of care to my community. That made my mind up that I had to get into work. I wouldn't recommend going out in the snow but I'm used to walking and left as early as I did because it was safer to travel in daylight."" Dave Gilbert, Mr Cheetham's manager at Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said he was ""extremely proud of the efforts that [Mr Cheetham] has gone to to ensure we've got a full crew"". But Mr Cheetham, who was worked in the fire service for five years, said he thought some of his colleagues might have thought he was a bit ""loopy"". ""I had that many layers on I looked like the abominable snowman,"" he said. Nurse Lydia Howells used a home-made sign to bag a lift to work Lydia Howells, 28, is a recovery nurse at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. She works in the operating theatre. ""This morning I knew I had to get to work, but the car was totally snowed in and the busses weren't running so I decided to make myself a sign and hit the road walking,"" she told the BBC on Friday. ""At work I have seen how people have pulled together so I was hopeful someone would stop."" She set out wearing three coats and clutching a flask of hot water. Fortunately for Ms Howells, she was in the ""extremely windy and bitterly cold"" conditions for ""no more than two minutes"" before she was offered a lift. ""I was elated when someone pulled up,"" she said. ""It was a really nice gesture. The guy who picked me up had to let the people he worked for know what he was doing, so they didn't think he was skiving. ""I have no idea how I am going to get home after my shift, so I've brought pyjamas in case I end up staying at the hospital,"" she added. ""There was no question in my mind that I was going to get to work today. I needed to get in to look after patients."" Lydia Howells pictured with the driver who picked her up Glasgow-based surgeon Andy Renwick told BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday that one colleague walked from Anniesland to Paisley - almost eight miles - to operate on a cancer patient. ""I won't give her name because she would be genuinely upset with me,"" he said. ""She walked from Anniesland to Paisley - it took her two hours and 50 minutes. I saw her come in, she had snow goggles on, Gortexed up, top and bottom, snow shoes and walking poles."" Mr Renwick's colleague was due to operate on a patient with bowel cancer. ""She knew that had to be done and so she made extra effort to get in here to make sure that was actually delivered."" Emily O'Connor, a trainee obstetrician at Cork University Maternity Hospital, posted a picture on Twitter of her walk to work through the snow with a friend early on Thursday morning.

Stranded motorists were handed cakes and doughnuts from the back of his lorry by a Greggs deliver driver. Motorist Les Goff told Metro,external: ""He offered me a cake and asked me if I'd help him deliver the cakes and doughnuts. It definitely lightened the mood, people were pleased"". Lesley Forster was stuck on the M80 in Scotland for 17 hours. After leaving Edinburgh at 2pm Wednesday afternoon, she didn't make it back home until Thursday morning. ""I had nothing with me,"" she told the BBC. ""I had to use the water I had to put in to my window wipers. I have never been so frightened in my life."" Fortunately for Ms Forster, a ""young lad"" who lived nearby was on hand with food and water for stranded motorists. ""He came out of his house with a sled filled with water and a few bits of food - all he had in the house - and handed it out,"" she said. ""I'm so grateful to him.""

""We went out with the tractor clearing all the tracks down so people could get in and out of the village,"" she told the BBC on Thursday. ""Pretty much the only other people we saw out were in tractors, out helping. ""Tractor is really the only way to get around at the moment. ""The village was effectively cut off so deliveries can't get in or out. I've got a bread maker so I'm making bread to deliver,"" she added.

"The cause is thought to be an electrical fault in the wooden building A fire has killed 24 people at a drug rehabilitation centre in Azerbaijan's capital Baku, officials say. Television pictures showed flames leaping through barred windows of a single-storey wooden building. The fire in a ward for bedridden patients was initially caused by an electrical fault in the building, a government statement said. Thirty-one people were rescued during the incident, the General Prosecutor's office said. Four people were taken to hospital, according to Azerbaijan's news agency APA. The blaze, which broke out just before dawn, was fanned by strong winds. It took around three hours for fire fighters to extinguish it. Azerbaijan country profile Fire tragedy prompts Azeri protest Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev visited the site of the fire, the Republican Narcological Centre, after it was extinguished, local media said. The former Soviet nation has a chronic shortage of rehabilitation places for its 30,000 registered drug addicts.

"Sienna Louisa Dottie Waring weighed in at 10lbs 1oz A baby girl was born at the roadside as snow hampered her parents' efforts to get to hospital. Andrew Waring was driving wife Daniella to hospital in ""adverse"" conditions on the A66 near Darlington when the couple realised they would not arrive in time. Mr Waring said he ""copied"" what he had seen at the birth of his first two children and ""knelt in the snow to deliver the baby."" Baby Sienna and her mum were ""happy and warm"" when paramedics arrived. The couple set off from their home in Catterick, North Yorkshire, when Mrs Waring went into labour. Mr Waring said:  ""The weather was very bad and I struggled to find somewhere to pull over and barely had time to ring 999 when the baby started coming. ""Having been present at the birth of our two other children I just copied what I had seen then. ""I opened the passenger door and knelt in the snow to deliver the baby."" Paramedics arrived and transferred Mrs Waring to hospital, after driving up and down the road several times to find her. In a tweet, the service dubbed the little girl ""#A66snowbaby"".

"This video can not be played Near miss bus driver Charmaine Laurie: ""It looked worse on the video"" Bus driver Charmaine Laurie said her training kicked in as she swerved to avoid a car on the wrong side of the road during the treacherous weather conditions in Edinburgh. Footage of the near-miss was caught on the dashcam of a van and went viral on social media. The back wheels of Ms Laurie's double-decker bus skidded on the snow as she tried to avoid smashing into the mini. She said she had very little time to react to the incident. Charmaine did not know the incident had been recorded Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Laurie said visibility had been ""very poor"" at the time. ""It was just as I came up over the hill,"" she recalled. ""I just saw through the snow the car u-turn in front of me so I didn't have much time to react. ""I just tried to brake but my back end started to slide out. ""So I had to take my foot off the brake and just try and glide through the space that was there.""

This video can not be played Car has near-miss with bus in Edinburgh His van was on the correct side of the road but faced being hit by the bus as Ms Laurie swerved around the mini. Ms Laurie said the gap between the vehicles was very tight, adding: ""There was a van on the other side of the road so there was very little space. ""A lot of it is just instinct but we are trained to be aware of these situations... so that's why I didn't brake heavily."" Ms Laurie had been carrying about 20 passengers on the bus in the south of Edinburgh. She said there was very little reaction from most of the passengers. ""There was one lady getting off the bus who asked how I was,"" she said. ""I said 'yeah I got a fright but I'm OK' and she was like 'well done'.""

Ms Laurie had earlier toldITV's Good Morning Britain,externalthat he mentioned the video when he picked her up at the end of her shift. ""I said 'funnily enough something like that happened to me',"" she told the breakfast TV programme. ""He said 'you're joking' and kind of dismissed it before going back to talking about the video."" ""When he went in the shop I looked at the video on Facebook and when he came out I was like: 'That was me!'."" Ms Laurie said the whole incident happened very quickly.

"Pollution must be recognised as a health risk, Prof Dame Sally Davies says People are being exposed to a daily cocktail of pollution that may be having a significant impact on their health, England's chief medical officer says. Prof Dame Sally Davies said the impact of air, light and noise pollution was well recognised in the environment. But she said its role in terms of health was yet to be fully understood. Dame Sally added there was enough evidence to suggest action had to be taken. And,in her annual report,external, she said the NHS could lead the way in cutting pollution levels. She said one in 20 vehicle journeys was linked to the NHS, either from patients or staff travelling. Check air pollution in your area Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem And making sure services were brought out of hospitals and closer to people's homes could help reduce that burden. Dame Sally also pointed to the attempts being made to phase out ambulances run on diesel, a key source of nitrogen dioxide, which is linked to respiratory disease. And she said the NHS could cut its use of disposable plastics, landfill and incineration. This video can not be played Will the light from your phone at night kill you? While air pollution does not kill people directly, it can shorten their lives by undermining the health of people with lung problems and heart disease. Previous research has suggested it may be a factor in one in 12 deaths and is the ninth leading factor for mortality in the UK - tobacco, diet and high blood pressure are the top three. But Dame Sally said there was also a question about how air, light and noise could coincide to have an impact on long-term health. ""With factors like air, light and noise, the public is exposed to a daily cocktail of pollutants,"" she said. ""Some of these can be linked to chronic conditions like heart disease and asthma.

"The UK games market defied the consumer spending squeeze to hit a record Â£5bn last year, industry figures show. Trade body UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie) credited the 12.4% growth from 2016 to ""an ever expanding audience"". Game software accounted for the majority of sales, with online and digital games the most popular. Non-digital boxed games also saw a surprise small rise in sales, driven by the popularity of titles such as Fifa 18, Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto. The growth in gaming sales came despite the fact that wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation - and shoppers have less disposable income to spend in stores. Console sales were up by almost a third on the previous year. Dorian Bloch, senior client insight director for entertainment, at market research firm GfK, said the Nintendo Switch, Sony's PS4 Pro and Microsoft's Xbox One X, had helped drive the strong performance in the sector. ""It is clear that the console gaming market is now enjoying a renaissance,"" he added. The success of new game sales meant there was less success for second-hand game sales, which fell just over 15% last year. â¢1 FIFA 18 - Electronic Arts â¢2 Call Of Duty: WWII - Activision Blizzard â¢3 Grand Theft Auto V - Rockstar/Take 2 â¢4 Assassin's Creed Origins - Ubisoft â¢5 Star Wars Battlefront II - Electronic Arts â¢6 Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy - Activision Blizzard â¢7 Destiny 2 - Activision Blizzard â¢8 Gran Turismo: Sport - Sony Computer Ent. â¢9 Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands - Ubisoft â¢10 Horizon Zero Dawn - Sony Computer Entertainment Dr Jo Twist, chief executive of Ukie, said the growth showed that UK consumers had ""a strong appetite"" for gaming.

"System Resistance Network is one of the new groups highlighted by the report The threat from the British far-right is now coming from a younger generation, according to the latest study from an anti-racism group. Hope Not Hate, which investigates neo-Nazi groups, said tech-savvy leaders were driving their cause forward. The group's ""State of Hate"" report said traditional groups are weakening. Earlier this week, the outgoing head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK warned of the growing threat from the far-right. Four far-right plots foiled says counter-terrorism head The report by Hope Not Hate (HNH) said that membership of traditionally-organised far-right groups was at its lowest level for two decades - but the threat that they had posed had been replaced by new networks which had been developing online. These new activists had been growing in size and influence and had developed new ways of marketing themselves to would-be followers which differentiated themselves from the stereotypical face of the far-right of the past. This rise in virtual activity was contributing to more online race or religious hatred, much of it aimed at Muslims. One of those organisations, National Action (NA), used its online activity to recruit volunteers for provocative street demonstrations, including one outside York Minister. It was later banned by Home Secretary Amber Rudd under terrorism laws in December 2016 and remains at the heart of extensive continuing police investigations. National Action held demonstrations before it was banned HNH said key NA supporters had remained active and tried to resurrect it under different names. More than 20 people have been arrested in the last year in relation to far-right investigations - with a number of cases awaiting trial. A major government review of last year's terrorism attacks recommended a new role for MI5 in investigating the far-right and feeding its assessments to Whitehall security planners. Darren Osborne: Jailed for Finsbury Park attack Ethan Stables: Announced homophobic terror attack online Nick Lowles, head of Hope Not Hate, called on the government to target online peddlers of hate. ""We are facing a surging threat from far-right terrorism and violent extremism,"" he said. ""We fear further violence from the extreme right in the months to come. This rising terrorist threat is the consequence of the increasingly confrontational tone of online far-right rhetoric, combined with the almost universal extreme-right belief that a civil war between Islam and the West is coming."" ""It is vitally important now that police and the government do more to crack down on the peddlers of hate and those pushing a civil war rhetoric."" Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""This Government did not hesitate to proscribe a neo-Nazi group, National Action, when the evidence was enough and we will not hesitate to take further action. We have continued to enforce this by proscribing National Action's known aliases Scottish Dawn and NS131 as well. ""Through our Prevent strategy, we are successfully fighting back against the terrorist recruiters and safeguarding vulnerable people who are being preyed upon - whether by Islamists, neo-Nazis or other violent extremists. ""At its heart this report shines a light on the growth of intolerance across the UK and Europe and we should all take a stand against extremism whether it is expressed by far right, Islamist groups or other movements.""

"Tim has a green cover over his tent in an effort to hide it from passers-by Tim, 22, has been calling a snowy field beside a motorway in north-west London home for the past two years. He lives in a tent that struggles to stay still against the wind on this bitterly cold night. He has an old duvet to keep himself warm and a green tarpaulin to remain as inconspicuous as possible. The sub-zero weather that has swept across the UK has not helped his plight. Tim sleeps rough in a field next to this motorway When temperatures fall below freezing, local authorities have a duty to provide emergency shelter for anyone who is sleeping rough. Tim is standing on the frosty ground in his bare feet. He appears to have frost and snow in his hair. UK snow: Latest updates for Thursday ""I think it's mould to be honest. I haven't got anywhere to shower, so that's how it's become unfortunately."" Tim was standing on the ground in his bare feet in -4Â°C Tim is one of the 4,751 peopleestimated to be sleeping rough in England, according to government figures. That is 15% more than last year. He says his local council has refused to offer him housing, as it believes he has made himself intentionally homeless. Tim says he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a condition that makes it difficult for him to live with other people. ""I've lived in house-shares before and have fallen out with people. They say that's my own fault."" Alan is a 42-year-old military veteran who has been sleeping rough for four years. He says he copes with the cold by turning to alcohol: ""I have a drink now and againâ¦ I don't do needles - I can show you my arms if you want. I don't deal with that rubbish. I just drink. It just gets me to sleep."" His hands tremble violently as he attempts to roll a cigarette. ""I would love to have a night in a shelter,"" says the former Army man, who went on to work as, among other things, a window cleaner. But he points out that when temperatures edge above zero again, he would be back out on the streets. He previously rejected homeless shelters because of the violence. ""It's rife because no-one's managing these things properly. I've been told by a lot of homeless people you're probably better off out here than you are in there."" Alan says he usually chooses to sleep in doorways because he doesn't like to bother people. He's aware of the risks and mentions thehomeless man who, last month, was found deadin Westminster, central London. ""Of course I am frightened of dying. I'm not worried about being attacked, the only thing that's going to hurt me is the weather."" Many rough sleepers become used to their situation and refuse help, support workers say Even during extreme weather rough sleepers are afraid of accepting support, says Jamie Shovlin, an assistant support worker at homeless charity Thames Reach. ""Some people get used to the streets - we call it entrenchment. They're committed to the streets, it's what they know. ""The longer they're out, the more difficult it is to convince them to come off the streets because what you're going to be able to offer them is not necessarily going to be what they want, [or] what they expect."" Mr Shovlin and his colleagues spend the nights during extreme weather seeking out homeless people who are often referred to them by members of the public, and convincing them to visit a shelter. This process takes time and even sub-zero temperatures or the risk of death is not enough to convince many homelesss people that they want to receive help. ""They might have entered into a similar situation previously and had a bad experience, so you're offering them an unknown situation, whereas their current argument would be they know how to deal with the streets,"" he says. Eventually, Mr Shovlin manages to convince Alan to come with him to a nearby shelter. Tim, however, refuses. He insists that he is fine and that -4Â°C is manageable.

But after a week of widespread chaos, the mood in Waterloo station on Friday at rush hour is almost jubilant. The weekend is around the corner and many of the thousands here will be granted a temporary reprieve from doing daily battle with the railways. The biggest gripe amongst passengers is that there has been precious little information of last minute changes to schedules. Most are understanding of the extraordinary challenges track and train operators are facing. Station staff are out in force and briefing passengers when they can. With the weather rapidly closing in, it's a dash for all to get home before the clock strikes 22:00 GMT.

"The UK games market defied the consumer spending squeeze to hit a record Â£5bn last year, industry figures show. Trade body UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie) credited the 12.4% growth from 2016 to ""an ever expanding audience"". Game software accounted for the majority of sales, with online and digital games the most popular. Non-digital boxed games also saw a surprise small rise in sales, driven by the popularity of titles such as Fifa 18, Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto. The growth in gaming sales came despite the fact that wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation - and shoppers have less disposable income to spend in stores. Console sales were up by almost a third on the previous year. Dorian Bloch, senior client insight director for entertainment, at market research firm GfK, said the Nintendo Switch, Sony's PS4 Pro and Microsoft's Xbox One X, had helped drive the strong performance in the sector. ""It is clear that the console gaming market is now enjoying a renaissance,"" he added. The success of new game sales meant there was less success for second-hand game sales, which fell just over 15% last year. â¢1 FIFA 18 - Electronic Arts â¢2 Call Of Duty: WWII - Activision Blizzard â¢3 Grand Theft Auto V - Rockstar/Take 2 â¢4 Assassin's Creed Origins - Ubisoft â¢5 Star Wars Battlefront II - Electronic Arts â¢6 Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy - Activision Blizzard â¢7 Destiny 2 - Activision Blizzard â¢8 Gran Turismo: Sport - Sony Computer Ent. â¢9 Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands - Ubisoft â¢10 Horizon Zero Dawn - Sony Computer Entertainment Dr Jo Twist, chief executive of Ukie, said the growth showed that UK consumers had ""a strong appetite"" for gaming.

"This video can not be played Motorists and pedestrians in Ukraine struggle with snow after heavy falls Large parts of Europe have endured another night of freezing conditions as a Siberian weather system continues to bring chaos. Blizzards and heavy snowfall have closed roads, rail services and schools and forced the cancellations of hundreds of flights. The unusually cold spell is being felt as far south as the Mediterranean. The number of weather-related deaths rose to as many as 55 with 21 victims in Poland, most of them rough sleepers. It triggered a warning from the World Health Organization that the poor, the homeless and migrants would be hardest hit by the big freeze. ""Those most at risk of cold-related illness include elderly people, children, and people who have chronic diseases or physical or mental limitations,"" it said as a statement. Live updates: UK braced for more snow Troops rescue drivers from Storm Emma Reality Check: Is snow getting rarer? The weather system has been given various nicknames - in the UK it is ""the Beast from the East"" while the Dutch call it the ""Siberian bear"" and Swedes the ""snow cannon"". Snow has even appeared on the normally balmy beaches of the French Riviera. This video can not be played How to keep warm? Tips from cold countries Ireland remains braced for what is predicted to be its heaviest snowfall in decades as Storm Emma moves in from the south. Flights in and out of Dublin airport were suspended with service disruptions expected to continue until Saturday at the earliest. Heavy snow near Montpellier, southern France, made roads and pavements treacherous Some stranded families in Montpellier had to bed down in reception centres The airport in the Swiss city of Geneva was forced to shut down on Thursday morning but was reopened after the runway was cleared using snow ploughs. In France, about 2,000 drivers were stranded on a motorway near the city of Montpellier, with some complaining of being stuck for as long as 24 hours. Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was also hit by freezing winds with KLM airlines cancelling or delaying dozens of flights. Dublin Airport has been badly disrupted by snow and strong winds Some rail services operated by Eurostar between London, Paris and Brussels were axed. As well as those in Poland, weather-related casualties were reported as far south as Spain and Italy. Seven people have died since Sunday in Slovakia, AFP news agency reports, and six more in the Czech Republic in recent days. The homeless, like here in Berlin, are most at risk from the cold One of three victims in Spain was a homeless man who had been sleeping in an abandoned truck, officials said. Five people were reported dead in Lithuania, four in France, two each in Serbia, Italy, Slovenia and Romania and one each in the UK and the Netherlands, AFP added. In the French capital, Paris, authorities set up emergency shelters for the city's roughly 3,000 homeless. Ukraine, which has further snowstorms forecast in the days to come, has found itself in a fresh row with Russia over gas supplies. The Russian state-run gas giant Gazprom said it would not restart gas shipments - expected on Thursday - because agreements had not been finalised. The shipments would have been the first from Russia since 2015. It's snowing - Can I refuse to go to work?

Moscow and Kiev have been at loggerheads since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Some parts of Europe are expected to see temperatures rise over the next couple of days, although Ireland and parts of southern England are braced for the effects of Storm Emma which is moving up from Portugal and France. On Thursday, Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar urged people to stay indoors until the storm passed later on Friday.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' President Donald Trump is to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week, hitting producers like Canada and China. He said steel products face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. The US imports four times more steel than it exports, and is reliant on steel from more than 100 nations. Mr Trump tweeted that the US was suffering from ""unfair trade"". But the move has hit US markets, with the Dow Jones index closing down 1.7%. The value of shares in American steel manufacturers jumped significantly after the announcement. The news is likely to provoke an angry reaction from China, and analysts have expressed fears of the prospect of new trade wars. Key US allies are also at risk of being hit with higher costs, but it is not clear if any countries will be excluded from the new measures. 'A blatant intervention' - trade partners react During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said that foreign countries were ""dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies"". And since taking office, Mr Trump said cheap imports from China were harming the viability of industry in the US, which is the world's biggest importer of steel. China isn't the only country to export the material to the US - 110 countries and territories do so. AndChina is only the 11th biggest exporter to the US,external- some US allies, including Canada, Japan and South Korea are among the 10 biggest sources of steel for the US, and they all face a big bump in costs. The recommendation to impose tariffs was made in a report,externalby Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. President Trump had asked him to investigate ""whether steel imports threaten to impair the national security"". Mr Trump promised to rebuild the American steel and aluminium industries, which he said had suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular China, for decades. ""When our country can't make aluminium and steel...you almost don't have much of a country,"" he said. ""We need great steel makers, great aluminium makers for defence."" The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 He spoke as Chinese economic adviser Liu He, a friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited the White House. Mr Trump's announcement was slightly delayed amid reports of wrangling over the issue among his aides. What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade More than a dozen metals executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp and Arcelor Mittal, joined him as he made the announcement. But officials from industries that rely on steel use have lobbied against the tariffs as they fear increased costs if they have to use more US-made metals. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The president wants to be seen as tough on trade and China, and so do many of his top officials: Pete Navarro, a trade adviser who's tipped for promotion, has hawkish views. So does Harry Harris, the president's pick for ambassador to Australia. Still, some advisers thought the president should take it slow. Aides huddled behind closed doors and in a hallway on Thursday morning, and the president's announcement was postponed. The scheduling conflict reflected a bigger clash: a fight between hardliners and those who approach trade in a more cautious manner. Meanwhile, the boss was right where he liked to be: in the eye of the storm, and everyone was waiting for him to speak. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freedland said any tariffs would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" The European Union""will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Chinahad already said it would consider retaliatory measures against the US A spokesman for US Speaker of the HousePaul Ryansaid he hoped the president ""will consider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forward"" The US Department of Energy says the industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis. But it is an industry significantly weaker than it was at the turn of the millennium. In the year 2000, the US produced112m tonsof steel - a figure that had fallen to86.5mtons in 2016. In 2000,135,000 peoplewere employed in the industry - a figure that fell to83,600in 2016. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York The threat of tariffs on steel and aluminium has hovered around the Trump administration for months, with delays making the president vulnerable to criticism that he is all bark and no bite, despite his America First message. He's now silenced those mutters and handed a victory to the steel industry. But the chaos surrounding Thursday's announcement - in which advisers apparently hoped to dissuade the president from action - underscores just how many more losers there may be. Dozens of companies in industries from car-making to construction had warned of hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, as higher prices raise costs for steel-dependent sectors such as manufacturing. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis advised that the move would cost the US support among its allies, such as Canada and South Korea. The European Union, Mexico and China have all said they are weighing retaliatory tariffs that would strike politically sensitive industries like agriculture. The last time the US imposed steel tariffs, in 2002, President George W Bush lifted them less than two years later to avoid a damaging trade war. Steel executives told the president on Thursday that they trust his judgement. But if a trade war is the outcome of this decision, as analysts expect, it remains to be seen how many will agree.

"This video can not be played Diver finds 7,000-year-old Native American burial site in sea Archaeologists have uncovered a Native American burial site dating back 7,000 years off the coast of Florida. The site was found by an amateur diver in 2016 who was looking for shark teeth but stumbled on an ancient jawbone. In a picture sent from the diver, archaeologist Ryan Duggins noticed a worn down molar tooth attached to the jawbone. This suggested it belonged to a prehistoric person. Florida state officials called the find an ""unprecedented discovery"". Mr Duggins and his team began investigating the site from the ""Archaic Period"" located 900ft (275m) from shore. The burial grounds are expected to cover about 32,000 sq feet (3,000 sq metres) off the coast of Manasota Key. One of the stakes excavated at Manasota Key Offshore revealed a notch in its length, it is not yet known what the notch was for Underwater, the team found densely packed organic remains, human bones, and sharpened wooden stakes and textile fragments, according to National Geographic. ""Seeing a 7,000-year-old site that is so well preserved in the Gulf of Mexico is awe inspiring,"" Mr Duggins said in a press release from the Florida Department of State. ""We are truly humbled by this experience."" The site is believed to have been preserved in a freshwater pond thousands of years ago when water levels were 30ft (9m) lower,according the a press release.,external. The pond had a bottom covered in peat, which reportedly slowed the process of organic decay and allowed for the preservation of human remains. 'The devil's rope': How barbed wire changed America ""Our hope is that this discovery leads to more knowledge and a greater understanding of Florida's early peoples,"" said Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner. The state said they are working closely with Native American tribes to ensure the proper treatment of the bones. ""We are happy to be working, shoulder to shoulder, with the Bureau of Archaeological Research and the residents of Manasota Key to identify a preservation plan that will allow the ancestors to continue to rest peacefully and without human disturbance for the next 7,000 years"", the Seminole Tribe of Florida's historic preservation officer Paul Backhousetold the Bradenton Herald newspaper,external. ""The highest priority of all involved is to honour tribal beliefs and customs with respect to this ancestral resting place,"" said the Florida Department of State. Native American tribe sues tech companies Florida archaeologists have discovered other evidence of the Archaic period but say this discovery is remarkable because the site survived offshore through hurricanes and erosion. ""The vast majority of underwater archaeological projects have historically been focused on shipwrecks,"" Mr Duggins told National Geographic.
