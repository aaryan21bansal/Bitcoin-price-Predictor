"This video can not be played Witness Rachael Allison was at the Birmingham Star City complex when the brawl broke out Five teenagers, including a 13-year-old girl, have been arrested after a mass brawl involving machetes broke out at a cinema. Seven West Midlands Police officers were hurt while attempting to disperse the fighting at the Star City complex in Birmingham on Saturday evening. The force said for those responding to the disorder ""it may be the worst thing they have ever seen"". Police drew Tasers and used a dispersal order to clear about 100 youths. Footage from inside the venue appears to show disorder breaking out and people on the floor screaming. A girl aged 13, a girl and boy both aged 14, and a 19-year-old man were all held on suspicion of assaulting police. In addition, a boy aged 14 was held on suspicion of obstructing police. All five were later arrested on suspicion of violent disorder but have now been released on bail with conditions which ban them leaving home at night and ban them from Star City and any cinema in the UK, police said. A 14-year-old boy had also been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder after an image circulated on social media showing a number of youths, with one carrying a machete. Asked if he was concerned about the ages of those involved, Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""It is concerning, there's no point pretending otherwise. ""That's why we've got plans in place, starting from first thing on Monday morning, where we'll be sending neighbourhood policing officers into schools around Birmingham to try and find out why."" This video can not be played Several arrests have been made following the fighting (Courtesy Rachael Allison) Mr Graham added: ""It's always hard to gauge these sorts of things - but what I will say is incidents like last night are rare. ""As for some officers who were there last night, it may be the worst thing they have ever seen."" The trouble ""seemed to be focussed at the cinema"" but ""pockets of disorder"" broke out around the whole complex for between 90 minutes and two hours, the force said. Two machetes were seized and a knife was recovered from a roundabout nearby. Since the disorder, the Vue cinema chain has pulled thegang film Blue Storyfrom its 91 outlets in the UK and Ireland, a decision its director Rapman described as ""truly unfortunate"". He said he sent his love to all those caught up in the trouble, adding: ""It's truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. Blue Story is a film about love, not violence."" A Vue spokesman said: ""We can confirm a decision was made to remove the film. The safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our first priority."" Mr Graham said: ""I understand there is a lot of speculation on social media and people are citing that film.  At this stage we are not jumping to any conclusions. That will form part of our investigations as it carries on."" Witness Choleigh McGuire described the brawl as ""one of the scariest moments of [her] life"", as she queued to watch the new Frozen film with her daughter. ""Armed police come, Tasers come, all of the people that were fighting ran off into the cinema, hiding. I am shaking,"" she said. Another witness, Rachael Allison, said ""a young boy was crying on the floor with his mother"" as a number of people started fighting. ""The police told everyone to leave the cinema as they held Taser guns in their hands and started to bring in guard dogs."" The force was called to the complex, in Nechells, at about 17:30 GMT and cleared the area by 21:00. The officers hurt during the disorder suffered minor facial injuries. Police used Tasers and dogs to break up the disorder Supt Ian Green said: ""This was a major outbreak of trouble which left families who were just trying to enjoy a night out at the cinema understandably frightened. ""We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order. ""It's clear that some of those who went to Star City last night were intent on causing trouble."" He said the force's response was necessary to restore order as quickly as possible. ""We understand that families with young children will have been left upset by what they saw last night, but we urge people to appreciate that our aim last night was to protect the public and restore order, and that's what we achieved,"" he added. Additional security is in place at the complex and police will be there on Sunday night. Mr Graham added: ""We know that Birmingham isn't unusual in this. Let's not pretend that knife crime or violence in the under 25s is rare or is just isolated around Birmingham. ""There are no short-term fixes to this, so we're prepared and we're in this for the long run and we're going to work with schools and other partners to prevent youth violence becoming an increasing problem.""

"Labour has vowed to ""put bad landlords out of business"" and bring in rent controls in England, if it wins power. Private rents would not be allowed to go up by more than inflation - and landlords would be fined for letting out sub-standard property. A Labour government would also bring in ""open-ended"" tenancies, to protect tenants from unfair evictions. The Tories have also set out plans to help tenants - including scrapping ""no fault"" evictions. Under Labour's ""private renters' charter"", landlords would face an annual ""property MOT"", with fines of up to Â£100,000 or forced repayment of rent if their properties are found to be sub-standard. Live: Latest from election campaign trail How rent controls could change the way we live What is Labour offering to Waspi women? If the party wins the general election on 12 December, rent increases would be capped at the national inflation rate. Areas with high rents would be able to make the case for further controls, local councils would get beefed-up enforcement powers and renters unions would be given government funding. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the policy reflected a wider view within Labour that the private sector could not be trusted in many areas and the state had to step in - a major dividing line with the Conservatives. The private rented sector accounts for 21% of households in England - a figure that has doubled since 1997,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external Labour said its research has found that tenants collectively pay more than Â£10bn a year in rent to landlords letting out sub-standard homes. The party claims one-in-four private rented homes in England are classed as ""non-decent"", meaning they are damp, cold, in disrepair or unsafe to live in. Labour plans tax on foreign firms buying property Tories plan stamp duty hike on non-UK residents Housing spokesman John Healey told BBC Breakfast ""these are standards that cannot be allowed to go on for longer"". While most landlords provided decent and secure accommodation, he said successive governments had allowed ""rogue landlords to flourish"", while tenants had fewer rights and protections than if they were hiring a car or household goods. ""This is about making all properties and all landlords operate to the sort of standards that the better ones already do. When one in four kids are growing up in private rented accommodation, this is the type of home which must be better, more secure and more affordable,"" he said. Under Labour's ""open-ended"" tenancies plan, tenants will only be able to be evicted on tightly-defined grounds, such as non-payment of rent or criminal behaviour in the property, or if the landlord plans to move back into the property. The Conservatives have also vowed to outlaw Section 21 notices, which allow landlords to evict renters without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period ends. A Conservative spokesman said Labour's plans would ""hurt the renters they claim to want to help by hiking up rents"". Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: ""For decades renters have had to live with the fear of being evicted from their home for no reason, with damaging consequences particularly for families with children and the elderly. ""This election marks a major step forward in the battle to secure basic protections for those who rent, as Labour and the Conservatives have made clear that they will scrap this outrageous practice, and give renters the security and stability they deserve."" The Residential Landlords Association claimed Labour's proposals would ""lead to a serious rental housing crisis"". Policy director David Smith said: ""The sector does not need new obligations, but better enforcement of those that already exist."" In addition to ending ""no fault"" evictions, the Conservatives say they would bring in ""lifetime deposits"", which would allow an initial lump sum to be transferred from one home to the next. The party says in its manifesto these measures will protect tenants ""from revenge evictions and rogue landlords"". It also says it will strengthen rights of possession for ""the many good landlords"". The Liberal Democrats say they will introduce longer-term tenancies and bring in controls on annual rent increases, linked to inflation. The Green Party proposes rent controls, more secure tenancy agreements and an end to ""no fault"" evictions. Housing policy is devolved to the UK's national parliaments. In December 2017, changes to Scottish law brought an end to fixed-term tenancies. Rent increases can now only be made once every 12 months. The current Welsh governmenthas not indicated an intention to pursue such a policy,external. In Northern Ireland, there is rent control on unfit private tenancies that began after 1 April 2007 and some other types of tenancy. Do you have any questions about the election?

"Nicola Sturgeon said she had a ""moral objection to weapons of mass destruction"" Scrapping Trident would be one of the SNP's key demands to gain its support in the event of a minority Labour government, says Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP is willing to support a Labour government if no party wins an overall majority - but the SNP leader has ruled out a formal coalition. Ms Sturgeon also wants Labour to stop Brexit and commit to an independence referendum next year. The Labour manifesto includes a pledge to renew the Trident nuclear programme. LIVE: Election campaign Tories to unveil manifesto 'to get Brexit done' Labour pledges payouts to pension age rise women Ms Sturgeonwas asked by Sky's Sophie Ridge,externalif scrapping Trident would be a red line for the SNP to support Labour. She replied ""Yes"", adding that the SNP would be ""absolutely firm"" on that. The SNP leader continued: ""I have a moral objection to weapons of mass destruction... I wouldn't be prepared to press a nuclear button that would kill potentially millions, tens of millions, of people. ""But there's also the opportunity costs of Trident - the billions, tens of billions, that are required to renew Trident in my view are better spent on stronger, conventional defence that is more effective to protect our country but also hospitals and schools and better social security provision. ""And these are the choices that we should be thinking very carefully about."" Sturgeon lists SNP's conditions for backing Labour Can Nicola Sturgeon deliver Scottish independence Ms Sturgeon said that in the event of a hung parliament, where no party had an overall majority and the SNP held the balance of power, Scotland would have ""maximum influence"", adding: ""That would be a pretty good outcome I think in terms of making sure Scotland's voice is heard."" She reiterated that there would be no coalition with Labour, saying instead SNP support would be ""less formal"" - such as a confidence and supply arrangement, where the SNP would support a Labour government on explicit votes in return for government support of specific policies. ""Other matters"" that she would want to progress would include holding anindependence referendum next year, stopping Brexit, devolving control of migration, employment and drugs classification laws to Holyrood and a ""real end to austerity""  and ""to the misery of Universal Credit and welfare cuts"". She insisted these issues would ""resonate strongly with many people across the UK"", as well as her supporters in Scotland. She added that she would ""never, ever"" put Boris Johnson into power. Labour say they willnot agree to a Scottish independence referendum in the ""early years"" of government. And duringFriday's Question Time leaders' special, Jeremy Corbyn said he did not plan to rely on other parties for support after the election. He said: ""We're not doing any deals with any other parties. I'm not trying to form a coalition government. ""I'm fighting this election to win it for Labour."" HMS Vigilant is one of four submarines which carry the UK's Trident nuclear programme Since 1969, according togovernment documents,external, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans. The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor - a concept known asmutually assured destruction. The UK has four Vanguard-class submarines, which each carry Trident missiles. While not on patrol, the submarines are located at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde - commonly known as Faslane. Faslane was chosen to host the UK's Polaris nuclear-armed submarine fleet at the height of the Cold War in the 1960s because of its relatively secluded position next to the deep waters of the Gare Loch and Firth of Clyde on the west coast of Scotland.

AlthoughLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been a longstanding critic of nuclear weapons, his party'smanifesto for the 12 December election,externaldid include a pledge to renew the Trident nuclear programme and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence. The Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson said on Tuesday,externalin an interview with ITV that she would be prepared to press the nuclear button if she was prime minister. A spokesman for theConservatives, who launched their manifesto on Sunday,said: ""Trident is good for Britain's security, and good for Scottish jobs.

"This video can not be played Labour's Angela Rayner: ""The government failed the women who were born in the 1950s"" Labour has promised compensation to more than three million women who lost out on years of state pension payments when their retirement age was raised, if it wins the general election. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the pledge would settle a ""debt of honour"" to women born in the 1950s. Those expecting to retire at 60 were told they would have to wait years longer when changes to the state pension age were accelerated in 2010. Labour said its promise may cost Â£58bn. The costing was not included in the party's manifesto, published earlier this week. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, cabinet minister Michael Gove said he was ""sympathetic"" to the position the women were in but accused Labour of producing a manifesto that ""drove a coach and horses"" through the party's own rules on spending. And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it was not clear ""where the money is coming from"". By Katie Prescott, BBC News business correspondent Labour is pledging to pay all women born in the 1950s for any pension income they may have lost when the men's and women's state pension age was equalised - in stages beginning in 2010 - following an act of Parliament in 1995. But pensions expert John Ralfe says the money would be far better targeted at those who were hit when the timeframe to equalise the gap was accelerated in 2011 - a far smaller cohort. He argues that it would be sensible to means-test the funding, so it can go to those who suffered hardship when the changes were put in place. But Labour's policy is all-encompassing. The party says that, as all women paid in, all women should get out and as ""a one-off historical redress for a historical wrongâ¦ the state will be expected to find the money"". But questioned by Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Mr McDonnell said it would be funded by a ""very special arrangement, a contingency, in the same way government in the past has dealt with matters in the past like this"". The fight over women's state pensions Defeat for women in state pension age challenge The retirement age for women rose to 65 in 2018, in line with men, and will go up to 66 by 2020, and to 67 by 2028. But a campaign by so-called Waspi women - theWomen Against State Pension Inequality,external- argues that they were not given enough time to prepare for the changes. Another group of campaigners known as Backto60recently lost a legal battleagainst the government over its handling of the issue. Labour said it would make individual payments of an average of Â£15,380 to the 3.7 million women it claims were affected, with some payouts as high as Â£31,300. Mr McDonnell said the compensation, which the party says could cost Â£58bn over five years, would right a ""historical wrong"". He told Sophy Ridge that the women affected ""had done everything that had been asked"" of them during their working lives and many had been ""forced into penury"" through no fault of their own. ""This is a historic injustice and we have to address it. Some of these women are older and may not be with us if we don't act quickly."" He said Labour was working on the assumption that the women ultimately won their legal fight for financial redress against the government. ""It is expensive but it is an entitlement, it is not a benefitâ¦The scale of this injustice is enormous"". Labour's economic plan in 10 points Asked why the cost of the policy was not included in Labour's manifesto, he said it was being treated differently from other financial commitments, likening it to compensationthe government had to pay to mesothelioma victimsafter losing a long-running legal battle last year. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said justice for those affected was a ""price worth paying"". ""People should have confidence in their government that they are not going to steal their pension,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""It fundamentally undermines the contract between the state and its people."" Labour has already promised to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future, a move which would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. From 1948 for more than 60 years men received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60. But over the years it was argued that the difference was unfair, as women had a longer life expectancy than men. So under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020. But the coalition government of 2010 decided to accelerate that timetable, arguing that the state pension was becoming unaffordable. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was bought forward to 2018 - affecting millions of women. While some of them had time to adapt to a longer working life, for others the change came as a shock. Read more here. Labour's pledge comes as a contrast to the Conservative Party's outlook on theWaspi campaign,external. Boris Johnson was challenged by one of the women affectedin Friday's BBC Question Time leaders' special. The prime minister said: ""I do sympathise deeply with the Waspi women... but it is very expensive to come up with the solution you want."" ""I cannot promise I can magic up that money for you,"" he added. What is the row about women's pensions?

"Two top energy firms say they have moved ownership of their UK operations overseas to protect themselves from Labour's nationalisation plans. In recent months, National Grid has opened offshore holding companies in Hong Kong and Luxembourg, while SSE has incorporated in Switzerland. As first reported in the Sunday Times,external, it would not stop them being taken over but could protect investors. Labour said the ""rip-off"" move showed the grid needed to be in public hands. In its election manifesto, the party promised a radical plan to renationalise Britain's rail, mail, water and energy networks, along with broadband. But energy companies have criticised the plan, with SSE and National Grid among thoserunning ads on Facebook warning of the potential costs. Labour has previously said its plans would be cost neutral, help decarbonise the economy faster and create jobs. But there are fears that it would try to renationalise the companies at a discount, compared to their current market value. Critics warn this would hit shareholders, including pension funds, who would be compensated with government bonds. National Grid runs the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, as well as the main gas transmission pipelines. It has a market value of Â£31bn. ""Labour's proposals for state ownership of National Grid would be highly detrimental to millions of ordinary people who either hold shares in the company or through their pension funds - which include several local authority pension funds,"" a spokeswoman said. ""To protect their holdings, and in line with our legal fiduciary duty to our shareholders, we have established holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. This has no financial benefit to the company and does not affect its day-to-day operations,"" she added. Labour vows to 'transform' UK at manifesto launch Election ads: Energy group attacks Labour plans How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? SSE said it had moved its electricity distribution business - which supplies 3.7 million homes in Scotland and England - to a Swiss holding company. It has also moved its Scottish transmission network business. The firm, which has a market value of Â£13.6bn, said Switzerland was party to the Energy Charter Treaty which offered better shareholder protection. ""[This is] an additional safeguard, which SSE does not believe would be required in practice, should SSE's electricity networks businesses and interests... become the subject of proposed legislation for nationalisation,"" a spokesman said. ""In practice, SSE expects that precedent, the principle of fairness and the need to secure future investor confidence in the UK economy means it should be possible to secure fair value from nationalisation."" According to the Sunday Times, water company Anglian has also set up an offshore holding company. Severn Trent is said to be considering a similar move. In a statement Labour said: ""The UK's energy networks are vital strategic infrastructure on which we all rely. You cannot boil a kettle, heat your home or run a business without the grid. ""The idea that private owners, who have been ripping off the public, would move offshore in an attempt to prolong the rip-off illustrates just why we need the grid back in public hands.""

They say two people were held after the vessel ran aground off Galicia's coast in the north-west. A third person fled. They all are said to be from Ecuador. Spanish media report that the submarine was from Colombia and police are trying to work out whether it sailed all the way from South America with the drugs. Narco-subs have been used to smuggle drugs from Latin America into the US.

"Aslan King went missing early on Saturday after suffering a suspected seizure A search has failed to find any trace of a British man missing in the Australian state of Victoria. Aslan King, 25, went missing early on Saturday morning after suffering a suspected seizure during a camping trip. Victoria Police said officers searched for Mr King on Sunday using a helicopter, boats, horses, motorcycles and sniffer dogs. Mr King, an illustrator from Brighton, relocated to Australia two weeks ago. His friends and family had described his disappearance as ""completely out of character"". Mr King is said to have hit his head on the ground before getting up quickly and rushing into thick bushland surrounding the campsite where he and four friends had been staying. The site is near the town of Princeton, beside cliffs on the Victorian coast near the tourist site known as the Twelve Apostles. Officers told local media they were concentrating on a radius of 300m around the campsite, but said the search was difficult because of the thick vegetation, rocky clifftops and deep coastal waters in the region. Officers searched for Mr King on Sunday using a helicopter, horses, boats, motorcycles and sniffer dogs Mr King had been on a coastal camping trip when he disappeared The area is also known to contain a large population of deadly tiger snakes. Sgt Danny Brown, of Victoria Police, said thermal imaging sensors had detected no trace of Mr King, but they might be used again as the search continued. An air and sea search has failed to find any sign of Mr King ""You're using every sense, whether that be eyes, ears and touch as well,"" he told Nine newspapers, adding the heat sensors would make ""a massive difference, because we're going to find things in areas that the eye can't see"". ""Some of this scrub, you have to get on hands and knees to move through it,"" he added. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""Our staff are seeking further information following the disappearance of a British man near Princeton, Australia, and are in contact with the Australian police.""

"The former member of Kara had recently staged a music comeback South Korean singer and actress Goo Hara has been found dead at her home in Seoul, police say. The 28-year-old is best known as a former member of the K-Pop group Kara, which she joined in 2008. Goo had also appeared on television and released music by herself. Police say the cause of death is still under investigation. She appeared at a series of comeback performances last week after being hospitalised in May following an alleged suicide attempt. The singer later apologised for causing ""concerns and a commotion"" among her fans over the incident. Reports said her manager had, at the time, found her unconscious. Goo was found dead about 18:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Sunday in her home, the Gangnam Police Department was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying. Her last post on Instagram, shared with her 1.5m followers on Saturday, was a photograph of herself in bed with the caption: ""Good night"". Kara, her former band, were one of the first K-Pop groups to break through on the international stage. Goo's first solo EP, released in 2015, peaked at number four in the Korean music charts. She had signed with a talent management agency in Japan earlier this year and released a song named Midnight Queen earlier this month. Over the last year her career was overshadowed by events in her life off the stage. In September 2018 Goo filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend after he threatened to damage her career by exposing an illicit video of her. Goo Hara (second from right) was with the group until they disbanded in 2016 Her former partner was given a suspended jail term in August for physically assaulting and blackmailing the star. Goo's death comes just over a month sinceanother former K-Pop girl band member, Sulli, was also found deadin a suspected suicide after struggling with online bullying. The two celebrities were close friends and after Sulli's death, Goo described their relationship as being ""like sisters"". Fans have been taking to social media to express their shock at news of Goo's death and many have shared photographs of the late friends together. South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, according to World Health Organisation data.

"This video can not be played Bloomberg to BBC in 2018: 'I'd like to make a difference' Billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has officially announced he is standing to be the Democratic Party presidential nominee. In a statement,the 77-year-old said he was standing ""to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America"",external. ""The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election,"" Mr Bloomberg wrote. He joins 17 other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination to take on Mr Trump in 2020. As things stand, former Vice-President Joe Biden, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are the party's front-runners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Bloomberg is said to be concerned the current field is not strong enough to challenge the president. Who will take on Trump in 2020? How  Bloomberg could shake up 2020 race He enters the race after months of debate over wealth inequality in the US, with Mr Sanders and Ms Warren announcing plans for steep tax rises for billionaires. Unveiling his tax proposals in September,Mr Sanders said: ""Billionaires should not exist."",external President Trump taunted Mr Bloomberg earlier in November, saying there was ""nobody I'd rather run against than little Michael"". This video can not be played 'Little Michael' Bloomberg will hurt Biden - Trump The same day, Mr Bloomberg filed paperwork for the Democratic primary election in Alabama. Michael Bloomberg is the eighth richest American with a net-worth of $54.4bn (Â£42bn), according to Forbes. Born in Massachusetts, he started out in business as a Wall Street banker before going on to create the financial publishing empire that bears his name. Over the years he has given millions of dollars to educational, medical and other causes - including political ones. He staged a successful campaign to become New York mayor in 2001 and remained in office for three consecutive terms until 2013. Rumours of presidential ambitions have surrounded him for more than a decade. Mr Bloomberg is a very data-driven businessman. But it doesn't take an advanced degree in quantitative analysis to realise that the Democratic field, even at this (relatively) late date is still in flux. There are four candidates at or near the top of early state and national primary polls - all with their strengths, of course, but also obvious weaknesses. His strategy appears to be to let the other candidates fight it out in the early voting states, then take on a diminished field later in the process, where his near unlimited resources will allow him to compete in the dozens of states that vote in March. It's a risky play that only someone of Mr Bloomberg's vast wealth can afford to make. Even so, it takes quite a leap of faith to imagine that Democrats these days are ready to jump over to a New York City plutocrat ex-Republican with a smorgasbord of a record that's business friendly, fiscally conservative and includes opposition to government-run health insurance and legalised marijuana, and past support for aggressive policing measures. At the very least, however, his entry will provide him a means to push a party that he sees drifting dangerous leftward back to the pro-business centre.

"Supporters of a pro-democracy candidate celebrate as results in the district election were announced Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, early results show. According to local media counts, 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled over the unrest, it went ahead peacefully. The election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests and clashes. The government and Beijing had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"", but that did not materialise. Instead some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats. One controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, who lost his seat, Junius Ho, said ""heaven and earth have been turned upside down"". Protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run and how much control does China have? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections don't normally generate such interest. But these polls were the first time people could express at the ballot box their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition law. Also, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate eventually to a bigger share, and say, in who becomes the city's next leader. The vote was seen as a referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 2.9m people cast votes. That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police. Over the past months,demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating. Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter. It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists. But in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, in Hong Kong Outside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened and they poured into the public viewing area. Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent. As they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones. By their facial expressions it was clear they couldn't believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another. Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protestors following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies. More than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts. Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election. In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho - one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians - suffered a shock defeat. He was stabbed earlier this monthby a man pretending to be a supporter. The lawmaker has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions. He was in July filmed shaking hands with a group of men - suspected of being triad gangsters - who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters. As results were announced, pro-democracy supporters were in high spirits in Tuen Mun district Jimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front - a campaign group responsible for organising some of the mass protest marches - won a seat after running for the first time. Mr Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood. After the vote, Mr Sham said ""we have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions"". This video can not be played Joshua Wong says Beijing can't keep him down Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as ""political screening"", but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won. In a tweet, Mr Wong said the ""historic"" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement. Allow Twitter content?

Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms Lam's administration was partly to blame. ""In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,"" she said. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat. ""I think [Lee] is the only one who can survive the de facto referendum,"" said Leung Kwok-hung, her pro-democracy opponent in the poll.

"Compared to the Labour manifesto, Boris Johnson's plan for the country is a shopping list of promises, not an encyclopaedia of ambitions. There are new vows - no tax rises, a target of 50,000 more nurses to be working in the NHS by the end of the Parliament, scrapping many hospital parking charges, more money to fix potholes, an end to the Fixed Term Parliament Act and a mysterious-sounding ""Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission"". Tory manifesto 'to forge a new Britain' - Johnson The 12 key policies in the Conservative manifesto An historic document, however, this is not - for three political reasons. First, the Conservatives are haunted by their manifesto calamity of 2017, when Theresa May presented the country with a list of hard choices in the expectation that a big majority would give her the political space to drive through controversial reforms. No-one in the Tory campaign this time wanted to put forward ideas that could unravel into painful choices for the electorate. Second, this is still a new government, and Boris Johnson has already made major commitments during his short time in Downing Street - big new spending on infrastructure, for example, under a new, more relaxed, set of spending rules; more cash for the health service and the beginnings of a plan to bring police numbers back up by 20,000. Remember too, his tax cut from raising the National Insurance threshold wasblurted out just last week. Last and most importantly, the big contrasts in this election have been there since day one. The manifestos have served to underline, rather than reveal that reality. The Conservatives and the Labour Party have totally different approaches to the size of the state and their willingness to intervene in the market. And Boris Johnson called this election because he wants to leave the EU at speed. Whereas Jeremy Corbyn is, after months of Labour evolving its position, offering another referendum. That is the clear difference between the two big parties this time. Vote to leave the EU at speed, and enact the 2016 referendum, or choose Labour to push for another big national ballot, and plump for the chance to stay. It's worth adding, of course, that often in the small print there are surprises, or sometimes mistakes, in these documents that trip up the parties in time. It is too early to say with confidence, only a number of hours after the manifesto has emerged, that there is nothing that will cause problems in the days to come. Who should I vote for?

"The Conservative slogan ""Get Brexit done"" suggests a quick and easy path to leaving the European Union (EU), allowing the UK to focus on other things apart from Brexit. But it's not that simple. We know the Brexit deadline has been delayed again - this time until 31 January 2020. If the Conservatives win a clear majority in this election, Brexit day could be earlier than that, otherwise it could be delayed again. Either way, though, it won't be the end of the matter. Boris Johnson wants it to happen as soon as possible. ""It is fair to say you're getting Brexit done because you are coming out of the EU and you're coming out of the legal order of the EU,"" the prime minister told the BBC. ""You are really taking back control of all the things - money, border, rules - you are doing all that."" But while the day of Brexit would certainly be a big symbolic moment (loved and hated in equal measure), it would also leave an enormous amount unresolved. That's because Brexit is not really a single event - it's a complex process that will go on for years. The UK would no longer be a member state of the European Union. That would be a significant change. But - and this assumes the UK left with awithdrawal agreement- only a few issues would actually have been sorted out. Among other things: the financial settlement- or divorce bill - the UK has agreed to pay the EU to settle past debts and future commitments many (but not all) aspects of citizens' rights - for EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU future arrangements for keeping the land border in Ireland (which would become the only land border between the UK and the EU) as open as it is now Almost everything else would still be up for grabs. Brexit would not be done. The legally binding deal we're talking about at the moment covers only the divorce, not the future relationship. That is dealt with in an accompanying political declaration, which is non-binding and sets only a direction of travel. A future government could still change course. Initially, the UK would enter a transition period during which it would continue to follow all EU rules and regulations and continue to pay the same amount of money into the EU budget. The transition would be due to end in December 2020, but under the terms of the withdrawal agreement it could be extended by one or two years. The government, though, has now said it will not ask for any extension. The advantage of transition is it would be a soft landing. There would be no sudden changes to the way the economy works, which would give some certainty to businesses. And there would be time to start negotiating the shape of the future relationship between the UK and the EU. But for as long as it lasts, the UK would have to follow all the rules policed by the European Commission, and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, without having any say in making those rules. There is a lot we need to talk about. What kind of free-trade arrangements would be put in place? What kind of security and police cooperation would be negotiated with the EU? How would data be exchanged in the future? This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It usually takes years to negotiate a free-trade deal but the UK and the EU would initially have a matter of months. The withdrawal agreement says the two sides would have to decide by 1 July 2020 whether to extend the post-Brexit transition period. So if the UK was to leave on 31 January, at the end of the current extension, there would be exactly five months to negotiate a trade deal. That's not enough, not even close. It's true the two sides would start from the same place (with all the same rules and regulations). But it's also true this would be the first trade deal in history when two parties were trying to move further away from each other rather than closer together. Trade negotiations are not for the faint-hearted - naturally enough, everyone is looking after their own interests. Some sectors of the economy would do well but others with less political clout might suffer.The fishing industry(which represents only about 0.1% of the UK economy) is fearful of this because it knows trade deals involve trade-offs. One other thing: as well as negotiating with the EU, the UK would also need to sign up to a series of trade agreements round the world to replace those it has as part of the EU. All of that could take up most of the next decade. It won't be done when the UK leaves the EU - it will only just have begun. If the UK were to leave with no withdrawal agreement, of course, there would be no transition period. Supporters of no-deal call it a clean break -we've looked at what that would entail here. The UK would certainly be free of EU rules and regulations straight away. But it would be a sudden jolt thatgovernment forecasts,externaland the vast majority of independent economists say would do serious damage to the economy. All those negotiations about the future would still have to take place but they would do so in a much less harmonious political atmosphere. And if the government sticks with its pledge to rule out any extension to the transition period, its opponents fear a new kind of no-deal could happen at the end of next year - ending the transition without any free trade deal in place. Talking of harmony, part of the government's ""Get Brexit done,"" argument is it would help heal the divisions in society that have emerged since the Brexit referendum. But many people are opposed to the government's proposed Brexit deal. Those who support remaining in the EU would continue to campaign for another referendum - a final say before Brexit happens. And if they were to fail, they could transform their campaign into a movement to try to rejoin. On the other side of the argument, those who favour a clean break could continue to argue that the compromises the government has had to make to come to an agreement with the EU amount to a betrayal of their Brexit vision. Leave and Remain has become a more important dividing line in many ways than UK party politics and it doesn't feel like that will suddenly come to an end. Whatever happens in the next few months, the fallout from the Brexit referendum will remain with us for years to come. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Ruja Ignatova called herself the Cryptoqueen. She told people she had invented a cryptocurrency to rival Bitcoin, and persuaded them to invest billions. Then, two years ago, she disappeared. Jamie Bartlett spent months investigating how she did it forthe Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, and trying to figure out where she's hiding. In early June 2016 a 36-year-old businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. She was dressed, as usual, in an expensive ballgown, wearing long diamond earrings and bright red lipstick. She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency ""for everyone to make payments everywhere"". Dr Ruja speaking at the Wembley Arena Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the biggest and best-known - its rise in value from a few cents to hundreds of dollars per coin by mid-2016 had given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors. Cryptocurrency as an idea was just entering the mainstream. Lots of people were looking to get involved in this strange new opportunity. OneCoin, Dr Ruja told the Wembley audience, was the ""Bitcoin Killer"". ""In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more!"" she shouted. All over the world, people were already investing their savings into OneCoin, hoping to be part of this new revolution. Documents leaked to the BBC show that British people spent almost â¬30m on OneCoin in the first six months of 2016, â¬2m of it in a single week - and the rate of investment could have increased after the Wembley extravaganza. Between August 2014 and March 2017 more than â¬4bn was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemenâ¦ even Palestine. But there was something very important these investors didn't know. To explain this, I need first to explain briefly how a cryptocurrency actually works. This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy. The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent. (I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune. Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about Â£250,000. ""I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?'"" he recalls. ""And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.' ""I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.'"" The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. ""So we need you to build a blockchain,"" he went on. ""What's the name of the company?"" asked Bjercke. ""It's OneCoin."" He didn't take the job. One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar. Jen McAdam on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were ""very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion"", she remembers. ""You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now,"" she was told. ""You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger."" The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. ""That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her."" The video of Dr Ruja at the Economist conference was what clinched it for Jen McAdam By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest â¬1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe â¬1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost â¬140, but they went all the way up to â¬118,000. One week later McAdam bought a ""tycoon"" package, for â¬5,000. Before long, she had invested â¬10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest â¬250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed Â£100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction. The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - ""the biggest scam in the [expletive] world"". He said he could prove it, too. ""Well then prove it to me!"" she replied, sharply. This video can not be played Jen McAdam has a fiery Skype call with cryptocurrency enthusiast Tim Curry Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain. It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017. ""OK Jenâ¦ they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database."" But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will. ""I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,'"" she says. The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away. Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop starBebe Rexha performed a private set,external. The Davina - and Jamie Bartlett Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned. This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. ""She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there,"" recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution. In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja. Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. ""When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined,"" he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket. Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala outside their house They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan ""What dreams may come"". A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside. Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made â¬100m over the last 30 years. Here is how multi-level marketing works. I pay Â£100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) This video can not be played 'Hun, this could be your opportunity to get rich' MLM is not illegal. Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme. In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her ""princess's dresses"" and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. ""We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy,"" he says. ""We made in our first month almost â¬90,000 out of nothing. Bang!"" Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as ""the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM"". This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its ""product"". No wonder it spread like wildfire. Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than â¬1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. ""No other company even came close,"" Alberts says. Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than â¬2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buymoreOneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. ""I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet,"" Igor says. ""I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to â¬100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that."" Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them  - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too. After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit. I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process. ""I felt responsibility. Not guilt,"" he replies. ""You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchainâ¦ What doubt can I have?"" He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else. By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was â¬3,000 - â¬1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away. It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say â¬4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as â¬15bn. There's a famous saying in journalism, ""Follow the money."" So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. ""They still exist"", he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. ""You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible."" A page on the OneCoin website It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s. Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as ""improbably standard"". For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. ""British companies are the companies of choice,"" he comments. ""They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate."" He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. ""We are very proud of this in this country,"" he says. ""The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided."" He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. ""This is classic,"" he exclaims. ""Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all."" Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with ""significant control"" - the real owner. ""This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind,"" he says, as he scrolls down the page. ""Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegalâ¦ That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu."" So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, with Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt, on BBC Sounds When you're dealing with a scam worth billions of euros, it's not unusual for shadowy groups to get involved. Several of the people Georgia and I interviewed spoke darkly about mysterious people and connections they didn't want to name. ""When you talk about the amount of money that's been put into OneCoin of course there's people out there who are pissed off and would do anything to shut anyone like me up,"" says Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain expert who discovered there was no blockchain, and started talking about it publicly. He tells me he's received death threats as a result of speaking out. ""If I knew what I would have to go through, I would have never blown the whistle. I would have just turned my back and walked away,"" he says. Bjorn Bjercke on Norwegian television When I ask him who might be behind the threats, he won't elaborate. ""I can't discuss that. It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast."" According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her. ""Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it,"" Bjercke says. ""I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip."" Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of ""very influential people"". When I ask for more details, he replies: ""No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives."" Konstantin Ignatov It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and ""significant players in Eastern European organised crime"". On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested, and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace. OneCoin headquarters in Sofia, Bulgaria Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the ""visionary"" Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive. But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin ""family"". She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own ""leader"" who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. ""You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world',"" she recalls. ""That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!'"" Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. ""If you have any negativity you should not be in this group,"" she was told. Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. ""When prophecy fails they believe more strongly,"" she says. ""Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.'"" Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. ""And in that sense it's cultic."" In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. ""We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin,"" it said. ""We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers."" Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment. ""There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official,"" said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. ""If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over."" Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment. The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. ""The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction,"" it said. ""We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors."" Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. ""I'm devastated for all the UK victims,"" Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. ""Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care!"" The City of London Police told the BBC: ""There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online."" Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency. Allow Twitter content?

In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package. He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them. ""There was no other way,"" he says ruefully. Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin. In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam. Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket. Daniel, Prudence and Jamie with children in the poor area of Kampala where Prudence works as a nurse People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences. ""Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced."" If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth. ""I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money."" But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says. One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. ""One Life!"" he shouts. ""One Coin!"" the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services. As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market. The family had saved about Â£3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research. Daniel and his mother She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost. ""I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope,"" he tells me. ""I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work."" I ask him why not. ""It's hard. It's hard to say."" Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? I look at Daniel. ""Maybe you can tell herâ¦ Maybeâ¦"" he says. He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money. Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. ""If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful,"" she says. ""You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard."" When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next? There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility. This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on. ""What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all,"" he says. ""Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family."" Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia. ""In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean,"" he says. Dr Ruja was renowned for expensive dresses and red lipstick A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest. Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot. From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything. Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us. We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken. We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. Dr Ruja posted a video of herself with her baby on social media Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk. Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. ""You will find her,"" he said. ""You must dig deeper."" She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us. On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were ""haters"" who could not be believed. She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a ""big passport"", he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens. OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency."" It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast ""will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased"". It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established.""

OneCoin was a familiar scam with a digital twist - a new and hugely successful take on the old pyramid scheme. But to me it symbolises something else too. It represents the dark side of rapid technological change - the way that every new technology creates amazing new opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don't. Dr Ruja comes on stage at Wembley to the song This Girl Is On Fire Dr Ruja identified several of society's weak spots and exploited them. She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening. And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money.

"Campaigning continues ahead of general election on 12 December Boris Johnson launched the Conservatives' election manifesto in Telford He pledged to ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"" He also promised 50,000 more nurses, at a cost of Â£750m a year The Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be back before MPs before 25 December, he said Earlier Labour said it would compensate women who lost out on state pension payments after the retirement age was raised John McDonnell said the money for this will come from ""a very special arrangement, a contingency"" Emma Owen, Dulcie Lee and Jo Couzens Well, that was a busy Sunday. We kicked off with the morning's political programmes, before the Conservatives launched their manifesto - and then came the reaction to it. So, in a nutshell, what happened?  Now, with 18 days to go until polling day (and two days left to register to vote), all the main parties have launched their respective manifestos.Head here to check out our interactive guide to compare their policies. Thanks for joining us, see you tomorrow. Reality Check The Conservatives are promising
the âlargest ever pothole fixing programmeâ. They plan to
allocate Â£500m a year for four years to fixing holes
in the road. So will that fix every hole? According to the Asphalt Industry Associationâs latest
survey, nearly two million potholes were
filled last year in England and Wales, at a cost of just
under Â£100m. Thatâs about Â£50 a
pothole. Local authorities were able to fill
over 300,000 more potholes than the previous year, though the sum spent barely
rose. Thatâs because councils
are trying, a bit more, to fill in potholes as
part of planned repairs, rather than patching them up on an ad-hoc basis. Potholes are just one,
very visible form of road surface degradation, all of which contribute to
accidents and damage to vehicles. How much would it cost to repair
every road completely? Clearing  the maintenance backlog on the
whole road network would cost Â£9bn for
Englandâs roads, plus Â£800m for Wales, according to
the AIA. Unsurprisingly, the unions don't think much of the Tory manifesto. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, says the party are offering nothing for the  country's ""forgotten and left behind"" towns and communities. Describing it a ""wafer thin offering"", Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, says: ""No serious party would come to the table with so little to say, and on Brexit, Johnson just sounds like a scratched record. ""He may not be aware but the Tories have been promising to get Brexit done for over three years. Saying it time and time again won't make it happen."" And Unison general secretary Dave Prentis says: ""No-one should be fooled by the promises for the NHS and public sector. For the past nine years the Tories have slashed funding and let services slide. ""Now they are trumpeting a reversal of their own bungled policy of scrapping the nursing bursary - a problem of their own making."" Earlier, we told you how the IFS's Paul Johnson felt the Tory manifesto showed a ""remarkable"" lack of significant policy action (see our post at 4.37PM). Now we can give you his thoughts on the ""triple lock"" on taxes - ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years -  which he says is a ""pretty disappointing kind of promise"". ""It's tying the hands of the chancellor,"" he says. Mr Johnson says that in order to pay for the increased investment in public services that the parties are promising, ""some taxes are going to have to rise"". Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor In a funny way, the Tory campaign is hoping this manifesto doesn't cause an enormous splash. Lots of Conservatives are really haunted by the calamity of what happen after the Conservative manifesto in 2017. That was the moment Theresa May's campaign really started to unravel - more from the archive on thathere. This manifesto is really a 'steady as she goes' document. But we shouldn't let that mask the fact that there are fundamental difference between the parties on how to run the economy and the size of the state. We've been bombarding you with policy announcements and analysis from our experts. But sometimes, all you need is a simple guide to the key issues. Guess what?We have one here. One of the most eye-catching policies announced by the Conservatives is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. But when are new nurses new nurses? Our health editor Hugh Pym explains: ""It isnotright to say that the Conservatives plan to recruit 50,000 more nurses or find 50,000 new nurses."" The Tories' aim is to train 14,000 new
graduates and undergraduates by increasing the number of university training
places. And it's hoped that an expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will
bring in another 5,000. A further 12,500 nurses will
be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that
18,500 nurses will be encouraged to stay in the profession or return to work
through improved career development opportunities and an enhanced retention
programme. So, our correspondent says: ""It is correct to say that the party wants toadd50,000 more nurses to the existing workforce total of around 300,000."" The Confederation of Business Industries (CBI) - a group representing businesses - has responded to the Conservative manifesto. Deputy director-general Josh Hardie said businesses ""will be heartened by a pro-enterprise vision, while looking for even more ambition on areas such as access to skills and infrastructure"". He also warned that ""sustainable economic growth will be risked if there is a needless rush for a bare bones Brexit deal that would slow down our domestic progress for a generation"". And he called for ""a new immigration system that gives access to the full range of skills and labour the economy needs"" as well as urging the government to offer its ""unequivocal backing for key projects like HS2 and Heathrow.â The Tory manifesto gives some more details about the party's policies on constitutional issues. ""After Brexit we also
need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship
between the Government, Parliament and the courts; the functioning of the Royal
Prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary
people,"" it says. Mr Johnson has had a difficult relationship with the courts since becoming prime minister,with the Supreme Court ruling that his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. His manifesto also includes a pledge to ""update"" the Human Rights Act ""to ensure that there is
a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security
and effective government"". To examine these issues, a Tory government would set up a ""Constitution, Democracy
& Rights Commission"", it says. And on Northern Ireland, the manifesto says the UK is stronger and richer for it being a part of it. In particular, it says: The party's general election manifesto says it is ""ambitious"" for the Welsh economy. The country would get ""major investments"" in infrastructure and industry, support for Welsh language institutions, and continued backing for Welsh car manufacturing. You can read more detail on these promiseshere. Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent The Conservatives confirm that they will continue the roll out ofUniversal Credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced, they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a National Strategy for Disabled People promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through the tax and benefits system - but no detail on how that will be achieved or how ongoing complaints about the failings of the Universal Credit will be addressed. More reaction, this time from the independent research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The group's director, Paul Johnson says: ""If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were
notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. ""If a
single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have
been calling it modest. ""As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of
significant policy action is remarkable."" He goes on to highlight what he says is a notable omission. ""Taken at face value todayâs manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, thatâs it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. ""Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in. ""One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to 'fix the crisis in social care once and for all'. ""After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward."" Back to the other parties now, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he recognises much of the Conservative manifesto ""because they're things that I have campaigned on for years, such as hospital parking charges"". ""So, I'm pleased that they are changing the agenda. ""They're even talking, maybe, about reducing immigration levels and of course Brexit. ""My question is, do they mean it and are they going to deliver?"" Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris
Johnson makes a personal guarantee that he will ""get Brexit done"" and leave the
EU in January if he wins a majority. He says that will end the political divisions in the
country - but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal
with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that
they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a
trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance
what the UKâs negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU
single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the
manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its
fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with
the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been
done. Katie PrescottToday business presenter The UKâs homes are so poorly insulated that to meet our 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade
them. According to the Business Select
Committee, it is a national infrastructure priority. The Tories' pledge to spend
Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would
affect 2.2 million homes but thereâs no mention of what would be done for those who
own their home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on
their energy bills, following the retrofitting, sounds optimistic and could only
apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such
work, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. And the policy is dwarfed by Labourâs promises of
spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the UK's 27 million homes â
costing Â£250bn. The Conservative manifesto has promised to ""strengthen"" the union of the UK, saying: What has happened so far today? As you've probably gathered, Boris Johnson launched the Tory Party manifesto this afternoon in Telford. We'll carry on bringing you the latest reaction and analysis but if you missed his speech here's a quick recap on that and the other main stories from today: We've heard a bit about what Labour think of the Tory manifesto, and now it's over to the Lib Dems. Deputy leader Sir Ed Davey says it is ""built on a
lie"" that ""Brexit can be implemented without causing years of chaos
and damage to our economy"". âThese promises are not worth the paper they are written on,"" he says. ""Boris Johnsonâs Farage-endorsed Brexit deal would leave the UK Â£70bn worse off, meaning less money to invest in our schools, hospitals and
tackling the climate emergency. âThe best way to build a brighter future is to stop Brexit, so we can
invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our public services and tackling
inequality.â Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor For most degree students and their universities there is
little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review led by Philip Augar. In the
short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their
current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same
effect as the cut proposed by the Augar review panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the
Lib Dems training wallet and Labourâs promise of six years' free adult
learning. Instead, the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a
right to retrain. A new National Skills Fund appears to overlap with a
scheme to boost retraining already under way. Further education colleges may be disappointed that there is
no extra money to raise the funding rate for the 16 to 18-year-olds they educate but there is some consolation in the form of cash towards fixing crumbling buildings. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Supporters of a pro-democracy candidate celebrate as results in the district election were announced Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, early results show. According to local media counts, 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled over the unrest, it went ahead peacefully. The election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests and clashes. The government and Beijing had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"", but that did not materialise. Instead some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats. One controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, who lost his seat, Junius Ho, said ""heaven and earth have been turned upside down"". Protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run and how much control does China have? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections don't normally generate such interest. But these polls were the first time people could express at the ballot box their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition law. Also, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate eventually to a bigger share, and say, in who becomes the city's next leader. The vote was seen as a referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 2.9m people cast votes. That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police. Over the past months,demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating. Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter. It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists. But in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, in Hong Kong Outside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened and they poured into the public viewing area. Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent. As they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones. By their facial expressions it was clear they couldn't believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another. Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protestors following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies. More than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts. Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election. In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho - one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians - suffered a shock defeat. He was stabbed earlier this monthby a man pretending to be a supporter. The lawmaker has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions. He was in July filmed shaking hands with a group of men - suspected of being triad gangsters - who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters. As results were announced, pro-democracy supporters were in high spirits in Tuen Mun district Jimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front - a campaign group responsible for organising some of the mass protest marches - won a seat after running for the first time. Mr Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood. After the vote, Mr Sham said ""we have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions"". This video can not be played Joshua Wong says Beijing can't keep him down Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as ""political screening"", but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won. In a tweet, Mr Wong said the ""historic"" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement. Allow Twitter content?

Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms Lam's administration was partly to blame. ""In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,"" she said. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat. ""I think [Lee] is the only one who can survive the de facto referendum,"" said Leung Kwok-hung, her pro-democracy opponent in the poll.

"This video can not be played Many sheep drowned when the ship tipped over Rescuers are scrambling to save thousands of sheep trapped after a large cargo ship overturned in the Black Sea off the coast of Romania. The Queen Hind capsized on Sunday after leaving the port of Midia, near the south-eastern city of Constanta. It was carrying more than 14,000 sheep. All crew members were rescued. An operation involving the military, police, firefighters, divers and the Romanian coastguard resumed on Monday morning after an overnight pause. As many as six vessels in the area initially intervened to help the emergency services, Romanian media reported. At least 32 sheep found swimming near the Palau-flagged ship were rescued on Sunday, but many are believed to have drowned - with thousands remaining trapped. A rescue operation, supported by the military, police and divers, was launched on Sunday ""We have already saved a small number. They were swimming in the sea,"" Ana-Maria Stoica, spokeswoman for the emergency services in Constanta, told the BBC. The crew members on board - some 20 Syrian nationals - were rescued from the vessel almost immediately. One crew member was taken to hospital with hypothermia. This video can not be played Watch emergency services bringing sheep ashore after saving them from the capsized ship ""He fell into the sea but was very quickly rescued,"" Ms Stoica said, adding that the rest of the crew were ""all safe here in the harbour"". It is not yet known what caused the ship, which was bound for Saudi Arabia, to capsize. An investigation will be carried out when the operation to rescue any surviving sheep and salvage the vessel is concluded, authorities say. Cryptoqueen: How this woman scammed the world, then vanished The bizarre story behind Gang Starr's final album Why is Instagram deleting the accounts of hundreds of porn stars? The ship, which left Midia at about 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT), was heading to the Saudi port of Jeddah with its cargo. Built in 1980, the vessel measures 85m (278ft) and has a gross tonnage of 3,785,according to the Marine Traffic website,external.

"Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann said she came off social media for several weeks after ""sexist and homophobic"" online comments A police officer said ""sexist and homophobic"" abuse sparked by her hairstyle led her to leave social media. Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann made several media appearances while leading the evacuation of Whaley Bridge in August. Some viewers mocked her on Twitter. Ms Swann said the reaction reflected wider problems with social media and she was shocked her ""mere existence could cause such a depth of feeling"". About 1,500 people were evacuated from Whaley Bridge when a dam wall at the nearby Toddbrook Reservoir was damaged in August. Ms Swann, the senior officer in the operation, noticed comments about her on social media after she appeared before cameras at a press conference. ""Yes, I am a woman. Yes, I might have a slightly different hairstyle. Yes, I am quite small,"" she said. ""The bit that astounded me was I could not believe that my mere existence could cause such a depth of feeling."" Toddbrook Reservoir was at risk of flooding Whaley Bridge when part of the dam collapsed She told BBC Radio Derby: ""I can take a bit of banter but then it became sexist and homophobic, and really, really insulting. ""The bit that really hurt was when people said I had no standards and I was letting policing down."" Some criticised her standard issue police uniform. ""They were saying, 'she's not wearing a hat'. Often we would get advised not to wear hats - you can see our eyes, so you can gain trust."" One comment said: ""Is that what a senior police officer looks likely [sic] these days??"" But others - including the leader of Derbyshire County Council, Barry Lewis - jumped to her defence, saying ""Be under no doubt, she saved a valley....that's what's important"". Ms Swann said it reached its nadir when a press agency ""wanted to run a story on my hair"" and so she took a break from Twitter. She said: ""My personal experience of the trolling and negative comments on social media are reflective of those that some people receive every day. ""Some of the comments were misogynistic and homophobic and the abuse I received has been recorded as a hate incident, in the same way it would be for the public or my officers and staff. ""In recent years, we have seen children feeling bullied by their peers through personal attacks on social media; with youngsters in some cases so desperate it has resulted in suicide due to the pressures of the abuse."" Messages on social media became ""sexist and homophobic"", Ms Swann said While believing more can be done by police on the issue, Ms Swann hoped her appearance in the national media showed the growing diversity in the police force - and she has returned to Twitter. ""In a funny sort of way I made my stand without meaning to. If some good comes out of that that's fine, it doesn't mean that it didn't hurt, it doesn't mean that it didn't upset me,"" she said.

"Campaigning continues ahead of general election on 12 December Boris Johnson launched the Conservatives' election manifesto in Telford He pledged to ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"" He also promised 50,000 more nurses, at a cost of Â£750m a year The Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be back before MPs before 25 December, he said Earlier Labour said it would compensate women who lost out on state pension payments after the retirement age was raised John McDonnell said the money for this will come from ""a very special arrangement, a contingency"" Emma Owen, Dulcie Lee and Jo Couzens Well, that was a busy Sunday. We kicked off with the morning's political programmes, before the Conservatives launched their manifesto - and then came the reaction to it. So, in a nutshell, what happened?  Now, with 18 days to go until polling day (and two days left to register to vote), all the main parties have launched their respective manifestos.Head here to check out our interactive guide to compare their policies. Thanks for joining us, see you tomorrow. Reality Check The Conservatives are promising
the âlargest ever pothole fixing programmeâ. They plan to
allocate Â£500m a year for four years to fixing holes
in the road. So will that fix every hole? According to the Asphalt Industry Associationâs latest
survey, nearly two million potholes were
filled last year in England and Wales, at a cost of just
under Â£100m. Thatâs about Â£50 a
pothole. Local authorities were able to fill
over 300,000 more potholes than the previous year, though the sum spent barely
rose. Thatâs because councils
are trying, a bit more, to fill in potholes as
part of planned repairs, rather than patching them up on an ad-hoc basis. Potholes are just one,
very visible form of road surface degradation, all of which contribute to
accidents and damage to vehicles. How much would it cost to repair
every road completely? Clearing  the maintenance backlog on the
whole road network would cost Â£9bn for
Englandâs roads, plus Â£800m for Wales, according to
the AIA. Unsurprisingly, the unions don't think much of the Tory manifesto. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, says the party are offering nothing for the  country's ""forgotten and left behind"" towns and communities. Describing it a ""wafer thin offering"", Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, says: ""No serious party would come to the table with so little to say, and on Brexit, Johnson just sounds like a scratched record. ""He may not be aware but the Tories have been promising to get Brexit done for over three years. Saying it time and time again won't make it happen."" And Unison general secretary Dave Prentis says: ""No-one should be fooled by the promises for the NHS and public sector. For the past nine years the Tories have slashed funding and let services slide. ""Now they are trumpeting a reversal of their own bungled policy of scrapping the nursing bursary - a problem of their own making."" Earlier, we told you how the IFS's Paul Johnson felt the Tory manifesto showed a ""remarkable"" lack of significant policy action (see our post at 4.37PM). Now we can give you his thoughts on the ""triple lock"" on taxes - ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years -  which he says is a ""pretty disappointing kind of promise"". ""It's tying the hands of the chancellor,"" he says. Mr Johnson says that in order to pay for the increased investment in public services that the parties are promising, ""some taxes are going to have to rise"". Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor In a funny way, the Tory campaign is hoping this manifesto doesn't cause an enormous splash. Lots of Conservatives are really haunted by the calamity of what happen after the Conservative manifesto in 2017. That was the moment Theresa May's campaign really started to unravel - more from the archive on thathere. This manifesto is really a 'steady as she goes' document. But we shouldn't let that mask the fact that there are fundamental difference between the parties on how to run the economy and the size of the state. We've been bombarding you with policy announcements and analysis from our experts. But sometimes, all you need is a simple guide to the key issues. Guess what?We have one here. One of the most eye-catching policies announced by the Conservatives is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. But when are new nurses new nurses? Our health editor Hugh Pym explains: ""It isnotright to say that the Conservatives plan to recruit 50,000 more nurses or find 50,000 new nurses."" The Tories' aim is to train 14,000 new
graduates and undergraduates by increasing the number of university training
places. And it's hoped that an expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will
bring in another 5,000. A further 12,500 nurses will
be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that
18,500 nurses will be encouraged to stay in the profession or return to work
through improved career development opportunities and an enhanced retention
programme. So, our correspondent says: ""It is correct to say that the party wants toadd50,000 more nurses to the existing workforce total of around 300,000."" The Confederation of Business Industries (CBI) - a group representing businesses - has responded to the Conservative manifesto. Deputy director-general Josh Hardie said businesses ""will be heartened by a pro-enterprise vision, while looking for even more ambition on areas such as access to skills and infrastructure"". He also warned that ""sustainable economic growth will be risked if there is a needless rush for a bare bones Brexit deal that would slow down our domestic progress for a generation"". And he called for ""a new immigration system that gives access to the full range of skills and labour the economy needs"" as well as urging the government to offer its ""unequivocal backing for key projects like HS2 and Heathrow.â The Tory manifesto gives some more details about the party's policies on constitutional issues. ""After Brexit we also
need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship
between the Government, Parliament and the courts; the functioning of the Royal
Prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary
people,"" it says. Mr Johnson has had a difficult relationship with the courts since becoming prime minister,with the Supreme Court ruling that his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. His manifesto also includes a pledge to ""update"" the Human Rights Act ""to ensure that there is
a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security
and effective government"". To examine these issues, a Tory government would set up a ""Constitution, Democracy
& Rights Commission"", it says. And on Northern Ireland, the manifesto says the UK is stronger and richer for it being a part of it. In particular, it says: The party's general election manifesto says it is ""ambitious"" for the Welsh economy. The country would get ""major investments"" in infrastructure and industry, support for Welsh language institutions, and continued backing for Welsh car manufacturing. You can read more detail on these promiseshere. Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent The Conservatives confirm that they will continue the roll out ofUniversal Credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced, they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a National Strategy for Disabled People promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through the tax and benefits system - but no detail on how that will be achieved or how ongoing complaints about the failings of the Universal Credit will be addressed. More reaction, this time from the independent research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The group's director, Paul Johnson says: ""If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were
notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. ""If a
single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have
been calling it modest. ""As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of
significant policy action is remarkable."" He goes on to highlight what he says is a notable omission. ""Taken at face value todayâs manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, thatâs it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. ""Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in. ""One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to 'fix the crisis in social care once and for all'. ""After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward."" Back to the other parties now, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he recognises much of the Conservative manifesto ""because they're things that I have campaigned on for years, such as hospital parking charges"". ""So, I'm pleased that they are changing the agenda. ""They're even talking, maybe, about reducing immigration levels and of course Brexit. ""My question is, do they mean it and are they going to deliver?"" Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris
Johnson makes a personal guarantee that he will ""get Brexit done"" and leave the
EU in January if he wins a majority. He says that will end the political divisions in the
country - but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal
with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that
they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a
trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance
what the UKâs negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU
single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the
manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its
fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with
the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been
done. Katie PrescottToday business presenter The UKâs homes are so poorly insulated that to meet our 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade
them. According to the Business Select
Committee, it is a national infrastructure priority. The Tories' pledge to spend
Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would
affect 2.2 million homes but thereâs no mention of what would be done for those who
own their home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on
their energy bills, following the retrofitting, sounds optimistic and could only
apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such
work, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. And the policy is dwarfed by Labourâs promises of
spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the UK's 27 million homes â
costing Â£250bn. The Conservative manifesto has promised to ""strengthen"" the union of the UK, saying: What has happened so far today? As you've probably gathered, Boris Johnson launched the Tory Party manifesto this afternoon in Telford. We'll carry on bringing you the latest reaction and analysis but if you missed his speech here's a quick recap on that and the other main stories from today: We've heard a bit about what Labour think of the Tory manifesto, and now it's over to the Lib Dems. Deputy leader Sir Ed Davey says it is ""built on a
lie"" that ""Brexit can be implemented without causing years of chaos
and damage to our economy"". âThese promises are not worth the paper they are written on,"" he says. ""Boris Johnsonâs Farage-endorsed Brexit deal would leave the UK Â£70bn worse off, meaning less money to invest in our schools, hospitals and
tackling the climate emergency. âThe best way to build a brighter future is to stop Brexit, so we can
invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our public services and tackling
inequality.â Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor For most degree students and their universities there is
little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review led by Philip Augar. In the
short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their
current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same
effect as the cut proposed by the Augar review panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the
Lib Dems training wallet and Labourâs promise of six years' free adult
learning. Instead, the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a
right to retrain. A new National Skills Fund appears to overlap with a
scheme to boost retraining already under way. Further education colleges may be disappointed that there is
no extra money to raise the funding rate for the 16 to 18-year-olds they educate but there is some consolation in the form of cash towards fixing crumbling buildings. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Many sheep drowned when the ship tipped over Rescuers are scrambling to save thousands of sheep trapped after a large cargo ship overturned in the Black Sea off the coast of Romania. The Queen Hind capsized on Sunday after leaving the port of Midia, near the south-eastern city of Constanta. It was carrying more than 14,000 sheep. All crew members were rescued. An operation involving the military, police, firefighters, divers and the Romanian coastguard resumed on Monday morning after an overnight pause. As many as six vessels in the area initially intervened to help the emergency services, Romanian media reported. At least 32 sheep found swimming near the Palau-flagged ship were rescued on Sunday, but many are believed to have drowned - with thousands remaining trapped. A rescue operation, supported by the military, police and divers, was launched on Sunday ""We have already saved a small number. They were swimming in the sea,"" Ana-Maria Stoica, spokeswoman for the emergency services in Constanta, told the BBC. The crew members on board - some 20 Syrian nationals - were rescued from the vessel almost immediately. One crew member was taken to hospital with hypothermia. This video can not be played Watch emergency services bringing sheep ashore after saving them from the capsized ship ""He fell into the sea but was very quickly rescued,"" Ms Stoica said, adding that the rest of the crew were ""all safe here in the harbour"". It is not yet known what caused the ship, which was bound for Saudi Arabia, to capsize. An investigation will be carried out when the operation to rescue any surviving sheep and salvage the vessel is concluded, authorities say.

"This video can not be played ""An electric baton to the back of the head"" - a former inmate described conditions at a secret camp to the BBC Leaked documents detail for the first time China's systematic brainwashing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in a network of high-security prison camps. The Chinese government has consistently claimed the camps in the far western Xinjiang region offer voluntary education and training. But official documents, seen byBBC Panorama, show how inmates are locked up, indoctrinated and punished. China's UK ambassador dismissed the documents as fake news. The leak was made to theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),external, which has worked with 17 media partners, including BBC Panorama and The Guardian newspaper in the UK. The investigation has found new evidence which undermines Beijing's claim that the detention camps, which have been built across Xinjiang in the past three years, are for voluntary re-education purposes to counter extremism. About a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial. 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' The leading Uighur geographer who vanished in China The leaked Chinese government documents, which the ICIJ have labelled ""The China Cables"", include a nine-page memo sent out in 2017 by Zhu Hailun, then deputy-secretary of Xinjiang's Communist Party and the region's top security official, to those who run the camps. The instructions make it clear that the camps should be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline, punishments and no escapes. The Chinese government says the camps are for voluntary re-education The memo includes orders to: ""Never allow escapes"" ""Increase discipline and punishment of behavioural violations"" ""Promote repentance and confession"" ""Make remedial Mandarin studies the top priority"" ""Encourage students to truly transform"" ""[Ensure] full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots"" The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled: ""The students should have a fixed bed position, fixed queue position, fixed classroom seat, and fixed station during skills work, and it is strictly forbidden for this to be changed. ""Implement behavioural norms and discipline requirements for getting up, roll call, washing, going to the toilet, organising and housekeeping, eating, studying, sleeping, closing the door and so forth."" Other documents confirm the extraordinary scale of the detentions. One reveals that 15,000 people from southern Xinjiang were sent to the camps over the course of just one week in 2017. Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, said the leaked memo should be used by prosecutors. ""This is an actionable piece of evidence, documenting a gross human rights violation,"" she said. ""I think it's fair to describe everyone being detained as being subject at least to psychological torture, because they literally don't know how long they're going to be there. The memo details how detainees will only be released when they can demonstrate they have transformed their behaviour, beliefs and language. ""Promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past activity,"" it says. ""For those who harbour vague understandings, negative attitudes or even feelings of resistanceâ¦ carry out education transformation to ensure that results are achieved."" Ben Emmerson QC, a leading human rights lawyer and an adviser to the World Uighur Congress, said the camps were trying to change people's identity. ""It is very difficult to view that as anything other than a mass brainwashing scheme designed and directed at an entire ethnic community. ""It's a total transformation that is designed specifically to wipe the Muslim Uighurs of Xinjiang as a separate cultural group off the face of the Earth."" The long read: China's hidden camps Explainer: China's Muslim 'crackdown' Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign Detainees are awarded points for their ""ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline"", the memo says. The punishment-and-reward system helps determine whether inmates are allowed contact with family and when they are released. They are only considered for release once four Communist Party committees have seen evidence they have been transformed. The leaked documents also reveal how the Chinese government uses mass surveillance and a predictive-policing programme that analyses personal data. One document shows how the system flagged 1.8m people simply because they had a data sharing app called Zapya on their phone. The authorities then ordered the investigation of 40,557 of them ""one by one"". The document says ""if it is not possible to eliminate suspicion"" they should be sent for ""concentrated training"". The documents include explicit directives to arrest Uighurs with foreign citizenship and to track Uighurs living abroad. They suggest that China's embassies and consulates are involved in the global dragnet. Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said the measures had safeguarded local people and there had not been a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years. ""The region now enjoys social stability and unity among ethnic groups. People there are living a happy life with a much stronger sense of fulfilment and security. ""In total disregard of the facts, some people in the West have been fiercely slandering and smearing China over Xinjiang in an attempt to create an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs, disrupt China's counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang and thwart China's steady development.""

"The plane spun in the air three times before crashing, a witness says At least 27 people have died after a passenger plane crashed into houses in the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local officials say. The victims included nine people from the same family who were in one of the houses hit in the Mapendo area. The small aircraft went down shortly after taking off from the city's airport on Sunday morning. The cause of the crash is still unclear. The plane was carrying 17 passengers and two crew members, officials say. Air disasters timeline How likely are you to survive a plane crash? Airlines keep safety training 'to an absolute minimum' Air accidents are relatively frequent in DR Congo amid lax safety standards and poor maintenance, and all the country's commercial carriers are banned from operating in the European Union. The Dornier-228 twin-turboprop aircraft - owned by private carrier Busy Bee - crashed about a minute after take-off, a source at Goma airport told the BBC.

"The plane spun in the air three times before crashing, a witness says At least 27 people have died after a passenger plane crashed into houses in the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local officials say. The victims included nine people from the same family who were in one of the houses hit in the Mapendo area. The small aircraft went down shortly after taking off from the city's airport on Sunday morning. The cause of the crash is still unclear. The plane was carrying 17 passengers and two crew members, officials say. Air disasters timeline How likely are you to survive a plane crash? Airlines keep safety training 'to an absolute minimum' Air accidents are relatively frequent in DR Congo amid lax safety standards and poor maintenance, and all the country's commercial carriers are banned from operating in the European Union.

"The percentage of waste reused, recycled or composted from July 2018 to July 2019 was 63%, the same as the year previously The amount of residual household waste produced per person in Wales has reduced by 17% in six years. This is the type of waste which goes into black bin bags and is not recycled, reused or composted. From 2012-2013, 217kg was produced per person, dropping to 180kg in 2018-2019. The percentage of waste reused, recycled or composted from July 2018 to June 2019 was 63%, the same amount as the year previously, a Welsh Government report found. The Welsh Government said its aim is ""to continue our progress towards zero waste as we move towards a more circular economy"". There are types of plastics that can be more difficult to recycle, including black plastics. This can be because the lasers tasked with sorting plastics cannot detect it, meaning the black plastic can end up in landfill. Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose and Asda have saidthey will stop using black plastic in their products by the end of the year. Dr Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, a consumer psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University, said ""consumers are increasingly environmentally aware"". ""Many supermarkets are now aware of the fact that consumers feel strongly against the use of black plastic in particular,"" she added. Dr Jansson-Boyd said there is ""absolutely"" a market for reducing single-use plastic waste or making packaging plastic-free. The amount of residual household waste produced per person in Wales has reduced by 17% in seven years A spokesperson for Delyn, a packaging manufacturer in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly, said the percentage of black plastic packaging it produces is now in the single figures. It said black was cheaper than the clear version, as ""black can contain more recyclate of varying quality as it doesn't need to be clear"". ""Plastic has a pivotal role to play in extending shelf life, protecting the contents, especially in food and medical environments,"" the company added. ""The mantra 'reduce, recycle and reuse' sums up where we believe the direction needs to go."" 'Plastic-free' award UK first for island Why plastic recycling is so confusing Making Wales greener with bikinis and milk rounds Another Welsh company hoping to profit from this shift is Transcend Packaging, also based in Ystrad Mynach, which has been trading for six months and has 170 employees. It producespaper strawsfor McDonalds and has set its sights on the market for replacing black heat-resistant ""CPET"" trays, commonly used for ready meals. This video can not be played How recyclable is your food shop? Sales director Mark Varney said the ""widely recycled"" trays are made of cardboard with a heat-resistant coating - and no plastics. He said the firm was talking to seven large potential food business clients around the country. The product is more expensive than traditional CPET trays, but as ""the volume goes up the price will come down"". ""Sustainable packaging has been around for years, but the difference is now the consumers' want and need for it so the price of the tray isn't the be all and end all,"" he said. ""Consumers are the ones really pushing behind it."" ""We have to make a change,"" says paddleboarder Sian Sykes who spearheaded a campaign to cut plastic waste across Anglesey Sian Sykes, Anglesey's regional representative for Surfers Against Sewage, said when she moved back to Wales she found ""every time I was walking on the beach I saw the tide bring in new plastic"". Shepaddleboarded around Wales in 2018to raise awareness of plastic pollution. Ms Sykes advised those who want to make changes to get reusable items such as cups, bottles and cutlery, and urged people to ""make a pledge"" and replace one single-use plastic item with something reusable.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says ""prevarication and procrastination"" over Brexit have undermined trust in politics The Conservatives will ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"", Boris Johnson has said as he launched the party's election manifesto. He promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments. Other pledges include tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. The59-page manifesto,externalcomes 18 days before the general election. Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this ""closely fought"" contest had ""never been starker"". What's in the Conservative Party manifesto? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Kuenssberg: Tories seek to avoid manifesto calamity As it happened: Boris Johnson unveils Tory manifesto ""Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,"" he added. The manifesto, which the PM described as a ""partial blueprint"" for the future of the country, promises20,000 more police officersand to ""level up"" schools funding. Other policies include: A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Childcare: Â£250m a year, for at least three years, plus a Â£250m capital spending boost, for ""wraparound"" childcare - meaning after school or during holidays Environment: Â£6.3bn for upgrades to homes, such as grants for improving boilers and insulation Â£500m a year for four years for filling potholes - almost 10 times the amount promised by the party in anannouncement in March,external A new National Skills Fund of Â£600m a year for five years.Labourand theLiberal Democratshave announced similar plans Building ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" between Leeds and Manchester and investing Â£28.8bn in strategic and local roads A review of the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and courts"" There are no plans to repeal the Hunting Act, which bans the hunting of foxes and others wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was a pared-back, ""take-no-chances"" manifesto. A plan to lift income tax thresholds for middle-earners to Â£80,000, announced during the Tory leadership campaign, has been dropped, with Mr Johnson saying this ""was not the time"" for such a move. There is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. The aim is to train 14,000 new graduates and undergraduates. It is hoped that expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will bring 5,000 more recruits. Nursing maintenance grants scrapped in 2017 will be restored. These will fund student living costs up to Â£8,000 at an estimated cost of Â£760m in 2020-21, rising to Â£880m in 2023-4. A further 12,500 nurses will be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that 18,500 nurses will stay in the profession or return to work through because of career development opportunities and an enhanced retention programme. The Conservatives' target for 50,000 more nurses in England by 2024 is an ambitious one. Around 19,000, according to the party, will come from extra training places and the incentive of reintroduced maintenance grants for students. This is something of a U-turn, as it was the Conservative government which scrapped the grants in 2017 after which the number of applicants for nursing degrees fell. The policy, though, involves retaining tuition fees - before 2017 nursing students did not have to pay these costs. That leaves more than half the target to come from overseas recruitment and better retention. The Conservative policy is to cut the cost of visas for foreign health staff but the surcharge to cover their healthcare costs will rise. The outlook for recruitment outside the UK looks uncertain. The party says there will be more effective retention of existing staff through continuing professional development and there will be measures to encourage nurses who have left the NHS to return to the workforce. Once again, that sounds fine in principle but achieving it is another matter. The prime minister promised to bring back theWithdrawal Agreement Billto Parliament before 25 December. The Conservatives want MPs to ratify the prime minister's Brexit deal before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. After this there would be a ""transition period"" - during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules while the two sides try to work out a permanent trade deal. The manifesto rules out extending the transition period beyond the 31 December 2020 deadline. The House of Commons approved the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in principle in October. But it has to be reintroduced because Parliament was dissolved ahead of the election on 12 December. The Conservatives promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. The manifesto promises free hospital parking in England for people with disabilities, frequent patients, the gravely ill, families of long-stay patients, carers and NHS staff working night shifts. The Conservative Party says Â£78m per year will be provided, which it claims is new funding for extra parking capacity, or compensation for lost fees.Labour wants to make hospital parking free for everyone in England, in line with Wales and Scotland. The manifesto promises Â£1bn per year in extra funding for care for the elderly over the next five years. The PM said he was willing to talk to other parties to come up with a long-term solution for funding the system. The ""triple lock"" on the UK state pension - meaning it will rise by the rate of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher - will be retained as will the older person's free bus pass. The government says free TV licences for all over-75s should be maintained. The BBC - which is now responsible for administering them - has said only those on pension credit will get them free in the future. Despite their big spending commitments, the Conservatives say they are committed to fiscal discipline and all their proposals are costed. Anaccompanying document,external- setting out how the plans will be paid for - says there will be no borrowing to pay for day-to-day spending and the budget will remain in balance. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the party's pledge not to raise taxes could ""come back to bite"" it, as it could limit the ability to deal with costs to the NHS from an ageing society. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the manifesto was ""paid for by billionaires, written by billionaires and delivered by billionaires - the problem is the rest of us will end up paying for it"". Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election policy guide Brexit:Labour is promising to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on close alignment with the EU. This would then be put to the public in a legally binding referendum, alongside the option of staying in the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum with the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU and the Brexit Party says the UK should leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Taxes:Labour has set out plans to raise income tax for the top 5% of earners and reverse cuts to corporation tax in order to increase public spending. The Liberal Democrats would bring in a 1p rise in income tax to spend on health and social care. The Brexit Party wants to scrap corporation tax for companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year, ditch VAT for fuel bills and abolish inheritance tax. Childcare:Labour has pledged that within five years two, three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 30 hours of free pre-school education per week. The Lib Dems are offering to fund 35 hours of childcare, 48 weeks a year for children aged two to four. Do you have any questions about the election?

"The Conservative Party launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain's Potential. It sets out the policies the party aimed to introduce should it win the election, which it has now done by a huge majority. Thefull document,externalran to 59 pages. But what were the promises that the party hoped would grab the public's attention? Reintroduce maintenance grants for nursing students. At present, there are just under 300,000 full-time equivalent posts. The party hopes to train more nurses by reintroducing maintenance grants of between Â£5,000 and Â£8,000 a year for students. The scrapping of these grants in 2017 was controversial and was followed by a fall in applicants. So, it is something of a U-turn. However, the policy will not involve a return to the pre-2017 policy of free tuition for nursing students. The 50,000 figure is reached by including foreign recruitment and policies for better retention of nurses. Labour promised to recruit 24,000 nurses - based on higher numbers in training - and introduce free tuition fees and maintenance grants. Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales would benefit from the funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? This video can not be played Boris Johnson launches the party's manifesto Get Brexit ""done"" early in 2020. In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris Johnson made a personal guarantee that he would get Brexit ""done"" in January if he won a majority. He said that will end the political divisions in the country, but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and confirm that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? A little bit more spending - and a bit more tax. There were no rabbits out of the hat, no huge tax cuts, or rises, and no big ticket new spending item. By design, the tax and spend numbers were smaller than those of the Liberal Democrats and, especially, Labour. They have space to do a lot more within the new borrowing rules. But Chancellor Sajid Javid and Prime Minister Boris Johnson want to keep a tight ship. There will be a little bit more spending and a bit more tax too. But it amounts to less than 1% of the size of the economy. The big picture is several billion a year of extra spending, but not several tens of billions. Keep the so-called triple lock on the state pension. Keeping the popular ""triple lock"" means the state pension will be increased by the CPI measure of inflation, wage growth or 2.5% each year - whichever is the highest. Critics say that keeping it in place is unaffordable and that it doesn't help the poorest and oldest pensioners who are on the old state pension. But tampering with it would have been politically radical - all of the major parties have committed to it in this election. The Conservatives have learned from past mistakes. Theresa May pledged to scrap the 2.5% guarantee in the 2017 election, and was forced to abandon the pledge to win support from the DUP. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. A cross-party consensus on care will be built. Boris Johnson promised tofix the crisis in adult social care, but the manifesto contains little more than the guiding principle that no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care. As things stand, few would call these details an ambitious plan, but the Conservatives' pledge to urgently build a cross-party consensus on future care will be welcomed. The system is already at breaking point, and experts warn the extra Â£1bn a year promised for the next five years won't be enough to prop it up. Not least, because the money will be shared with equally overstretched children's services. The Tory calculation appears to be that it is best to say as little as possible, rather than risk being tripped up by an issue that cost them dearly at the last election. Social care is devolved so this will only apply in England. Meet the pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero. Conservative climate policies will attract scrutiny. In June, they set aworld-leading goal of cutting emissions to virtually zero by 2050. And they've created a boom in cheap offshore wind energy. Butinterim emissions targets are already slipping away,external. What's more, some scientists are warning that the climate needs even more urgent repair. That led the Lib Dems and SNP to propose an earlier clean-up date of 2045. Labour says it should be by the 2030s. The Greens want 2030 - which would mean practically all petrol and diesel vehicles banned, all homes insulated and all central heating boilers changed within a decade. So, it's not just a question of the date - it's whether the policy can be delivered. Energy policy applies to the whole of the UK, as does policy relating to exports. What is a climate emergency? Where the UK's recycling really goes CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Improve the energy efficiency of social housing. The UK's homes are so poorly insulated that to meet the country's 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade them. This pledge to spend Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would affect 2.2m homes. But there's no mention of what would be done for those who own their own home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on their energy bills sounds optimistic and could only apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such work on housing, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. The policy is dwarfed by Labour's promises of spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the 27 million homes in the UK, at a cost of Â£250bn. Housing is devolved so this will only apply to England. Fewer lower-skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. The last Conservative manifesto reiterated the leadership's intention to reduce net migration to less than 100,000. It became an albatross - a much-criticised target that was never achieved.  Boris Johnson had already jettisoned it in favour of an Australian style points-based system, attracting ""the brightest and the best"". The focus on control means that fewer lower skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. But while the Conservatives can argue this will mean less pressure on public services, it is these services which often rely on migrant labour. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Reduce poverty through changes to tax and benefits. The Conservatives confirm they will continue the roll out of universal credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a national strategy for disabled people promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through changes to tax and benefits. But there is little detail on how ongoing complaints about the failings of universal credit will be addressed. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Help parents by making childcare available in the holidays. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are offering multi-billion pound, universal childcare policies for pre-school children. But for the Tories this is a much more strategic offer - aiming to create 250,000 extra childcare places during the holidays for primary school-age children - about 5% of that age group. It would cost Â£250m per year for three years, with Â£250m for one-off costs such as buildings. This recalls the era of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, with its pre-austerity expansion of breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday clubs. Much of this will be delivered through schools, so it will depend on them being able to make their premises available over the summer holidays. Childcare is devolved so will only apply to England. Freeze of tuition fees at Â£9,250 likely to continue. For most degree students and their universities there is little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding, led by Philip Augar. In the short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same effect as the cut proposed by the Augar panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the Lib Dems training wallet and Labour's promise of six years of free adult learning. Instead the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a right to retrain. Tuition fees and education are devolved, so any policy changes will apply to England only. And there's Â£2bn to fill potholes. It's telling that top of the Tories' transport list is a promise to build a new rail line linking Manchester and Leeds. It's a long-held and well-founded grievance in the north of England that transport infrastructure is substandard compared with the south. But the project isn't expected to be complete before 2040. The more immediate infrastructure conundrum is High Speed 2 which is already under way. Given how much that project polarises opinion it wasn't a surprise when a Conservative government said it would make a decision after the election. And by singling-out funding of Â£2bn for potholes and a further Â£29bn for roads, the Conservatives are more at ease than the other main parties in reaffirming their commitment to the car as a predominant mode of transport. In truth, on transport there are no huge policy surprises. It will look into the constitutional power balance. The Supreme Court's ruling in September - that Boris Johnson's advice to the Queen to prorogue (suspend) Parliament was unlawful - was the latest and most dramatic example of judicial review. There is now almost no area of government decision-making that cannot be subject to scrutiny by judges. Some feel it has pulled the judiciary too far into areas of political decision-making. The Conservatives' proposed ""constitution, democracy and rights"" commission is intended to look afresh at the constitutional power balance between the three great institutions of state, the executive (government and crown), Parliament and the judiciary.

"This video can not be played Watch as Elon Musk laughs off the embarrassing incident Tesla has received almost 150,000 orders for its new pickup truck, boss Elon Musk has said, despite an embarrassing hiccup at its launch. Mr Musk was caught out on stage when the windows of the Cybertruck shattered during a demonstration supposed to show their durability. Tesla shares dived 6.1% after the event on Thursday and several bad reviews. With its distinct angular design, the electric truck was greeted with cheers but also bemusement. But on Saturday Mr Musk tweeted: ""146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri & 17% single motor"". The demand had come despite ""no advertising & no paid endorsement"" for the truck, he said. No date has been given for the Cybertruck's release, but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest. Tesla's new pickup truck smashed during demo The industrial-looking vehicle is covered in stainless steel alloy and will be able to go from 0 to 100km/h (62 mph) in about three seconds, Mr Musk said in his presentation in Hawthorne, California. However, some analysts are concerned about the futuristic design, with Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds' vehicle marketplace saying: ""It looks like a truck version of the DeLorean from Back To The Future."" Some analysts are concerned about the futuristic design The launch event's ""fail"" happened during a segment displaying how the truck's stainless steel exterior, and metal windows, could withstand bullets and sledgehammers. Tesla's head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, proceeded to throw a metal ball at the front left window, causing it to smash. He repeated the move on the rear left window and the same thing happened. Mr Musk was heard to swear before joking: ""Room for improvement."" On Friday Tesla's share price dived by 6%,slashing Mr Musk's personal net worth by $768m (Â£598m) in a single day,external, according to Forbes. The pickup market represents a significant opportunity for Tesla as it improves its battery technology, meaning carrying heavier loads over long distances is now practical. According to vehicle marketplace Edmunds, large trucks have accounted for 14.4% of new vehicle sales in the US up until October, compared to 12.6% in 2015.

"A map is created as a vehicle travels - using green, amber and red to show the road's condition Taxis, buses and even delivery vans could soon join the fight against potholes. They are the scourge of roads and motorists, with Flintshire council aloneleft with 4,000 and a Â£4m repair billlast year. But special monitoring technology being developed at the University of South Wales (USW) could help to find potholes before they get worse. It works through a dashboard device that collects real-time data. While sat-navs give the driver a profile of the road ahead, the small device records the profile of the road surface. Flintshire council tops pothole response table Meltable bags of plastic used in council trial Is our pothole problem getting worse? The system collects details of the smallest change in road vibrations, particularly potholes, feeding them into a real-time map. If a vehicle is travelling the same route every day, data it gathers can highlight potential problem areas. Trials have already been carried out with taxis and buses operated by Transport for London, highway maintenance vehicles in Northern Ireland and delivery cars working for Bristol Community Meals. The device is fitted to a vehicle's dashboard Data sent back shows the state of the roads, highlighted in red, amber and green to show their condition. ""The key problem councils have is knowing exactly where new problems form on the roads,"" said the man behind the device, Kevin Lee. ""There is ongoing planned maintenance. However that might not necessarily be where the roads are suffering the worst problems right now. This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? ""So, if you don't know where the problem is, how are you supposed to fix it? The benefit of our system is that it records what the problem is, when it is actually happening."" Mr Lee is the managing director of Cardiff-based Mobilized Construction and is being supported to develop the system by USW's Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Emerging Technologies (CEMET). Kevin Lee said councils have problems knowing where potholes are on their roads He said the system solved the three main problems caused by failing roads: the fall in safety standards for motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, the extra financial impact of road repairs and the environmental and time cost that road closures cause. ""The system gives local authorities time-relevant, vital data to ensure the roads that are in the most urgent need of repairs are dealt with faster,"" he added. The RAC's Pothole Index found that in the first three months of 2018, the proportion of breakdowns caused by road surface problems almost doubled compared to 2017.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says ""prevarication and procrastination"" over Brexit have undermined trust in politics The Conservatives will ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"", Boris Johnson has said as he launched the party's election manifesto. He promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments. Other pledges include tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. The59-page manifesto,externalcomes 18 days before the general election. Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this ""closely fought"" contest had ""never been starker"". What's in the Conservative Party manifesto? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Kuenssberg: Tories seek to avoid manifesto calamity As it happened: Boris Johnson unveils Tory manifesto ""Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,"" he added. The manifesto, which the PM described as a ""partial blueprint"" for the future of the country, promises20,000 more police officersand to ""level up"" schools funding. Other policies include: A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Childcare: Â£250m a year, for at least three years, plus a Â£250m capital spending boost, for ""wraparound"" childcare - meaning after school or during holidays Environment: Â£6.3bn for upgrades to homes, such as grants for improving boilers and insulation Â£500m a year for four years for filling potholes - almost 10 times the amount promised by the party in anannouncement in March,external A new National Skills Fund of Â£600m a year for five years.Labourand theLiberal Democratshave announced similar plans Building ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" between Leeds and Manchester and investing Â£28.8bn in strategic and local roads A review of the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and courts"" There are no plans to repeal the Hunting Act, which bans the hunting of foxes and others wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was a pared-back, ""take-no-chances"" manifesto. A plan to lift income tax thresholds for middle-earners to Â£80,000, announced during the Tory leadership campaign, has been dropped, with Mr Johnson saying this ""was not the time"" for such a move. There is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. The aim is to train 14,000 new graduates and undergraduates. It is hoped that expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will bring 5,000 more recruits. Nursing maintenance grants scrapped in 2017 will be restored. These will fund student living costs up to Â£8,000 at an estimated cost of Â£760m in 2020-21, rising to Â£880m in 2023-4. A further 12,500 nurses will be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that 18,500 nurses will stay in the profession or return to work through because of career development opportunities and an enhanced retention programme. The Conservatives' target for 50,000 more nurses in England by 2024 is an ambitious one. Around 19,000, according to the party, will come from extra training places and the incentive of reintroduced maintenance grants for students. This is something of a U-turn, as it was the Conservative government which scrapped the grants in 2017 after which the number of applicants for nursing degrees fell. The policy, though, involves retaining tuition fees - before 2017 nursing students did not have to pay these costs. That leaves more than half the target to come from overseas recruitment and better retention. The Conservative policy is to cut the cost of visas for foreign health staff but the surcharge to cover their healthcare costs will rise. The outlook for recruitment outside the UK looks uncertain. The party says there will be more effective retention of existing staff through continuing professional development and there will be measures to encourage nurses who have left the NHS to return to the workforce. Once again, that sounds fine in principle but achieving it is another matter. The prime minister promised to bring back theWithdrawal Agreement Billto Parliament before 25 December. The Conservatives want MPs to ratify the prime minister's Brexit deal before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. After this there would be a ""transition period"" - during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules while the two sides try to work out a permanent trade deal. The manifesto rules out extending the transition period beyond the 31 December 2020 deadline. The House of Commons approved the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in principle in October. But it has to be reintroduced because Parliament was dissolved ahead of the election on 12 December. The Conservatives promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. The manifesto promises free hospital parking in England for people with disabilities, frequent patients, the gravely ill, families of long-stay patients, carers and NHS staff working night shifts. The Conservative Party says Â£78m per year will be provided, which it claims is new funding for extra parking capacity, or compensation for lost fees.Labour wants to make hospital parking free for everyone in England, in line with Wales and Scotland. The manifesto promises Â£1bn per year in extra funding for care for the elderly over the next five years. The PM said he was willing to talk to other parties to come up with a long-term solution for funding the system. The ""triple lock"" on the UK state pension - meaning it will rise by the rate of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher - will be retained as will the older person's free bus pass. The government says free TV licences for all over-75s should be maintained. The BBC - which is now responsible for administering them - has said only those on pension credit will get them free in the future. Despite their big spending commitments, the Conservatives say they are committed to fiscal discipline and all their proposals are costed. Anaccompanying document,external- setting out how the plans will be paid for - says there will be no borrowing to pay for day-to-day spending and the budget will remain in balance. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the party's pledge not to raise taxes could ""come back to bite"" it, as it could limit the ability to deal with costs to the NHS from an ageing society. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the manifesto was ""paid for by billionaires, written by billionaires and delivered by billionaires - the problem is the rest of us will end up paying for it"". Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election policy guide Brexit:Labour is promising to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on close alignment with the EU. This would then be put to the public in a legally binding referendum, alongside the option of staying in the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum with the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU and the Brexit Party says the UK should leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Taxes:Labour has set out plans to raise income tax for the top 5% of earners and reverse cuts to corporation tax in order to increase public spending. The Liberal Democrats would bring in a 1p rise in income tax to spend on health and social care. The Brexit Party wants to scrap corporation tax for companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year, ditch VAT for fuel bills and abolish inheritance tax. Childcare:Labour has pledged that within five years two, three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 30 hours of free pre-school education per week. The Lib Dems are offering to fund 35 hours of childcare, 48 weeks a year for children aged two to four. Do you have any questions about the election?

"This video can not be played Pope visits Nagasaki in rare Japan trip Pope Francis has made an impassioned appeal for the abolition of nuclear weapons during a visit to Nagasaki, one of the two Japanese cities targeted by atomic bombs during World War Two. He decried the ""unspeakable horror"" of nuclear weapons and insisted they were ""not the answer"" for global peace. At least 74,000 were killed in Nagasaki by the attack by US forces in 1945. Two survivors of the bombing, now both in their 80s, presented the pontiff a wreath during the Sunday service. Pope France arrived from Thailand on Saturday for a four-day visit, which is only the second papal visit to Japan. The Japanese Christians forced to trample on Christ Hundreds of people gathered in the pouring rain to hear him in Nagasaki. The Pope then attended a meeting at the Peace Memorial in Hiroshima, the site of the other atomic attack. In a sombre ceremony, the Pope unequivocally condemned the use of nuclear weapons. ""This place makes us deeply aware of the pain and horror that we human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another,"" he said at the event in Nagasaki. This video can not be played Nuclear weapons: Explained in numbers During his speech, Pope Francis also took aim at their use as a deterrent and insisted peace is incompatible with the ""fear of mutual destruction or the threat of total annihilation."" He also criticised the money ""squandered"" on the weapons around the world and mentioned a ""climate of distrust"" hindering contemporary non-proliferation and arms control efforts. Where are the world's nuclear weapons? In pictures: Nagasaki bombing Sakue Shimohira, 85, and Shigemi Fukahori, 89, were two survivors who met with the Pope during the visit. ""My mother and older sister were killed, charred,"" Ms Shimohira was quoted by AFP news agency as saying. ""Even if you survived, you couldn't live like a human or die like a human... It's the horror of nuclear weapons."" The visit is the first by a Pope in 38 years There are about 536,000 Catholics in Japan,external, according to Vatican News. The number makes up less than only 0.5% of the population - where Buddhism and Shintoism are the most popular religions. Nagasaki is known for being home to so-called ""hidden Christians"" who practiced their faith underground when it was banned during the 17th Century. The first atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima by a US warplane on 6 August 1945. The US hoped the bombing, which came after Japan rejected an earlier ultimatum for peace, would force a quick surrender without risking US casualities on the ground. What happened in Hiroshima? The first bomb killed an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima - about half of whom are thought to have died on its initial impact. Thousands were killed instantly in Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 The attack was the first use of nuclear weapons, which had just been developed, during a war. US President Harry Truman only announced their existence after the first bomb was dropped. When no immediate surrender came from the Japanese, US forces dropped a second bomb three days later. Nagasaki was actually not the initial target of the attack, but was only chosen after bad weather obscured the main target city of Kokura. Japan surrendered six days later and officially brought about the end of World War Two. The necessity of the bombs, and their devastating and lasting impact on civilians, has been contested since.

That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. The manifesto promises free hospital parking in England for people with disabilities, frequent patients, the gravely ill, families of long-stay patients, carers and NHS staff working night shifts. The Conservative Party says Â£78m per year will be provided, which it claims is new funding for extra parking capacity, or compensation for lost fees.Labour wants to make hospital parking free for everyone in England, in line with Wales and Scotland. The manifesto promises Â£1bn per year in extra funding for care for the elderly over the next five years. The PM said he was willing to talk to other parties to come up with a long-term solution for funding the system. The ""triple lock"" on the UK state pension - meaning it will rise by the rate of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher - will be retained as will the older person's free bus pass. The government says free TV licences for all over-75s should be maintained. The BBC - which is now responsible for administering them - has said only those on pension credit will get them free in the future. Despite their big spending commitments, the Conservatives say they are committed to fiscal discipline and all their proposals are costed. Anaccompanying document,external- setting out how the plans will be paid for - says there will be no borrowing to pay for day-to-day spending and the budget will remain in balance. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the party's pledge not to raise taxes could ""come back to bite"" it, as it could limit the ability to deal with costs to the NHS from an ageing society. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the manifesto was ""paid for by billionaires, written by billionaires and delivered by billionaires - the problem is the rest of us will end up paying for it"". Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election policy guide Brexit:Labour is promising to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on close alignment with the EU. This would then be put to the public in a legally binding referendum, alongside the option of staying in the EU. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum with the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU and the Brexit Party says the UK should leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Taxes:Labour has set out plans to raise income tax for the top 5% of earners and reverse cuts to corporation tax in order to increase public spending. The Liberal Democrats would bring in a 1p rise in income tax to spend on health and social care. The Brexit Party wants to scrap corporation tax for companies earning less than Â£10,000 a year, ditch VAT for fuel bills and abolish inheritance tax. Childcare:Labour has pledged that within five years two, three and four-year-olds will be entitled to 30 hours of free pre-school education per week. The Lib Dems are offering to fund 35 hours of childcare, 48 weeks a year for children aged two to four. Do you have any questions about the election?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says ""prevarication and procrastination"" over Brexit have undermined trust in politics The Conservatives will ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"", Boris Johnson has said as he launched the party's election manifesto. He promised 50,000 more nurses in England and the creation of 50 million more GP appointments. Other pledges include tighter immigration controls and not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. The59-page manifesto,externalcomes 18 days before the general election. Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this ""closely fought"" contest had ""never been starker"". What's in the Conservative Party manifesto? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Kuenssberg: Tories seek to avoid manifesto calamity As it happened: Boris Johnson unveils Tory manifesto ""Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people,"" he added. The manifesto, which the PM described as a ""partial blueprint"" for the future of the country, promises20,000 more police officersand to ""level up"" schools funding. Other policies include: A ""triple tax lock"", ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years Raising the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500 in 2020, with an ambition to raise it further to Â£12,500 Childcare: Â£250m a year, for at least three years, plus a Â£250m capital spending boost, for ""wraparound"" childcare - meaning after school or during holidays Environment: Â£6.3bn for upgrades to homes, such as grants for improving boilers and insulation Â£500m a year for four years for filling potholes - almost 10 times the amount promised by the party in anannouncement in March,external A new National Skills Fund of Â£600m a year for five years.Labourand theLiberal Democratshave announced similar plans Building ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" between Leeds and Manchester and investing Â£28.8bn in strategic and local roads A review of the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and courts"" There are no plans to repeal the Hunting Act, which bans the hunting of foxes and others wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was a pared-back, ""take-no-chances"" manifesto. A plan to lift income tax thresholds for middle-earners to Â£80,000, announced during the Tory leadership campaign, has been dropped, with Mr Johnson saying this ""was not the time"" for such a move. There is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. The aim is to train 14,000 new graduates and undergraduates. It is hoped that expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will bring 5,000 more recruits. Nursing maintenance grants scrapped in 2017 will be restored. These will fund student living costs up to Â£8,000 at an estimated cost of Â£760m in 2020-21, rising to Â£880m in 2023-4. A further 12,500 nurses will be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that 18,500 nurses will stay in the profession or return to work through because of career development opportunities and an enhanced retention programme. The Conservatives' target for 50,000 more nurses in England by 2024 is an ambitious one. Around 19,000, according to the party, will come from extra training places and the incentive of reintroduced maintenance grants for students. This is something of a U-turn, as it was the Conservative government which scrapped the grants in 2017 after which the number of applicants for nursing degrees fell. The policy, though, involves retaining tuition fees - before 2017 nursing students did not have to pay these costs. That leaves more than half the target to come from overseas recruitment and better retention. The Conservative policy is to cut the cost of visas for foreign health staff but the surcharge to cover their healthcare costs will rise. The outlook for recruitment outside the UK looks uncertain. The party says there will be more effective retention of existing staff through continuing professional development and there will be measures to encourage nurses who have left the NHS to return to the workforce. Once again, that sounds fine in principle but achieving it is another matter. The prime minister promised to bring back theWithdrawal Agreement Billto Parliament before 25 December. The Conservatives want MPs to ratify the prime minister's Brexit deal before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January. After this there would be a ""transition period"" - during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules while the two sides try to work out a permanent trade deal. The manifesto rules out extending the transition period beyond the 31 December 2020 deadline. The House of Commons approved the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in principle in October. But it has to be reintroduced because Parliament was dissolved ahead of the election on 12 December. The Conservatives promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are.

"This video can not be played Watch as Elon Musk laughs off the embarrassing incident Tesla has received almost 150,000 orders for its new pickup truck, boss Elon Musk has said, despite an embarrassing hiccup at its launch. Mr Musk was caught out on stage when the windows of the Cybertruck shattered during a demonstration supposed to show their durability. Tesla shares dived 6.1% after the event on Thursday and several bad reviews. With its distinct angular design, the electric truck was greeted with cheers but also bemusement. But on Saturday Mr Musk tweeted: ""146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri & 17% single motor"". The demand had come despite ""no advertising & no paid endorsement"" for the truck, he said. No date has been given for the Cybertruck's release, but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest. Tesla's new pickup truck smashed during demo The industrial-looking vehicle is covered in stainless steel alloy and will be able to go from 0 to 100km/h (62 mph) in about three seconds, Mr Musk said in his presentation in Hawthorne, California. However, some analysts are concerned about the futuristic design, with Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds' vehicle marketplace saying: ""It looks like a truck version of the DeLorean from Back To The Future."" Some analysts are concerned about the futuristic design The launch event's ""fail"" happened during a segment displaying how the truck's stainless steel exterior, and metal windows, could withstand bullets and sledgehammers. Tesla's head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, proceeded to throw a metal ball at the front left window, causing it to smash. He repeated the move on the rear left window and the same thing happened. Mr Musk was heard to swear before joking: ""Room for improvement."" On Friday Tesla's share price dived by 6%,slashing Mr Musk's personal net worth by $768m (Â£598m) in a single day,external, according to Forbes. The pickup market represents a significant opportunity for Tesla as it improves its battery technology, meaning carrying heavier loads over long distances is now practical. According to vehicle marketplace Edmunds, large trucks have accounted for 14.4% of new vehicle sales in the US up until October, compared to 12.6% in 2015.

"Campaigning continues ahead of general election on 12 December Boris Johnson launched the Conservatives' election manifesto in Telford He pledged to ""get Brexit done"" and ""forge a new Britain"" He also promised 50,000 more nurses, at a cost of Â£750m a year The Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be back before MPs before 25 December, he said Earlier Labour said it would compensate women who lost out on state pension payments after the retirement age was raised John McDonnell said the money for this will come from ""a very special arrangement, a contingency"" Emma Owen, Dulcie Lee and Jo Couzens Well, that was a busy Sunday. We kicked off with the morning's political programmes, before the Conservatives launched their manifesto - and then came the reaction to it. So, in a nutshell, what happened?  Now, with 18 days to go until polling day (and two days left to register to vote), all the main parties have launched their respective manifestos.Head here to check out our interactive guide to compare their policies. Thanks for joining us, see you tomorrow. Reality Check The Conservatives are promising
the âlargest ever pothole fixing programmeâ. They plan to
allocate Â£500m a year for four years to fixing holes
in the road. So will that fix every hole? According to the Asphalt Industry Associationâs latest
survey, nearly two million potholes were
filled last year in England and Wales, at a cost of just
under Â£100m. Thatâs about Â£50 a
pothole. Local authorities were able to fill
over 300,000 more potholes than the previous year, though the sum spent barely
rose. Thatâs because councils
are trying, a bit more, to fill in potholes as
part of planned repairs, rather than patching them up on an ad-hoc basis. Potholes are just one,
very visible form of road surface degradation, all of which contribute to
accidents and damage to vehicles. How much would it cost to repair
every road completely? Clearing  the maintenance backlog on the
whole road network would cost Â£9bn for
Englandâs roads, plus Â£800m for Wales, according to
the AIA. Unsurprisingly, the unions don't think much of the Tory manifesto. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, says the party are offering nothing for the  country's ""forgotten and left behind"" towns and communities. Describing it a ""wafer thin offering"", Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, says: ""No serious party would come to the table with so little to say, and on Brexit, Johnson just sounds like a scratched record. ""He may not be aware but the Tories have been promising to get Brexit done for over three years. Saying it time and time again won't make it happen."" And Unison general secretary Dave Prentis says: ""No-one should be fooled by the promises for the NHS and public sector. For the past nine years the Tories have slashed funding and let services slide. ""Now they are trumpeting a reversal of their own bungled policy of scrapping the nursing bursary - a problem of their own making."" Earlier, we told you how the IFS's Paul Johnson felt the Tory manifesto showed a ""remarkable"" lack of significant policy action (see our post at 4.37PM). Now we can give you his thoughts on the ""triple lock"" on taxes - ruling out increases in the headline rate of income tax and National Insurance, as well as VAT, for five years -  which he says is a ""pretty disappointing kind of promise"". ""It's tying the hands of the chancellor,"" he says. Mr Johnson says that in order to pay for the increased investment in public services that the parties are promising, ""some taxes are going to have to rise"". Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor In a funny way, the Tory campaign is hoping this manifesto doesn't cause an enormous splash. Lots of Conservatives are really haunted by the calamity of what happen after the Conservative manifesto in 2017. That was the moment Theresa May's campaign really started to unravel - more from the archive on thathere. This manifesto is really a 'steady as she goes' document. But we shouldn't let that mask the fact that there are fundamental difference between the parties on how to run the economy and the size of the state. We've been bombarding you with policy announcements and analysis from our experts. But sometimes, all you need is a simple guide to the key issues. Guess what?We have one here. One of the most eye-catching policies announced by the Conservatives is a pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. But when are new nurses new nurses? Our health editor Hugh Pym explains: ""It isnotright to say that the Conservatives plan to recruit 50,000 more nurses or find 50,000 new nurses."" The Tories' aim is to train 14,000 new
graduates and undergraduates by increasing the number of university training
places. And it's hoped that an expanded nurse apprenticeship schemes will
bring in another 5,000. A further 12,500 nurses will
be recruited from abroad, through a new NHS visa. Finally, it is hoped that
18,500 nurses will be encouraged to stay in the profession or return to work
through improved career development opportunities and an enhanced retention
programme. So, our correspondent says: ""It is correct to say that the party wants toadd50,000 more nurses to the existing workforce total of around 300,000."" The Confederation of Business Industries (CBI) - a group representing businesses - has responded to the Conservative manifesto. Deputy director-general Josh Hardie said businesses ""will be heartened by a pro-enterprise vision, while looking for even more ambition on areas such as access to skills and infrastructure"". He also warned that ""sustainable economic growth will be risked if there is a needless rush for a bare bones Brexit deal that would slow down our domestic progress for a generation"". And he called for ""a new immigration system that gives access to the full range of skills and labour the economy needs"" as well as urging the government to offer its ""unequivocal backing for key projects like HS2 and Heathrow.â The Tory manifesto gives some more details about the party's policies on constitutional issues. ""After Brexit we also
need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship
between the Government, Parliament and the courts; the functioning of the Royal
Prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary
people,"" it says. Mr Johnson has had a difficult relationship with the courts since becoming prime minister,with the Supreme Court ruling that his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. His manifesto also includes a pledge to ""update"" the Human Rights Act ""to ensure that there is
a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security
and effective government"". To examine these issues, a Tory government would set up a ""Constitution, Democracy
& Rights Commission"", it says. And on Northern Ireland, the manifesto says the UK is stronger and richer for it being a part of it. In particular, it says: The party's general election manifesto says it is ""ambitious"" for the Welsh economy. The country would get ""major investments"" in infrastructure and industry, support for Welsh language institutions, and continued backing for Welsh car manufacturing. You can read more detail on these promiseshere. Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent The Conservatives confirm that they will continue the roll out ofUniversal Credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced, they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a National Strategy for Disabled People promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through the tax and benefits system - but no detail on how that will be achieved or how ongoing complaints about the failings of the Universal Credit will be addressed. More reaction, this time from the independent research group the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The group's director, Paul Johnson says: ""If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were
notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. ""If a
single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have
been calling it modest. ""As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of
significant policy action is remarkable."" He goes on to highlight what he says is a notable omission. ""Taken at face value todayâs manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, thatâs it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. ""Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in. ""One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to 'fix the crisis in social care once and for all'. ""After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward."" Back to the other parties now, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he recognises much of the Conservative manifesto ""because they're things that I have campaigned on for years, such as hospital parking charges"". ""So, I'm pleased that they are changing the agenda. ""They're even talking, maybe, about reducing immigration levels and of course Brexit. ""My question is, do they mean it and are they going to deliver?"" Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris
Johnson makes a personal guarantee that he will ""get Brexit done"" and leave the
EU in January if he wins a majority. He says that will end the political divisions in the
country - but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal
with the EU next year, and have confirmed as a written manifesto pledge that
they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a
trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance
what the UKâs negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU
single market, and any form of customs union. There will be no political alignment with the EU, the
manifesto says, and it promises that the UK will be in full control of its
fishing waters. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with
the EU, business uncertainty will continue. And it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been
done. Katie PrescottToday business presenter The UKâs homes are so poorly insulated that to meet our 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade
them. According to the Business Select
Committee, it is a national infrastructure priority. The Tories' pledge to spend
Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would
affect 2.2 million homes but thereâs no mention of what would be done for those who
own their home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on
their energy bills, following the retrofitting, sounds optimistic and could only
apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such
work, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. And the policy is dwarfed by Labourâs promises of
spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the UK's 27 million homes â
costing Â£250bn. The Conservative manifesto has promised to ""strengthen"" the union of the UK, saying: What has happened so far today? As you've probably gathered, Boris Johnson launched the Tory Party manifesto this afternoon in Telford. We'll carry on bringing you the latest reaction and analysis but if you missed his speech here's a quick recap on that and the other main stories from today: We've heard a bit about what Labour think of the Tory manifesto, and now it's over to the Lib Dems. Deputy leader Sir Ed Davey says it is ""built on a
lie"" that ""Brexit can be implemented without causing years of chaos
and damage to our economy"". âThese promises are not worth the paper they are written on,"" he says. ""Boris Johnsonâs Farage-endorsed Brexit deal would leave the UK Â£70bn worse off, meaning less money to invest in our schools, hospitals and
tackling the climate emergency. âThe best way to build a brighter future is to stop Brexit, so we can
invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our public services and tackling
inequality.â Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor For most degree students and their universities there is
little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review led by Philip Augar. In the
short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their
current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same
effect as the cut proposed by the Augar review panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the
Lib Dems training wallet and Labourâs promise of six years' free adult
learning. Instead, the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a
right to retrain. A new National Skills Fund appears to overlap with a
scheme to boost retraining already under way. Further education colleges may be disappointed that there is
no extra money to raise the funding rate for the 16 to 18-year-olds they educate but there is some consolation in the form of cash towards fixing crumbling buildings. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The protest delayed the game by about half an hour Hundreds of students have disrupted the annual Harvard-Yale football game in a climate change protest. They invaded the field in New Haven, Connecticut, at half-time, demanding that the two elite US universities stop investing in fossil fuels. As officials appealed for them to leave, spectators and some players also joined the protest, US media report. About 50 people were escorted from the field by police, while others left voluntarily. Can the divestment movement tame climate change? Clear and unequivocal climate emergency - scientists The protest began when dozens of students and alumni stormed the field, linking arms and holding signs reading Yale and Harvard United for Climate Justice,the Harvard Crimson newspaper reported,external. Some chanted ""Disclose, Divest, and Reinvest"". Divestment refers to the shedding of stocks, bonds or other investments as a way to tackle climate change. Protesters who refused to leave were escorted off the field by police The protest delayed the game by about half an hour. In a video released by the group Divest Harvard,external, university football team captain Wesley Osgbury said both universities were investing in industries that are ""destroying our futures"". ""When it comes to the climate crisis, no-one wins,"" he said. ""Harvard and Yale can't claim to truly promote knowledge while at the same time supporting the companies engaged in misleading the public, smearing academics and denying the truth. That's why we are joining together with our friends at Yale to call for change."" The first group of protesters was quickly joined by spectators and some players A Yale spokeswoman said that while the university supported the right to freedom of expression it did not approve of the protesters' tactics, or the disruption of university events.

In a statement published by the Harvard Crimson, spokeswoman Rachael Dane said: ""Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.""

"This video can not be played Asma Shuweikh was praised for confronting the abusive commuter A man has been arrested after a video showed a Tube passenger directing ""horrific"" anti-Semitic abuse at Jewish children. The clip showed a man reading Bible passages to two boys in skullcaps and acting aggressively. British Transport Police launched an appeal over the footage, recorded by a commuter on the London Underground. The force said it had arrested a man in Birmingham on suspicion of a racially-aggravated offence. Asma Shuweikh, who was widely praised for confronting the man in the video, said she ""wouldn't hesitate to do it again"" and wished more people had intervened in the altercation on Friday. The video was recorded on a Northern Line service on Friday ""If everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did,"" she said. ""Being a mother of two, I know what it's like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation. ""When he started talking to the child I thought, 'no, I have to say something'. As a mother of two it's appalling, I can't sit back and watch that happen. ""To be honest I thought it is my duty as a mother, as a practising Muslim, as a citizen of this country, to have to say something.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she had a ""moral objection to weapons of mass destruction"" Scrapping Trident would be one of the SNP's key demands to gain its support in the event of a minority Labour government, says Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP is willing to support a Labour government if no party wins an overall majority - but the SNP leader has ruled out a formal coalition. Ms Sturgeon also wants Labour to stop Brexit and commit to an independence referendum next year. The Labour manifesto includes a pledge to renew the Trident nuclear programme. LIVE: Election campaign Tories to unveil manifesto 'to get Brexit done' Labour pledges payouts to pension age rise women Ms Sturgeonwas asked by Sky's Sophie Ridge,externalif scrapping Trident would be a red line for the SNP to support Labour. She replied ""Yes"", adding that the SNP would be ""absolutely firm"" on that. The SNP leader continued: ""I have a moral objection to weapons of mass destruction... I wouldn't be prepared to press a nuclear button that would kill potentially millions, tens of millions, of people. ""But there's also the opportunity costs of Trident - the billions, tens of billions, that are required to renew Trident in my view are better spent on stronger, conventional defence that is more effective to protect our country but also hospitals and schools and better social security provision. ""And these are the choices that we should be thinking very carefully about."" Sturgeon lists SNP's conditions for backing Labour Can Nicola Sturgeon deliver Scottish independence Ms Sturgeon said that in the event of a hung parliament, where no party had an overall majority and the SNP held the balance of power, Scotland would have ""maximum influence"", adding: ""That would be a pretty good outcome I think in terms of making sure Scotland's voice is heard."" She reiterated that there would be no coalition with Labour, saying instead SNP support would be ""less formal"" - such as a confidence and supply arrangement, where the SNP would support a Labour government on explicit votes in return for government support of specific policies. ""Other matters"" that she would want to progress would include holding anindependence referendum next year, stopping Brexit, devolving control of migration, employment and drugs classification laws to Holyrood and a ""real end to austerity""  and ""to the misery of Universal Credit and welfare cuts"". She insisted these issues would ""resonate strongly with many people across the UK"", as well as her supporters in Scotland. She added that she would ""never, ever"" put Boris Johnson into power. Labour say they willnot agree to a Scottish independence referendum in the ""early years"" of government. And duringFriday's Question Time leaders' special, Jeremy Corbyn said he did not plan to rely on other parties for support after the election. He said: ""We're not doing any deals with any other parties. I'm not trying to form a coalition government. ""I'm fighting this election to win it for Labour."" HMS Vigilant is one of four submarines which carry the UK's Trident nuclear programme Since 1969, according togovernment documents,external, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans. The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor - a concept known asmutually assured destruction. The UK has four Vanguard-class submarines, which each carry Trident missiles. While not on patrol, the submarines are located at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde - commonly known as Faslane. Faslane was chosen to host the UK's Polaris nuclear-armed submarine fleet at the height of the Cold War in the 1960s because of its relatively secluded position next to the deep waters of the Gare Loch and Firth of Clyde on the west coast of Scotland. Read more here. AlthoughLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been a longstanding critic of nuclear weapons, his party'smanifesto for the 12 December election,externaldid include a pledge to renew the Trident nuclear programme and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence. The Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson said on Tuesday,externalin an interview with ITV that she would be prepared to press the nuclear button if she was prime minister. A spokesman for theConservatives, who launched their manifesto on Sunday,said: ""Trident is good for Britain's security, and good for Scottish jobs.

"The victim was found injured in a car outside West Ealing station on Drayton Green Road A man has died after being found fatally stabbed in a car outside a railway station in west London. Murder detectives believe the 26-year-old victim was injured in a fight near to West Ealing railway station and was then involved in a car crash on Drayton Green Road shortly before 01:20 GMT. Police have also quashed rumours the man was killed in a ""road rage"" attack. So far there have been no arrests as detectives continue to investigate the man's murder. The victim's family is aware and a post-mortem examination will be held later. Det Insp Neil John said: ""We believe the victim was involved in an altercation 100m from the railway station on The Avenue. ""This is a busy street with a number of shops and restaurants and if anybody was in the area and saw something, no matter how small, I would urge them to contact police."" West Ealing train station was closed for most of Sunday and only reopened at 13:45 GMT Ruth Holmstock, 72, whose flat overlooks the scene of the crash, said she heard a single ""thump"" in the early hours. She described it as ""the sort of noise you make when you reverse into a gate, but it was loud enough to make me go and see what it was."" ""There were a lot of people hanging around. It looked like any other crash, like they were swapping insurance details,"" she added. Kiran Ramachandraiah, who lives in the same block of flats, said he woke up at about 02:00 to see paramedics trying to revive the victim. ""I couldn't see the person,"" he said. ""He was completely surrounded by police and paramedics."" The attack followsa fatal stabbing in Whitechapel on Saturday, in which another man in his 20s was killed.

"Colombia's President IvÃ¡n Duque has said security forces will remain on the streets to maintain order, as protests continued for a third day. The anti-government demonstrations erupted on Thursday, when more than 250,000 marched in a national strike. They started peacefully but clashes between protesters and police have since broken out, and there have been reports of vandalism and looting. Mr Duque said troops would carry out joint patrols with police. ""We express the total and absolute rejection of all Colombians for the vandalism, for the terrorism, for the looting,"" Mr Duque told reporters on Saturday. Duque: Puppet or rock star? BogotÃ¡ placed under curfew amid fresh protests Why protesters are on the streets worldwide At least three people have died since the protests against corruption and possible austerity measures began. A curfew was imposed in the capital, BogotÃ¡, on Friday, but it did not deter protesters from returning to the streets a day later. President Duque said troops would carry out joint patrols with police When protests resumed on Saturday, police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of people who had gathered near BogotÃ¡'s National Park, reports said. Demonstrators also gathered outside of congress in Bolivar Plaza, near the presidential palace. Protests took to the streets of BogotÃ¡ despite a curfew imposed by the mayor Separately, late on Friday, three police officers were killed in a bomb attack in the country's south-west. It is not clear if the incident is connected to the protests. The area is notorious for drug trafficking and gang violence. Colombians have taken to the streets over possible changes to the minimum wage, pension and tax reforms, and the privatisation of state companies. The government insists there are no planned pension or labour reforms and that any changes would take place in consultation with labour groups. Protesters are also angry about alleged corruption and whatsome see as the government's failure to honour a 2016 peace deal with left-wing Farc rebelsamid a rise in violence. Thursday's general strike was called by unions and student groups, and more protests were held on Friday, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds This video can not be played Protesters scattered as police fired tear gas in the capital BogotÃ¡ President Duque said he had heard Colombians and vowed to deepen ""social dialogue"". Unrest in Colombia has coincided with a surge of anti-government demonstrations elsewhere in Latin America.

"The percentage of waste reused, recycled or composted from July 2018 to July 2019 was 63%, the same as the year previously The amount of residual household waste produced per person in Wales has reduced by 17% in six years. This is the type of waste which goes into black bin bags and is not recycled, reused or composted. From 2012-2013, 217kg was produced per person, dropping to 180kg in 2018-2019. The percentage of waste reused, recycled or composted from July 2018 to June 2019 was 63%, the same amount as the year previously, a Welsh Government report found. The Welsh Government said its aim is ""to continue our progress towards zero waste as we move towards a more circular economy"". There are types of plastics that can be more difficult to recycle, including black plastics. This can be because the lasers tasked with sorting plastics cannot detect it, meaning the black plastic can end up in landfill. Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose and Asda have saidthey will stop using black plastic in their products by the end of the year. Dr Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, a consumer psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University, said ""consumers are increasingly environmentally aware"". ""Many supermarkets are now aware of the fact that consumers feel strongly against the use of black plastic in particular,"" she added. Dr Jansson-Boyd said there is ""absolutely"" a market for reducing single-use plastic waste or making packaging plastic-free. The amount of residual household waste produced per person in Wales has reduced by 17% in seven years A spokesperson for Delyn, a packaging manufacturer in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly, said the percentage of black plastic packaging it produces is now in the single figures. It said black was cheaper than the clear version, as ""black can contain more recyclate of varying quality as it doesn't need to be clear"". ""Plastic has a pivotal role to play in extending shelf life, protecting the contents, especially in food and medical environments,"" the company added. ""The mantra 'reduce, recycle and reuse' sums up where we believe the direction needs to go."" 'Plastic-free' award UK first for island Why plastic recycling is so confusing Making Wales greener with bikinis and milk rounds Another Welsh company hoping to profit from this shift is Transcend Packaging, also based in Ystrad Mynach, which has been trading for six months and has 170 employees. It producespaper strawsfor McDonalds and has set its sights on the market for replacing black heat-resistant ""CPET"" trays, commonly used for ready meals. This video can not be played How recyclable is your food shop? Sales director Mark Varney said the ""widely recycled"" trays are made of cardboard with a heat-resistant coating - and no plastics. He said the firm was talking to seven large potential food business clients around the country. The product is more expensive than traditional CPET trays, but as ""the volume goes up the price will come down"". ""Sustainable packaging has been around for years, but the difference is now the consumers' want and need for it so the price of the tray isn't the be all and end all,"" he said. ""Consumers are the ones really pushing behind it."" ""We have to make a change,"" says paddleboarder Sian Sykes who spearheaded a campaign to cut plastic waste across Anglesey Sian Sykes, Anglesey's regional representative for Surfers Against Sewage, said when she moved back to Wales she found ""every time I was walking on the beach I saw the tide bring in new plastic"". Shepaddleboarded around Wales in 2018to raise awareness of plastic pollution. Ms Sykes advised those who want to make changes to get reusable items such as cups, bottles and cutlery, and urged people to ""make a pledge"" and replace one single-use plastic item with something reusable.

"Justice Ginsburg is the most senior liberal judge on the US Supreme Court US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been discharged from hospital after suffering chills and a fever, the court says. The 86-year-old is ""doing well"" after returning home on Sunday, a court spokeswoman said. The court said Ms Ginsburgwas evaluated at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington,externalon Friday. She was then transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital for ""treatment of any possible infection"", the court said. Her symptoms improved after she was given intravenous antibiotics and fluids, the court said. As the court's most senior liberal justice, her health is closely watched. The hospital visit came days after Ms Ginsburg returned to the Supreme Court's bench after missing a session the previous week due to a stomach bug. Why half of America panics when this woman falls ill Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court Ms Ginsburg is the oldest sitting justice on the Supreme Court, and has received hospital treatment a number of times in recent years. In August, she was treated for a cancerous tumour on her pancreas. She received treatment for colon cancer in 1999, and pancreatic cancer in 2009. In December 2018 she had surgery to remove two cancerous nodules from her lung. She has also suffered fractured ribs from falls. US Supreme Court justices serve for life or until they choose to retire, and supporters have expressed concern that if anything were to happen to Ms Ginsburg then a more conservative justice could replace her.

"This video can not be played Labour's Angela Rayner: ""The government failed the women who were born in the 1950s"" Labour has promised compensation to more than three million women who lost out on years of state pension payments when their retirement age was raised, if it wins the general election. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the pledge would settle a ""debt of honour"" to women born in the 1950s. Those expecting to retire at 60 were told they would have to wait years longer when changes to the state pension age were accelerated in 2010. Labour said its promise may cost Â£58bn. The costing was not included in the party's manifesto, published earlier this week. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, cabinet minister Michael Gove said he was ""sympathetic"" to the position the women were in but accused Labour of producing a manifesto that ""drove a coach and horses"" through the party's own rules on spending. And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it was not clear ""where the money is coming from"". By Katie Prescott, BBC News business correspondent Labour is pledging to pay all women born in the 1950s for any pension income they may have lost when the men's and women's state pension age was equalised - in stages beginning in 2010 - following an act of Parliament in 1995. But pensions expert John Ralfe says the money would be far better targeted at those who were hit when the timeframe to equalise the gap was accelerated in 2011 - a far smaller cohort. He argues that it would be sensible to means-test the funding, so it can go to those who suffered hardship when the changes were put in place. But Labour's policy is all-encompassing. The party says that, as all women paid in, all women should get out and as ""a one-off historical redress for a historical wrongâ¦ the state will be expected to find the money"". But questioned by Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Mr McDonnell said it would be funded by a ""very special arrangement, a contingency, in the same way government in the past has dealt with matters in the past like this"". The fight over women's state pensions Defeat for women in state pension age challenge The retirement age for women rose to 65 in 2018, in line with men, and will go up to 66 by 2020, and to 67 by 2028. But a campaign by so-called Waspi women - theWomen Against State Pension Inequality,external- argues that they were not given enough time to prepare for the changes. Another group of campaigners known as Backto60recently lost a legal battleagainst the government over its handling of the issue. Labour said it would make individual payments of an average of Â£15,380 to the 3.7 million women it claims were affected, with some payouts as high as Â£31,300. Mr McDonnell said the compensation, which the party says could cost Â£58bn over five years, would right a ""historical wrong"". He told Sophy Ridge that the women affected ""had done everything that had been asked"" of them during their working lives and many had been ""forced into penury"" through no fault of their own. ""This is a historic injustice and we have to address it. Some of these women are older and may not be with us if we don't act quickly."" He said Labour was working on the assumption that the women ultimately won their legal fight for financial redress against the government. ""It is expensive but it is an entitlement, it is not a benefitâ¦The scale of this injustice is enormous"". Labour's economic plan in 10 points Asked why the cost of the policy was not included in Labour's manifesto, he said it was being treated differently from other financial commitments, likening it to compensationthe government had to pay to mesothelioma victimsafter losing a long-running legal battle last year. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said justice for those affected was a ""price worth paying"". ""People should have confidence in their government that they are not going to steal their pension,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""It fundamentally undermines the contract between the state and its people."" Labour has already promised to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future, a move which would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. From 1948 for more than 60 years men received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60. But over the years it was argued that the difference was unfair, as women had a longer life expectancy than men. So under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020. But the coalition government of 2010 decided to accelerate that timetable, arguing that the state pension was becoming unaffordable. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was bought forward to 2018 - affecting millions of women. While some of them had time to adapt to a longer working life, for others the change came as a shock. Read more here. Labour's pledge comes as a contrast to the Conservative Party's outlook on theWaspi campaign,external. Boris Johnson was challenged by one of the women affectedin Friday's BBC Question Time leaders' special. The prime minister said: ""I do sympathise deeply with the Waspi women... but it is very expensive to come up with the solution you want."" ""I cannot promise I can magic up that money for you,"" he added. What is the row about women's pensions?

"Supporters of a pro-democracy candidate celebrate as results in the district election were announced Hong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, early results show. According to local media counts, 17 of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled over the unrest, it went ahead peacefully. The election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests and clashes. The government and Beijing had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"", but that did not materialise. Instead some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost council seats. One controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, who lost his seat, Junius Ho, said ""heaven and earth have been turned upside down"". Protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run and how much control does China have? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections don't normally generate such interest. But these polls were the first time people could express at the ballot box their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now withdrawn extradition law. Also, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate eventually to a bigger share, and say, in who becomes the city's next leader. The vote was seen as a referendum on Chief Executive Carrie Lam A record 4.1 million people had registered to vote - more than half the population - and more than 2.9m people cast votes. That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police. Over the past months,demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating. Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter. It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists. But in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, in Hong Kong Outside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened and they poured into the public viewing area. Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent. As they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones. By their facial expressions it was clear they couldn't believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another. Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protestors following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies. More than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts. Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election. In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho - one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians - suffered a shock defeat. He was stabbed earlier this monthby a man pretending to be a supporter. The lawmaker has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions. He was in July filmed shaking hands with a group of men - suspected of being triad gangsters - who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters. As results were announced, pro-democracy supporters were in high spirits in Tuen Mun district Jimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front - a campaign group responsible for organising some of the mass protest marches - won a seat after running for the first time. Mr Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood. After the vote, Mr Sham said ""we have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions"". This video can not be played Joshua Wong says Beijing can't keep him down Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as ""political screening"", but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won. In a tweet, Mr Wong said the ""historic"" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement. Allow Twitter content?

Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms Lam's administration was partly to blame. ""In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,"" she said. Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat. ""I think [Lee] is the only one who can survive the de facto referendum,"" said Leung Kwok-hung, her pro-democracy opponent in the poll.

"This video can not be played Several arrests have been made and officers remain at the scene after the fight (Courtesy Rachael Allison) A fight involving people armed with machetes broke out at a cinema in what one witness described as ""one of the scariest moments of her life"". A number of police officers were assaulted as they attempted to clear about 100 people from the Star City complex in Birmingham. They were responding to reports a group with machetes had arrived at the multiplex. Several arrests for assaulting officers and failing to disperse were made. The injured officers sustained only minor injuries, West Midlands Police said. One witness described it as ""one of the scariest moments of [her] life"", as she queued to watch the new Frozen film with her daughter. Choleigh McGuire said: ""Armed police come, Tasers come, all of the people that were fighting ran off into the cinema, hiding. I am shaking."" Officers were called to the scene at about 17:35 on Saturday after reports of people carrying machetes One witness said ""a young boy was crying on the floor with his mother"" as a number of people started fighting. ""The police told everyone to leave the cinema as they held Taser guns in their hands and started to bring in guard dogs,"" said Rachael Allison. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area - near the M6 - due to a build-up of traffic. A dispersal order has been put in place giving police the power to move on groups of people and arrest those who fail to leave.

"The victim was found injured in a car outside West Ealing station on Drayton Green Road A man has died after being found fatally stabbed in a car outside a railway station in west London. Murder detectives believe the 26-year-old victim was injured in a fight near to West Ealing railway station and was then involved in a car crash on Drayton Green Road shortly before 01:20 GMT. Police have also quashed rumours the man was killed in a ""road rage"" attack. So far there have been no arrests as detectives continue to investigate the man's murder. The victim's family is aware and a post-mortem examination will be held later. Det Insp Neil John said: ""We believe the victim was involved in an altercation 100m from the railway station on The Avenue. ""This is a busy street with a number of shops and restaurants and if anybody was in the area and saw something, no matter how small, I would urge them to contact police."" West Ealing train station was closed for most of Sunday and only reopened at 13:45 GMT Ruth Holmstock, 72, whose flat overlooks the scene of the crash, said she heard a single ""thump"" in the early hours. She described it as ""the sort of noise you make when you reverse into a gate, but it was loud enough to make me go and see what it was."" ""There were a lot of people hanging around. It looked like any other crash, like they were swapping insurance details,"" she added. Kiran Ramachandraiah, who lives in the same block of flats, said he woke up at about 02:00 to see paramedics trying to revive the victim. ""I couldn't see the person,"" he said. ""He was completely surrounded by police and paramedics."" The attack followsa fatal stabbing in Whitechapel on Saturday, in which another man in his 20s was killed.

"Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann said she came off social media for several weeks after ""sexist and homophobic"" online comments A police officer said ""sexist and homophobic"" abuse sparked by her hairstyle led her to leave social media. Deputy chief constable Rachel Swann made several media appearances while leading the evacuation of Whaley Bridge in August. Some viewers mocked her on Twitter. Ms Swann said the reaction reflected wider problems with social media and she was shocked her ""mere existence could cause such a depth of feeling"". About 1,500 people were evacuated from Whaley Bridge when a dam wall at the nearby Toddbrook Reservoir was damaged in August. Ms Swann, the senior officer in the operation, noticed comments about her on social media after she appeared before cameras at a press conference. ""Yes, I am a woman. Yes, I might have a slightly different hairstyle. Yes, I am quite small,"" she said. ""The bit that astounded me was I could not believe that my mere existence could cause such a depth of feeling."" Toddbrook Reservoir was at risk of flooding Whaley Bridge when part of the dam collapsed She told BBC Radio Derby: ""I can take a bit of banter but then it became sexist and homophobic, and really, really insulting. ""The bit that really hurt was when people said I had no standards and I was letting policing down."" Some criticised her standard issue police uniform. ""They were saying, 'she's not wearing a hat'. Often we would get advised not to wear hats - you can see our eyes, so you can gain trust."" One comment said: ""Is that what a senior police officer looks likely [sic] these days??"" But others - including the leader of Derbyshire County Council, Barry Lewis - jumped to her defence, saying ""Be under no doubt, she saved a valley....that's what's important"". Ms Swann said it reached its nadir when a press agency ""wanted to run a story on my hair"" and so she took a break from Twitter. She said: ""My personal experience of the trolling and negative comments on social media are reflective of those that some people receive every day. ""Some of the comments were misogynistic and homophobic and the abuse I received has been recorded as a hate incident, in the same way it would be for the public or my officers and staff. ""In recent years, we have seen children feeling bullied by their peers through personal attacks on social media; with youngsters in some cases so desperate it has resulted in suicide due to the pressures of the abuse."" Messages on social media became ""sexist and homophobic"", Ms Swann said While believing more can be done by police on the issue, Ms Swann hoped her appearance in the national media showed the growing diversity in the police force - and she has returned to Twitter. ""In a funny sort of way I made my stand without meaning to. If some good comes out of that that's fine, it doesn't mean that it didn't hurt, it doesn't mean that it didn't upset me,"" she said.

"Ruja Ignatova called herself the Cryptoqueen. She told people she had invented a cryptocurrency to rival Bitcoin, and persuaded them to invest billions. Then, two years ago, she disappeared. Jamie Bartlett spent months investigating how she did it forthe Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, and trying to figure out where she's hiding. In early June 2016 a 36-year-old businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. She was dressed, as usual, in an expensive ballgown, wearing long diamond earrings and bright red lipstick. She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency ""for everyone to make payments everywhere"". Dr Ruja speaking at the Wembley Arena Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the biggest and best-known - its rise in value from a few cents to hundreds of dollars per coin by mid-2016 had given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors. Cryptocurrency as an idea was just entering the mainstream. Lots of people were looking to get involved in this strange new opportunity. OneCoin, Dr Ruja told the Wembley audience, was the ""Bitcoin Killer"". ""In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more!"" she shouted. All over the world, people were already investing their savings into OneCoin, hoping to be part of this new revolution. Documents leaked to the BBC show that British people spent almost â¬30m on OneCoin in the first six months of 2016, â¬2m of it in a single week - and the rate of investment could have increased after the Wembley extravaganza. Between August 2014 and March 2017 more than â¬4bn was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemenâ¦ even Palestine. But there was something very important these investors didn't know. To explain this, I need first to explain briefly how a cryptocurrency actually works. This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy. The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent. (I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune. Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about Â£250,000. ""I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?'"" he recalls. ""And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.' ""I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.'"" The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. ""So we need you to build a blockchain,"" he went on. ""What's the name of the company?"" asked Bjercke. ""It's OneCoin."" He didn't take the job. One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar. Jen McAdam on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were ""very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion"", she remembers. ""You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now,"" she was told. ""You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger."" The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. ""That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her."" The video of Dr Ruja at the Economist conference was what clinched it for Jen McAdam By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest â¬1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe â¬1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost â¬140, but they went all the way up to â¬118,000. One week later McAdam bought a ""tycoon"" package, for â¬5,000. Before long, she had invested â¬10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest â¬250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed Â£100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction. The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - ""the biggest scam in the [expletive] world"". He said he could prove it, too. ""Well then prove it to me!"" she replied, sharply. This video can not be played Jen McAdam has a fiery Skype call with cryptocurrency enthusiast Tim Curry Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain. It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017. ""OK Jenâ¦ they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database."" But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will. ""I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,'"" she says. The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away. Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop starBebe Rexha performed a private set,external. The Davina - and Jamie Bartlett Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned. This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. ""She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there,"" recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution. In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja. Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. ""When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined,"" he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket. Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala outside their house They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan ""What dreams may come"". A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside. Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made â¬100m over the last 30 years. Here is how multi-level marketing works. I pay Â£100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) This video can not be played 'Hun, this could be your opportunity to get rich' MLM is not illegal. Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme. In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her ""princess's dresses"" and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. ""We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy,"" he says. ""We made in our first month almost â¬90,000 out of nothing. Bang!"" Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as ""the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM"". This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its ""product"". No wonder it spread like wildfire. Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than â¬1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. ""No other company even came close,"" Alberts says. Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than â¬2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buymoreOneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. ""I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet,"" Igor says. ""I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to â¬100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that."" Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them  - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too. After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit. I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process. ""I felt responsibility. Not guilt,"" he replies. ""You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchainâ¦ What doubt can I have?"" He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else. By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was â¬3,000 - â¬1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away. It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say â¬4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as â¬15bn. There's a famous saying in journalism, ""Follow the money."" So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. ""They still exist"", he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. ""You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible."" A page on the OneCoin website It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s. Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as ""improbably standard"". For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. ""British companies are the companies of choice,"" he comments. ""They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate."" He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. ""We are very proud of this in this country,"" he says. ""The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided."" He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. ""This is classic,"" he exclaims. ""Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all."" Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with ""significant control"" - the real owner. ""This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind,"" he says, as he scrolls down the page. ""Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegalâ¦ That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu."" So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, with Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt, on BBC Sounds When you're dealing with a scam worth billions of euros, it's not unusual for shadowy groups to get involved. Several of the people Georgia and I interviewed spoke darkly about mysterious people and connections they didn't want to name. ""When you talk about the amount of money that's been put into OneCoin of course there's people out there who are pissed off and would do anything to shut anyone like me up,"" says Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain expert who discovered there was no blockchain, and started talking about it publicly. He tells me he's received death threats as a result of speaking out. ""If I knew what I would have to go through, I would have never blown the whistle. I would have just turned my back and walked away,"" he says. Bjorn Bjercke on Norwegian television When I ask him who might be behind the threats, he won't elaborate. ""I can't discuss that. It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast."" According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her. ""Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it,"" Bjercke says. ""I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip."" Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of ""very influential people"". When I ask for more details, he replies: ""No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives."" Konstantin Ignatov It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and ""significant players in Eastern European organised crime"". On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested, and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace. OneCoin headquarters in Sofia, Bulgaria Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the ""visionary"" Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive. But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin ""family"". She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own ""leader"" who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. ""You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world',"" she recalls. ""That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!'"" Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. ""If you have any negativity you should not be in this group,"" she was told. Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. ""When prophecy fails they believe more strongly,"" she says. ""Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.'"" Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. ""And in that sense it's cultic."" In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. ""We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin,"" it said. ""We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers."" Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment. ""There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official,"" said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. ""If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over."" Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment. The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. ""The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction,"" it said. ""We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors."" Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. ""I'm devastated for all the UK victims,"" Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. ""Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care!"" The City of London Police told the BBC: ""There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online."" Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency. Allow Twitter content?

In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package. He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them. ""There was no other way,"" he says ruefully. Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin. In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam. Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket. Daniel, Prudence and Jamie with children in the poor area of Kampala where Prudence works as a nurse People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences. ""Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced."" If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth. ""I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money."" But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says. One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. ""One Life!"" he shouts. ""One Coin!"" the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services. As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market. The family had saved about Â£3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research. Daniel and his mother She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost. ""I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope,"" he tells me. ""I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work."" I ask him why not. ""It's hard. It's hard to say."" Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? I look at Daniel. ""Maybe you can tell herâ¦ Maybeâ¦"" he says. He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money. Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. ""If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful,"" she says. ""You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard."" When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next? There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility. This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on. ""What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all,"" he says. ""Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family."" Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia. ""In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean,"" he says. Dr Ruja was renowned for expensive dresses and red lipstick A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest. Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot. From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything. Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us. We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken. We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. Dr Ruja posted a video of herself with her baby on social media Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk. Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. ""You will find her,"" he said. ""You must dig deeper."" She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us. On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were ""haters"" who could not be believed. She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a ""big passport"", he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens. OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency."" It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast ""will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased"". It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established.""

OneCoin was a familiar scam with a digital twist - a new and hugely successful take on the old pyramid scheme. But to me it symbolises something else too. It represents the dark side of rapid technological change - the way that every new technology creates amazing new opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don't. Dr Ruja comes on stage at Wembley to the song This Girl Is On Fire Dr Ruja identified several of society's weak spots and exploited them. She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening. And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money.

"Ruja Ignatova called herself the Cryptoqueen. She told people she had invented a cryptocurrency to rival Bitcoin, and persuaded them to invest billions. Then, two years ago, she disappeared. Jamie Bartlett spent months investigating how she did it forthe Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, and trying to figure out where she's hiding. In early June 2016 a 36-year-old businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. She was dressed, as usual, in an expensive ballgown, wearing long diamond earrings and bright red lipstick. She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency ""for everyone to make payments everywhere"". Dr Ruja speaking at the Wembley Arena Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the biggest and best-known - its rise in value from a few cents to hundreds of dollars per coin by mid-2016 had given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors. Cryptocurrency as an idea was just entering the mainstream. Lots of people were looking to get involved in this strange new opportunity. OneCoin, Dr Ruja told the Wembley audience, was the ""Bitcoin Killer"". ""In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more!"" she shouted. All over the world, people were already investing their savings into OneCoin, hoping to be part of this new revolution. Documents leaked to the BBC show that British people spent almost â¬30m on OneCoin in the first six months of 2016, â¬2m of it in a single week - and the rate of investment could have increased after the Wembley extravaganza. Between August 2014 and March 2017 more than â¬4bn was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemenâ¦ even Palestine. But there was something very important these investors didn't know. To explain this, I need first to explain briefly how a cryptocurrency actually works. This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy. The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent. (I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune. Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about Â£250,000. ""I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?'"" he recalls. ""And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.' ""I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.'"" The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. ""So we need you to build a blockchain,"" he went on. ""What's the name of the company?"" asked Bjercke. ""It's OneCoin."" He didn't take the job. One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar. Jen McAdam on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were ""very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion"", she remembers. ""You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now,"" she was told. ""You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger."" The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. ""That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her."" The video of Dr Ruja at the Economist conference was what clinched it for Jen McAdam By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest â¬1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe â¬1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost â¬140, but they went all the way up to â¬118,000. One week later McAdam bought a ""tycoon"" package, for â¬5,000. Before long, she had invested â¬10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest â¬250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed Â£100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction. The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - ""the biggest scam in the [expletive] world"". He said he could prove it, too. ""Well then prove it to me!"" she replied, sharply. This video can not be played Jen McAdam has a fiery Skype call with cryptocurrency enthusiast Tim Curry Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain. It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017. ""OK Jenâ¦ they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database."" But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will. ""I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,'"" she says. The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away. Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop starBebe Rexha performed a private set,external. The Davina - and Jamie Bartlett Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned. This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. ""She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there,"" recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution. In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja. Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. ""When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined,"" he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket. Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala outside their house They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan ""What dreams may come"". A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside. Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made â¬100m over the last 30 years. Here is how multi-level marketing works. I pay Â£100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) This video can not be played 'Hun, this could be your opportunity to get rich' MLM is not illegal. Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme. In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her ""princess's dresses"" and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. ""We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy,"" he says. ""We made in our first month almost â¬90,000 out of nothing. Bang!"" Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as ""the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM"". This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its ""product"". No wonder it spread like wildfire. Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than â¬1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. ""No other company even came close,"" Alberts says. Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than â¬2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buymoreOneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. ""I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet,"" Igor says. ""I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to â¬100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that."" Andreea Cimbala and Igor Alberts The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them  - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too. After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit. I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process. ""I felt responsibility. Not guilt,"" he replies. ""You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchainâ¦ What doubt can I have?"" He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else. By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was â¬3,000 - â¬1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away. It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say â¬4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as â¬15bn. There's a famous saying in journalism, ""Follow the money."" So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. ""They still exist"", he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. ""You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible."" A page on the OneCoin website It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s. Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as ""improbably standard"". For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. ""British companies are the companies of choice,"" he comments. ""They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate."" He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. ""We are very proud of this in this country,"" he says. ""The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided."" He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. ""This is classic,"" he exclaims. ""Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all."" Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with ""significant control"" - the real owner. ""This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind,"" he says, as he scrolls down the page. ""Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegalâ¦ That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu."" So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, with Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt, on BBC Sounds When you're dealing with a scam worth billions of euros, it's not unusual for shadowy groups to get involved. Several of the people Georgia and I interviewed spoke darkly about mysterious people and connections they didn't want to name. ""When you talk about the amount of money that's been put into OneCoin of course there's people out there who are pissed off and would do anything to shut anyone like me up,"" says Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain expert who discovered there was no blockchain, and started talking about it publicly. He tells me he's received death threats as a result of speaking out. ""If I knew what I would have to go through, I would have never blown the whistle. I would have just turned my back and walked away,"" he says. Bjorn Bjercke on Norwegian television When I ask him who might be behind the threats, he won't elaborate. ""I can't discuss that. It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast."" According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her. ""Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it,"" Bjercke says. ""I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip."" Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of ""very influential people"". When I ask for more details, he replies: ""No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives."" Konstantin Ignatov It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and ""significant players in Eastern European organised crime"". On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested, and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace. OneCoin headquarters in Sofia, Bulgaria Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the ""visionary"" Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive. But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin ""family"". She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own ""leader"" who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. ""You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world',"" she recalls. ""That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!'"" Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. ""If you have any negativity you should not be in this group,"" she was told. Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. ""When prophecy fails they believe more strongly,"" she says. ""Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.'"" Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. ""And in that sense it's cultic."" In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. ""We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin,"" it said. ""We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers."" Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment. ""There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official,"" said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. ""If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over."" Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment. The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. ""The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction,"" it said. ""We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors."" Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. ""I'm devastated for all the UK victims,"" Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. ""Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care!"" The City of London Police told the BBC: ""There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online."" Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency. Allow Twitter content?

In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package. He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them. ""There was no other way,"" he says ruefully. Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin. In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam. Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket. Daniel, Prudence and Jamie with children in the poor area of Kampala where Prudence works as a nurse People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences. ""Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced."" If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth. ""I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money."" But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says. One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. ""One Life!"" he shouts. ""One Coin!"" the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services. As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market. The family had saved about Â£3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research. Daniel and his mother She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost. ""I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope,"" he tells me. ""I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work."" I ask him why not. ""It's hard. It's hard to say."" Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? I look at Daniel. ""Maybe you can tell herâ¦ Maybeâ¦"" he says. He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money. Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. ""If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful,"" she says. ""You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard."" When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next? There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility. This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on. ""What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all,"" he says. ""Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family."" Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia. ""In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean,"" he says. Dr Ruja was renowned for expensive dresses and red lipstick A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest. Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot. From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything. Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us. We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken. We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. Dr Ruja posted a video of herself with her baby on social media Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk. Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. ""You will find her,"" he said. ""You must dig deeper."" She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us. On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were ""haters"" who could not be believed. She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a ""big passport"", he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens. OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: ""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency."" It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast ""will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased"". It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: ""Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established.""

OneCoin was a familiar scam with a digital twist - a new and hugely successful take on the old pyramid scheme. But to me it symbolises something else too. It represents the dark side of rapid technological change - the way that every new technology creates amazing new opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don't. Dr Ruja comes on stage at Wembley to the song This Girl Is On Fire Dr Ruja identified several of society's weak spots and exploited them. She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening. And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money.

Sumatran rhinos have been hard hit by poaching and habitat loss, but the biggest threat facing the species today is the fragmented nature of their populations. Efforts to breed the species in Malaysia have so far failed. Five rhino species can be found today, two in Africa and three in Asia The Asian species include the Sumatran rhino,Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, which is the smallest living rhino species The animal is closely related to the woolly rhinoceros, which became extinct about 10,000 years ago No more than 100 Sumatran rhinos remain in the wild (some estimates put the number as low as 30), scattered on the islands of Sumatra, Indonesia Last male Sumatran rhino in Malaysia dies Sumatran rhino 'hanging on by a thread' LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.
