"This video can not be played Watch: Liz Truss quizzed on 'no handouts' cost of living policy Tory leadership contender Liz Truss has defended her plans to lower taxes, describing them as the best way to avoid a recession. She was speaking after she had told a paper she favoured lowering taxes over ""giving out handouts"" to help households hit by higher fuel bills. On a visit to Solihull, she said lowering taxes would help ease the cost of living crisis. Her rival Rishi Sunak wants to tackle inflation before cutting taxes. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss has pledged to scrap April's National Insurance rise, cancel a planned corporation tax rise and temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills. Asked by theFinancial Times,externalabout how she would help households faced with fuel bills due to rise again in October, she said: ""Of course I will look at what more can be done. ""But the way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts."" What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Questioned later about these comments, she said: ""What I will do from day one is reduce taxes, reverse the National Insurance rise and also have a temporary moratorium on the green energy levy so people are spending less of their money on fuel bills. ""But what I'm about as a Conservative is people keeping more of their own money, growing the economy so we avoid a recession and the best way to do that is lower taxes, but also unleashing investment into our economy."" Ms Truss also took aim at Mr Sunak's economic legacy as chancellor after theBank of England warned this week that the UK would fall into recessionas it raised interest rates by the highest amount in 27 years. She added: ""Under the plans at present, what we know is Britain is headed for a recession. ""That is not inevitable, but we need to avoid that by making sure our economy is competitive, that we're encouraging businesses to grow and that we are keeping taxes low."" Her rival Mr Sunak has said he would focus on getting a grip on inflation. Responding to Ms Truss's comments, the former chancellor said it is ""simply wrong to rule out further direct support at this time"". ""Her tax proposals are not going to help very significantly, people like pensioners or those on low incomes who are exactly the kind of families that are going to need help"", said Mr Sunak. He said he wants to ensure ""that the people who really need our help do get the support that they need to get through the winter"". Speaking at a leadership hustings in Eastbourne on Friday, he said theTories can ""kiss goodbye"" to winning the next electionif inflation is not brought under control quickly. He highlighted a warning by the Bank of England that inflation could become embedded. The Bank of England has warned inflation - currently 9.4% - could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to its 2% target in 2024. He said there would be ""no hope that we're going to win that next election"" amid continuing rising prices.

"Many disabled people report inconsistencies in the prices and policies for concessionary tickets There are huge inconsistencies in the availability and price of concessionary and companion tickets for people who need a personal assistant or carer to support them, many disabled people say. It comes after news a free national Arts Access Card for disabled people to use at theatres, concerts and festivals is being delayed by two years. Arts Council England (ACE), which is responsible for creating the card together with the BFI, told BBC Radio 4's Front Row that pilots will not be up and running until early 2024. Andrew Miller, until recently the government's first disability champion for arts and culture, championed the idea of the card after seeing howa similar scheme, Hynt,,externalworked in Wales. He told Front Row: ""One of the principle reasons for my advocating a national arts access scheme was the lack of any consistency in venues' approach to companion tickets and disabled access. ""As I've experienced, through a lifetime of event attendance as a wheelchair user, buying tickets for 40 years, it's the Wild West out there for disabled consumers. ""There's no consistency between how companion tickets are priced. Some make them half price and the disabled person goes full price, others you get a free companion and the disabled person pays a reduced rate."" The national Arts Access Card had been due to launch in March 2022, according to the government's previously-published National Disability Strategy. The High Court laterruled that strategy unlawful,externaldue to inadequate consultation with disabled people - the government has applied for permission to appeal - but the card is still being rolled out independently. During the course of the research, a number of theatres agreed their websites were confusing Therese Heath, an arts lover and university arts lecturer, agrees that policies and prices vary from venue to venue. She says it's not fair if a disabled person who needs a companion to attend, ends up paying more. ""It's discriminatory to expect someone to pay double to do something that a non-disabled person does not have to pay double for,"" she said. ""Sometimes events I've been to will say that there is a PA [personal assistant] scheme, but it can be very difficult to get hold of anyone. At one event I went to, the so-called access helpline was also their ticketing helpline so it was completely rammed and you couldn't get through to anybody."" Recently she wanted to buy tickets for a festival, but said she was surprised to find there was no information at all. ""They didn't have a shred of access information on their website,"" she recalled. ""I was looking for whether they offered PA tickets. I was looking for information as to whether I could get my wheelchair onto the site, whether there were disabled toilets. And unfortunately at that point there was absolutely nothing on their website whatsoever."" The Equality Act applies to any business that provides goods, facilities or services to members of the public including theatres, cinemas, music venues, comedy clubs and festivals. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)has published guidance,externalon responsibilities that entertainment venues have towards their customers, ""Reasonable adjustments are not just about changes to physical features or the addition of auxiliary aids such as a hearing loop, although these can be important to some disabled people,"" it says. ""Consider providing information (such as programmes and publicity material) in alternative formats and offering an additional ticket for free to a disabled person who needs to bring an assistant."" Andrew Miller described the market as a ""Wild West for disabled consumers"" But research by Front Row revealed that doesn't always happen. Stephanie Sirr CEO of the Nottingham Playhouse and co-president of UK Theatre  confirmed the ""big 12"" subsidised theatres all offer free companion tickets, as do many other UK Theatre members. Hackney Empire and Belgrade Coventry offer disabled concessions plus a free carer ticket for those who need one. The Tron in Glasgow no longer does concessions, instead offering three price options to choose from. No-one has to prove eligibility for any concession. A companion ticket is free. But the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton confirmed they charge half price for a companion ticket. During the course of the research, a number of theatres agreed their websites were confusing. The Bristol Old Vic has now updated its site making clear free companion tickets are not only available for people with ""restricted mobility"", but also those who are hearing or visually impaired or neuro-divergent. The Mercury in Colchester, the Birmingham Rep and the Leeds Playhouse all said if people join their free access schemes to book tickets it overrides links which wrongly appear to charge for companion seats.  The Mercury added that barriers to the arts aren't always to do with price, and not everyone wants the free seat. The Birmingham Rep said being on the access list means they can be sure customers get the right seat for them, for example the end of a row, near the loos, or the best position to read the subtitled captions. The Leeds Playhouse said they are currently updating their website but that disabled people can book tickets online, in person or over the phone. All venues stress they work hard to make sure the companion seats are protected for those who really need them, and say abuse won't be tolerated. Some require proof of eligibility, like the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne, where recipients must be in receipt of disability benefits PIP, DLA, or Attendance Allowance, or a Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI ). As well as the Hynt card in Wales, Nimbus Disability (previously known as CredAbility) operate the Access Card, which is already accepted by companies including Ticketmaster, Merlin theme parks, the O2 Academies, SSE arenas, Delfont Mackintosh and Ambassador Group Theatres (ATG). Nimbus Disability operate the Access Card, which is accepted by many events companies (mock-up pictured) Trained experts have assessed 60,000 members so far, deciding what reasonable adjustments an individual needs. It is noted on the card and then universally accepted. From this week, ATG is rolling out online booking for all access tickets. Its access and safeguarding lead, Cate Gordon, says all 37 venues will be included. ""By registering with Nimbus's Access Card, customers will be able to log on to our website and book their own accessible seats, and also an essential companion ticket if requiredâ¦ at the time of day that you want to, just in the same way that any non-disabled person could,"" she said. Miller, who is now a trustee at Bafta and the Royal Shakespeare Company, is confident the government-backed national Arts Access Card will happen eventually. ""It could be well be that it builds on what Hynt has established in Wales, what CredAbility Nimbus have done, and also what the UK cinema card (CEA) does. But the essential element for me is that the card is made free to disabled users. That for me is a red line. ""When this scheme gets rolled out, it will transform the lives of disabled audiences, making the arts and the venue sector far more accessible and radically change the access approach to all the venues who sign up to it.""

"Flowers were laid outside Liquid Leisure Windsor on Sunday morning An 11-year-old girl has died after going missing at a water sports and activity park. Police were called to the lake at Liquid Leisure Windsor in Datchet, Berkshire, about 15.55 BST on Saturday after the child got into difficulty. She was found more than an hour later by emergency services and was rushed to hospital, but later died. Members of the public who went into the water to look for her have been praised for their bravery. Thames Valley Police said her death is being treated as unexplained and an investigation has been launched. The water park, in Datchet, Berkshire, has an obstacle course Supt Michael Greenwood said: ""This has been an extremely traumatic and upsetting incident for all involved."" Several members of the public got into the lake shortly after she got into difficulty ""but were unable to locate her"", he said. ""I would like to commend them for their courage and bravery,"" he added. People leaving flowers outside Liquid Leisure on Sunday afternoon A mother-of-two, who did not want to be named, was at the water park when the girl went missing. She said lifeguards and friends of the girl's family ran along the lake shouting her name at about 15:45. ""I later learnt that they were hoping she'd somehow managed to make it back to the shoreline and was in shock or passed out,"" the woman said. ""They were asking all of us to shout her name, describing her as shoulder height on an adult, with shoulder-length brown hair."" She said between 30 and 40 people - lifeguards and other swimmers - jumped into the water to look for the girl before emergency services arrived. ""As the situation unfolded, with every minute that passed by you could see the rising panic amongst the onlookers,"" the woman added. The Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service and South Central Ambulance Service joined police officers at the site. The National Police Air Service was also involved in the search, although it is not clear exactly where the girl was found. The girl's family have been informed and they are being supported by officers. The water park is closed on Sunday following the girl's death Supt Greenwood, the local policing area commander for Windsor and Maidenhead, offered his ""sincere condolences"" and requested that the privacy of the girl's family be ""respected"". He said: ""We are in the early stages of investigating this incident to understand the full circumstances."" Liquid Leisure Windsor describes itself as home to ""Europe's largest aqua park"", with a floating obstacle course on the lake. It also has outdoor activities including wakeboarding, open water swimming and boat rides. In a statement on its Facebook page, the company said it would be closed on Sunday. It said its thoughts were with all those affected ""by this desperately tragic and upsetting incident"". Liquid Leisure Windsor added it would not be right to comment further while police are in the early stages of an investigation, but it would ""continue to fully support and assist them throughout the process"".

"This video can not be played Watch: 'Incredible' Moraa wins gold in women's 800m final for Kenya 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Kenya's Mary Moraa gatecrashed Keely Hodgkinson and Laura Muir's Anglo-Scottish duel to take 800m gold at the Commonwealth Games. The 22-year-old world bronze medallist showed devastating speed down the home straight to outlast Hodgkinson, winning in one minute 57.07 seconds. Scotland's Muir took bronze by one hundredth of a second ahead of Jamaica's Natoya Goule. Muir will have another shot at glory in Sunday's 1500m final. Hodgkinson however said she was ""fuming"" to have missed her chance to claim a first international title in front of a home crowd. ""I am not quite sure what happened, it went so quick,"" the world and Olympic silver medallist told BBC Sport. ""The first lap I went a bit hard, maybe I could have been a bit more patient. ""There are positives but I want gold so I am fuming. I wanted to stand on top of that podium in front of my home crowd. ""Unfortunately I came away with a silver, again. But I have got one more chance."" Hodgkinson, like Muir, is part of a large British team travelling to Munich for the European Championships next week. Hodgkinson was first to congratulate Muir after the latter endured a nervous wait to find out she had pipped Jamaica's Goule to bronze They, like the winner, will doubtless review this action-packed race before they arrive in Germany. Moraa initially appeared to have misjudged her pace, cantering clear of the pack in the opening 300 metres, before slowing around the bell. But there was still plenty of sting left in her legs and, as Hodgkinson and Muir attempted to crank up the pressure 200 metres from home, Moraa tracked them and found a gear beyond either. As Hodgkinson and Muir flopped to the track after the line, Moraa gleefully broke out a celebratory jig for the television cameras. Other than American Olympic and world champion Athing Mu, Moraa is the only athlete to have beaten Hodgkinson over 800m this year. She triumphed in Stockholm in June with a similarly ferocious kick from home and the former 400m specialist, who only changed up to two laps last year, looks set to make Mu and Hodgkinson's rivalry into a three-hander drama. ""Oh my goodness, these girls are fast,"" Muir told BBC Sport after finishing in 1:57.87, 0.47 seconds behind Hodgkinson. ""I was in fourth with 100 metres to go and I was just like 'no way'. ""Kids, that's why if your coach says run all the way to the line, you run all the way to the line."" Chalmers has won the British title in each of the past three years Three-time British champion Alastair Chalmers claimed Guernsey's first Commonwealth medal ever outside shooting and lawn bowls with a superb bronze in the 400m hurdles. The 22-year-old, running in lane two, followed home British Virgin Islands' Kyron McMaster, who successfully defended his title, and Jamaica's Jaheel Hyde in 49.97 seconds. ""You are absolutely amazing, all of you,"" Chalmers told the crowd after they had roared him home over the final 100 metres. Uganda's Jacob Kiplimo surged past Kenyan rivals Nicholas Kimeli and Jacob Krop to seize 5,000m gold and complete a distance double following his 10,000m triumph four days before. England's Marc Scott finished fourth in a season's best 13:19.84, but was more than 10 seconds off the leading trio. In the first track final of the evening, Jamaica's Janieve Russell kept her composure to defend her 400m hurdles title as compatriot Rushell Clayton went out fast and faded even faster.

"""Sometimes you just need a hug from your mum,"" says Molly Leonard who has spent months apart from her family to be treated for anorexia A woman with anorexia said being treated for up to six months, while hundreds of miles from her family has been ""awful"". Molly Leonard, 24, from Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan, has spent time in units in London, Bristol and Glasgow. There is currently no specialist residential unit for people with eating disorders in Wales. The Welsh government said it was looking at the feasibility of an eating disorder unit in Wales. Molly estimates she has spent about a quarter of the past 10 years in specialist residential units. She said there were times when the only contact she could have with loved ones was through video calls and text messages. ""They ship you off miles away,"" she said. Molly lives at home with her parents in Rhoose ""You just need to be close to home, especially when you're in such a fragile state. ""You're just taken away to a place you may never have been, with people you don't know, and it is very scary."" She said being able to see loved ones affected her recovery: ""Sometimes you just need a hug from your mum and your mum to just tell you that everything will be okay and you just can't get that. ""It's ridiculous, because part of recovering is getting back to normality and part of that is being able to spend time with your family and friends."" Eating disorder charity Beat's National Lead for Wales Jo Whitfield said: ""There are no adult inpatient eating disorder services within Wales."" A Woman fears she may die without specialist treatment Eating disorder survivor finds menu calories triggering ""If somebody aged 18 or over needs to be hospitalised with an eating disorder, this will happen outside of the country."" She said having eating disorder treatment far away from home could be ""very distressing and isolating"". She added: ""Families are often unable to visit regularly, which can be very difficult for both the person who is unwell and their loved ones."" She said patients are less likely to need hospital treatment if they can access eating disorder treatment in their local area. ""If many people in Wales are needing hospital treatment for an eating disorder, this suggests they are not getting the support they need quickly enough,"" she said. Molly Leonard's most recent hospital stay was in March 2022 Molly, who is one of an estimated 58,000 people in Wales with an eating disorder, said she first began obsessing over calories and exercise when she was 15 years old. It coincided with her grandfather being unwell and having a tough time at school. ""It completely engulfs you, everything you do, everything you think is about food or how to lose weight, or about just shaming yourself for the way that you look,"" she said. She began not eating and lying when asked about it. But when she was 18 and moved away from home to study at Oxford Brookes University, she said that things got ""really bad"". When she was 19 she sought help from a GP for the first time and was immediately sent to A&E because her potassium levels were dangerously low. Within months she was sectioned and spent about six months at an eating disorder unit in Oxford. She said she was not ready to engage with treatment at that time but being hospitalised near where she lived was a help: ""I had my friends around me, which was really good"". It was to be her first hospital stay of many. Within a year of being discharged, she was sectioned again and was sent to an eating disorder unit in London. ""The eating disorder had full control of me and I wasn't at a point where I wanted to accept help for it. ""The only thing on my mind was I wanted to lose weight,"" she said. Her illness led her to quit university and move home to Wales, just before the Covid pandemic hit. Molly said she was sharing her story to try and help others She busied herself making facemasks, raising over Â£600 for eating disorder charity Beat. But it wasn't long before she started losing weight again. She briefly moved out of the family home to St Albans, Hertfordshire and ended up back in hospital - this time a general hospital in London. While there she said she was told she was being moved to Glasgow because it was the only bed available at an eating disorder unit in the UK. ""I honestly thought they were joking when they told me that but I was under section so I didn't have a choice,"" she said. Covid restrictions meant she could not have any visitors. While at the Glasgow unit she met other patients from Wales who were ""struggling just as much as I was"". Molly ran away from the hospital several times. She was told she was a Covid risk, so her father drove from south Wales to collect her and bring her home, she said. Since returning from Glasgow has been sectioned several times, initially spending six months at another specialist unit in London. Molly is one of an estimated 58,000 people in Wales with an eating disorder Last summer Molly hit rock bottom. She was sent to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""There's a week of my life that I have no recollection of. ""I honestly don't remember what happened. Apparently I was refusing treatment, I wasn't eating or drinking, I was refusing everything, pulling cannulas out,"" she said. She was sectioned and sent to the Hafan y Coed mental health unit at University Hospital Llandough, Vale of Glamorgan. This photo was taken after Molly came out of hospital in Bristol in April Her most recent residential treatment was a few months at an eating disorder unit in Bristol at the start of this year. ""I was honestly at the point of being put into palliative care because things had got so bad. ""It was honestly the lowest point,"" she said. ""My mum was telling me she was scared to wake up every morning, just in case she found me having not woken up."" Molly said since then she has turned a corner. She attributes the change to her love of crafting. She has always enjoyed crafts, everything from making candles or earrings to flower arranging - and while in hospital in Bristol, she began doing craft sessions for other patients. Molly said making crafts and teaching others is helping her get better Since returning home from hospital in April she has been running taster craft sessions at her local library and hopes to build it into a business, with the help of The Prince's Trust andBig Ideas Wales,external.

"John Swinney has announced an extra Â£140m of funding in a bid to end the council pay dispute The Scottish government has warned that allocating an extra Â£140m to settle a council pay dispute will mean sacrificing other spending plans. Deputy First MinisterJohn Swinney announced the new fundingon Friday after talks with local authorities. He said the government was keen to make sure council employees, who have been offered a 2% rise, get a fair salary. But with the budget fully allocated, he said very difficult decisions would have to be be made to find the money. Unions have said that until the extra funding translates into a formal, ""significantly improved"" offer, plans for strikes are still on. Staff at schools, nurseries and waste and recycling centres voted to strike afterrejecting the 2% pay offerin March. The deputy first minister told BBC Scotland there were ""massive pressures"" due to the cost of living crisis but he hoped progress could be made ""at the earliest opportunity"". Councils to get extra Â£140m towards workers' pay Bin collectors to strike during Edinburgh Festival Significantly improved pay offer needed, says union ""The Scottish government's budget is fully allocated and we will have to take very difficult decisions to provide Â£140m of new resources to local government to assist them in making an improved offer to council employees,"" he added. ""That will involve us making financial sacrifices. ""It involves us changing programmes and changing timetables for programmes, but we recognise that we've got to work with local authorities to put forward an improved settlement offer for council staff."" Leaders of the local authority body Cosla met on Friday to discuss the prospect of industrial action by members of the Unite, Unison and GMB unions. The strike action could result in rubbish piling up The council leaders decided they needed more information and said they would reconvene next week. Mr Swinney later said that the Scottish government would contribute Â£140m of recurring funding to help Cosla make a revised pay offer. GMB Scotland organiser Keir Greenaway accused government and council leaders of ""squabbling"" over where to find the money to settle the dispute. He said the current cost of living crisis meant workers were already struggling to pay bills and feed their families. ""Unless a significantly improved offer is found, then tens of thousands of local government workers will fall into working poverty and that will turn the cost of living crisis for them into a catastrophe,"" Mr Greenaway said. ""Whatever money has been found by the Scottish government, that hasn't found its way into a formal offer to our members yet. And until that happens, we'll still be looking at industrial action."" He added: ""It should lay heavy on the political leadership who have let this situation get to where it is. ""We've been waiting for a decent and improved offer since March. They have sat on their hands and done nothing. ""If industrial action takes place, it's on the Scottish government and council leaders.""

"This video can not be played Watch as Alex Jones is told his text messages were sent to opposing lawyers by mistake US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $49.3m (Â£41m) in damages after falsely claiming a 2012 school shooting was a hoax. A jury in Texas ruled the radio host must pay $45.2m in punitive damages, in addition to $4.1m in compensatory damages they awarded a day earlier. The two-week defamation trial was brought by the parents of a child killed in the attack. Twenty children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook in Connecticut. The lawsuit was filed by Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, the separated parents of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who died in the primary school shooting. The plaintiffs - who said they had endured harassment and emotional distress because of the Infowars founder's misinformation - had sought $150m. The compensatory damages issued on Thursday were meant to cover the actual costs to the family incurred by Jones' defamation, such as the private security they hired during the trial out of fear of an attack from a Jones supporter. LATEST FROM COURT:Five revealing moments from Alex Jones trial BACKGROUND:Sandy Hook: What happened that day LEGAL CASE:Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation The punitive damages are meant to act as a deterrent, and to stop Jones from repeating his offence. ""We ask that you send a very, very simple message and that is: Stop Alex Jones,"" a lawyer for the parents said in court on Friday. ""Stop the monetisation of misinformation and lies. Please."" Earlier on Friday, an economist hired by the parents testified that Jones, his media brand Infowars and parent company Free Speech Systems are worth up to $270m. Jesse Lewis, six, was killed at Sandy Hook Bernard Pettingill told the court that records indicate Jones withdrew $62m for himself from his company in 2021 as his legal troubles grew. ""That number represents, in my opinion, a value of a net worth,"" Mr Pettingill said. ""He's got money put in a bank account somewhere."" Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protections in the first week of the two-week trial. The trial heard that Jones' business had earned about $800,000 in a single day selling diet supplements, gun paraphernalia and survivalist equipment. Lawyers for the parents accused Jones of trying to hide evidence, and argued that he had committed perjury when he denied having sent any messages about the Sandy Hook attack. Earlier this week, an attorney for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones' legal representative had accidentally sent them two years of the radio host's telephone texts. The parents said Jones had made their lives ""hell"" He said that the congressional committee investigating last year's US Capitol riot had requested access to the messages as they look into Jones' alleged role. This is the first of three trials against Jones being brought by family members of Sandy Hook victims. He has already lost a series of defamation cases filed by parents of the victims by default after failing to produce documents and testimony. But this was the first trial in which financial damages were agreed by a jury. Jones appeared briefly in the court on Friday, but was not present for the final verdict. Despite retracting his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones has continued to use his media platform to argue the case was rigged against him and claimed that members of the jury pool ""don't know what planet they're on"". His Infowars website depicted the judge being consumed by flames. His behaviour triggered several rebukes from the judge, who at one point told him: ""This is not your show."" After the verdict on Friday, he posted a video where he claimed his net worth to be a fraction of what was said in court, and condemned the trial as ""beyond any kangaroo-rigged court ever"". Jones - a popular figure in US fringe conservative commentary - has repeatedly argued that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax orchestrated by the government to strip Americans of gun rights, and that the parents of the dead children were ""crisis actors"". His lawyer had cited US constitutional free speech protections and asked for leniency in the trial, saying the jury had already sent a message to all radio hosts ""that their standard of care has changed"".

"Monkeypox has caught the world by surprise. It has long been a fixture in parts of central and western Africa where people live close to the forest animals that carry the virus. But now it has gone global - it is spreading in ways that have not been seen before and on a scale that is unprecedented. There have been nearly 27,000 confirmed cases of the disease - mostly in men having sex with other men - across 88 countries. The World Health Organization says this is a global emergency. So can monkeypox be stopped? Or are we now doomed to have another virus spreading around the world? There are three things we need to consider: Is the virus particularly tricky to deal with? Do we have the ability to stop it? Is there the will to tackle a disease principally affecting gay and bisexual men? There's nothing special about the biology of monkeypox virus. It is not an unstoppable force. Covid probably was - it spreads so readily that it was arguably impossible to contain even in the earliest days of the pandemic. But monkeypox has a harder time getting from one person to the next. It needs close physical contact - such as through infected skin, prolonged face-to-face contact or contaminated surfaces like a bedsheet or a towel. The two viruses are simply in different leagues, and past monkeypox outbreaks have just fizzled out. And we have already overcome the far greater challenge of defeating the virus's deadly cousin, smallpox. ""Monkeypox is easier as it is less transmissible than smallpox so we're in a much better position,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. However, one issue is some people have mild symptoms or ones that can be easily mistaken for a sexually transmitted disease or chickenpox. That means it can be unwittingly passed on to others. Monkeypox: What are the symptoms? The virus has got into a group of people who are having enough sex or enough intimate contact with enough partners for it to overcome its own inadequacies and spread. The virus is not a classed as a sexually transmitted infection. But a studyin the New England Journal of Medicine,externalestimated 95% of monkeypox infections were being acquired through sex, particularly sex between men. Sex, obviously, is full of all the intimate skin-on-skin contact that the virus uses to spread. That leaves two options for containing the disease - persuading people to have less sex; or to reduce the risk of catching the infection when exposed. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""The easiest way to prevent it is to close down all highly active sexual networks for a couple of months until it goes away, but I don't think that will ever happen - do you?"" Some people do adjust their sex lives in response to warnings about monkeypox and advice has been targeted at those most at risk. But Prof Hunter argues the lesson of sexually transmitted infections - from syphilis in the Middle Ages through to now - is that people still have sex and ""vaccination is pretty much the only option"". Fortunately, the smallpox vaccine which was used to eradicate that virus is around 85% effective at preventing monkeypox. There are limited supplies as stockpiles are kept in case of someone weaponising smallpox, not to tackle an unprecedented monkeypox outbreak. However, not everyone at risk would need vaccinating to stop the outbreak. ""Herd immunity"" means that once a critical threshold of people are protected the virus can no longer spread. This will be much easier to achieve with monkeypox than other diseases - including Covid. While anybody can catch monkeypox, it is gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who are disproportionately affected in this outbreak. The virus can affect anyone, but the outbreak is predominantly in men having sex with men This can make it easier to control the virus as, overall, it is a group that is more clued into sexual health. It also allows resources to be targeted at those who need it - such as vaccinating men having sex with men rather than the whole population. However, stigma, discrimination and abuse can stop people seeking help, particularly in countries wheresex between men is illegal. ""Some countries don't have infrastructure in place and some may not have the will to test for monkeypox, because it's men who have sex with men,"" said Prof Francois Balloux, from University College London. There are still challenges in countries that support LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender - rights. Even policies such as asking people to isolate - which we're so familiar with from Covid - can have unintended consequences. ""That's tantamount to coming out - whether to a wife or parents [as you suddenly have to explain why] - so there is a strong pressure not to say who your contacts were,"" said Prof Hunter. Already some countries do appear to be getting on top of the virus. The UK says the number of infections appears to have levelled offat around 35-a-day,external. But cases continue to soar elsewhere, including the US whichhas declared an emergency. But it won't be enough for just rich countries to get on top of the virus when it's nowin more than 80 countries,externalthat don't have a long history of the disease. ""It's very unclear to me whether it will be controlled completely, some countries will get on top of it, some might not,"" said Prof Balloux. The WHO's technical lead for monkeypox, Dr Rosamund Lewis, says it is ""possible"" to end the outbreak but warns ""we don't have a crystal ball"" and it's not clear if the organisation will be able to ""support countries enough and communities enough to stop this outbreak."" The endemic countries in Africa - where monkeypox is always there - will continue to deal with the virus as it continually jumps from wild animals into people. Studies have shownthe problem is getting worse,externalsince the smallpox eradication programme ended, as few people under 50 will have been immunised. The only thing that would stop that is a mass vaccination campaign, ""but there's a big debate in Africa whether that is appropriate or necessary,"" says Prof Hunter. The worry is monkeypox could become a permanent presence in people around the globe rather than just in countries with infected animals. At the moment that is in men having sex with men, but the longer the outbreak goes on the more chances the virus has to establish itself more widely. There have been isolated cases in children and women, but these have not kickstarted their own outbreaks in classrooms or workplaces. However, the risks increase as the virus is given time to become better at infecting people. We have witnessed how Covid evolved and variants such as Omicron became so much better at infecting us. ""Unless the virus changes I personally doubt it will spread in children or more generally in people who don't have many sexual partners,"" said Prof Balloux. ""But the longer the wait, the higher the risk it might change,"" he said. The other issue is monkeypox has a knack for infecting a wide range of mammals including squirrels, rats, dormice and monkeys in Africa. There is a danger that the virus could get a foothold in other animals and start bouncing between species.The 2003 monkeypox outbreak in the US,external- which led to 47 cases across six states - was driven by pet prairie dogs. Tackling this outbreak of monkeypox is possible, but the longer we leave it the harder it gets and the greater the risk.

"""Sometimes you just need a hug from your mum,"" says Molly Leonard who has spent months apart from her family to be treated for anorexia A woman with anorexia said being treated for up to six months, while hundreds of miles from her family has been ""awful"". Molly Leonard, 24, from Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan, has spent time in units in London, Bristol and Glasgow. There is currently no specialist residential unit for people with eating disorders in Wales. The Welsh government said it was looking at the feasibility of an eating disorder unit in Wales. Molly estimates she has spent about a quarter of the past 10 years in specialist residential units. She said there were times when the only contact she could have with loved ones was through video calls and text messages. ""They ship you off miles away,"" she said. Molly lives at home with her parents in Rhoose ""You just need to be close to home, especially when you're in such a fragile state. ""You're just taken away to a place you may never have been, with people you don't know, and it is very scary."" She said being able to see loved ones affected her recovery: ""Sometimes you just need a hug from your mum and your mum to just tell you that everything will be okay and you just can't get that. ""It's ridiculous, because part of recovering is getting back to normality and part of that is being able to spend time with your family and friends."" Eating disorder charity Beat's National Lead for Wales Jo Whitfield said: ""There are no adult inpatient eating disorder services within Wales."" A Woman fears she may die without specialist treatment Eating disorder survivor finds menu calories triggering ""If somebody aged 18 or over needs to be hospitalised with an eating disorder, this will happen outside of the country."" She said having eating disorder treatment far away from home could be ""very distressing and isolating"". She added: ""Families are often unable to visit regularly, which can be very difficult for both the person who is unwell and their loved ones."" She said patients are less likely to need hospital treatment if they can access eating disorder treatment in their local area. ""If many people in Wales are needing hospital treatment for an eating disorder, this suggests they are not getting the support they need quickly enough,"" she said. Molly Leonard's most recent hospital stay was in March 2022 Molly, who is one of an estimated 58,000 people in Wales with an eating disorder, said she first began obsessing over calories and exercise when she was 15 years old. It coincided with her grandfather being unwell and having a tough time at school. ""It completely engulfs you, everything you do, everything you think is about food or how to lose weight, or about just shaming yourself for the way that you look,"" she said. She began not eating and lying when asked about it. But when she was 18 and moved away from home to study at Oxford Brookes University, she said that things got ""really bad"". When she was 19 she sought help from a GP for the first time and was immediately sent to A&E because her potassium levels were dangerously low. Within months she was sectioned and spent about six months at an eating disorder unit in Oxford. She said she was not ready to engage with treatment at that time but being hospitalised near where she lived was a help: ""I had my friends around me, which was really good"". It was to be her first hospital stay of many. Within a year of being discharged, she was sectioned again and was sent to an eating disorder unit in London. ""The eating disorder had full control of me and I wasn't at a point where I wanted to accept help for it. ""The only thing on my mind was I wanted to lose weight,"" she said. Her illness led her to quit university and move home to Wales, just before the Covid pandemic hit. Molly said she was sharing her story to try and help others She busied herself making facemasks, raising over Â£600 for eating disorder charity Beat. But it wasn't long before she started losing weight again. She briefly moved out of the family home to St Albans, Hertfordshire and ended up back in hospital - this time a general hospital in London. While there she said she was told she was being moved to Glasgow because it was the only bed available at an eating disorder unit in the UK. ""I honestly thought they were joking when they told me that but I was under section so I didn't have a choice,"" she said. Covid restrictions meant she could not have any visitors. While at the Glasgow unit she met other patients from Wales who were ""struggling just as much as I was"". Molly ran away from the hospital several times. She was told she was a Covid risk, so her father drove from south Wales to collect her and bring her home, she said. Since returning from Glasgow has been sectioned several times, initially spending six months at another specialist unit in London. Molly is one of an estimated 58,000 people in Wales with an eating disorder Last summer Molly hit rock bottom. She was sent to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""There's a week of my life that I have no recollection of. ""I honestly don't remember what happened. Apparently I was refusing treatment, I wasn't eating or drinking, I was refusing everything, pulling cannulas out,"" she said. She was sectioned and sent to the Hafan y Coed mental health unit at University Hospital Llandough, Vale of Glamorgan. This photo was taken after Molly came out of hospital in Bristol in April Her most recent residential treatment was a few months at an eating disorder unit in Bristol at the start of this year. ""I was honestly at the point of being put into palliative care because things had got so bad. ""It was honestly the lowest point,"" she said. ""My mum was telling me she was scared to wake up every morning, just in case she found me having not woken up."" Molly said since then she has turned a corner. She attributes the change to her love of crafting. She has always enjoyed crafts, everything from making candles or earrings to flower arranging - and while in hospital in Bristol, she began doing craft sessions for other patients. Molly said making crafts and teaching others is helping her get better Since returning home from hospital in April she has been running taster craft sessions at her local library and hopes to build it into a business, with the help of The Prince's Trust andBig Ideas Wales,external. ""I really think that, from my experience, I can help people to get over their mental health through craft because it's helped me so much. It's changed my life,"" she said. Molly is determined to get better. ""I've been struggling with this since I was 15 and next year I'll be 25. I just don't want the eating disorder to been ruling my life for 10 years, it's too long,"" she said. ""'I've got ambitions and I've got things that I want to be doing and that is stopping me."" Molly has been running taster craft sessions at her local library A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are increasing investment in eating disorders services.

"The Tories can ""kiss goodbye"" to winning the next election if inflation is not brought under control quickly, Rishi Sunak has said. Speaking at a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, the ex-chancellor, who wants to prioritise tackling rising prices before cutting taxes, seized on a warning by the Bank of England. Rival Liz Truss said keeping taxes low was the best way to avoid a downturn. She said the UK should not be ""talking itself into a recession"". The Bank of England has warned inflation - currently 9.4% - could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to its 2% target in 2024. Ms Truss, who has promised to reverse some of Mr Sunak's tax rises, challenged the Bank's gloomy economic prognosis, at the hustings. But Mr Sunakhighlighted its warning that inflation could become embedded,saying there would be ""no hope that we're going to win that next election"" amid continuing rising prices. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss are vying for support from Conservative party members to be elected the next party leader, and prime minister. Voting has started and the result is due to be announced on 5 September. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Pressure is on for next PM to tackle economy swiftly Sunak: I took money out of deprived urban areas There was a brief disturbance at the hustings when Ms Truss's opening remarks were interrupted by a small group of climate activists, who were believed to be from the Green New Deal Rising group. After the group was ejected from the event, Ms Truss took aim at what she called ""unfair protests"" that disrupted people's lives. She pledged to clamp down on ""militant people who try and disrupt our country"" - mentioning both trade unions and environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion. Another protester was later removed from the event after interrupting Ms Truss. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters interrupt Liz Truss speech by delivering speeches of their own. Ms Truss, who will be attending the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham on Saturday, is also due to set out her proposals for boosting economic growth and levelling up the UK. Her plans include reviewing the Treasury formula which determines which regional projects receive funding and creating ""low-tax and low-regulation zones"" across the country to create hubs for enterprise. Meanwhile,in an interview with the Financial Times,,externalMs Truss said people should be helped with the cost-of-living crisis by lower taxes, not giving ""handouts"". She told the paper she would ""look at what more can be done"" but in a ""Conservative way"". Paul Drechsler, chair of the International Chamber of Commerce UK, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the poorest in the UK are heading for a ""financial crisis of epic proportions"". ""I'd say to anyone who's running for role of prime minister, thinking about a policy or a tax change is just not going to be good enough in September when people are already being hit by these escalating energy costs,"" said Mr Drechsler, former president of the Confederation of British Industry. He added that ""anybody talking about taxation is not going to deliver a quick solution"" to those who were unable to afford food or heating bills. Liz Truss is competing with Rishi Sunak to become the next prime minister Elsewhere, Mr Sunak is vowing not to let ""political correctness"" stop him tackling ""horrific"" child grooming gangs if he becomes leader. In an interview with GB News, Mr Sunak said grooming gang members should face life sentences and that the police should record the ethnicity of those involved. Mr Sunak said that, as the father of two young girls, he believed there needed to be greater focus on tackling the crime. A reportpublished by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuseearlier this year recommended collecting ethnicity data of the victims and perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. It said: ""Poor or non-existent data collection makes it impossible to know whether any particular ethnic group is over-represented as perpetrators of child sexual exploitation by networks."" Mr Sunak told GB News ""a particular group of people"" were ""perpetuating"" child grooming and it was ""far more pervasive across the country than actually we all realise"". He added: ""And we all know the reason that people don't focus on it. It's because of political correctness and they're scared of calling out the fact."" Separately, Mr Sunak is focusing on his opposition to another referendum on Scottish independence, warning in a statement issued by his leadership campaign thatignoring the SNP would be ""dangerously complacent"". He said: ""We can't just bury our heads in the sand and pretend they aren't there - we need to stop them in their tracks."" His comment will be seen as a criticism of Ms Trusswho earlier this week, said:""I think the best thing to do with Nicola Sturgeon is ignore her. ""She's an attention seeker, that's what she is.""

"The Tories can ""kiss goodbye"" to winning the next election if inflation is not brought under control quickly, Rishi Sunak has said. Speaking at a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, the ex-chancellor, who wants to prioritise tackling rising prices before cutting taxes, seized on a warning by the Bank of England. Rival Liz Truss said keeping taxes low was the best way to avoid a downturn. She said the UK should not be ""talking itself into a recession"". The Bank of England has warned inflation - currently 9.4% - could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to its 2% target in 2024. Ms Truss, who has promised to reverse some of Mr Sunak's tax rises, challenged the Bank's gloomy economic prognosis, at the hustings. But Mr Sunakhighlighted its warning that inflation could become embedded,saying there would be ""no hope that we're going to win that next election"" amid continuing rising prices. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss are vying for support from Conservative party members to be elected the next party leader, and prime minister. Voting has started and the result is due to be announced on 5 September. What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Pressure is on for next PM to tackle economy swiftly Sunak: I took money out of deprived urban areas There was a brief disturbance at the hustings when Ms Truss's opening remarks were interrupted by a small group of climate activists, who were believed to be from the Green New Deal Rising group. After the group was ejected from the event, Ms Truss took aim at what she called ""unfair protests"" that disrupted people's lives. She pledged to clamp down on ""militant people who try and disrupt our country"" - mentioning both trade unions and environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion. Another protester was later removed from the event after interrupting Ms Truss. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters interrupt Liz Truss speech by delivering speeches of their own. Ms Truss, who will be attending the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham on Saturday, is also due to set out her proposals for boosting economic growth and levelling up the UK. Her plans include reviewing the Treasury formula which determines which regional projects receive funding and creating ""low-tax and low-regulation zones"" across the country to create hubs for enterprise. Meanwhile,in an interview with the Financial Times,,externalMs Truss said people should be helped with the cost-of-living crisis by lower taxes, not giving ""handouts"". She told the paper she would ""look at what more can be done"" but in a ""Conservative way"". Paul Drechsler, chair of the International Chamber of Commerce UK, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the poorest in the UK are heading for a ""financial crisis of epic proportions"". ""I'd say to anyone who's running for role of prime minister, thinking about a policy or a tax change is just not going to be good enough in September when people are already being hit by these escalating energy costs,"" said Mr Drechsler, former president of the Confederation of British Industry. He added that ""anybody talking about taxation is not going to deliver a quick solution"" to those who were unable to afford food or heating bills. Liz Truss is competing with Rishi Sunak to become the next prime minister Elsewhere, Mr Sunak is vowing not to let ""political correctness"" stop him tackling ""horrific"" child grooming gangs if he becomes leader. In an interview with GB News, Mr Sunak said grooming gang members should face life sentences and that the police should record the ethnicity of those involved. Mr Sunak said that, as the father of two young girls, he believed there needed to be greater focus on tackling the crime. A reportpublished by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuseearlier this year recommended collecting ethnicity data of the victims and perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. It said: ""Poor or non-existent data collection makes it impossible to know whether any particular ethnic group is over-represented as perpetrators of child sexual exploitation by networks."" Mr Sunak told GB News ""a particular group of people"" were ""perpetuating"" child grooming and it was ""far more pervasive across the country than actually we all realise"". He added: ""And we all know the reason that people don't focus on it. It's because of political correctness and they're scared of calling out the fact."" Separately, Mr Sunak is focusing on his opposition to another referendum on Scottish independence, warning in a statement issued by his leadership campaign thatignoring the SNP would be ""dangerously complacent"". He said: ""We can't just bury our heads in the sand and pretend they aren't there - we need to stop them in their tracks."" His comment will be seen as a criticism of Ms Trusswho earlier this week, said:""I think the best thing to do with Nicola Sturgeon is ignore her. ""She's an attention seeker, that's what she is.""

"Elizabeth Bird came through to take silver 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Elizabeth Bird clinched a thrilling 3,000m steeplechase silver as England won five athletics medals on day eight of the Commonwealth Games. In the night's final event, Bird overhauled shattered Ugandan Peruth Chemutai on the last bend and, urged on by the crowd, powered over the line. Nathan Maguire and Daniel Sidbury secured gold and silver in the men's T53/54 1500m title. Triple jumper Naomi Metzger and shot putter Scott Lincoln also won bronzes. Bird, 27, seemed to be competing for bronze but when Chemutai clattered into a hurdle she sensed her chance and started gaining ground. ""This crowd was amazing,"" said Bird. ""Those last two laps, when I was trying to close the gap, I was using their energy so thank you to everyone who came here. ""I wish I had started moving sooner because I was so close to the gold, but I will take a silver."" Kenya's Jackline Chepkoech claimed the gold in a new Commonwealth best of nine minutes 15.680 seconds, while England's Aimee Pratt finished fourth. Maguire joined his fiancee Hannah Cockroft in winning gold - she claimed the women's 100m T33/34 title on Wednesday - and then revealed what the occasion meant to him. ""The fact we are here on the same stage as the able-bodied guys is massive,"" he told BBC Sport. ""When I was growing up there was no representation or TV coverage of any Para-sport so the fact we are on primetime TV, showing the kids what they could be in the future, that's so important."" Metzger, 24, twice broke her personal best to secure a medal, leaping 14.32 with her first jump and then 14.39 with her third. ""It feels like I'm dreaming. It's basically been the perfect day,"" she said. ""I've jumped a few PBs and come away with a medal at my home Games. It has been fabulous."" Jamaica's Shanieka Ricketts set a new Commonwealth record of 14.94m to take the gold. Lincoln, a 29-year-old bricklayer, powered his fifth throw 20.57m to claim bronze in a shot put competition dominated by New Zealand's Tom Walsh. ""It's not quite sunk in yet but it's absolutely incredible to get the job done in the end,"" said Lincoln. ""It was a tricky first four throws, I was just getting a bit overexcited with the crowd noise. I've never had anything like that before, it was absolutely incredible."" Allow Twitter content?

Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule Commonwealth Games medal table BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times Hughes will go for 200m gold on Saturday England's Zharnel Hughes won his 200m semi-final in style to book his place in Saturday's final as the fastest qualifier, but Adam Gemili missed out. Hughes was roared around the bend by the home fans and was able to ease up before crossing the line in 20.32 seconds. He said: ""I was wondering where is everyone else? Because I thought they were pretty close to me. I executed a good race."" Hughes will go head to head with 2018 champion Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago, who won his semi-final in 20.40. Gemili started well but dropped back to fourth place, with his time of 20.97 not quick enough to qualify from a semi-final won by Nigerian Udodi Onwuzurike. It is the latest disappointment for Gemili, having been knocked out of the heats at the World Championships in Eugene last month. Then, he initiallyblamed the media spotlighton his controversial ex-coach Rana Reider for impacting his form and mindset. The 28-year-old, who has been based in Florida,split from Reider just days before the Games. ""I know there have been issues with me this year - it has affected me,"" said Gemili. ""Physically I'm OK, but there has been a lot which has affected my training and the mental side for me."" Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah cruised to victory in her 200m semi-final, timing 22.63 seconds despite powering down in the final 20m. Namibia's Christine Mboma, the Olympic silver medallist, and Nigerian teenager Favour Ofili won the other two semi-finals, while Scotland's Beth Dobbin booked her place in the final as a fastest loser. Local boy Matthew Hudson-Smith, who won world bronze last month, maintained his impressive form by winning his 400m semi-final. ""It was cold and a messy run but the job was to get through to the final and I have done that,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The first 50m was not that good, my legs were all over the place. I am still a bit tired from Eugene but the crowd lifted me and I can't complain."" England's Victoria Ohuruogu, who is coached by sister Christine, won  her 400m semi-final in 51.34 seconds. Team-mates Ama Pipi and Jodie Williams also qualified directly while Scotland's Zoey Clark went through as the fastest loser but Nicole Yeargin missed out. In the morning session, Scotland's Laura Muir finished fifth in her 1500m heat to reach Sunday's final. She ran four minutes 14.11 seconds as she paced herself carefully having also reached Saturday's 800m final. A Commonwealth Games medal is the only one missing from Muir's collection after she finished 11th in the 1500m - having been clipped - in 2014 and skipped the Gold Coast four years ago to focus on her veterinary exams. ""This is the last one. If I can get not just one but two it would be very special,"" she said. ""It's going to be hard. The Commonwealth in these distances is really strong, but it's an amazing opportunity to give it my best. I would hate to be sitting at home watching the final thinking I could be part of it."" Scotland team-mate Jemma Reekie also qualified along with England's Katie Snowden and Melissa Courtney-Bryant. England's Cindy Sember ran 12.67 seconds to win her 100m hurdles heat on her 28th birthday, while in the long jump team-mates Jazmin Sawyers (6.80m), Lorraine Ugen (6.79m) and Abigail Irozuru (6.59m) all reached the final.

"""Sometimes you just need a hug from your mum,"" says Molly Leonard who has spent months apart from her family to be treated for anorexia A woman with anorexia said being treated for up to six months, while hundreds of miles from her family has been ""awful"". Molly Leonard, 24, from Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan, has spent time in units in London, Bristol and Glasgow. There is currently no specialist residential unit for people with eating disorders in Wales. The Welsh government said it was looking at the feasibility of an eating disorder unit in Wales. Molly estimates she has spent about a quarter of the past 10 years in specialist residential units. She said there were times when the only contact she could have with loved ones was through video calls and text messages. ""They ship you off miles away,"" she said. Molly lives at home with her parents in Rhoose ""You just need to be close to home, especially when you're in such a fragile state. ""You're just taken away to a place you may never have been, with people you don't know, and it is very scary."" She said being able to see loved ones affected her recovery: ""Sometimes you just need a hug from your mum and your mum to just tell you that everything will be okay and you just can't get that. ""It's ridiculous, because part of recovering is getting back to normality and part of that is being able to spend time with your family and friends."" Eating disorder charity Beat's National Lead for Wales Jo Whitfield said: ""There are no adult inpatient eating disorder services within Wales."" A Woman fears she may die without specialist treatment Eating disorder survivor finds menu calories triggering ""If somebody aged 18 or over needs to be hospitalised with an eating disorder, this will happen outside of the country."" She said having eating disorder treatment far away from home could be ""very distressing and isolating"". She added: ""Families are often unable to visit regularly, which can be very difficult for both the person who is unwell and their loved ones."" She said patients are less likely to need hospital treatment if they can access eating disorder treatment in their local area. ""If many people in Wales are needing hospital treatment for an eating disorder, this suggests they are not getting the support they need quickly enough,"" she said. Molly Leonard's most recent hospital stay was in March 2022 Molly, who is one of an estimated 58,000 people in Wales with an eating disorder, said she first began obsessing over calories and exercise when she was 15 years old. It coincided with her grandfather being unwell and having a tough time at school. ""It completely engulfs you, everything you do, everything you think is about food or how to lose weight, or about just shaming yourself for the way that you look,"" she said. She began not eating and lying when asked about it. But when she was 18 and moved away from home to study at Oxford Brookes University, she said that things got ""really bad"". When she was 19 she sought help from a GP for the first time and was immediately sent to A&E because her potassium levels were dangerously low. Within months she was sectioned and spent about six months at an eating disorder unit in Oxford. She said she was not ready to engage with treatment at that time but being hospitalised near where she lived was a help: ""I had my friends around me, which was really good"". It was to be her first hospital stay of many. Within a year of being discharged, she was sectioned again and was sent to an eating disorder unit in London. ""The eating disorder had full control of me and I wasn't at a point where I wanted to accept help for it. ""The only thing on my mind was I wanted to lose weight,"" she said. Her illness led her to quit university and move home to Wales, just before the Covid pandemic hit. Molly said she was sharing her story to try and help others She busied herself making facemasks, raising over Â£600 for eating disorder charity Beat. But it wasn't long before she started losing weight again. She briefly moved out of the family home to St Albans, Hertfordshire and ended up back in hospital - this time a general hospital in London. While there she said she was told she was being moved to Glasgow because it was the only bed available at an eating disorder unit in the UK. ""I honestly thought they were joking when they told me that but I was under section so I didn't have a choice,"" she said. Covid restrictions meant she could not have any visitors. While at the Glasgow unit she met other patients from Wales who were ""struggling just as much as I was"". Molly ran away from the hospital several times. She was told she was a Covid risk, so her father drove from south Wales to collect her and bring her home, she said. Since returning from Glasgow has been sectioned several times, initially spending six months at another specialist unit in London. Molly is one of an estimated 58,000 people in Wales with an eating disorder Last summer Molly hit rock bottom. She was sent to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""There's a week of my life that I have no recollection of. ""I honestly don't remember what happened. Apparently I was refusing treatment, I wasn't eating or drinking, I was refusing everything, pulling cannulas out,"" she said. She was sectioned and sent to the Hafan y Coed mental health unit at University Hospital Llandough, Vale of Glamorgan. This photo was taken after Molly came out of hospital in Bristol in April Her most recent residential treatment was a few months at an eating disorder unit in Bristol at the start of this year. ""I was honestly at the point of being put into palliative care because things had got so bad. ""It was honestly the lowest point,"" she said. ""My mum was telling me she was scared to wake up every morning, just in case she found me having not woken up."" Molly said since then she has turned a corner. She attributes the change to her love of crafting. She has always enjoyed crafts, everything from making candles or earrings to flower arranging - and while in hospital in Bristol, she began doing craft sessions for other patients. Molly said making crafts and teaching others is helping her get better Since returning home from hospital in April she has been running taster craft sessions at her local library and hopes to build it into a business, with the help of The Prince's Trust andBig Ideas Wales,external. ""I really think that, from my experience, I can help people to get over their mental health through craft because it's helped me so much. It's changed my life,"" she said. Molly is determined to get better. ""I've been struggling with this since I was 15 and next year I'll be 25. I just don't want the eating disorder to been ruling my life for 10 years, it's too long,"" she said. ""'I've got ambitions and I've got things that I want to be doing and that is stopping me."" Molly has been running taster craft sessions at her local library A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are increasing investment in eating disorders services. ""Most people who need to access services, including in-patient care, will receive this care in Wales and we are also working with NHS Wales to scope the feasibility of a specialist eating disorder unit in Wales. ""We expect all health boards to provide specialist, multi-disciplinary support for people with eating disorders.""

"Elizabeth Bird came through to take silver 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Elizabeth Bird clinched a thrilling 3,000m steeplechase silver as England won five athletics medals on day eight of the Commonwealth Games. In the night's final event, Bird overhauled shattered Ugandan Peruth Chemutai on the last bend and, urged on by the crowd, powered over the line. Nathan Maguire and Daniel Sidbury secured gold and silver in the men's T53/54 1500m title. Triple jumper Naomi Metzger and shot putter Scott Lincoln also won bronzes. Bird, 27, seemed to be competing for bronze but when Chemutai clattered into a hurdle she sensed her chance and started gaining ground. ""This crowd was amazing,"" said Bird. ""Those last two laps, when I was trying to close the gap, I was using their energy so thank you to everyone who came here. ""I wish I had started moving sooner because I was so close to the gold, but I will take a silver."" Kenya's Jackline Chepkoech claimed the gold in a new Commonwealth best of nine minutes 15.680 seconds, while England's Aimee Pratt finished fourth. Maguire joined his fiancee Hannah Cockroft in winning gold - she claimed the women's 100m T33/34 title on Wednesday - and then revealed what the occasion meant to him. ""The fact we are here on the same stage as the able-bodied guys is massive,"" he told BBC Sport. ""When I was growing up there was no representation or TV coverage of any Para-sport so the fact we are on primetime TV, showing the kids what they could be in the future, that's so important."" Metzger, 24, twice broke her personal best to secure a medal, leaping 14.32 with her first jump and then 14.39 with her third. ""It feels like I'm dreaming. It's basically been the perfect day,"" she said. ""I've jumped a few PBs and come away with a medal at my home Games. It has been fabulous."" Jamaica's Shanieka Ricketts set a new Commonwealth record of 14.94m to take the gold. Lincoln, a 29-year-old bricklayer, powered his fifth throw 20.57m to claim bronze in a shot put competition dominated by New Zealand's Tom Walsh. ""It's not quite sunk in yet but it's absolutely incredible to get the job done in the end,"" said Lincoln. ""It was a tricky first four throws, I was just getting a bit overexcited with the crowd noise. I've never had anything like that before, it was absolutely incredible."" Allow Twitter content?

Commonwealth Games day-by-day guide & schedule Commonwealth Games medal table BBC TV, radio & digital coverage times Hughes will go for 200m gold on Saturday England's Zharnel Hughes won his 200m semi-final in style to book his place in Saturday's final as the fastest qualifier, but Adam Gemili missed out. Hughes was roared around the bend by the home fans and was able to ease up before crossing the line in 20.32 seconds. He said: ""I was wondering where is everyone else? Because I thought they were pretty close to me. I executed a good race."" Hughes will go head to head with 2018 champion Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago, who won his semi-final in 20.40. Gemili started well but dropped back to fourth place, with his time of 20.97 not quick enough to qualify from a semi-final won by Nigerian Udodi Onwuzurike. It is the latest disappointment for Gemili, having been knocked out of the heats at the World Championships in Eugene last month. Then, he initiallyblamed the media spotlighton his controversial ex-coach Rana Reider for impacting his form and mindset. The 28-year-old, who has been based in Florida,split from Reider just days before the Games. ""I know there have been issues with me this year - it has affected me,"" said Gemili. ""Physically I'm OK, but there has been a lot which has affected my training and the mental side for me."" Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah cruised to victory in her 200m semi-final, timing 22.63 seconds despite powering down in the final 20m. Namibia's Christine Mboma, the Olympic silver medallist, and Nigerian teenager Favour Ofili won the other two semi-finals, while Scotland's Beth Dobbin booked her place in the final as a fastest loser. Local boy Matthew Hudson-Smith, who won world bronze last month, maintained his impressive form by winning his 400m semi-final. ""It was cold and a messy run but the job was to get through to the final and I have done that,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The first 50m was not that good, my legs were all over the place. I am still a bit tired from Eugene but the crowd lifted me and I can't complain."" England's Victoria Ohuruogu, who is coached by sister Christine, won  her 400m semi-final in 51.34 seconds. Team-mates Ama Pipi and Jodie Williams also qualified directly while Scotland's Zoey Clark went through as the fastest loser but Nicole Yeargin missed out. In the morning session, Scotland's Laura Muir finished fifth in her 1500m heat to reach Sunday's final. She ran four minutes 14.11 seconds as she paced herself carefully having also reached Saturday's 800m final. A Commonwealth Games medal is the only one missing from Muir's collection after she finished 11th in the 1500m - having been clipped - in 2014 and skipped the Gold Coast four years ago to focus on her veterinary exams. ""This is the last one. If I can get not just one but two it would be very special,"" she said. ""It's going to be hard. The Commonwealth in these distances is really strong, but it's an amazing opportunity to give it my best. I would hate to be sitting at home watching the final thinking I could be part of it."" Scotland team-mate Jemma Reekie also qualified along with England's Katie Snowden and Melissa Courtney-Bryant. England's Cindy Sember ran 12.67 seconds to win her 100m hurdles heat on her 28th birthday, while in the long jump team-mates Jazmin Sawyers (6.80m), Lorraine Ugen (6.79m) and Abigail Irozuru (6.59m) all reached the final.

"This video can not be played Watch as Alex Jones is told his text messages were sent to opposing lawyers by mistake US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $49.3m (Â£41m) in damages after falsely claiming a 2012 school shooting was a hoax. A jury in Texas ruled the radio host must pay $45.2m in punitive damages, in addition to $4.1m in compensatory damages they awarded a day earlier. The two-week defamation trial was brought by the parents of a child killed in the attack. Twenty children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook in Connecticut. The lawsuit was filed by Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, the separated parents of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who died in the primary school shooting. The plaintiffs - who said they had endured harassment and emotional distress because of the Infowars founder's misinformation - had sought $150m. The compensatory damages issued on Thursday were meant to cover the actual costs to the family incurred by Jones' defamation, such as the private security they hired during the trial out of fear of an attack from a Jones supporter. LATEST FROM COURT:Five revealing moments from Alex Jones trial BACKGROUND:Sandy Hook: What happened that day LEGAL CASE:Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation The punitive damages are meant to act as a deterrent, and to stop Jones from repeating his offence. ""We ask that you send a very, very simple message and that is: Stop Alex Jones,"" a lawyer for the parents said in court on Friday. ""Stop the monetisation of misinformation and lies. Please."" Earlier on Friday, an economist hired by the parents testified that Jones, his media brand Infowars and parent company Free Speech Systems are worth up to $270m. Jesse Lewis, six, was killed at Sandy Hook Bernard Pettingill told the court that records indicate Jones withdrew $62m for himself from his company in 2021 as his legal troubles grew. ""That number represents, in my opinion, a value of a net worth,"" Mr Pettingill said. ""He's got money put in a bank account somewhere."" Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protections in the first week of the two-week trial. The trial heard that Jones' business had earned about $800,000 in a single day selling diet supplements, gun paraphernalia and survivalist equipment. Lawyers for the parents accused Jones of trying to hide evidence, and argued that he had committed perjury when he denied having sent any messages about the Sandy Hook attack. Earlier this week, an attorney for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones' legal representative had accidentally sent them two years of the radio host's telephone texts. The parents said Jones had made their lives ""hell"" He said that the congressional committee investigating last year's US Capitol riot had requested access to the messages as they look into Jones' alleged role. This is the first of three trials against Jones being brought by family members of Sandy Hook victims. He has already lost a series of defamation cases filed by parents of the victims by default after failing to produce documents and testimony. But this was the first trial in which financial damages were agreed by a jury. Jones appeared briefly in the court on Friday, but was not present for the final verdict. Despite retracting his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones has continued to use his media platform to argue the case was rigged against him and claimed that members of the jury pool ""don't know what planet they're on"". His Infowars website depicted the judge being consumed by flames. His behaviour triggered several rebukes from the judge, who at one point told him: ""This is not your show."" After the verdict on Friday, he posted a video where he claimed his net worth to be a fraction of what was said in court, and condemned the trial as ""beyond any kangaroo-rigged court ever"". Jones - a popular figure in US fringe conservative commentary - has repeatedly argued that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax orchestrated by the government to strip Americans of gun rights, and that the parents of the dead children were ""crisis actors"". His lawyer had cited US constitutional free speech protections and asked for leniency in the trial, saying the jury had already sent a message to all radio hosts ""that their standard of care has changed"".

"Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around Taiwan China is halting co-operation with the US in several key areas including climate change, military talks and efforts to combat international crime. The new measures follow a trip to Taiwan by a US congressional delegation led by senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi. China, which also announced it was sanctioning Ms Pelosi and her family, views the visit as a challenge to its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. The self-ruled island sees itself as distinct from the mainland. The measures were announced by China's foreign ministry on Friday. It said dialogue between US and Chinese defence officials would be cancelled, while co-operation on returning illegal immigrants, climate change, and investigating international crime would be suspended. The two major powers have maintained cordial diplomatic ties on the need to combat climate change in recent years. At last year's climate summit in Glasgow, China vowed to work ""with urgency"" with the US to cut emissions. The countries have also found rare common cause on efforts to fight the trade of illegal drugs such as fentanyl. The decision to halt co-operation was taken because Ms Pelosi visited Taiwan ""in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations,"" the Chinese ministry said in a statement. It also accused the US delegation and Ms Pelosi - who is the highest-ranking US politician to travel to the island in 25 years - of ""egregious provocations"". In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying criticised US foreign policy by comparing it to the police killing of George Floyd, the unarmed black American whose death in 2020 sparked global anti-racism protests. ""We cannot allow the US to take itself as 'world policeman' and treat other countries as George Floyd whom it can bully and strangle at will,"" she wrote. At a news conference later on Friday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Ms Pelosi ""had every right"" to go to Taiwan and said China's new measures were ""fundamentally irresponsible"". ""We'll continue our efforts to keep open lines of communications with Beijing, while defending our interests and values,"" she said. Analysis by John Sudworth, former Beijing correspondent in Washington There can be few clearer examples of just how far, and how fast, the international political landscape is shifting. The statement from Beijing marks a new low point in the defining strategic relationship of our time. The consensus, just a few years ago, was that an established superpower should build strong trade and investment ties with a newly emerging one. The ideological differences would then fade away. Instead, while China has indeed become the factory of the world, deeply integrated into global supply chains, it has grown more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad. A 1997 trip to Taiwan by then US House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, was met with little opposition. The Nancy Pelosi visit has been met with missiles - flown directly over a democracy and the heads of its 24 million people - whose appetite, by the way, for China's vision for unification dwindles ever further the more authoritarian it becomes. And now, any American citizen worried about the impact of Chinese precursor chemicals - sold into Mexico and then turned into the fentanyl that is fuelling thousands of US deaths - will also feel the impact of these shifting geopolitical plates. The Chinese statement suspends counter-narcotics co-operation. China's ""shared future for mankind"" messaging on climate change is similarly put on ice, now seemingly held hostage to the precondition that its claims to Taiwan be recognised. Nancy Pelosi may have given China the pretext. But this is a shift that was already well under way. The battle over values is front and centre stage once again, and the profound challenges it presents for the existing global order are likely only to increase. Although the US does not officially recognise Taiwan, it maintains strong relations with the island - which includes selling weapons for Taiwan to defend itself. Ms Pelosi is currently in Japan on the final leg of an Asia tour, and said on Friday that China ""will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there"". ON THE GROUND:Taiwan's 'Pelosi lovefest' EXPLAINER:China and Taiwan: A really simple guide ANALYSIS:Where Taiwan crisis leaves Biden's China policy Speaking to the BBC, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu defended the visit which he said would ""raise the profile of Taiwan and... allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". He also condemned the large-scale military exercises that China began around the island on Thursday in response to Ms Pelosi's visit. This video can not be played Foreign minister, Joseph Wu, condemns China's military drills around Taiwan Beijing is currently holding military drills in the air and seas around the island and these are expected to continue until Sunday. More than 100 warplanes and 10 warships have taken part in the live-fire exercises, with many apparently crossing the unofficial buffer zone between China and Taiwan. At least one ballistic missile has flown directly over the island, according to Chinese state media. Taiwan's foreign ministry has not confirmed or denied whether that is true, but it condemned the ongoing drills as ""highly provocative acts"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken added on Friday that there was ""no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response"". The White House summoned China's ambassador to Washington, condemning China's escalation as ""irresponsible"". In a statement, National Security Council strategic communications co-ordinator John Kirby said the White House had made it clear that the US ""is prepared for what Beijing chooses to do. We will not seek and do not want a crisis."" Why do China and Taiwan have poor relations?China sees the self-ruled island as a part of its territory and insists it should be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary How is Taiwan governed?The island has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces Who recognises Taiwan?Only a few countries recognise Taiwan. Most recognise the Chinese government in Beijing instead. The US has no official ties with Taiwan but does have a law which requires it to provide the island with the means to defend itself Taiwan foreign minister defends Pelosi visit China condemns 'manic' visit as Pelosi continues tour The view from Taiwan: 'We've had this for 70 years' UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you What happens if TikTok is banned?

"Gabriel Martinelli became the first Brazilian player to score the first goal of a Premier League season Mikel Arteta said his Arsenal side look ""hungry"" after getting their campaign off to the perfect start with victory over Crystal Palace in an entertaining 2022-23 Premier League curtain-raiser at Selhurst Park. The Gunners maintained their impressive pre-season form with an energetic performance that was rewarded when Gabriel Martinelli nodded in a 20th-minute opener from new signing Oleksandr Zinchenko's headed assist. It took Palace most of the first half to adapt to the visitors' tempo, but once they did Odsonne Edouard forced Aaron Ramsdale into a save after Joachim Andersen's header found him in the six-yard box. Buoyed by a vibrant home crowd, the Eagles poured forward in search of a leveller but it was Arsenal who found the net again, Marc Guehi inadvertently heading Bukayo Saka's fierce cross into his own goal late on. ""I have had this feeling for the first few weeks since the boys started pre-season. They are ready, they look hungry, with that mentality that they really want to win,"" Arteta told Match of the Day. ""The team came here to play the way we wanted to play - we were dominant, we were a threat, we were really lively and sharp from the beginning. Then when we felt under pressure we coped with that with resilience."" Follow reaction to Crystal Palace v Arsenal Read the latest Crystal Palace news here Enjoy the best Arsenal content here This video can not be played Mikel Arteta praises Arsenal's 'hungry' mentality in win at Palace Between Arsenal's savvy transfer business, free-scoring pre-season form and being the focus of Amazon's latest All or Nothing series, there has been plenty to whet their fans' appetites this summer. We may have to wait until the second series to learn whether Arteta piped Palace anthem 'Glad All Over' out during training before this one - as he did with 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before visiting Anfield last season - orwhether it was the Spaniard's artworkthat set the tone, but his side arrived with a relentless intensity that made Martinelli's opening goal feel inevitable. The 21-year-old Brazilian had earlier missed a glorious chance after Gabriel Jesus waltzed through the Palace defence, skewing wide of the far post after his compatriot's effort was blocked, but he stooped to head in from a clever corner routine. The Gunners lost their opening three league games last season, including another Friday night opener at Brentford, and ultimately narrowly missed out on a return to Champions League football. But they have strengthened with the acquisitions of Jesus and Zinchenko from Manchester City and both already look set to have a big impact on Arteta's young squad. Jesus, who scored seven goals in five pre-season games, caused Palace's back four problems with his relentless work-rate as well as his talent on the ball, and he laid on a chance for Martin Odegaard that the Gunners captain might have done better with. It was another Arsenal debutant who really impressed, with 21-year-old centre back William Saliba - who has spent most of his three years at the club out on loan, producing a fine defensive display. The Frenchman was part of a back four that had to show resilience amid the hosts' growing threat, before Guehi's own goal following a snappy Saka break made things more comfortable. It was a result and performance that will have pleased Arteta, who recorded his 50th league win as Gunners boss, while simultaneously giving Arsenal's top-four rivals a glimpse of what they are up against this term. This video can not be played Missed chances cost Palace - Patrick Vieira Palace boss Patrick Vieira was concerned this game had arrived too early after a disrupted pre-season that saw some of his squad not being able to travel to Singapore and Australia, some players remaining on the treatment table, and the Frenchman still hoping to make more transfer additions. He also said he was happy with the business the Eagles have done so far this window, although only Cheick Doucoure started after arriving from Lens, and Palace struggled to deal with an irrepressible Arsenal early on. The hosts, who took four points off Arsenal last season, did improve and Ramsdale's save from Edouard's header before the break was followed after half-time when the goalkeeper also denied Eberechi Eze following Wilfried Zaha's pass in what kick-started a dominant spell for the Eagles. Palace, who are looking to improve on their 12th-placed finish last season, were unable to capitalise on that pressure and were instead caught out on the break, but Vieira will want to wait until the end of the transfer window before giving a real assessment of where his side are.
