"Abellio ScotRail's contract to run train services in Scotland will end early, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has announced. The Dutch firm has been running the franchise since 2015 but had faced criticism over cancellations and performance levels. The contract, worth more than Â£7bn over 10 years, was due to last until 2025. But Mr Matheson said a so-called ""break clause"" would be used to end the franchise three years early, in 2022. He told MSPs he was looking at other options for the future, including the franchise being run by the public sector. ScotRail operates about 2,400 train services a day, and covers all services in Scotland except those run by other operators which cross the border. It is not responsible for the maintenance of the track, which falls under Network Rail nor the operation of the main rail routes from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. Timeline: How Abellio lost Scotland's confidence Look back on the statement with Holyrood Live There had been political pressure on ministers over the service with complaints over a high number of cancellations, overcrowding and the cost of tickets. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Matheson said a proposed increase in government subsidy for the service would not deliver sufficient benefits to passengers or the economy. Mr Matheson told the Scottish parliament a ""break clause"" will be used to end the franchise early Mr Matheson said Abellio had ""successes and challenges"" over the first five years of the ScotRail franchise, but that his decision was ""the right one for passengers, communities, the economy and taxpayers"". He confirmed the contract would now run until 31 March, 2022. ""It is of course necessary to plan for the future provision of ScotRail services and I can confirm that work is already under way to examine the options open to the Scottish ministers after the current contract comes to an end,"" he said. The franchise system for Britain's railways is grinding to a halt. The Scottish government has jammed on the brakes and change is also expected soon at Westminster. The reason given to MSPs for ending the franchise is 2022 stuck carefully to the contractual option on doing so and avoided the shortcomings of Abellio's handling of the franchise since 2015. That would be open to legal challenge. Such a challenge would point out that the service has improved in the past year, with the arrival of new trains, adding more capacity. There's a new station in north-west Glasgow and improvements to the Aberdeen-Inverness service have just begun. What happens next? Abellio is obliged to continue the service until the franchise ends. The soon to be publishedWilliams Reviewis expected to start a big shift away from the franchise bidding system. Pricing for tickets is expected to be shaken up. In Scotland, there is pressure within the SNP, from unions, Labour and Greens, to put ScotRail operations in public hands. If there's to be another franchise, the government previously said it wants a public sector bidder for it. If there is to be one from April 2022, it will have to get up and running very soon. Dominic Booth, managing director of Abellio UK, said the firm was ""hugely disappointed"" and that the decision was ""the wrong choice for Scotland's Railway and its customers"". He said the company had invested more than Â£475m in new and upgraded trains and created more than 500 extra jobs in Scotland. Mr Booth added: ""Our offer to Transport Scotland would have delivered an improved service for our customers at a reduced cost to the taxpayer."" ScotRail admits it 'didn't do well enough' after delays Thousands of ScotRail services axed due to staff shortages ScotRail passenger satisfaction falls to 16-year low But Kevin Lindsay, organiser for the train drivers' trade union Aslef in Scotland, claimed Abellio had let down passengers and staff. He added: ""The truth is that the franchise model is a broken business model. It hasn't worked, it doesn't work and it will not work. Everyone on the railway understands that."" Scottish Labour also welcomed the decision and called for the rail system to return to public ownership while the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the company had provided a ""poor service"". Scottish Conservative shadow transport minister Jamie Greene described the termination of the contract as ""an admission of absolute failure"" by the SNP.

"Victoria station was closed due to overcrowding fears London Victoria was left ""at a standstill"" because of a ""major signal failure"" during rush-hour. Part of the station, the country's second busiest, was closed due to overcrowding fears. Services faced delays and cancellations until the end of Wednesday. Southern Rail, which operates many of the services, advised passengers not to travel from Victoria. About 75 million passengers passed through the station last year. Images posted on social media showed hundreds of passengers held on the station concourse, unable to catch Southern, Southeastern and Gatwick Express trains. Thameslink services out of London Bridge were also affected by the problems. Trains were running in the area at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday, but disruption lasted until the end of service.

"This video can not be played Queen's Speech: Brexit, the NHS and what happened next Boris Johnson has claimed his programme for government is the ""most radical Queen's Speech in a generation"". The prime minister said planned new laws to toughen up criminal justice and increase NHS spending would deliver on the ""people's priorities"". But his main priority is the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said many of the PM's promises mimicked the ""language of Labour policy but without the substance"". ""They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, even when it's a very pale imitation, but I fear those swayed by the prime minister's promises will be sorely disappointed,"" added the Labour leader. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the PM of ""denying [Scotland] the right to choose our own future"" referring to the SNP's desire for another referendum on Scottish independence. ""Why did democracy stop in the prime minister's world with the independence referendum in 2014?"" he asked. But Boris Johnson said he felt a ""colossal sense of obligation"" to the voters. He told MPs that ""a new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach"" adding that the government would ""work flat out to deliver it"". LIVE: Reaction to State Opening of Parliament What does the Queen's Speech mean for you? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Addressing Parliament for the second time in less than three months, the Queen said the priority for her government was to deliver Brexit on 31 January, but ministers also had an ""ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people's priorities"". Of the more than 30 bills announced in the Queen's Speech, seven were on Brexit. This video can not be played Queen's speech outlines plans for Brexit and NHS It comes as the government says it will close its Department for Exiting the European Union on 31 January. The seven bills announced that were devoted to Brexit cover legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law. The first to be put to Parliament will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that enables the UK to leave the EU - on Friday before the Christmas recess. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn walked to the House of Lords together in silence Following last week's general election, the prime minister has a Commons majority of 80 - the largest enjoyed by a Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? The prime minister's increased parliamentary authority and command of his party means it is likely to pass without major changes in the New Year in time to meet the 31 January deadline. In another move welcomed by Tory MPs, the bill willalso enable more British judgesto depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court. On the NHS, the government says it will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service's funding, with an extra Â£33.9bn per year provided by 2023/24. The PM's commitment on the NHS amounts to a 3.4% year-on-year increase in expenditure, a significant increase on what the NHS received during the five year Tory-Lib Dem coalition government as well as under his predecessors David Cameron and Theresa May. But it is significantly lower than the 6% average annual increases seen under Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And when adjusted for inflation, and factoring in the increased cost of equipment, medicines and staff pay, it could actually be worth Â£20.5bn by 2023-4. The Tories' environmental plans analysed Do the Tories' broadband plans add up? Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Labour's health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said: ""If the Conservatives' plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick, we would urge them to pledge the extra Â£6bn a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they've imposed for a decade."" There was also a commitment announced for ministers to seek cross-party consensus for long-term reform of the social care system and the government will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. This government wants to try to give the appearance that they are completely new, completely different, even though the Conservatives have been in power for nearly a full decade. That is quite a political stunt to try to pull off. But it's clear also that Boris Johnson came to the Commons today to present a vision that he hopes can straddle left and right, or what has traditionally been seen as Labour's place in politics and the Conservatives' place in politics. That is what the results of the general election gave him as an opportunity. And the challenge for Boris Johnson is not just to hold onto that for five years, but show to people who voted Tory for the first time that the party was worth the risk - that their vote was the right decision. The test will be enormous - whether or not all that rhetoric actually matches up to the reality of the actions and decisions that this government will make. Mr Johnson has had a reputation for years of being hungry with ambition to get to this place. We're going to find out in the next months and years whether he's hungry to take the decisions that actually will cement his place in history. Plans for longer sentences for violent criminals, were also unveiled, as well as the establishment of a Royal Commission to improve the ""efficiency and effectiveness"" of the criminal justice process and there are bills that will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms. And those charged with knife possession will face ""swift justice"". Other announcements in the Queen's Speech included: A ""points-based immigration system"", allowing the UK to welcome skilled workers On housing, landlords will get more rights to gain possession of their property and a new ""lifetime deposit"" scheme has been proposed which will mean tenants do not have to find a new deposit every time they move A pledge to cut business rates for thousands of retailers, pubs and restaurants across England and Wales. With the aim of helping struggling high streets, the government promised to increase the retail discount on rates by a third to 50%, costing Â£320m A new visa to ""ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom"" The removal of hospital car parking charges ""for those in greatest need"" New laws to ""accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband"" The government will continue to take steps to meet net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act - which would enable the prime minister to call an election without the consent of MPs Thursday's State Opening of Parliament was the 66th time the Queen has opened Parliament - and has come only weeks after the last one on 14 October. There was less pageantry than usual, as was the case the last time a snap election was held in 2017.

"Nurses are on picket lines across Northern Ireland Strike action by 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland over pay and staffing has ended. In total, more than 20,000 people who work in the health service in Northern Ireland were involved in Wednesday's action. Nine thousand Royal College of Nursing nurses ended their 12-hour strike at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Nurses in the Unison union remained on strike until midnight, along with the majority of NIPSA members. Members of the Unite union are on strike until 06:00 on Thursday, while NIPSA ambulance workers are due to end their action at 07:00 GMT. The Health and Social Care Board said 4,749 hospital appointments were cancelled on Wednesday. Why are Northern Ireland's nurses going on strike? What services will be affected? Politicians find no easy answers to nurses' strike Paul Cummings, deputy chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said two-hourly calls were being made to each of the health trusts to assess the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, he said so far there had been ""no reported issues of patient safety"". ""Every aspect of health and social care has been affected,"" he said. ""Pressure is continuing to grow on our emergency departments, but so far our preparations [for the strike] have paid dividends."" This video can not be played 'This is unprecedented for us' Speaking at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, RCN member Nuala Murray told BBC News NI: ""This was incredibly difficult. I've been nursing for 37 years. ""This is so unprecedented for us to have to strike but nurses are so fed up, they've just had enough. ""Their patients aren't safe and they need to do something."" Many appointments and treatments have been cancelled because of the strike, and a number of minor injury units are closed. The Health and Social Care Board said all emergency departments would remain open as normal, but would be under significant pressure. Sean Smyth, whose daughter died in June, joined the picket line at Belfast City Hospital. ""I'm here to show solidarity with the fantastic health workers we have,"" he said. ""The care and support Eimear got was equally matched by the support they showed me and my family and we'll never be able to thank them. Sean Smyth said he was frustrated at the state of the health service in Northern Ireland ""Eimear was first treated in England. We have first hand experience of the nursing staff in St James's in Leeds. ""The nurses nurse in England. Here in Belfast we have seen the nurses nurse, clean, cook, do every task there is possible. And the work they do is unbelievable. ""I've witnessed what their colleagues get in England. The pay get and the conditions they work in, the staffing levels compared to ours. It is chalk and cheese, we are the poor country cousin to England, Scotland and Wales. ""Where Eimear died, it was something from the 1980s - a horrible grey room. It's a horrible environment, the facilities are poor. ""Our hospitals need major investment, our staff need major support from our politicians."" Mairead Meenan, a staff nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said the ""fair pay"" issue had brought her to the picket line. ""Everybody wants equal pay and equal rights,"" she said, adding that nurses in Northern Ireland felt ""undervalued"" compared to their counterparts doing the same jobs in Great Britain. She called on politicians to ""start talking"" and sort the dispute out. ""You get paid loads and loads of money and you would not last 10 minutes in our job,"" said Ms Meenan. One woman, whose appointment at Altnagelvin went ahead as scheduled on Wednesday morning, came out to support nurses and health workers on the picket line. She has had two operations at the hospital since May. ""I was extremely well looked after and am very appreciative of all the care I've had,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I'm also totally disgusted with Stormont and its lack of getting on with sorting out Northern Ireland. ""This wouldn't have happened if they [politicians] had thought about it properly and fought for our good health service."" On so many measures, Northern Ireland lags behind the other UK nations when it comes to NHS performance. Not only does it has the highest vacancy rates, it also has the worst record in terms of meeting waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and routine operations. The best indication of this is the figures for the proportion of patients seen in four hours in A&E. England has just seen its performance sink to a record low of just over 81%. In Northern Ireland it is currently below 66%. Why? The suspension of a devolved government has certainly not helped - delaying everything from new policy to pay rises. But modernisation of health care in Northern Ireland was already behind schedule before that happened. Services are spread too thinly across too many sites, so there is a lot of catching up to do - and the more it is delayed the longer it will take. This video can not be played 'Patient safety is compromised every single day' Health workers say they want to be paid the same as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. Pay parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ended in 2014 when the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Jim Wells was health minister. He imposed a ""degree of restraint"" on pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Wells said the decision had been ""very difficult because the choice was very stark"", explaining that another increase in pay at the time could have led to redundancies or services being closed. The issue has not been looked at again because Northern Ireland has not had a devolved government since 2017. Downing Street said the strike highlighted the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties working together to restore devolved government. The ""quickest and best"" way to resolve the dispute was to get the Stormont executive up and running again, said the Prime Minister's spokesman. He added that the Northern Ireland Department of Health had been working closely with trust chief executives, unions and staff to make sure that services were delivered safely during the strike. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent These are unprecedented times. For the first time in UK history close to 20,000 health and social care works are on picket lines, including about 15,500 nurses. With more than 300,000 people in Northern Ireland waiting for an appointment, today's strike is going to push all services over the limit. As healthcare workers protest and wave flags calling for pay parity and safer staffing levels, what they are also shouting about is a desire to get devolved government back up and running. While there is a skeleton staff today, and while many appointments have been cancelled, a shortage of staff has been an issue for many years. Paramedics join the picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The RCN argues the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The RCN estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in Northern Ireland is 13%, compared with about 11% in England and 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing.

A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board said major challenges were expected across all health and social care services on Wednesday. It also advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted, they should attend their appointment/service as normal. All emergency departments remain open. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first,"" said the spokesperson. ""Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods."" The heads of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts have statedthe current crisis in the service has been ""years in the making"". Are you a patient who will be affected by the strike?

"Abellio ScotRail's contract to run train services in Scotland will end early, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has announced. The Dutch firm has been running the franchise since 2015 but had faced criticism over cancellations and performance levels. The contract, worth more than Â£7bn over 10 years, was due to last until 2025. But Mr Matheson said a so-called ""break clause"" would be used to end the franchise three years early, in 2022. He told MSPs he was looking at other options for the future, including the franchise being run by the public sector. ScotRail operates about 2,400 train services a day, and covers all services in Scotland except those run by other operators which cross the border. It is not responsible for the maintenance of the track, which falls under Network Rail nor the operation of the main rail routes from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. Timeline: How Abellio lost Scotland's confidence Look back on the statement with Holyrood Live There had been political pressure on ministers over the service with complaints over a high number of cancellations, overcrowding and the cost of tickets. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Matheson said a proposed increase in government subsidy for the service would not deliver sufficient benefits to passengers or the economy. Mr Matheson told the Scottish parliament a ""break clause"" will be used to end the franchise early Mr Matheson said Abellio had ""successes and challenges"" over the first five years of the ScotRail franchise, but that his decision was ""the right one for passengers, communities, the economy and taxpayers"". He confirmed the contract would now run until 31 March, 2022. ""It is of course necessary to plan for the future provision of ScotRail services and I can confirm that work is already under way to examine the options open to the Scottish ministers after the current contract comes to an end,"" he said. The franchise system for Britain's railways is grinding to a halt. The Scottish government has jammed on the brakes and change is also expected soon at Westminster. The reason given to MSPs for ending the franchise is 2022 stuck carefully to the contractual option on doing so and avoided the shortcomings of Abellio's handling of the franchise since 2015. That would be open to legal challenge. Such a challenge would point out that the service has improved in the past year, with the arrival of new trains, adding more capacity. There's a new station in north-west Glasgow and improvements to the Aberdeen-Inverness service have just begun. What happens next? Abellio is obliged to continue the service until the franchise ends. The soon to be publishedWilliams Reviewis expected to start a big shift away from the franchise bidding system. Pricing for tickets is expected to be shaken up. In Scotland, there is pressure within the SNP, from unions, Labour and Greens, to put ScotRail operations in public hands. If there's to be another franchise, the government previously said it wants a public sector bidder for it. If there is to be one from April 2022, it will have to get up and running very soon. Dominic Booth, managing director of Abellio UK, said the firm was ""hugely disappointed"" and that the decision was ""the wrong choice for Scotland's Railway and its customers"". He said the company had invested more than Â£475m in new and upgraded trains and created more than 500 extra jobs in Scotland. Mr Booth added: ""Our offer to Transport Scotland would have delivered an improved service for our customers at a reduced cost to the taxpayer."" ScotRail admits it 'didn't do well enough' after delays Thousands of ScotRail services axed due to staff shortages ScotRail passenger satisfaction falls to 16-year low But Kevin Lindsay, organiser for the train drivers' trade union Aslef in Scotland, claimed Abellio had let down passengers and staff. He added: ""The truth is that the franchise model is a broken business model. It hasn't worked, it doesn't work and it will not work. Everyone on the railway understands that."" Scottish Labour also welcomed the decision and called for the rail system to return to public ownership while the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the company had provided a ""poor service"". Scottish Conservative shadow transport minister Jamie Greene described the termination of the contract as ""an admission of absolute failure"" by the SNP.

"Actor Joe Alwyn says his biggest competition this Christmas is... Kermit The Frog. Both play Bob Cratchit in versions of A Christmas Carol. Joe's in the latest BBC adaptation from the makers of Peaky Blinders. Kermit, of course, is in the 1992 Muppets classic. The revelation though? ""I've never actually seen A Muppet Christmas Carol,"" says Joe, despite it being on all Christmas, every Christmas. Safe to say, the 2019 version is as far from Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear as you can get - a far darker take on the classic Charles Dickens novel. Charlotte Riley says her favourite Christmas movie is Dudley Moore's Santa Claus and her favourite festive song is Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree The plot is the same - The mean-spirited Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Guy Pearce) gets a visit from the ghost of Jacob Marley. Three other ghosts then show him his past, his present and his deathly future. ""There is a psychological thriller element to it,"" says Charlotte Riley, who plays the Ghost of Christmas Present. ""You understand a lot more about Scrooge and why he is the way that he is. ""I think it humanises him and it makes the story of redemption even more satisfying."" Joe Alwyn's favourite Christmas movie is Home Alone, with Silent Night as his favourite Christmas song She thinks executive producer Steven Knight has ""read between the lines"" of Dickens to put this new twist on the plot. Knight is the brains behind Taboo and Peaky Blinders, and this version shares the aesthetic of both those shows. ""It's not the glossy, sanitised, cheery Dickensian world that we might know previously,"" says Joe Alwyn. ""It looks at Scrooge's pain and that goes into some uncomfortable themes and areas that haven't been explored before. ""It's totally in the vein of Peaky Blinders."" Stephen Graham's Christmas classic is It's A Wonderful Life, while he argues Imagine by John Lennon is his favourite Christmas song Other cast members include Jason Flemyng as the Ghost of Christmas Future, Vinette Robinson as Mary Cratchit and Andy Serkis as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Playing the role of Jacob Marley - Scrooge's old business partner - is Stephen Graham, who says Knight has put an ""earthy, working class spin"" on the festive tale. ""What this version has done is make a good representation of what's happening in society now in certain respects. ""It bangs a mirror up and says, 'Be careful'. Look at how you treat people and your fellow man. ""You don't want to go to your grave with all those horrible resentments."" A Christmas Carol marks the end of arguably the most high-profile year of Stephen Graham's career so far, with major roles in Line Of Duty, The Virtues and Martin Scorsese's The Irishman. ""It's been alright hasn't it?"" he smiles. ""I still pinch myself sometimes as I'm still that little kid that just wanted to be an actor when he grew up."" He admits that more people now recognise him, which he puts down to Line Of Duty in which he played series five's protagonist, John Corbett. ""I never realised how massive that show is. And the momentum of that seemed to carry on to The Virtues."" A Christmas Carol begins on BBC One on Sunday 22 December at 21:00.

"A gold pendant depicted the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor - a protector of the dead Archaeologists have discovered two royal tombs in Greece containing jewellery and artefacts dating back more than 3,000 years. The finds include a gold ring depicting bulls flanked by sheaves of barley and a pendant showing an Egyptian goddess. The US researchers say their discovery will provide new clues about early Mycenaean trade and culture. The tombs are near the Bronze Age palace of Pylos, in Greece's southern Peloponnese region. They are not far from another important grave discovered in 2015, believed to be that of an early ruler of the city. Greece displays 7,000-year-old archaeological enigma DNA clue to origins of early Greek civilization A statement from Greece's culture ministry said on Tuesday that the dome-shaped roofs of both tombs had collapsed during antiquity, filling them with so much debris that robbers were unable to plunder them. A team from the University of Cincinnati,external(UC) spent more than 18 months excavating the site and documenting the artefacts. A gold ring showed life from the earliest days of agriculture Jack Davis, head of UC's classics department, said items such as the gold ring depicting two bulls with sheaves of barley gave an insight into life around the Mediterranean more than 3,000 years ago. ""It's an interesting scene of animal husbandry - cattle mixed with grain production. It's the foundation of agriculture,"" he said. The tombs were littered with tiny pieces of gold leaf that had fallen from the walls. The tombs had collapsed, which protected the contents from thieves In 2015 archaeologists at nearby Pylos found the grave of a high-status man whom they dubbed the Griffin Warrior after engravings of a mythological creature engraved in his tomb. The tomb included armour, weapons, gold jewellery and an agate sealstone depicting two warriors fighting.

An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here. Following his speech this morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has also been interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark. You can watch the full interview on BBC Two from 22:30 GMT.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

That's a marked contrast to the frosty reception Jeremy Corbyn got during a fractious meeting with his own MPs last night, where he faced strong criticism over his leadership. A little more now fromthat Spectator article,externalpenned by the prime minister. Mr Johnson wraps up the piece with some of his oft-repeated buzzwords such as a promise to ""unite and level up"" and ""unleash [the UK's] potential"".

"The number of cod which can be legally caught by the UK's fishermen will be halved next year. It was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday at Brussels talks on fishing quotas for 2020. Prior to those discussions, representatives of Scottish trawlermen agreed to a 50% reduction in the cod catch in an effort to preserve stocks. The UK government said that in order to protect the future of the industry it had to fish sustainably. Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said: ""The reduction in the total allowable catch for North Sea cod will have a serious economic impact on the Scottish white fish sector next year, and will present major practical difficulties for the fleet. ""We welcome the commitment to review and update the stock assessment model for North Sea cod, reflecting the changing distribution of cod in the North Sea, most likely as a result of climate change."" Regulation of the fishing industry will be controlled by the UK after Brexit Fisheries Secretary Fergus Ewing, who was at the talks in Brussels, added: ""With Brexit about to happen it has been clear the EU is already prioritising other members over the state about to walk away. ""That is perhaps unsurprising, but coupled with the challenging scientific advice, it has made this a difficult two days."" Britain is preparing to leave the Common Fisheries Policy regime as a result of Brexit. Reality Check: How would Brexit affect the UK's fishing waters? UK to withdraw from international fishing arrangement Brexit fishing industry plans outlined by government Mike Park of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association (SWFPA) said the next year would be ""extremely challenging"". Speaking on the BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: ""It's a stock that's quite prolific in the northern North Sea. ""There's been significant changes over the whole of the North Sea but essentially next year that will cause the fleet problems which is now our focus to try and resolve that. ""In the next year, as the UK prepares to leave the Common Fisheries Policy, it is vital that the right scientific work is done to improve our understanding of the current status of the stock to enable better decisions to be taken on fishing opportunities for 2021."" Speaking after the talks concluded, UK fisheries minister George Eustice said: ""This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the North East Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks. ""I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of bycatch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban. ""However, we also know that to protect the profitability of fisheries in the future, we must fish sustainably today."" The talks have resulted in small increases in the allowable catches for North Sea ling and skate, as well as the relaxation of some proposed control and management measures Last year, the UK government set out its plans for the future of fishing after Brexit. It said devolved nations would have a say in setting annual quotas for third countries, but the environment secretary's decision was final. It intends to move to a system of quota management which it believes will guarantee a fairer share of the fish in UK waters for UK registered boats. The rules of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy will continue to apply until December 2020. Mr Eustice claimed some of the challenges faced by the UK fishing industry had resulted from EU rules. He said: ""Some of the problems have been exacerbated by the fact that the EU's outdated method for sharing quota between member states means that the UK gets a very small share of the cod in our own waters."" Marine sustainability group Open Seas said in a statement: ""Devastatingly this decision commits to yet more overfishing in the coming year. Quota for North Sea cod has been set roughly 30% above scientific advice."" Open Seas said the agreements represented ""bad decisions for the health of our sea, bad debts that will be owed by future generations, and fail legal pledges to end overfishing"". What difference will this make to prices on the street? Cod is a traditional fish and chips favourite in England, with battered haddock more popular in Scotland Industry sources say it is actually very hard - almost impossible in fact - to tell what impact the quotas will have on prices on the street. With takeaway fish and chips for example, cod is more popular in England - whereas haddock is the staple of the fish supper in Scotland. With the haddock quota up, in theory it could mean that with more haddock then prices would be a bit lower, and with less cod prices could be a slightly higher. However a lot of the cod that hits fish and chip shops in England comes from frozen at sea suppliers from Norway.

An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our
pledges and promises."" Mr Johnson was greeted with table-banging and one
MP described the atmosphere inside the room as ""euphoric"". Tory MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie says the prime minister was on ""top form"". Allow Twitter content?

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson. She said at the time ofher pioneering move in 2018that she hoped it would signal a step forward in modernising Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here. Following his speech this morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has also been interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark. You can watch the full interview on BBC Two from 22:30 GMT.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

"Bet365 boss Denise Coates has received a Â£323m payday, confirming her position as the UK's best paid executive. The co-founder of the online gambling firm was paid a Â£277m salary plus dividends as the popularity of online gambling continues to grow. The firm's accounts,externalshow that in the year to end-March her salary rose from Â£220m on the previous period. But the rise comes as the industry faced mounting criticism, including overchildren gambling. How Bet365's Denise Coates hit her own jackpot Gambling: How much do we spend in the UK? How much should bosses be paid? The privately held company is owned jointly by Ms Coates and members of her direct family, including her brother John, who is joint chief executive, and her father Peter, the firm's chairman. Ms Coates earned a first-class degree in econometrics - the application of statistical methods to economic data - from Sheffield University before joining the High Street betting firm, run by her father. She identified the potential of online gambling in 2000 and invested in the domain name Bet365.com so that she could drive the family business in that direction. Bet365 made a profit before tax of Â£791m in the year, compared with Â£661m the year before. The firm paid dividends of Â£92.5m, half of which are thought to have gone to Ms Coates, as the owner of about half of Bet365's shares. The group of firms owns Stoke City Football Club, which made a loss of Â£8.7m in the year. The High Pay Centre, a think tank which monitors income, said the timing of the release of the Bet365 results looked ""cynical"", given it was just after a general election. High Pay Centre executive director Luke Hildyard said: ""This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues."" He added: ""Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people."" Mr Hildyard said there was ""clearly scope"" for those accumulating such sums to pay their workers more or contribute more in taxes. In October, Cardiff University research suggested that two-fifths of 11 to 16-year-olds had gambled in the past year. The study said this was ""particularly concerning, given that across the UK, most forms of commercial gambling are only legal for those aged 18 and over"". Fruit machines were the most popular form of gambling, followed by playing cards for money with friends and scratchcards. Dr Graham Moore of the Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement said at the time: ""The evidence shows that people who gamble earlier in life are more likely to become problem gamblers in adulthood."" However, aGambling Commission study in October,externalsuggested that 11% of children had gambled within a week of the survey being conducted. But in addition,the regulator warned in July,externalof research that indicated links between ""problem gambling and suicidal thoughts or attempts"". Bet365 says it has ""an unwavering commitment to deliver industry-leading approaches to player protection"", including monitoring customer gambling, and says it will ""terminate the [customer] relationship if it feels the risk of harm is too high"".

"It is the first time members of the Royal College of Nursing in NI have voted for strike action Health workers across Northern Ireland have been staging industrial action in protest against pay and staffing levels which they say are ""unsafe"". Last month, for the first time in UK history,the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) voted to on strike across Northern Irelandwith members of the largest health union Unison following suit days later. It is believed that about 15,500 nurses in total are taking part in a walk-out on Wednesday - that figure includes about 9,000 RCN nurses and a further 6,500 Unison nurses. RCN nurses are staging a 12-hour strike which began at 08:00 GMT on Wednesday. Other unions including Unite and the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (Nipsa) are also joining the industrial action, with paramedics staging a 24-hour strike. BBC News NI explains the background to the crisis. The problem of pay and funding for nurses and healthcare staff dates back to about 2010. Until January 2017, it was the responsibility of a health minister in the devolved Stormont executive to decide on pay for healthcare staff in Northern Ireland. But then devolution collapsed, following a bitter row between power-sharing partners Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), because of a green energy financial scandal. Since then, the top civil servant in the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, has been in charge. Nurses in Northern Ireland have their training fees and bursaries paid for, while those in England do not. Five Stormont health ministers - from 2010 until the collapse of devolution - were at the helm regarding pay issues for health care workers: Michael McGimpsey - Ulster Unionist Party Edwin Poots, Jim Wells and Simon Hamilton of the DUP Michelle O'Neill - Sinn FÃ©in While changes to policy were in the hands of ministers, decisions about saving money were rubber-stamped by the Stormont executive, which up until 2016 included ministers from all five main parties. In late 2014, then-Health Minister Jim Wells said hewould impose a ""degree of restraint"",externalon pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. A differential developed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, where pay rises for nurses and healthcare workers in Northern Ireland did not increase in line with those in Scotland, England and Wales. Some health workers began their first phase of industrial action on 25 November Yes, but those have not been without criticism either. In January 2016, then-Health Minister Simon Hamilton announced a 1% pay awardthat almost triggered industrial action. At the time, the unions said the 1% rise was a one-off payment for most staff rather than an increase in annual salaries, which had been the case in other parts of the UK. Mr Hamilton argued that the demands from the unions were ""unaffordable"". In August 2016, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, who had taken over the health minister brief by then,wrote to the NHS Pay Review Body,external, as part of its annual remit, saying the arrangements on pay would remain unchanged. In her letter, she said the Northern Ireland Executive had ""endorsed the principle of adherence to the UK government's public sector pay policy and, therefore, any proposals will be constrained by HM Treasury's call for future pay restraint"". In 2017, the Westminster government agreed a pay deal that guaranteed an increase over three years for NHS workers. But the deal was not implemented in Northern Ireland due to the lack of a functioning executive. Some health workers began their first phase of industrial action on 25 November Since the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2017, talks have been ongoing between the health unions and the Department of Health. To date, little has been agreed, which has led to nurses and members of Northern Ireland's largest health union, Unison,voting for strike action. The Department of Health has said it remains ""focused on finding a way forward"" and is finalising a formal pay offer for 2019-20, which would be ""the best offer possible within the budget available"" given intense budgetary pressures. Some health workers begantheir first phase of industrial action on 25 November. It has included the withdrawal of labour at different times, across a number of hospitals in Northern Ireland, such as: Not working overtime on days of industrial action Not working unpaid hours Not completing paperwork other than individual patient records Unions have said they are receiving strong public support and the Stormont civil service said intensive contingency planning is being undertaken to mitigate the impact of industrial action on patients and other service users. On Tuesday, the five main political party leaders wrote to the Northern Ireland secretary calling on him to restore the parity between nurses pay. They later met two senior civil servants, but there was no breakthough. Ahead of Wednesday's strike, a spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) said major challenges were expected across all health and social care services. It advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted by their Trust then they should attend their appointment/ service as normal. All emergency departments remain open, but ""significant pressure"" was expected within the departments. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first. Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods,"" said the spokesperson.

"Nurses are on picket lines across Northern Ireland Strike action by 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland over pay and staffing has ended. In total, more than 20,000 people who work in the health service in Northern Ireland were involved in Wednesday's action. Nine thousand Royal College of Nursing nurses ended their 12-hour strike at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Nurses in the Unison union remained on strike until midnight, along with the majority of NIPSA members. Members of the Unite union are on strike until 06:00 on Thursday, while NIPSA ambulance workers are due to end their action at 07:00 GMT. The Health and Social Care Board said 4,749 hospital appointments were cancelled on Wednesday. Why are Northern Ireland's nurses going on strike? What services will be affected? Politicians find no easy answers to nurses' strike Paul Cummings, deputy chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said two-hourly calls were being made to each of the health trusts to assess the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, he said so far there had been ""no reported issues of patient safety"". ""Every aspect of health and social care has been affected,"" he said. ""Pressure is continuing to grow on our emergency departments, but so far our preparations [for the strike] have paid dividends."" This video can not be played 'This is unprecedented for us' Speaking at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, RCN member Nuala Murray told BBC News NI: ""This was incredibly difficult. I've been nursing for 37 years. ""This is so unprecedented for us to have to strike but nurses are so fed up, they've just had enough. ""Their patients aren't safe and they need to do something."" Many appointments and treatments have been cancelled because of the strike, and a number of minor injury units are closed. The Health and Social Care Board said all emergency departments would remain open as normal, but would be under significant pressure. Sean Smyth, whose daughter died in June, joined the picket line at Belfast City Hospital. ""I'm here to show solidarity with the fantastic health workers we have,"" he said. ""The care and support Eimear got was equally matched by the support they showed me and my family and we'll never be able to thank them. Sean Smyth said he was frustrated at the state of the health service in Northern Ireland ""Eimear was first treated in England. We have first hand experience of the nursing staff in St James's in Leeds. ""The nurses nurse in England. Here in Belfast we have seen the nurses nurse, clean, cook, do every task there is possible. And the work they do is unbelievable. ""I've witnessed what their colleagues get in England. The pay get and the conditions they work in, the staffing levels compared to ours. It is chalk and cheese, we are the poor country cousin to England, Scotland and Wales. ""Where Eimear died, it was something from the 1980s - a horrible grey room. It's a horrible environment, the facilities are poor. ""Our hospitals need major investment, our staff need major support from our politicians."" Mairead Meenan, a staff nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said the ""fair pay"" issue had brought her to the picket line. ""Everybody wants equal pay and equal rights,"" she said, adding that nurses in Northern Ireland felt ""undervalued"" compared to their counterparts doing the same jobs in Great Britain. She called on politicians to ""start talking"" and sort the dispute out. ""You get paid loads and loads of money and you would not last 10 minutes in our job,"" said Ms Meenan. One woman, whose appointment at Altnagelvin went ahead as scheduled on Wednesday morning, came out to support nurses and health workers on the picket line. She has had two operations at the hospital since May. ""I was extremely well looked after and am very appreciative of all the care I've had,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I'm also totally disgusted with Stormont and its lack of getting on with sorting out Northern Ireland. ""This wouldn't have happened if they [politicians] had thought about it properly and fought for our good health service."" On so many measures, Northern Ireland lags behind the other UK nations when it comes to NHS performance. Not only does it has the highest vacancy rates, it also has the worst record in terms of meeting waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and routine operations. The best indication of this is the figures for the proportion of patients seen in four hours in A&E. England has just seen its performance sink to a record low of just over 81%. In Northern Ireland it is currently below 66%. Why? The suspension of a devolved government has certainly not helped - delaying everything from new policy to pay rises. But modernisation of health care in Northern Ireland was already behind schedule before that happened. Services are spread too thinly across too many sites, so there is a lot of catching up to do - and the more it is delayed the longer it will take. This video can not be played 'Patient safety is compromised every single day' Health workers say they want to be paid the same as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. Pay parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ended in 2014 when the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Jim Wells was health minister. He imposed a ""degree of restraint"" on pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Wells said the decision had been ""very difficult because the choice was very stark"", explaining that another increase in pay at the time could have led to redundancies or services being closed. The issue has not been looked at again because Northern Ireland has not had a devolved government since 2017. Downing Street said the strike highlighted the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties working together to restore devolved government. The ""quickest and best"" way to resolve the dispute was to get the Stormont executive up and running again, said the Prime Minister's spokesman. He added that the Northern Ireland Department of Health had been working closely with trust chief executives, unions and staff to make sure that services were delivered safely during the strike. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent These are unprecedented times. For the first time in UK history close to 20,000 health and social care works are on picket lines, including about 15,500 nurses. With more than 300,000 people in Northern Ireland waiting for an appointment, today's strike is going to push all services over the limit. As healthcare workers protest and wave flags calling for pay parity and safer staffing levels, what they are also shouting about is a desire to get devolved government back up and running. While there is a skeleton staff today, and while many appointments have been cancelled, a shortage of staff has been an issue for many years. Paramedics join the picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The RCN argues the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The RCN estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in Northern Ireland is 13%, compared with about 11% in England and 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing.

"Four of Stormont's main parties have criticised Julian Smith after refusing to meet with them Stormont parties have criticised the secretary of state for not meeting them on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming healthcare strike. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Alliance and the UUP all hit out at the decision. The NIO said health is a devolved matter. About 9,000 nurses are to strike for 12 hours on Wednesday from 08:00 GMT. The five main Stormont party leaders have sent a letter to Julian Smith, which they said ""provides cover"" for him to intervene. The Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) said the strikes pose a ""major challenge"". The latest information on strike action and how it might affect patients can be found onthe Health and Social Care Board website.,external Representatives from the five parties met with with the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, David Sterling, and Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly on Tuesday afternoon in a last-minute effort to avert the strike action. That meeting was unsuccessful. The parties had hoped they could then meet with Mr Smith, but the Northern Ireland Office said health remained a devolved matter. Nichola Mallon at Stormont on Tuesday evening SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said she is ""angry"" Mr Smith did not meet the parties. ""On the eve of significant strike action in our health service by healthcare workers who have been left with no other choice, it is unacceptable that the secretary of state chose not to engage with parties this evening. ""What message does that send to healthcare staff?"" she asked. This video can not be played Nurse's plea to politicians in Northern Ireland Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said the decision not to meet was ""regrettable"". ""The pay and staffing issue must not be used as a political football within the talks,"" she said. ""Party leaders restated there is consensus if the Executive is restored byÂ 13 JanuaryÂ that we will adopt a policy to award pay parity."" The letter to Julian Smith, signed by Arlene Foster, Michelle O'Neill, Naomi Long, Colum Eastwood and Steve Aiken, said there was ""collective support for the restoration of pay parity"". ""In our view this statement, making clear that any health and finance ministers in any future Northern Ireland Executive formed before 13 January 2020 would restore pay parity, provides cover for you as secretary of state to intervene to ensure that pay parity is restored independently of the ongoing talks to restore the Executive,"" the letter said. Health crisis: Nurses continue industrial action Health crisis 'years in the making' Steve Aiken, leader of the UUP, said: ""Here we had today an opportunity for both politicians here and for the secretary of state to do what was right."" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: ""It is disappointing that on such an important issue, one that effects people in Northern Ireland directly and could have serious consequences tomorrow, he wasn't willing to actually come into the room and have the conversation with us this evening."" Nurses and other healthcare workers have been taking industrial action for several weeks amid complaints of poor pay and staffing levels. Paramedics are set to take 24-hour strike action. A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) said ""major challenges are expected across all health and social care services in Northern Ireland tomorrow"". The HSCB announced that the South Tyrone Hospital Minor Injury Unit (MIU), Mid Ulster MIU, Bangor MIU and Ards MIU will all be closed on Wednesday.

By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in NI is within 13%, compared with about 11% in England and about 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing. Nurses are demanding better work force planning. Last year, the local health service spent Â£52m on agency nurses to fill these gaps in the workforce. That money, the RCN argues, could be better managed to train and pay health service nurses. These are exceptional times which require an exceptional intervention. The RCN says no time is a good time to strike but years of negotiations between various health ministers failed and years of warnings were ignored.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""Election result brought shame on us"" Labour ""pursued a path of almost comic indecision"" over Brexit during the election and ""alienated both sides of the debate"", Tony Blair has said. In a speech in London, the ex-PM said he believed the party could have kept much of the vote in traditional Labour areas under a different leadership. The situation was ""made impossible by failure to take a clear position and to stick to it"", Mr Blair said. ""The result has brought shame on us. We let our country down,"" he added. In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Blair said ""the Labour Party, by its self-indulgence - and that's what it was in the end - was the effective handmaiden of Brexit. ""It's not our fault, because the fault is with those who advocated it - but our combination of misguided ideology and utter incompetence allowed it to happen."" Labour staff told they could lose their jobs Thornberry enters leadership race Who will be Labour's next leader? Jeremy Corbyn told MPs on Tuesday that he ""took responsibility"" for Labour's worst electoral performance, in terms of seats won, since 1935. And some of his supporters within the party, including shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, have called Mr Blair's comments an ""oversimplification"" and said Mr Corbyn should not be blamed for the loss. Labour's leader in Wales, and First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said there was ""nothing wrong"" with the party's ""basic message"" and it just had to be ""retuned"" in five years' time. Mr Corbyn has said he will stand down as Labour leader ""early next year"". But he was criticised to his face by some Labour colleagues, with former MP Mary Creagh saying the lack of a personal apology showed he was a ""man without honour and without shame"". Meanwhile, Emily Thornberry has become the first MP to officially put herself forward to replace Mr Corbyn as Labour leader. In an article for the Guardian,external, she said she has already ""pummelled"" Boris Johnson across the despatch box and said she would be able to exploit the prime minister's failings. This video can not be played Mary Creagh on Jeremy Corbyn: ""He should be apologising"" In his speech, ex-Labour leader Mr Blair - a longstanding critic of the party's move to the left under Mr Corbyn - said: ""I believe with different leadership we would have kept much of our vote in traditional Labour areas. ""Instead, we pursued a path of almost comic indecision - alienated both sides of the debate."" And he said the party should never have fallen into the ""Elephant trap"" of agreeing to a ""Brexit election"" without a clear position on Brexit and with a leader who had a ""net approval rating of minus 40%"". Mr Blair knows his intervention will probably be dismissed by many in the Labour Party, and he will be reviled by Corbynites. But what, I think, he is trying to do is open a genuine debate, in the aftermath of  Labour's worst defeat since 1935. His analysis is the scale of the defeat now threatens the very future and survival of the Labour Party - that under Mr Corbyn it has travelled so far from electability that if it carries on on that trajectory it will never be returned to government and it will be replaced by another force, another party. So his analysis is a pretty stark one: Either the party claws back from the Corbyn agenda - or it's over. Labour fought the 2017 general election on a platform of leaving the EU. But it switched to backing another referendum, under pressure from its members and senior figures in the shadow cabinet. During this year's election campaign, Mr Corbyn said he wanted renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU and then put it to a public vote, with the option of remaining in the EU. But he said he would not take sides during the referendum campaign, and would act instead as an ""honest broker"" who could unite the Leave and Remain factions. Thornberry 'warned Labour over Brexit neutrality' Why Blyth Valley changed its mind Can Tories deepen shallow roots? Mr Blair said ""it would have been better"" if Mr Corbyn had just said he was pro-Brexit, in line with his longstanding Euroscepticism. ""When things are really tough in politics, you might as well do what you believe in, because at least you'll be more convincing defending it,"" he said. Mr Blair insisted his criticism of Mr Corbyn as leader was not an attack on him ""as a person"". But he added: ""People saw him as fundamentally opposing what Britain and Western countries stand for."" Mr Corbyn personified ""a brand of quasi-revolutionary socialism - mixing far-left economic policy with deep hostility to Western foreign policy"" - and that this combination ""never has and never will"" appeal to traditional Labour voters, he argued. And the far-left ""protest movement"" which was born out of Mr Corbyn's leadership was supported by ""cult trimmings"" and was ""utterly incapable"" of being voted in as a ""credible government"". Turning to allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Blair said: ""The failure to deal with it is a matter of disgust that left some of us who voted Labour feeling for the first time in our lives conflicted about doing it."" He also hit back at Mr Corbyn's claim that Labour's policies were popular, arguing that individual policies, such as renationalising the railways, may have been popular but taken together, the party's manifesto was a ""100-page wish list"". ""Any fool can promise everything for free - but the people weren't fooled,"" he added. Mr Blair, won three general elections in a row between 1997 and 2005, said Labour's challenge was to become a ""modern progressive coalition"" with the ability to win and hold power or admit it had ""exhausted its original mission"". He did not support the idea that the next Labour leader had to be a woman or come from outside London, as some in the party have suggested. ""What (the public) want is someone who is going to govern the country with a creditable programme,"" he told the audience. Among the Labour seats in the North of England to fall to the Conservatives was Mr Blair's former constituency Sedgefield, which he represented for 24 years, and which has not had a Tory MP since the 1930s. But Shadow Justice Secretary Mr Burgon insisted Labour's election defeat should not be blamed on Mr Corbyn. He told BBC Politics Live: ""I think it's a mistake to put everything down to a single leader or personality."" He blamed the ""the right-wing press"" for trying to ""toxify"" Mr Corbyn and said that the ""mistake"" Labour made ""was underestimating how much people wanted to get Brexit done"". Mr Burgon said Mr Blair's analysis was an ""oversimplification"", saying: ""Does he really think that Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer are 'hard left'?"" Sam Tarry, Labour's new MP for Ilford South, said:  ""It's very easy for Blair to come out with these simplistic sort of problems. ""It's under his regime that we really began to break down the trust in the electorate."" Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has told the BBC he is ""seriously considering"" standing to be the next Labour leader. He said the party had a ""mountain to climb"" following their election defeat. Reflecting on Labour's election defeat, Sir Keir - who like Mr Blair backed another EU referendum - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party had failed to ""knock back"" the Conservatives' ""get Brexit done"" slogan. Former Work and Pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said she would ""decide over Christmas"" on whether she would stand, saying the party needed to tackle anti-Semitism, restore ""kindness to our politics"" and be more ""inclusive"". Labour ended up with 59 fewer MPs than two years ago. Its share of the vote, at 32.2%, was higher than in either its 2010 or 2015 defeats, it was a long way from the 41.9% it secured under Mr Corbyn in 2017. Other candidates believed to be considering running to be Labour leader include: Tottenham MP and ex-Business Minister David Lammy MP for Norwich South and ex-shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis MP for Birmingham Yardley Jess Phillips Wigan MP and former shadow environment secretary Lisa Nandy Who will be Labour's next leader?

"Bet365 boss Denise Coates has received a Â£323m payday, confirming her position as the UK's best paid executive. The co-founder of the online gambling firm was paid a Â£277m salary plus dividends as the popularity of online gambling continues to grow. The firm's accounts,externalshow that in the year to end-March her salary rose from Â£220m on the previous period. But the rise comes as the industry faced mounting criticism, including overchildren gambling. How Bet365's Denise Coates hit her own jackpot Gambling: How much do we spend in the UK? How much should bosses be paid? The privately held company is owned jointly by Ms Coates and members of her direct family, including her brother John, who is joint chief executive, and her father Peter, the firm's chairman. Ms Coates earned a first-class degree in econometrics - the application of statistical methods to economic data - from Sheffield University before joining the High Street betting firm, run by her father. She identified the potential of online gambling in 2000 and invested in the domain name Bet365.com so that she could drive the family business in that direction. Bet365 made a profit before tax of Â£791m in the year, compared with Â£661m the year before. The firm paid dividends of Â£92.5m, half of which are thought to have gone to Ms Coates, as the owner of about half of Bet365's shares. The group of firms owns Stoke City Football Club, which made a loss of Â£8.7m in the year. The High Pay Centre, a think tank which monitors income, said the timing of the release of the Bet365 results looked ""cynical"", given it was just after a general election. High Pay Centre executive director Luke Hildyard said: ""This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues."" He added: ""Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people."" Mr Hildyard said there was ""clearly scope"" for those accumulating such sums to pay their workers more or contribute more in taxes. In October, Cardiff University research suggested that two-fifths of 11 to 16-year-olds had gambled in the past year. The study said this was ""particularly concerning, given that across the UK, most forms of commercial gambling are only legal for those aged 18 and over"". Fruit machines were the most popular form of gambling, followed by playing cards for money with friends and scratchcards. Dr Graham Moore of the Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement said at the time: ""The evidence shows that people who gamble earlier in life are more likely to become problem gamblers in adulthood."" However, aGambling Commission study in October,externalsuggested that 11% of children had gambled within a week of the survey being conducted. But in addition,the regulator warned in July,externalof research that indicated links between ""problem gambling and suicidal thoughts or attempts"". Bet365 says it has ""an unwavering commitment to deliver industry-leading approaches to player protection"", including monitoring customer gambling, and says it will ""terminate the [customer] relationship if it feels the risk of harm is too high"".

"Tony Blair gives his verdict on Labour's election defeat Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry is the first to formally declare her bid to be the party's next leader Sir Keir Starmer also says he is thinking about running The process of swearing in new MPs continues after the Conservative Party won last week's election On Thursday, the Queen's Speech will set out the government legislative programme Brexit bill set to come back before MPs on Friday It will include changes from earlier versions, including greater powers for UK judges to depart from EU law after Brexit Becky Morton and Victoria King We're going to end our live coverage here for the day. Thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of what's gone on... An email to staff warns that the party will have to consider its structure amid a funding reduction. Read more. An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our
pledges and promises."" Mr Johnson was greeted with table-banging and one
MP described the atmosphere inside the room as ""euphoric"". Tory MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie says the prime minister was on ""top form"". Allow Twitter content?

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson. She said at the time ofher pioneering move in 2018that she hoped it would signal a step forward in modernising Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here. Following his speech this morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has also been interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark. You can watch the full interview on BBC Two from 22:30 GMT.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

That's a marked contrast to the frosty reception Jeremy Corbyn got during a fractious meeting with his own MPs last night, where he faced strong criticism over his leadership. A little more now fromthat Spectator article,externalpenned by the prime minister. Mr Johnson wraps up the piece with some of his oft-repeated buzzwords such as a promise to ""unite and level up"" and ""unleash [the UK's] potential"". He admits the slogans ""sound trite at the end of a campaign"" but adds: ""I - we - mean them wholeheartedly... I am full of a surging confidence that we can do it. ""We have the energy, the ideas, the mandate, and we have some time; and since time is a wasting asset I want you to know that even as you munch your mince pies, we are engaged full tilt on a programme of change for the better. Merry Christmas!"" In terms of gender, race and sexuality, the group of MPs elected last Thursday are the most diverse so far, although women still lag way behind men in terms of equal representation in the House of Commons. The proportion of MPs from ethnic minorities, although growing, is also lower than that of the UK's population as a whole. Our colleagues on the BBC's Data Journalism Team have pulled together all the stats for you here - do check it out. One of the more obvious campaign metaphors saw the PM drive through a wall to denote breaking Parliament's deadlock over Brexit Boris Johnson has written the diary for the Christmas edition of the Spectator - the magazine he used to edit. You can read the whole thingon the Spectator's website,external, but here's a particularly interesting section, where the PM references some of the stranger moments of his general election campaign... ""Perhaps I should mention especially the media
team, who had to explain such mysteries as why I chose to shut myself in a
giant fridge and what exactly I was thinking when I confiscated a TV reporterâs
mobile live on air."" Here are the moments the PM is referring to, in case you need reminding: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson also extends his thanks to ""the âopsâ team"" who ""basically manage your life"". ""They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. ""In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory - to show that we could get it âwrapped upâ by Christmas (more or less). ""Some said these metaphors were clunking, but in a general election campaign, clunking is what you need."" One of the PM's final stops on the election campaign trail involved delivering milk ""to denote delivery of our domestic agenda"" The BBC's Iain Watson makes an interesting point about the use of traditional media by candidates and potential candidates in the Labour leadership race.

Following the election defeat, Labour Party staff have been warned about the implications for their jobs. An email sent to all staff says the ""reduction in Short money funding"" - the funding given to opposition parties based on how many seats and votes they have - would have an ""immediate impact"" for those employed within Jeremy Corbyn's office and political adviser roles linked to the shadow cabinet. The email, from Labour's director of HR and safeguarding, says the party will also need to look at ""the way we are structured as an organisation and the impact this will have on the
way we work in futureâ. Here's a copy of the full email: In response to the leaked email, Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, said it was ""unacceptable"" for lower paid staff to face this uncertainty while ""the architects of our defeat"" have ""protected themselves"". ""It's the sort of thing you might expect from the worst corporations, not the party of Labour,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nurses are on picket lines across Northern Ireland Strike action by 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland over pay and staffing has ended. In total, more than 20,000 people who work in the health service in Northern Ireland were involved in Wednesday's action. Nine thousand Royal College of Nursing nurses ended their 12-hour strike at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Nurses in the Unison union remained on strike until midnight, along with the majority of NIPSA members. Members of the Unite union are on strike until 06:00 on Thursday, while NIPSA ambulance workers are due to end their action at 07:00 GMT. The Health and Social Care Board said 4,749 hospital appointments were cancelled on Wednesday. Why are Northern Ireland's nurses going on strike? What services will be affected? Politicians find no easy answers to nurses' strike Paul Cummings, deputy chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said two-hourly calls were being made to each of the health trusts to assess the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, he said so far there had been ""no reported issues of patient safety"". ""Every aspect of health and social care has been affected,"" he said. ""Pressure is continuing to grow on our emergency departments, but so far our preparations [for the strike] have paid dividends."" This video can not be played 'This is unprecedented for us' Speaking at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, RCN member Nuala Murray told BBC News NI: ""This was incredibly difficult. I've been nursing for 37 years. ""This is so unprecedented for us to have to strike but nurses are so fed up, they've just had enough. ""Their patients aren't safe and they need to do something."" Many appointments and treatments have been cancelled because of the strike, and a number of minor injury units are closed. The Health and Social Care Board said all emergency departments would remain open as normal, but would be under significant pressure. Sean Smyth, whose daughter died in June, joined the picket line at Belfast City Hospital. ""I'm here to show solidarity with the fantastic health workers we have,"" he said. ""The care and support Eimear got was equally matched by the support they showed me and my family and we'll never be able to thank them. Sean Smyth said he was frustrated at the state of the health service in Northern Ireland ""Eimear was first treated in England. We have first hand experience of the nursing staff in St James's in Leeds. ""The nurses nurse in England. Here in Belfast we have seen the nurses nurse, clean, cook, do every task there is possible. And the work they do is unbelievable. ""I've witnessed what their colleagues get in England. The pay get and the conditions they work in, the staffing levels compared to ours. It is chalk and cheese, we are the poor country cousin to England, Scotland and Wales. ""Where Eimear died, it was something from the 1980s - a horrible grey room. It's a horrible environment, the facilities are poor. ""Our hospitals need major investment, our staff need major support from our politicians."" Mairead Meenan, a staff nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said the ""fair pay"" issue had brought her to the picket line. ""Everybody wants equal pay and equal rights,"" she said, adding that nurses in Northern Ireland felt ""undervalued"" compared to their counterparts doing the same jobs in Great Britain. She called on politicians to ""start talking"" and sort the dispute out. ""You get paid loads and loads of money and you would not last 10 minutes in our job,"" said Ms Meenan. One woman, whose appointment at Altnagelvin went ahead as scheduled on Wednesday morning, came out to support nurses and health workers on the picket line. She has had two operations at the hospital since May. ""I was extremely well looked after and am very appreciative of all the care I've had,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I'm also totally disgusted with Stormont and its lack of getting on with sorting out Northern Ireland. ""This wouldn't have happened if they [politicians] had thought about it properly and fought for our good health service."" On so many measures, Northern Ireland lags behind the other UK nations when it comes to NHS performance. Not only does it has the highest vacancy rates, it also has the worst record in terms of meeting waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and routine operations. The best indication of this is the figures for the proportion of patients seen in four hours in A&E. England has just seen its performance sink to a record low of just over 81%. In Northern Ireland it is currently below 66%. Why? The suspension of a devolved government has certainly not helped - delaying everything from new policy to pay rises. But modernisation of health care in Northern Ireland was already behind schedule before that happened. Services are spread too thinly across too many sites, so there is a lot of catching up to do - and the more it is delayed the longer it will take. This video can not be played 'Patient safety is compromised every single day' Health workers say they want to be paid the same as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. Pay parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ended in 2014 when the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Jim Wells was health minister. He imposed a ""degree of restraint"" on pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Wells said the decision had been ""very difficult because the choice was very stark"", explaining that another increase in pay at the time could have led to redundancies or services being closed. The issue has not been looked at again because Northern Ireland has not had a devolved government since 2017. Downing Street said the strike highlighted the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties working together to restore devolved government. The ""quickest and best"" way to resolve the dispute was to get the Stormont executive up and running again, said the Prime Minister's spokesman. He added that the Northern Ireland Department of Health had been working closely with trust chief executives, unions and staff to make sure that services were delivered safely during the strike. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent These are unprecedented times. For the first time in UK history close to 20,000 health and social care works are on picket lines, including about 15,500 nurses. With more than 300,000 people in Northern Ireland waiting for an appointment, today's strike is going to push all services over the limit. As healthcare workers protest and wave flags calling for pay parity and safer staffing levels, what they are also shouting about is a desire to get devolved government back up and running. While there is a skeleton staff today, and while many appointments have been cancelled, a shortage of staff has been an issue for many years. Paramedics join the picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The RCN argues the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The RCN estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in Northern Ireland is 13%, compared with about 11% in England and 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing.

A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board said major challenges were expected across all health and social care services on Wednesday. It also advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted, they should attend their appointment/service as normal. All emergency departments remain open. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first,"" said the spokesperson. ""Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods."" The heads of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts have statedthe current crisis in the service has been ""years in the making"". Are you a patient who will be affected by the strike?

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""Election result brought shame on us"" Labour ""pursued a path of almost comic indecision"" over Brexit during the election and ""alienated both sides of the debate"", Tony Blair has said. In a speech in London, the ex-PM said he believed the party could have kept much of the vote in traditional Labour areas under a different leadership. The situation was ""made impossible by failure to take a clear position and to stick to it"", Mr Blair said. ""The result has brought shame on us. We let our country down,"" he added. In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Blair said ""the Labour Party, by its self-indulgence - and that's what it was in the end - was the effective handmaiden of Brexit. ""It's not our fault, because the fault is with those who advocated it - but our combination of misguided ideology and utter incompetence allowed it to happen."" Labour staff told they could lose their jobs Thornberry enters leadership race Who will be Labour's next leader? Jeremy Corbyn told MPs on Tuesday that he ""took responsibility"" for Labour's worst electoral performance, in terms of seats won, since 1935. And some of his supporters within the party, including shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, have called Mr Blair's comments an ""oversimplification"" and said Mr Corbyn should not be blamed for the loss. Labour's leader in Wales, and First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said there was ""nothing wrong"" with the party's ""basic message"" and it just had to be ""retuned"" in five years' time. Mr Corbyn has said he will stand down as Labour leader ""early next year"". But he was criticised to his face by some Labour colleagues, with former MP Mary Creagh saying the lack of a personal apology showed he was a ""man without honour and without shame"". Meanwhile, Emily Thornberry has become the first MP to officially put herself forward to replace Mr Corbyn as Labour leader. In an article for the Guardian,external, she said she has already ""pummelled"" Boris Johnson across the despatch box and said she would be able to exploit the prime minister's failings. This video can not be played Mary Creagh on Jeremy Corbyn: ""He should be apologising"" In his speech, ex-Labour leader Mr Blair - a longstanding critic of the party's move to the left under Mr Corbyn - said: ""I believe with different leadership we would have kept much of our vote in traditional Labour areas. ""Instead, we pursued a path of almost comic indecision - alienated both sides of the debate."" And he said the party should never have fallen into the ""Elephant trap"" of agreeing to a ""Brexit election"" without a clear position on Brexit and with a leader who had a ""net approval rating of minus 40%"". Mr Blair knows his intervention will probably be dismissed by many in the Labour Party, and he will be reviled by Corbynites. But what, I think, he is trying to do is open a genuine debate, in the aftermath of  Labour's worst defeat since 1935. His analysis is the scale of the defeat now threatens the very future and survival of the Labour Party - that under Mr Corbyn it has travelled so far from electability that if it carries on on that trajectory it will never be returned to government and it will be replaced by another force, another party. So his analysis is a pretty stark one: Either the party claws back from the Corbyn agenda - or it's over. Labour fought the 2017 general election on a platform of leaving the EU. But it switched to backing another referendum, under pressure from its members and senior figures in the shadow cabinet. During this year's election campaign, Mr Corbyn said he wanted renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU and then put it to a public vote, with the option of remaining in the EU. But he said he would not take sides during the referendum campaign, and would act instead as an ""honest broker"" who could unite the Leave and Remain factions. Thornberry 'warned Labour over Brexit neutrality' Why Blyth Valley changed its mind Can Tories deepen shallow roots? Mr Blair said ""it would have been better"" if Mr Corbyn had just said he was pro-Brexit, in line with his longstanding Euroscepticism. ""When things are really tough in politics, you might as well do what you believe in, because at least you'll be more convincing defending it,"" he said. Mr Blair insisted his criticism of Mr Corbyn as leader was not an attack on him ""as a person"". But he added: ""People saw him as fundamentally opposing what Britain and Western countries stand for."" Mr Corbyn personified ""a brand of quasi-revolutionary socialism - mixing far-left economic policy with deep hostility to Western foreign policy"" - and that this combination ""never has and never will"" appeal to traditional Labour voters, he argued. And the far-left ""protest movement"" which was born out of Mr Corbyn's leadership was supported by ""cult trimmings"" and was ""utterly incapable"" of being voted in as a ""credible government"". Turning to allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Blair said: ""The failure to deal with it is a matter of disgust that left some of us who voted Labour feeling for the first time in our lives conflicted about doing it."" He also hit back at Mr Corbyn's claim that Labour's policies were popular, arguing that individual policies, such as renationalising the railways, may have been popular but taken together, the party's manifesto was a ""100-page wish list"". ""Any fool can promise everything for free - but the people weren't fooled,"" he added. Mr Blair, won three general elections in a row between 1997 and 2005, said Labour's challenge was to become a ""modern progressive coalition"" with the ability to win and hold power or admit it had ""exhausted its original mission"". He did not support the idea that the next Labour leader had to be a woman or come from outside London, as some in the party have suggested. ""What (the public) want is someone who is going to govern the country with a creditable programme,"" he told the audience. Among the Labour seats in the North of England to fall to the Conservatives was Mr Blair's former constituency Sedgefield, which he represented for 24 years, and which has not had a Tory MP since the 1930s. But Shadow Justice Secretary Mr Burgon insisted Labour's election defeat should not be blamed on Mr Corbyn. He told BBC Politics Live: ""I think it's a mistake to put everything down to a single leader or personality."" He blamed the ""the right-wing press"" for trying to ""toxify"" Mr Corbyn and said that the ""mistake"" Labour made ""was underestimating how much people wanted to get Brexit done"". Mr Burgon said Mr Blair's analysis was an ""oversimplification"", saying: ""Does he really think that Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer are 'hard left'?"" Sam Tarry, Labour's new MP for Ilford South, said:  ""It's very easy for Blair to come out with these simplistic sort of problems. ""It's under his regime that we really began to break down the trust in the electorate."" Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has told the BBC he is ""seriously considering"" standing to be the next Labour leader. He said the party had a ""mountain to climb"" following their election defeat. Reflecting on Labour's election defeat, Sir Keir - who like Mr Blair backed another EU referendum - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party had failed to ""knock back"" the Conservatives' ""get Brexit done"" slogan. Former Work and Pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said she would ""decide over Christmas"" on whether she would stand, saying the party needed to tackle anti-Semitism, restore ""kindness to our politics"" and be more ""inclusive"". Labour ended up with 59 fewer MPs than two years ago. Its share of the vote, at 32.2%, was higher than in either its 2010 or 2015 defeats, it was a long way from the 41.9% it secured under Mr Corbyn in 2017. Other candidates believed to be considering running to be Labour leader include: Tottenham MP and ex-Business Minister David Lammy MP for Norwich South and ex-shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis MP for Birmingham Yardley Jess Phillips Wigan MP and former shadow environment secretary Lisa Nandy Who will be Labour's next leader?

"The number of cod which can be legally caught by the UK's fishermen will be halved next year. It was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday at Brussels talks on fishing quotas for 2020. Prior to those discussions, representatives of Scottish trawlermen agreed to a 50% reduction in the cod catch in an effort to preserve stocks. The UK government said that in order to protect the future of the industry it had to fish sustainably. Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said: ""The reduction in the total allowable catch for North Sea cod will have a serious economic impact on the Scottish white fish sector next year, and will present major practical difficulties for the fleet. ""We welcome the commitment to review and update the stock assessment model for North Sea cod, reflecting the changing distribution of cod in the North Sea, most likely as a result of climate change."" Regulation of the fishing industry will be controlled by the UK after Brexit Fisheries Secretary Fergus Ewing, who was at the talks in Brussels, added: ""With Brexit about to happen it has been clear the EU is already prioritising other members over the state about to walk away. ""That is perhaps unsurprising, but coupled with the challenging scientific advice, it has made this a difficult two days."" Britain is preparing to leave the Common Fisheries Policy regime as a result of Brexit. Reality Check: How would Brexit affect the UK's fishing waters? UK to withdraw from international fishing arrangement Brexit fishing industry plans outlined by government Mike Park of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association (SWFPA) said the next year would be ""extremely challenging"". Speaking on the BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: ""It's a stock that's quite prolific in the northern North Sea. ""There's been significant changes over the whole of the North Sea but essentially next year that will cause the fleet problems which is now our focus to try and resolve that. ""In the next year, as the UK prepares to leave the Common Fisheries Policy, it is vital that the right scientific work is done to improve our understanding of the current status of the stock to enable better decisions to be taken on fishing opportunities for 2021."" Speaking after the talks concluded, UK fisheries minister George Eustice said: ""This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the North East Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks. ""I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of bycatch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban. ""However, we also know that to protect the profitability of fisheries in the future, we must fish sustainably today."" The talks have resulted in small increases in the allowable catches for North Sea ling and skate, as well as the relaxation of some proposed control and management measures Last year, the UK government set out its plans for the future of fishing after Brexit. It said devolved nations would have a say in setting annual quotas for third countries, but the environment secretary's decision was final. It intends to move to a system of quota management which it believes will guarantee a fairer share of the fish in UK waters for UK registered boats. The rules of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy will continue to apply until December 2020. Mr Eustice claimed some of the challenges faced by the UK fishing industry had resulted from EU rules. He said: ""Some of the problems have been exacerbated by the fact that the EU's outdated method for sharing quota between member states means that the UK gets a very small share of the cod in our own waters."" Marine sustainability group Open Seas said in a statement: ""Devastatingly this decision commits to yet more overfishing in the coming year. Quota for North Sea cod has been set roughly 30% above scientific advice."" Open Seas said the agreements represented ""bad decisions for the health of our sea, bad debts that will be owed by future generations, and fail legal pledges to end overfishing"". What difference will this make to prices on the street? Cod is a traditional fish and chips favourite in England, with battered haddock more popular in Scotland Industry sources say it is actually very hard - almost impossible in fact - to tell what impact the quotas will have on prices on the street. With takeaway fish and chips for example, cod is more popular in England - whereas haddock is the staple of the fish supper in Scotland. With the haddock quota up, in theory it could mean that with more haddock then prices would be a bit lower, and with less cod prices could be a slightly higher.

"Neville Herron estimates he has paid an extra Â£32,000 Mortgage borrowers ""unfairly trapped"" on high interest rates when their lenders were nationalised are launching legal action against the companies they say are responsible. Some 150,000 homeowners are said to have been overcharged for years, unable to switch to a cheaper deal after their mortgages were transferred. One man who says he paid an extra Â£32,000 said it was a ""disgrace"". The Treasury said it was working to ""remove barriers"" to cheaper deals. The group legal action, brought by the UK Mortgage Prisoner Action Group, is now looking to claim repayment of the extra interest. Many of those affected - usually having taken out mortgages in the late 2000s with Northern Rock or Bradford & Bingley - have been paying more than 5% interest on their mortgages for the past 12 years. In some cases, this amounts to more than double the cost of the best rates available on the market. Northern Rock was nationalised during the financial crisis Neville Herron took out a Northern Rock loan in 2003 to pay for his bungalow in Lancashire. After the bank was taken into public ownership following the financial crash, his mortgage was transferred to Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM), owned by UK Asset Resolution. But when his existing mortgage deal came to an end, he was not offered a new fixed-rate mortgage - and so had to pay standard variable interest rates. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the extra cost amounted to ""well over"" Â£32,000. ""It's placed a great strain on our marriage,"" he said. ""We didn't have a holiday for five or six years."" Mr Herron said the mortgage repayments for the home had put strain on his marriage Mr Herron wanted to switch mortgage lender for a cheaper loan. But because it looked like his loan was in negative equity, he failed the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority's, strict affordability criteria - and was unable to do so. ""We were on something like six or 7% interest, which was a lot more than other people were on,"" he said. ""I was having to do two jobs, getting home late at night, working really hard."" Mr Herron's mortgage was later sold by NRAM to Whistletree, owned by TSB Bank, which did offer him a new deal - but Mr Herron said it had saved him only Â£40 a month. TSB said it was ""fully committed"" to supporting Whistletree customers. A spokesman said: ""Since purchasing the portfolio from UKAR, we have developed the capability for customers to switch to a new product and we are constantly looking for other ways to improve this service."" The action group legal action is being taken against numerous companies. Damon Parker, from law firm Harcus Parker, which is bringing the legal action on behalf of the UK Mortgage Prisoner Action Group, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme mortgage companies had a ""duty"" to offer customers a ""fair rate"". ""And we say that our clients have been unfairly treated because they're paying too much... at a time when every other mortgage customer is paying unprecedented low rates."" ""It's not fair to charge people just because they're collateral damage caught up in a nationalisation. ""Some people have got into terrible financial situations. Some people have been repossessed."" In March, the Financial Conduct Authorityproposed loosening its affordability checksfor those affected, saying it would ""make it easier for customers to get a more affordable mortgage"". But banks and building societies would still need to agree to take on these customers. The Treasury said in a statement it had ""worked with the Financial Conduct Authority to introduce new rules that remove barriers preventing some customers from accessing cheaper deals and continue to work on this matter"".

"Tony Blair gives his verdict on Labour's election defeat Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry is the first to formally declare her bid to be the party's next leader Sir Keir Starmer also says he is thinking about running The process of swearing in new MPs continues after the Conservative Party won last week's election On Thursday, the Queen's Speech will set out the government legislative programme Brexit bill set to come back before MPs on Friday It will include changes from earlier versions, including greater powers for UK judges to depart from EU law after Brexit Becky Morton and Victoria King We're going to end our live coverage here for the day. Thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of what's gone on... An email to staff warns that the party will have to consider its structure amid a funding reduction. Read more. An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our
pledges and promises."" Mr Johnson was greeted with table-banging and one
MP described the atmosphere inside the room as ""euphoric"". Tory MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie says the prime minister was on ""top form"". Allow Twitter content?

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson. She said at the time ofher pioneering move in 2018that she hoped it would signal a step forward in modernising Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here. Following his speech this morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has also been interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark. You can watch the full interview on BBC Two from 22:30 GMT.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

That's a marked contrast to the frosty reception Jeremy Corbyn got during a fractious meeting with his own MPs last night, where he faced strong criticism over his leadership. A little more now fromthat Spectator article,externalpenned by the prime minister. Mr Johnson wraps up the piece with some of his oft-repeated buzzwords such as a promise to ""unite and level up"" and ""unleash [the UK's] potential"". He admits the slogans ""sound trite at the end of a campaign"" but adds: ""I - we - mean them wholeheartedly... I am full of a surging confidence that we can do it. ""We have the energy, the ideas, the mandate, and we have some time; and since time is a wasting asset I want you to know that even as you munch your mince pies, we are engaged full tilt on a programme of change for the better. Merry Christmas!"" In terms of gender, race and sexuality, the group of MPs elected last Thursday are the most diverse so far, although women still lag way behind men in terms of equal representation in the House of Commons. The proportion of MPs from ethnic minorities, although growing, is also lower than that of the UK's population as a whole. Our colleagues on the BBC's Data Journalism Team have pulled together all the stats for you here - do check it out. One of the more obvious campaign metaphors saw the PM drive through a wall to denote breaking Parliament's deadlock over Brexit Boris Johnson has written the diary for the Christmas edition of the Spectator - the magazine he used to edit. You can read the whole thingon the Spectator's website,external, but here's a particularly interesting section, where the PM references some of the stranger moments of his general election campaign... ""Perhaps I should mention especially the media
team, who had to explain such mysteries as why I chose to shut myself in a
giant fridge and what exactly I was thinking when I confiscated a TV reporterâs
mobile live on air."" Here are the moments the PM is referring to, in case you need reminding: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson also extends his thanks to ""the âopsâ team"" who ""basically manage your life"". ""They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. ""In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory - to show that we could get it âwrapped upâ by Christmas (more or less). ""Some said these metaphors were clunking, but in a general election campaign, clunking is what you need."" One of the PM's final stops on the election campaign trail involved delivering milk ""to denote delivery of our domestic agenda"" The BBC's Iain Watson makes an interesting point about the use of traditional media by candidates and potential candidates in the Labour leadership race.

Following the election defeat, Labour Party staff have been warned about the implications for their jobs. An email sent to all staff says the ""reduction in Short money funding"" - the funding given to opposition parties based on how many seats and votes they have - would have an ""immediate impact"" for those employed within Jeremy Corbyn's office and political adviser roles linked to the shadow cabinet. The email, from Labour's director of HR and safeguarding, says the party will also need to look at ""the way we are structured as an organisation and the impact this will have on the
way we work in futureâ. Here's a copy of the full email: In response to the leaked email, Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, said it was ""unacceptable"" for lower paid staff to face this uncertainty while ""the architects of our defeat"" have ""protected themselves"". ""It's the sort of thing you might expect from the worst corporations, not the party of Labour,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson visited the North East the day after his election victory It is a phrase that has been repeated many times to me during two decades of reporting politics in the North East - the Tories can't win here. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it again when he came to County Durham on the eve of the 2019 campaign. He was wrong. The Conservatives took seven Labour seats, and had it not been for the Brexit Party complicating the picture, they might have taken more. There are now 10 Tory MPs in the region - the most since 1935. This was the North's version of what happened in the south of England during Labour's 1997 win. The nerves and excitement of an MP's first day New ministers named as Johnson cabinet takes shape Ten names to keep an eye on in Parliament Candidates who had never expected to triumph have suddenly found themselves with a new career. Take Jacob Young, the 26-year-old who turned Labour's supposedly safe Redcar seat blue. He has handed in his notice in at the Teesside chemical plant where he works, but will still be working a Christmas Day shift he had been rostered to do. And these 2019 generation Tories do feel different. Many are rooted in their communities, with northern heritage and a local outlook. Yes, there's a lawyer, but also an NHS worker. That sense people were voting for candidates who cared about where they lived certainly helped win the apparently unwinnable. Then there was the context of this election. Tory and Labour candidates told me the prime minister's ""get Brexit done"" mantra was parroted back to them by voter after voter. Those who wanted out of the European Union were always unlikely to back Labour, but they were also joined by those weary of the debate. Then there was the Labour leader. Their candidates said if they managed to get past the hostility on Brexit, they hit a brick wall when it came to Jeremy Corbyn. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did not go down well on the doorstep Many of the new Conservative converts came from working class areas. Places loyal to Labour, but even more committed to their country. The North East has always been a rich source for army recruitment. There are many families with military connections. For them, Mr Corbyn was just not patriotic enough to lead. The charge that he sided too often with the nation's enemies - fair or not - hit home. And appeals to memories of Thatcherism fell flat. Folk memory of the 1980s struggles have faded, and now Tory MPs represent ex-steel towns like Consett and former mining communities like Blyth. But was there genuine enthusiasm for Boris Johnson? I am not sure. We never really got to test out the thesis as the PM's three carefully-controlled campaign appearances kept him away from too many members of the public. So there is a sense, as the prime minister has acknowledged, that some previously-Labour voters have been prepared to lend him their votes to deliver Brexit and keep Mr Corbyn away from power. But perhaps some seeds of victory were sown a little earlier too. Although the June 2017 general election was a huge disappointment for the region's Tories, the previous month's local elections were a triumph. Their candidate, Ben Houchen, pulled off the biggest shock becoming the first Tees Valley Mayor - an election Labour expected to win. He has proved adept at getting into the local media, but he has also honoured campaign pledges his rivals said were unachievable. And some of those pledges do not feel very traditionally Tory. Mr Houchen bought the local airport to try and arrest its apparent terminal decline under a private sector owner. There are early signs of revival under public ownership. He has called for intervention to save the area's steel industry, and demanded contracts for local trains to go to County Durham-based Hitachi. The election results were front page news These are not the actions of a Conservative prepared to entirely trust the market. But it also means he has looked and sounded like a champion for the area. In the same election, the Conservatives defeated Labour to take control of Northumberland Council. Their regime may have made fewer headlines than Mayor Houchen, but so far it has exuded an air of quiet competence. Both regimes may well have helped detoxify the Conservative brand in the North East. Maybe it's no coincidence then that Blyth Valley in Northumberland, and constituencies in and close to Tees Valley, were prepared to vote Conservative. In contrast, many of the Labour councils have had to oversee nine years of cuts in their communities. But instead of pinning the blame on government-imposed austerity, some voters seem to have started asking whether they are getting a good deal out of generations of loyalty to Labour. So in this year's local elections, Labour lost control of councils like Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Darlington. Now the Conservatives may be sensing an opportunity to colonise Labour's heartland. Last week's results have left even more seats teetering on the brink. Small majorities the Conservatives could conquer in 2024. And empires do end. You only have to look over the border into Scotland to see how lost ground for Labour can become a wipe out. The prime minister then is already talking about big investment in the north - the warm words of the Northern Powerhouse turned into action. But promises must be delivered to make borrowed votes permanent, and any infrastructure investment takes time. And then there is getting Brexit done. Every economic study suggests the North East and its export-led economy has the most at stake. The likes of Nissan cannot wait years for trade deals, and they cannot afford delays of a few minutes for parts to clear ports. A Brexit that costs jobs, and reduces the ability to invest in the North East's public services, could see Labour bounce back. The Conservative roots remain shallow in the North East. The PM and his new band of MPs will need to dig in hard and make rhetoric real to make them permanent.

"Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Labour leadership takes blame over election result Corbyn 'sorry' over Labour's heavy election defeat The Labour leader's closest allies are now busy making the case that Corbynism must survive Corbyn. When I spoke to his former chief cheerleader Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the giant trade union Unite, he told me the fudged message on Brexit - which he attributed, by the way, to Remainers not Leavers, and to the way Mr Corbyn had allowed himself to be pushed into promising a second referendum - had cost votes. The party leadership had been tainted by it. But the radical left-wing policies had been ""popular"" and need not change. Mr Corbyn himself arguedin an article in the Observer newspaper,externalthat he was ""proud we won the arguments"", which begs the obvious question: if this election showed Labour had won the arguments, what would losing the arguments have looked like? Mr McCluskey told me on my BBC Radio 5 Live programme Pienaar's Politics: ""All of Labour's policies were extremely popular. The problem is that, yes, when they were put together, there was a question of credulity - could Labour really deliver all of this. ""As regards Jeremy, yes, there's no doubt that it became an issue on the doorstep because of course, for the last four years, every single day, he has been attacked massively in a way that no politicians have by the media. ""The media, especially the right-wing media, wanted the election to be about Brexit. If I have to say this a thousand timesâ¦ Brexit was the reason for this defeat."" Meanwhile, Labour comrades, including freshly defeated former MPs, say Labour pushed policies on tax, spending and public ownership that some found implausible. Caroline Flint, ejected by the voters of Don Valley, told Sky News the answer could not be ""Corbyn without a beard"". For good measure, Ms Flint landed her Labour Remainer colleague and likely leadership contender, Emily Thornberry, in it knee-deep. She said the shadow foreign secretary had told a fellow MP she was ""glad my constituents aren't as stupid as yours."" Ms Thornberry has since dismissed the anecdote as a ""complete and utter lie"", and has instructed solicitors over the comments. Just as well. Otherwise her prospects in the leadership race might easily have grown as dim as she now denies characterising Leave voters. Caroline Flint took on Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry on Sunday morning So who will run? Rebecca Long-Bailey was the first name Mr McCluskey mentioned when I asked him to state his preference. The Corbynista shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has said he'd like to be elected her deputy. It's not clear though that she's keen to run, let alone, one imagines, play the role of Labour's bridge-across-the-barbed-wire. Lisa Nandy hasn't, at the time of writing, declared her candidacy, but she surely will - having told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""seriously thinking about it"". So will Sir Keir Starmer, the great hope of many pro-European centrists. It was telling that John McDonnell told Marr it was time for a ""non-London MP"" to become leader, which appeared to rule out Sir Keir and Ms Thornberry, at least in his view. The shadow chancellor also told Marr: ""If anyone's to blame, it's me. Full stop."" That sounded big of him. Except, of course, that he gave up on his own hopes of becoming leader some time ago, and still means to have some influence in installing the next one. As for Jess Phillips, the combative, charismatic wild card in the race when she joins it, Mr McDonnell volunteered that he would ""prefer someone elseâ¦ someone who actually has been really solidly involved in the development of our existing policy"". He wasn't, of course, sticking around with the aim of helping to install a suitable successor. ""We're not into that sort of conniving politics of the past,"" he said, which will reassure those who want a change of political direction. Unless it doesn't.

"Tony Blair gives his verdict on Labour's election defeat Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry is the first to formally declare her bid to be the party's next leader Sir Keir Starmer also says he is thinking about running The process of swearing in new MPs continues after the Conservative Party won last week's election On Thursday, the Queen's Speech will set out the government legislative programme Brexit bill set to come back before MPs on Friday It will include changes from earlier versions, including greater powers for UK judges to depart from EU law after Brexit Becky Morton and Victoria King We're going to end our live coverage here for the day. Thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of what's gone on... An email to staff warns that the party will have to consider its structure amid a funding reduction. Read more. An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our
pledges and promises."" Mr Johnson was greeted with table-banging and one
MP described the atmosphere inside the room as ""euphoric"". Tory MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie says the prime minister was on ""top form"". Allow Twitter content?

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson. She said at the time ofher pioneering move in 2018that she hoped it would signal a step forward in modernising Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here. Following his speech this morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has also been interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark. You can watch the full interview on BBC Two from 22:30 GMT.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

That's a marked contrast to the frosty reception Jeremy Corbyn got during a fractious meeting with his own MPs last night, where he faced strong criticism over his leadership. A little more now fromthat Spectator article,externalpenned by the prime minister. Mr Johnson wraps up the piece with some of his oft-repeated buzzwords such as a promise to ""unite and level up"" and ""unleash [the UK's] potential"". He admits the slogans ""sound trite at the end of a campaign"" but adds: ""I - we - mean them wholeheartedly... I am full of a surging confidence that we can do it. ""We have the energy, the ideas, the mandate, and we have some time; and since time is a wasting asset I want you to know that even as you munch your mince pies, we are engaged full tilt on a programme of change for the better. Merry Christmas!"" In terms of gender, race and sexuality, the group of MPs elected last Thursday are the most diverse so far, although women still lag way behind men in terms of equal representation in the House of Commons. The proportion of MPs from ethnic minorities, although growing, is also lower than that of the UK's population as a whole. Our colleagues on the BBC's Data Journalism Team have pulled together all the stats for you here - do check it out. One of the more obvious campaign metaphors saw the PM drive through a wall to denote breaking Parliament's deadlock over Brexit Boris Johnson has written the diary for the Christmas edition of the Spectator - the magazine he used to edit. You can read the whole thingon the Spectator's website,external, but here's a particularly interesting section, where the PM references some of the stranger moments of his general election campaign... ""Perhaps I should mention especially the media
team, who had to explain such mysteries as why I chose to shut myself in a
giant fridge and what exactly I was thinking when I confiscated a TV reporterâs
mobile live on air."" Here are the moments the PM is referring to, in case you need reminding: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson also extends his thanks to ""the âopsâ team"" who ""basically manage your life"". ""They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. ""In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory - to show that we could get it âwrapped upâ by Christmas (more or less). ""Some said these metaphors were clunking, but in a general election campaign, clunking is what you need.""

Following the election defeat, Labour Party staff have been warned about the implications for their jobs. An email sent to all staff says the ""reduction in Short money funding"" - the funding given to opposition parties based on how many seats and votes they have - would have an ""immediate impact"" for those employed within Jeremy Corbyn's office and political adviser roles linked to the shadow cabinet. The email, from Labour's director of HR and safeguarding, says the party will also need to look at ""the way we are structured as an organisation and the impact this will have on the
way we work in futureâ. Here's a copy of the full email: In response to the leaked email, Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, said it was ""unacceptable"" for lower paid staff to face this uncertainty while ""the architects of our defeat"" have ""protected themselves"". ""It's the sort of thing you might expect from the worst corporations, not the party of Labour,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Neville Herron estimates he has paid an extra Â£32,000 Mortgage borrowers ""unfairly trapped"" on high interest rates when their lenders were nationalised are launching legal action against the companies they say are responsible. Some 150,000 homeowners are said to have been overcharged for years, unable to switch to a cheaper deal after their mortgages were transferred. One man who says he paid an extra Â£32,000 said it was a ""disgrace"". The Treasury said it was working to ""remove barriers"" to cheaper deals. The group legal action, brought by the UK Mortgage Prisoner Action Group, is now looking to claim repayment of the extra interest. Many of those affected - usually having taken out mortgages in the late 2000s with Northern Rock or Bradford & Bingley - have been paying more than 5% interest on their mortgages for the past 12 years. In some cases, this amounts to more than double the cost of the best rates available on the market. Northern Rock was nationalised during the financial crisis Neville Herron took out a Northern Rock loan in 2003 to pay for his bungalow in Lancashire. After the bank was taken into public ownership following the financial crash, his mortgage was transferred to Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM), owned by UK Asset Resolution. But when his existing mortgage deal came to an end, he was not offered a new fixed-rate mortgage - and so had to pay standard variable interest rates. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the extra cost amounted to ""well over"" Â£32,000. ""It's placed a great strain on our marriage,"" he said. ""We didn't have a holiday for five or six years."" Mr Herron said the mortgage repayments for the home had put strain on his marriage Mr Herron wanted to switch mortgage lender for a cheaper loan. But because it looked like his loan was in negative equity, he failed the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority's, strict affordability criteria - and was unable to do so. ""We were on something like six or 7% interest, which was a lot more than other people were on,"" he said. ""I was having to do two jobs, getting home late at night, working really hard."" Mr Herron's mortgage was later sold by NRAM to Whistletree, owned by TSB Bank, which did offer him a new deal - but Mr Herron said it had saved him only Â£40 a month. TSB said it was ""fully committed"" to supporting Whistletree customers.

"Nurses are on picket lines across Northern Ireland Strike action by 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland over pay and staffing has ended. In total, more than 20,000 people who work in the health service in Northern Ireland were involved in Wednesday's action. Nine thousand Royal College of Nursing nurses ended their 12-hour strike at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Nurses in the Unison union remained on strike until midnight, along with the majority of NIPSA members. Members of the Unite union are on strike until 06:00 on Thursday, while NIPSA ambulance workers are due to end their action at 07:00 GMT. The Health and Social Care Board said 4,749 hospital appointments were cancelled on Wednesday. Why are Northern Ireland's nurses going on strike? What services will be affected? Politicians find no easy answers to nurses' strike Paul Cummings, deputy chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said two-hourly calls were being made to each of the health trusts to assess the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, he said so far there had been ""no reported issues of patient safety"". ""Every aspect of health and social care has been affected,"" he said. ""Pressure is continuing to grow on our emergency departments, but so far our preparations [for the strike] have paid dividends."" This video can not be played 'This is unprecedented for us' Speaking at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, RCN member Nuala Murray told BBC News NI: ""This was incredibly difficult. I've been nursing for 37 years. ""This is so unprecedented for us to have to strike but nurses are so fed up, they've just had enough. ""Their patients aren't safe and they need to do something."" Many appointments and treatments have been cancelled because of the strike, and a number of minor injury units are closed. The Health and Social Care Board said all emergency departments would remain open as normal, but would be under significant pressure. Sean Smyth, whose daughter died in June, joined the picket line at Belfast City Hospital. ""I'm here to show solidarity with the fantastic health workers we have,"" he said. ""The care and support Eimear got was equally matched by the support they showed me and my family and we'll never be able to thank them. Sean Smyth said he was frustrated at the state of the health service in Northern Ireland ""Eimear was first treated in England. We have first hand experience of the nursing staff in St James's in Leeds. ""The nurses nurse in England. Here in Belfast we have seen the nurses nurse, clean, cook, do every task there is possible. And the work they do is unbelievable. ""I've witnessed what their colleagues get in England. The pay get and the conditions they work in, the staffing levels compared to ours. It is chalk and cheese, we are the poor country cousin to England, Scotland and Wales. ""Where Eimear died, it was something from the 1980s - a horrible grey room. It's a horrible environment, the facilities are poor. ""Our hospitals need major investment, our staff need major support from our politicians."" Mairead Meenan, a staff nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said the ""fair pay"" issue had brought her to the picket line. ""Everybody wants equal pay and equal rights,"" she said, adding that nurses in Northern Ireland felt ""undervalued"" compared to their counterparts doing the same jobs in Great Britain. She called on politicians to ""start talking"" and sort the dispute out. ""You get paid loads and loads of money and you would not last 10 minutes in our job,"" said Ms Meenan. One woman, whose appointment at Altnagelvin went ahead as scheduled on Wednesday morning, came out to support nurses and health workers on the picket line. She has had two operations at the hospital since May. ""I was extremely well looked after and am very appreciative of all the care I've had,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I'm also totally disgusted with Stormont and its lack of getting on with sorting out Northern Ireland. ""This wouldn't have happened if they [politicians] had thought about it properly and fought for our good health service."" On so many measures, Northern Ireland lags behind the other UK nations when it comes to NHS performance. Not only does it has the highest vacancy rates, it also has the worst record in terms of meeting waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and routine operations. The best indication of this is the figures for the proportion of patients seen in four hours in A&E. England has just seen its performance sink to a record low of just over 81%. In Northern Ireland it is currently below 66%. Why? The suspension of a devolved government has certainly not helped - delaying everything from new policy to pay rises. But modernisation of health care in Northern Ireland was already behind schedule before that happened. Services are spread too thinly across too many sites, so there is a lot of catching up to do - and the more it is delayed the longer it will take. This video can not be played 'Patient safety is compromised every single day' Health workers say they want to be paid the same as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. Pay parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ended in 2014 when the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Jim Wells was health minister. He imposed a ""degree of restraint"" on pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Wells said the decision had been ""very difficult because the choice was very stark"", explaining that another increase in pay at the time could have led to redundancies or services being closed. The issue has not been looked at again because Northern Ireland has not had a devolved government since 2017. Downing Street said the strike highlighted the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties working together to restore devolved government. The ""quickest and best"" way to resolve the dispute was to get the Stormont executive up and running again, said the Prime Minister's spokesman. He added that the Northern Ireland Department of Health had been working closely with trust chief executives, unions and staff to make sure that services were delivered safely during the strike. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent These are unprecedented times. For the first time in UK history close to 20,000 health and social care works are on picket lines, including about 15,500 nurses. With more than 300,000 people in Northern Ireland waiting for an appointment, today's strike is going to push all services over the limit. As healthcare workers protest and wave flags calling for pay parity and safer staffing levels, what they are also shouting about is a desire to get devolved government back up and running. While there is a skeleton staff today, and while many appointments have been cancelled, a shortage of staff has been an issue for many years. Paramedics join the picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The RCN argues the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The RCN estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in Northern Ireland is 13%, compared with about 11% in England and 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing.

A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board said major challenges were expected across all health and social care services on Wednesday. It also advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted, they should attend their appointment/service as normal. All emergency departments remain open. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first,"" said the spokesperson. ""Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods."" The heads of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts have statedthe current crisis in the service has been ""years in the making"". Are you a patient who will be affected by the strike?

"Neville Herron estimates he has paid an extra Â£32,000 Mortgage borrowers ""unfairly trapped"" on high interest rates when their lenders were nationalised are launching legal action against the companies they say are responsible. Some 150,000 homeowners are said to have been overcharged for years, unable to switch to a cheaper deal after their mortgages were transferred. One man who says he paid an extra Â£32,000 said it was a ""disgrace"". The Treasury said it was working to ""remove barriers"" to cheaper deals. The group legal action, brought by the UK Mortgage Prisoner Action Group, is now looking to claim repayment of the extra interest. Many of those affected - usually having taken out mortgages in the late 2000s with Northern Rock or Bradford & Bingley - have been paying more than 5% interest on their mortgages for the past 12 years. In some cases, this amounts to more than double the cost of the best rates available on the market. Northern Rock was nationalised during the financial crisis Neville Herron took out a Northern Rock loan in 2003 to pay for his bungalow in Lancashire. After the bank was taken into public ownership following the financial crash, his mortgage was transferred to Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM), owned by UK Asset Resolution. But when his existing mortgage deal came to an end, he was not offered a new fixed-rate mortgage - and so had to pay standard variable interest rates. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the extra cost amounted to ""well over"" Â£32,000. ""It's placed a great strain on our marriage,"" he said. ""We didn't have a holiday for five or six years."" Mr Herron said the mortgage repayments for the home had put strain on his marriage Mr Herron wanted to switch mortgage lender for a cheaper loan. But because it looked like his loan was in negative equity, he failed the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority's, strict affordability criteria - and was unable to do so. ""We were on something like six or 7% interest, which was a lot more than other people were on,"" he said. ""I was having to do two jobs, getting home late at night, working really hard."" Mr Herron's mortgage was later sold by NRAM to Whistletree, owned by TSB Bank, which did offer him a new deal - but Mr Herron said it had saved him only Â£40 a month. TSB said it was ""fully committed"" to supporting Whistletree customers. A spokesman said: ""Since purchasing the portfolio from UKAR, we have developed the capability for customers to switch to a new product and we are constantly looking for other ways to improve this service."" The action group legal action is being taken against numerous companies. Damon Parker, from law firm Harcus Parker, which is bringing the legal action on behalf of the UK Mortgage Prisoner Action Group, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme mortgage companies had a ""duty"" to offer customers a ""fair rate"".

An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our
pledges and promises."" Mr Johnson was greeted with table-banging and one
MP described the atmosphere inside the room as ""euphoric"". Tory MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie says the prime minister was on ""top form"". Allow Twitter content?

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson. She said at the time ofher pioneering move in 2018that she hoped it would signal a step forward in modernising Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

That's a marked contrast to the frosty reception Jeremy Corbyn got during a fractious meeting with his own MPs last night, where he faced strong criticism over his leadership. A little more now fromthat Spectator article,externalpenned by the prime minister. Mr Johnson wraps up the piece with some of his oft-repeated buzzwords such as a promise to ""unite and level up"" and ""unleash [the UK's] potential"". He admits the slogans ""sound trite at the end of a campaign"" but adds: ""I - we - mean them wholeheartedly... I am full of a surging confidence that we can do it. ""We have the energy, the ideas, the mandate, and we have some time; and since time is a wasting asset I want you to know that even as you munch your mince pies, we are engaged full tilt on a programme of change for the better. Merry Christmas!"" In terms of gender, race and sexuality, the group of MPs elected last Thursday are the most diverse so far, although women still lag way behind men in terms of equal representation in the House of Commons. The proportion of MPs from ethnic minorities, although growing, is also lower than that of the UK's population as a whole. Our colleagues on the BBC's Data Journalism Team have pulled together all the stats for you here - do check it out. One of the more obvious campaign metaphors saw the PM drive through a wall to denote breaking Parliament's deadlock over Brexit Boris Johnson has written the diary for the Christmas edition of the Spectator - the magazine he used to edit. You can read the whole thingon the Spectator's website,external, but here's a particularly interesting section, where the PM references some of the stranger moments of his general election campaign... ""Perhaps I should mention especially the media
team, who had to explain such mysteries as why I chose to shut myself in a
giant fridge and what exactly I was thinking when I confiscated a TV reporterâs
mobile live on air."" Here are the moments the PM is referring to, in case you need reminding: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson also extends his thanks to ""the âopsâ team"" who ""basically manage your life"". ""They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. ""In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory - to show that we could get it âwrapped upâ by Christmas (more or less). ""Some said these metaphors were clunking, but in a general election campaign, clunking is what you need."" One of the PM's final stops on the election campaign trail involved delivering milk ""to denote delivery of our domestic agenda"" The BBC's Iain Watson makes an interesting point about the use of traditional media by candidates and potential candidates in the Labour leadership race.

Following the election defeat, Labour Party staff have been warned about the implications for their jobs. An email sent to all staff says the ""reduction in Short money funding"" - the funding given to opposition parties based on how many seats and votes they have - would have an ""immediate impact"" for those employed within Jeremy Corbyn's office and political adviser roles linked to the shadow cabinet. The email, from Labour's director of HR and safeguarding, says the party will also need to look at ""the way we are structured as an organisation and the impact this will have on the
way we work in futureâ. Here's a copy of the full email: In response to the leaked email, Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, said it was ""unacceptable"" for lower paid staff to face this uncertainty while ""the architects of our defeat"" have ""protected themselves"".

An SDLP MP has raised a ""respectful protest"" about the requirement for MPs to
pledge allegiance to the Queen during the swearing in ceremony. Claire Hanna wrote to Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to express her concerns about the issue. MPs are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so. After affirming, Ms Hanna told the Commons that her allegiance was to her constituents in South Belfast ""in order to serve them"". Some SNP MPs also stressed they were making the pledge in order to serve their constituents, while the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill, Steven Bonnar, crossed his fingers during his ceremony You can't see it in the image he shared on Twitter, but video does show the moment...

Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi at the G7 summit in August Boris Johnson has been congratulated on his election victory by the Indian prime minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Narendra Modi and the PM also ""resolved to continue working closely together on issues such as trade, security and defence, and to step up our cooperation on climate change ahead of next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow"". The latter part of that statement comes after this morning's story when the UK's official climate watchdogurged Mr Johnson to get the UK back on track to tackle climate change. Earlier we told you about the warm reception Boris Johnson got as he addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs for the first time since his election victory. The PA news agency has been speaking to some of those at the meeting, with former minister Robert Halfon saying the prime minister gave a ""great speech"". ""He said we've got a lot of work to do,"" Mr Halfon reports. ""The voters, they've
lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our
pledges and promises."" Mr Johnson was greeted with table-banging and one
MP described the atmosphere inside the room as ""euphoric"". Tory MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie says the prime minister was on ""top form"". Allow Twitter content?

Welsh first minister and Labour leader Mark Drakeford has been speaking to BBC Wales about the fall-out from his party's election defeat. Labour lost six seats to the Tories in Wales, although it remained the biggest party there. Mr Drakeford denies Jeremy Corbyn's project has been discredited by the result saying: ""I think it is very important
that the next Labour leader continues to position the Labour Party as a party
that says to people that you can have a different future, that there is hope
for people."" ""Now, we
will need to refine that message and retune it in five years' time, but
that basic message [is] that the Labour Party stands for something different,
stands for something better."" However, he acknowledges that ""maybe we didn't convey it convincingly enough"". Mr Drakeford also says he believes his party's next leader should give Welsh Labour ""a greater degree of autonomy"". But he says this was not a factor in last week's election result, adding: ""The national mood and
the national swing is what determines most of what happens in Wales."" We mentioned some time ago about key MP groupings meeting for the first time since the election. Here's another - the cross-party More United group, founded in 2016 and designed to encourage less tribalism and more collaboration between politicians of different stripes. They say they want to particularly focus this Parliamentary session on ""key issues
     that Brexit has left behind"". Among the members are Labour's Rosie Duffield - who said action on climate change should be a priority - and her colleague Tulip
Siddiq, who stressed the need to do more to tackle misogyny and racism directed at those in public life. Group CEO and founder member of the Women's Equality Party Tabitha Morton added: The general election might have been fought on tribal lines, but our network offers real hope of change, encouraging cross-party collaboration, pushing back against extremism. If this kind of system was needed before, it is utterly essential today.â  Earlierwe told you about Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Ellie Reeves who had newborn plus-onesto witness them being sworn in for the new Parliamentary session. Ms Reeves has just confirmed she'll immediately go on maternity leave. Ms Creasy explained she'll be doing the same and will be covered by ""locum"" Kizzy Gardiner in her constituency office, and ""proxy"" voter Peter Kyle when it comes to making decisions in Parliament. The locum is a first for British politics, as this story explains. Ms Creasyadds,external: ""Next we have to win fight for every MP to have such cover."" The first MP to take a baby into a House of Commons debate (rather than during a vote, when it's more common) was ex-Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson. She said at the time ofher pioneering move in 2018that she hoped it would signal a step forward in modernising Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier we heard Tory MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann speak in Cornish as he was sworn in. Here is the SNP's Marion Fellows opting to say hers in the Scots language. MPs must first make their oath in English, but they can follow this with an oath in Welsh, Scottish, Gaelic or Cornish. This video can not be played Speaking of matters legal... Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent We've learned this afternoon thatthe government's Brexit bill will enable more British judges to depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court,expanding this power to courts below the Supreme Court. There is no real detail in the government's pledge - but it marks a potentially really significant development. It means that UK civil courts below the Supreme Court, for example the Court of Appeal, High Court, county courts, and tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal could depart from ECJ rulings in areas such as workers' rights. Take for instance the right to paid holidays. The ECJ has interpreted this right more generously than the UK courts: for example, on the inclusion of overtime in holiday pay, and currently its interpretation binds the UK courts. Following the 11 month transition period after Brexit, the way is open, for example, for an employer to take a case to one of the UK's lower civil courts and invite a judge to apply a more restrictive interpretation to the right to paid holidays. This would create plenty of work for lawyers, but it opens a can of worms and could affect many workers. Outgoing Supreme Court President Lady Hale has warned against politicians choosing the UK's top judges in a speech marking her retirement. You might remember Lady Haleas the judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. She - and her spider brooch - became something of a sensation. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives pledged to review the ""relationship between the government, Parliament and the courts"", leading some to fear that greater political involvement in the judiciary is coming. Lady Hale, who will officially retire from her post next month, advises against adopting a US-style approach ""whether in powers or in process of appointment"". UK Supreme Court judges are appointed on legal experts' advice, whereas in the US the President can nominate them. Read the full story here. Following his speech this morning, former prime minister Tony Blair has also been interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark. You can watch the full interview on BBC Two from 22:30 GMT.

There were 650 MPs to swear in and it looks as though we're nearly at the end. The process requires them to recite an oath of allegiance to the Crown or an affirmation - and MPs cannot take their seat, speak in debates, vote or receive a salary until they do it. They could also be fined Â£500 and have their seat declared vacant âas if they were deadâ if they attempted to do so. The same rule applies to Members of the Lords.

That's a marked contrast to the frosty reception Jeremy Corbyn got during a fractious meeting with his own MPs last night, where he faced strong criticism over his leadership. A little more now fromthat Spectator article,externalpenned by the prime minister. Mr Johnson wraps up the piece with some of his oft-repeated buzzwords such as a promise to ""unite and level up"" and ""unleash [the UK's] potential"". He admits the slogans ""sound trite at the end of a campaign"" but adds: ""I - we - mean them wholeheartedly... I am full of a surging confidence that we can do it. ""We have the energy, the ideas, the mandate, and we have some time; and since time is a wasting asset I want you to know that even as you munch your mince pies, we are engaged full tilt on a programme of change for the better. Merry Christmas!"" In terms of gender, race and sexuality, the group of MPs elected last Thursday are the most diverse so far, although women still lag way behind men in terms of equal representation in the House of Commons. The proportion of MPs from ethnic minorities, although growing, is also lower than that of the UK's population as a whole. Our colleagues on the BBC's Data Journalism Team have pulled together all the stats for you here - do check it out. One of the more obvious campaign metaphors saw the PM drive through a wall to denote breaking Parliament's deadlock over Brexit Boris Johnson has written the diary for the Christmas edition of the Spectator - the magazine he used to edit. You can read the whole thingon the Spectator's website,external, but here's a particularly interesting section, where the PM references some of the stranger moments of his general election campaign... ""Perhaps I should mention especially the media
team, who had to explain such mysteries as why I chose to shut myself in a
giant fridge and what exactly I was thinking when I confiscated a TV reporterâs
mobile live on air."" Here are the moments the PM is referring to, in case you need reminding: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson also extends his thanks to ""the âopsâ team"" who ""basically manage your life"". ""They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. ""In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory - to show that we could get it âwrapped upâ by Christmas (more or less). ""Some said these metaphors were clunking, but in a general election campaign, clunking is what you need."" One of the PM's final stops on the election campaign trail involved delivering milk ""to denote delivery of our domestic agenda"" The BBC's Iain Watson makes an interesting point about the use of traditional media by candidates and potential candidates in the Labour leadership race.

Following the election defeat, Labour Party staff have been warned about the implications for their jobs. An email sent to all staff says the ""reduction in Short money funding"" - the funding given to opposition parties based on how many seats and votes they have - would have an ""immediate impact"" for those employed within Jeremy Corbyn's office and political adviser roles linked to the shadow cabinet. The email, from Labour's director of HR and safeguarding, says the party will also need to look at ""the way we are structured as an organisation and the impact this will have on the
way we work in futureâ. Here's a copy of the full email: In response to the leaked email, Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, said it was ""unacceptable"" for lower paid staff to face this uncertainty while ""the architects of our defeat"" have ""protected themselves"".

"Nurses are on picket lines across Northern Ireland Strike action by 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland over pay and staffing has ended. In total, more than 20,000 people who work in the health service in Northern Ireland were involved in Wednesday's action. Nine thousand Royal College of Nursing nurses ended their 12-hour strike at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Nurses in the Unison union remained on strike until midnight, along with the majority of NIPSA members. Members of the Unite union are on strike until 06:00 on Thursday, while NIPSA ambulance workers are due to end their action at 07:00 GMT. The Health and Social Care Board said 4,749 hospital appointments were cancelled on Wednesday. Why are Northern Ireland's nurses going on strike? What services will be affected? Politicians find no easy answers to nurses' strike Paul Cummings, deputy chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said two-hourly calls were being made to each of the health trusts to assess the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, he said so far there had been ""no reported issues of patient safety"". ""Every aspect of health and social care has been affected,"" he said. ""Pressure is continuing to grow on our emergency departments, but so far our preparations [for the strike] have paid dividends."" This video can not be played 'This is unprecedented for us' Speaking at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, RCN member Nuala Murray told BBC News NI: ""This was incredibly difficult. I've been nursing for 37 years. ""This is so unprecedented for us to have to strike but nurses are so fed up, they've just had enough. ""Their patients aren't safe and they need to do something."" Many appointments and treatments have been cancelled because of the strike, and a number of minor injury units are closed. The Health and Social Care Board said all emergency departments would remain open as normal, but would be under significant pressure. Sean Smyth, whose daughter died in June, joined the picket line at Belfast City Hospital. ""I'm here to show solidarity with the fantastic health workers we have,"" he said. ""The care and support Eimear got was equally matched by the support they showed me and my family and we'll never be able to thank them. Sean Smyth said he was frustrated at the state of the health service in Northern Ireland ""Eimear was first treated in England. We have first hand experience of the nursing staff in St James's in Leeds. ""The nurses nurse in England. Here in Belfast we have seen the nurses nurse, clean, cook, do every task there is possible. And the work they do is unbelievable. ""I've witnessed what their colleagues get in England. The pay get and the conditions they work in, the staffing levels compared to ours. It is chalk and cheese, we are the poor country cousin to England, Scotland and Wales. ""Where Eimear died, it was something from the 1980s - a horrible grey room. It's a horrible environment, the facilities are poor. ""Our hospitals need major investment, our staff need major support from our politicians."" Mairead Meenan, a staff nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said the ""fair pay"" issue had brought her to the picket line. ""Everybody wants equal pay and equal rights,"" she said, adding that nurses in Northern Ireland felt ""undervalued"" compared to their counterparts doing the same jobs in Great Britain. She called on politicians to ""start talking"" and sort the dispute out. ""You get paid loads and loads of money and you would not last 10 minutes in our job,"" said Ms Meenan. One woman, whose appointment at Altnagelvin went ahead as scheduled on Wednesday morning, came out to support nurses and health workers on the picket line. She has had two operations at the hospital since May. ""I was extremely well looked after and am very appreciative of all the care I've had,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I'm also totally disgusted with Stormont and its lack of getting on with sorting out Northern Ireland. ""This wouldn't have happened if they [politicians] had thought about it properly and fought for our good health service."" On so many measures, Northern Ireland lags behind the other UK nations when it comes to NHS performance. Not only does it has the highest vacancy rates, it also has the worst record in terms of meeting waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and routine operations. The best indication of this is the figures for the proportion of patients seen in four hours in A&E. England has just seen its performance sink to a record low of just over 81%. In Northern Ireland it is currently below 66%. Why? The suspension of a devolved government has certainly not helped - delaying everything from new policy to pay rises. But modernisation of health care in Northern Ireland was already behind schedule before that happened. Services are spread too thinly across too many sites, so there is a lot of catching up to do - and the more it is delayed the longer it will take. This video can not be played 'Patient safety is compromised every single day' Health workers say they want to be paid the same as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. Pay parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ended in 2014 when the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Jim Wells was health minister. He imposed a ""degree of restraint"" on pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Wells said the decision had been ""very difficult because the choice was very stark"", explaining that another increase in pay at the time could have led to redundancies or services being closed. The issue has not been looked at again because Northern Ireland has not had a devolved government since 2017. Downing Street said the strike highlighted the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties working together to restore devolved government. The ""quickest and best"" way to resolve the dispute was to get the Stormont executive up and running again, said the Prime Minister's spokesman. He added that the Northern Ireland Department of Health had been working closely with trust chief executives, unions and staff to make sure that services were delivered safely during the strike. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent These are unprecedented times. For the first time in UK history close to 20,000 health and social care works are on picket lines, including about 15,500 nurses. With more than 300,000 people in Northern Ireland waiting for an appointment, today's strike is going to push all services over the limit. As healthcare workers protest and wave flags calling for pay parity and safer staffing levels, what they are also shouting about is a desire to get devolved government back up and running. While there is a skeleton staff today, and while many appointments have been cancelled, a shortage of staff has been an issue for many years. Paramedics join the picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The RCN argues the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The RCN estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in Northern Ireland is 13%, compared with about 11% in England and 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing.

A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board said major challenges were expected across all health and social care services on Wednesday. It also advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted, they should attend their appointment/service as normal. All emergency departments remain open. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first,"" said the spokesperson. ""Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods."" The heads of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts have statedthe current crisis in the service has been ""years in the making"". Are you a patient who will be affected by the strike?

"The number of cod which can be legally caught by the UK's fishermen will be halved next year. It was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday at Brussels talks on fishing quotas for 2020. Prior to those discussions, representatives of Scottish trawlermen agreed to a 50% reduction in the cod catch in an effort to preserve stocks. The UK government said that in order to protect the future of the industry it had to fish sustainably. Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said: ""The reduction in the total allowable catch for North Sea cod will have a serious economic impact on the Scottish white fish sector next year, and will present major practical difficulties for the fleet. ""We welcome the commitment to review and update the stock assessment model for North Sea cod, reflecting the changing distribution of cod in the North Sea, most likely as a result of climate change."" Regulation of the fishing industry will be controlled by the UK after Brexit Fisheries Secretary Fergus Ewing, who was at the talks in Brussels, added: ""With Brexit about to happen it has been clear the EU is already prioritising other members over the state about to walk away. ""That is perhaps unsurprising, but coupled with the challenging scientific advice, it has made this a difficult two days."" Britain is preparing to leave the Common Fisheries Policy regime as a result of Brexit. Reality Check: How would Brexit affect the UK's fishing waters? UK to withdraw from international fishing arrangement Brexit fishing industry plans outlined by government Mike Park of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association (SWFPA) said the next year would be ""extremely challenging"". Speaking on the BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: ""It's a stock that's quite prolific in the northern North Sea. ""There's been significant changes over the whole of the North Sea but essentially next year that will cause the fleet problems which is now our focus to try and resolve that. ""In the next year, as the UK prepares to leave the Common Fisheries Policy, it is vital that the right scientific work is done to improve our understanding of the current status of the stock to enable better decisions to be taken on fishing opportunities for 2021."" Speaking after the talks concluded, UK fisheries minister George Eustice said: ""This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the North East Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks. ""I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of bycatch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban. ""However, we also know that to protect the profitability of fisheries in the future, we must fish sustainably today."" The talks have resulted in small increases in the allowable catches for North Sea ling and skate, as well as the relaxation of some proposed control and management measures Last year, the UK government set out its plans for the future of fishing after Brexit. It said devolved nations would have a say in setting annual quotas for third countries, but the environment secretary's decision was final. It intends to move to a system of quota management which it believes will guarantee a fairer share of the fish in UK waters for UK registered boats. The rules of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy will continue to apply until December 2020. Mr Eustice claimed some of the challenges faced by the UK fishing industry had resulted from EU rules. He said: ""Some of the problems have been exacerbated by the fact that the EU's outdated method for sharing quota between member states means that the UK gets a very small share of the cod in our own waters."" Marine sustainability group Open Seas said in a statement: ""Devastatingly this decision commits to yet more overfishing in the coming year. Quota for North Sea cod has been set roughly 30% above scientific advice."" Open Seas said the agreements represented ""bad decisions for the health of our sea, bad debts that will be owed by future generations, and fail legal pledges to end overfishing"". What difference will this make to prices on the street? Cod is a traditional fish and chips favourite in England, with battered haddock more popular in Scotland Industry sources say it is actually very hard - almost impossible in fact - to tell what impact the quotas will have on prices on the street. With takeaway fish and chips for example, cod is more popular in England - whereas haddock is the staple of the fish supper in Scotland. With the haddock quota up, in theory it could mean that with more haddock then prices would be a bit lower, and with less cod prices could be a slightly higher. However a lot of the cod that hits fish and chip shops in England comes from frozen at sea suppliers from Norway.

"Boris Johnson has been urged to get the UK back on track with tackling the emissions heating the planet. The Committee on Climate Change, the UK's official climate watchdog, says the government needs to be meeting its own targets to have credibility with other nations. But it warns that UK efforts to address the climate crisis have so far fallen short. The comments come ahead of a vital global climate conference next November hosted by the prime minister in Glasgow. Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external Last decade 'on course' to be warmest What is climate change? A letter from the climate committee's chairman, Conservative peer Lord Deben, says urgent action is needed in five areas: An ambitious, well-funded strategy for entirely removing fossil fuels from the UK's building stock - that will mean much better insulation and switching gas boilers for cleaner alternatives. An early consultation on phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - the current date is 2040. Delivering on the Conservatives' manifesto commitment for 40GW of offshore wind by 2030 - that will mean huge expansion of wind farms offshore. Working out how to fund emissions reductions from industry and how to pay for an infrastructure for hydrogen heating and equipment to capture emissions from heavy polluters. Introducing a world-leading package through the Agriculture and Environment Bill to cut emissions from farming and pay for the 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of annual tree planting promised in the manifesto. Phasing out petrol and diesel cars is high on the agenda for the committee The Climate Change Committee says that most of all, the prime minister should make it clear that he is putting the government's target for net zero emissions by 2050 at the heart of the UK's economic strategy. And urgent action is also needed on adapting to climate change in the UK itself. Lord Deben said: ""We are worryingly unprepared for the changes ahead. Many departmental plans do not even include a basic assessment of climate risk."" He claimed the government could increase flood defence spending by Â£4bn and stop people paving over open ground in cities. Ministers should find ways to stop people over-heating in homes, workplaces and public buildings, and they should also protect the natural environment by increasing tree planting and restoring peatland. Boris Johnson has previously said he wants the UK to be a world leader in climate change. Mostly when he speaks on the subject he promotes the notion that technology can solve climate problems. Environmentalists celebrate the role of technology too - but warn that lifestyle changes will still be needed. In a previous paper, the Climate Change Committee assumed that some people would have to cut down on meat as a contribution to meeting emissions. Transport academics have also said that Conservative plans for road building - and possibly airport expansion - would both increase emissions. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin.

"Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Labour leadership takes blame over election result Corbyn 'sorry' over Labour's heavy election defeat The Labour leader's closest allies are now busy making the case that Corbynism must survive Corbyn. When I spoke to his former chief cheerleader Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the giant trade union Unite, he told me the fudged message on Brexit - which he attributed, by the way, to Remainers not Leavers, and to the way Mr Corbyn had allowed himself to be pushed into promising a second referendum - had cost votes. The party leadership had been tainted by it. But the radical left-wing policies had been ""popular"" and need not change. Mr Corbyn himself arguedin an article in the Observer newspaper,externalthat he was ""proud we won the arguments"", which begs the obvious question: if this election showed Labour had won the arguments, what would losing the arguments have looked like? Mr McCluskey told me on my BBC Radio 5 Live programme Pienaar's Politics: ""All of Labour's policies were extremely popular. The problem is that, yes, when they were put together, there was a question of credulity - could Labour really deliver all of this. ""As regards Jeremy, yes, there's no doubt that it became an issue on the doorstep because of course, for the last four years, every single day, he has been attacked massively in a way that no politicians have by the media. ""The media, especially the right-wing media, wanted the election to be about Brexit. If I have to say this a thousand timesâ¦ Brexit was the reason for this defeat."" Meanwhile, Labour comrades, including freshly defeated former MPs, say Labour pushed policies on tax, spending and public ownership that some found implausible. Caroline Flint, ejected by the voters of Don Valley, told Sky News the answer could not be ""Corbyn without a beard"". For good measure, Ms Flint landed her Labour Remainer colleague and likely leadership contender, Emily Thornberry, in it knee-deep. She said the shadow foreign secretary had told a fellow MP she was ""glad my constituents aren't as stupid as yours."" Ms Thornberry has since dismissed the anecdote as a ""complete and utter lie"", and has instructed solicitors over the comments. Just as well. Otherwise her prospects in the leadership race might easily have grown as dim as she now denies characterising Leave voters. Caroline Flint took on Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry on Sunday morning So who will run? Rebecca Long-Bailey was the first name Mr McCluskey mentioned when I asked him to state his preference. The Corbynista shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has said he'd like to be elected her deputy. It's not clear though that she's keen to run, let alone, one imagines, play the role of Labour's bridge-across-the-barbed-wire. Lisa Nandy hasn't, at the time of writing, declared her candidacy, but she surely will - having told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""seriously thinking about it"". So will Sir Keir Starmer, the great hope of many pro-European centrists. It was telling that John McDonnell told Marr it was time for a ""non-London MP"" to become leader, which appeared to rule out Sir Keir and Ms Thornberry, at least in his view. The shadow chancellor also told Marr: ""If anyone's to blame, it's me. Full stop."" That sounded big of him. Except, of course, that he gave up on his own hopes of becoming leader some time ago, and still means to have some influence in installing the next one. As for Jess Phillips, the combative, charismatic wild card in the race when she joins it, Mr McDonnell volunteered that he would ""prefer someone elseâ¦ someone who actually has been really solidly involved in the development of our existing policy"". He wasn't, of course, sticking around with the aim of helping to install a suitable successor. ""We're not into that sort of conniving politics of the past,"" he said, which will reassure those who want a change of political direction. Unless it doesn't.

"Nurses are on picket lines across Northern Ireland Strike action by 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland over pay and staffing has ended. In total, more than 20,000 people who work in the health service in Northern Ireland were involved in Wednesday's action. Nine thousand Royal College of Nursing nurses ended their 12-hour strike at 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Nurses in the Unison union remained on strike until midnight, along with the majority of NIPSA members. Members of the Unite union are on strike until 06:00 on Thursday, while NIPSA ambulance workers are due to end their action at 07:00 GMT. The Health and Social Care Board said 4,749 hospital appointments were cancelled on Wednesday. Why are Northern Ireland's nurses going on strike? What services will be affected? Politicians find no easy answers to nurses' strike Paul Cummings, deputy chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said two-hourly calls were being made to each of the health trusts to assess the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, he said so far there had been ""no reported issues of patient safety"". ""Every aspect of health and social care has been affected,"" he said. ""Pressure is continuing to grow on our emergency departments, but so far our preparations [for the strike] have paid dividends."" This video can not be played 'This is unprecedented for us' Speaking at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, RCN member Nuala Murray told BBC News NI: ""This was incredibly difficult. I've been nursing for 37 years. ""This is so unprecedented for us to have to strike but nurses are so fed up, they've just had enough. ""Their patients aren't safe and they need to do something."" Many appointments and treatments have been cancelled because of the strike, and a number of minor injury units are closed. The Health and Social Care Board said all emergency departments would remain open as normal, but would be under significant pressure. Sean Smyth, whose daughter died in June, joined the picket line at Belfast City Hospital. ""I'm here to show solidarity with the fantastic health workers we have,"" he said. ""The care and support Eimear got was equally matched by the support they showed me and my family and we'll never be able to thank them. Sean Smyth said he was frustrated at the state of the health service in Northern Ireland ""Eimear was first treated in England. We have first hand experience of the nursing staff in St James's in Leeds. ""The nurses nurse in England. Here in Belfast we have seen the nurses nurse, clean, cook, do every task there is possible. And the work they do is unbelievable. ""I've witnessed what their colleagues get in England. The pay get and the conditions they work in, the staffing levels compared to ours. It is chalk and cheese, we are the poor country cousin to England, Scotland and Wales. ""Where Eimear died, it was something from the 1980s - a horrible grey room. It's a horrible environment, the facilities are poor. ""Our hospitals need major investment, our staff need major support from our politicians."" Mairead Meenan, a staff nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said the ""fair pay"" issue had brought her to the picket line. ""Everybody wants equal pay and equal rights,"" she said, adding that nurses in Northern Ireland felt ""undervalued"" compared to their counterparts doing the same jobs in Great Britain. She called on politicians to ""start talking"" and sort the dispute out. ""You get paid loads and loads of money and you would not last 10 minutes in our job,"" said Ms Meenan. One woman, whose appointment at Altnagelvin went ahead as scheduled on Wednesday morning, came out to support nurses and health workers on the picket line. She has had two operations at the hospital since May. ""I was extremely well looked after and am very appreciative of all the care I've had,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I'm also totally disgusted with Stormont and its lack of getting on with sorting out Northern Ireland. ""This wouldn't have happened if they [politicians] had thought about it properly and fought for our good health service."" On so many measures, Northern Ireland lags behind the other UK nations when it comes to NHS performance. Not only does it has the highest vacancy rates, it also has the worst record in terms of meeting waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and routine operations. The best indication of this is the figures for the proportion of patients seen in four hours in A&E. England has just seen its performance sink to a record low of just over 81%. In Northern Ireland it is currently below 66%. Why? The suspension of a devolved government has certainly not helped - delaying everything from new policy to pay rises. But modernisation of health care in Northern Ireland was already behind schedule before that happened. Services are spread too thinly across too many sites, so there is a lot of catching up to do - and the more it is delayed the longer it will take. This video can not be played 'Patient safety is compromised every single day' Health workers say they want to be paid the same as their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales. Pay parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ended in 2014 when the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Jim Wells was health minister. He imposed a ""degree of restraint"" on pay for health care workers, due to financial challenges in the department. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Wells said the decision had been ""very difficult because the choice was very stark"", explaining that another increase in pay at the time could have led to redundancies or services being closed. The issue has not been looked at again because Northern Ireland has not had a devolved government since 2017. Downing Street said the strike highlighted the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties working together to restore devolved government. The ""quickest and best"" way to resolve the dispute was to get the Stormont executive up and running again, said the Prime Minister's spokesman. He added that the Northern Ireland Department of Health had been working closely with trust chief executives, unions and staff to make sure that services were delivered safely during the strike. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent These are unprecedented times. For the first time in UK history close to 20,000 health and social care works are on picket lines, including about 15,500 nurses. With more than 300,000 people in Northern Ireland waiting for an appointment, today's strike is going to push all services over the limit. As healthcare workers protest and wave flags calling for pay parity and safer staffing levels, what they are also shouting about is a desire to get devolved government back up and running. While there is a skeleton staff today, and while many appointments have been cancelled, a shortage of staff has been an issue for many years. Paramedics join the picket line outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast The RCN argues the real value of nurses' pay here has fallen by 15% over the past eight years. There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The RCN estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in Northern Ireland is 13%, compared with about 11% in England and 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing.

A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board said major challenges were expected across all health and social care services on Wednesday. It also advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted, they should attend their appointment/service as normal. All emergency departments remain open. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first,"" said the spokesperson. ""Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods."" The heads of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts have statedthe current crisis in the service has been ""years in the making"". Are you a patient who will be affected by the strike?
