Here are some more details about what changes mothers-to-be can expect during the coronavirus crisis. All seven health boards in Wales
have asked pregnant women to attend future scans alone and have said expectant
mothers will now only be allowed one birth partner with them when it comes to
having their baby. Aneurin Bevan University Health
Board and Swansea Bay Health Board have also had to reduce the amount of
face-to-face appointments carried out, meaning some consultations
may now be done over the phone or online.

A doctor has called on people to ""leave the DIY project for another day"" after a spike in the number of home improvement-related eye injuries. Opthalmologist James Morgan of Cardiff University said: ""While itâs tempting to undertake much needed DIY there is a risk and what we donât want is people coming in with injuries because they could displace other patients with a greater clinical need. ""Please take care. The services are really under stress and if thereâs one thing you can do to help the NHS, leave that DIY project for another day.â Welsh Government has welcomed the UK government's plans to help the
self-employed. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak
said self-employed people facing financial difficulties will be able to have
80% of their monthly wages covered by the UK government. Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said Mr Sunak's announcement was ""warmly welcomed"" in Cardiff. ""It will provide huge relief for hundreds of
thousands of people in Wales who are self-employed,"" he said. ""Of course, details are emerging about how the scheme will operate and we
will be looking very closely at what gaps there are that individuals may fall
through"". There are around 211,000 self-employed people in Wales. FSB Wales had earlier welcomed the commitment but said it would be calling on the Welsh Government to create a hardship fund to ""plug the gap"" until money was available in June. Mr Skates added the Welsh Government would be announcing news of a ""cross-sector, cross-government fund"" which ""matches
seamlessly"" with UK government support already announced. A council says its call centre staff have received a number of ""aggressive"" and ""abusive"" calls. A ""large majority"" of the calls were from ""patient and co-operative"",Flintshire council said in a statement,external. ""Sadly, a small minority of callers into our contact centres have been aggressive and at times abusive,"" the council said. ""Examples include council tax payers expecting a council tax âholidayâ because a local service such as a library has been temporarily closed. Behaviour of this type is unacceptable."" The council asked for ""good and caring"" conduct from residents calling in. Fifteen Welsh Labour MPs are urging UK ministers to state clearly when measures to deal with the coronavirus crisis apply to England only. They warn ""mixed messages"" could mean people lose confidence in their actions and refuse to comply with their advice. In a letter, the MPs highlight ""confusion"" over a business rates plan that did not specify Welsh ministers would have their own programme. They describe similar problems with an England-only NHS volunteering scheme. BBC Wales' parliamentary correspondent Mark Hutchings has posted a video on social media showing people in Pontcanna, Cardiff, giving NHS staff a round of applause. Allow Twitter content?

A driving instructor does not know how she will get by while she waits to receive money from the government's fund for the self-employed. Lauren Cook said the payment was good ""in terms of the amount."" The 29-year-old, from Raglan, Monmouthshire, said: âHaving to wait for over two months for it is the problem, because of the bills - household bills but also with the business, paying the car and the insurance, things like that. âThere are a few clauses in it. How long you have got to wait.
You have got to wait 10 weeks, over two months. ""Just wondering how we are going to cope until I can get the money.â People who breach stringent new rules brought in to
tackle the coronavirus outbreak risk a fine of up to Â£120. First Minister Mark Drakeford has signed into law new
regulations setting out how the measures will be enforced. People found in breach of the rules will be fined Â£60 for a first offence, which rises to Â£120 for second and subsequent offences -
although people ignoring the new law could risk arrest if they do not comply. But while fines in England could reach as high as Â£960, that
will not happen in Wales. A fixed penalty notice for a first offence falls
to Â£30 if paid within 14 days. Ceri Welchman and her family A family trapped in South America by coronavius have spoken about their ordeal. As the pandemic rapidly spreads globally, many countries have introduced strict controls on domestic and foreign travel. Cardiff NHS occupational therapist, Ceri Welchman, her partner Salvatore Ledda and their four-year-old daughter Nicole had been touring South America since 4 January. When countries began closing borders, the family fled La Paz, Bolivia, to Sao Paulo, Brazil, to get a flight home. Two hours from the border, the Brazilian government closed its doors. ""There wasn't much thought given for tourists who were trying to get out,"" Ms Welchman said. ""My biggest worry is if anything happens to Nicole while we are here and couldn't leave."" A doctor at a hospital in one of the worst hit areas of the UK has told BBC Wales that colleagues were ""very, very nervous"". Gethin Williams, a
consultant surgeon at the Royal Gwent Hospital, said comparisons with Italy had made staff anxious at their level of exposure to the Covid-19 virus. On Wednesday, Sarah Aitken, director of public health at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which operates the Royal Gwent,said the area could be ""following Italy""as it is overwhelmed by a rapid rise in cases. Dr Williams said: ""We've read reports
from Italy and heard from colleagues in London that young, healthy doctors -
presumably exposed to a lot of viral load - are getting severe Covid infection
and being placed themselves on ventilators."" Labour MP Stephen Doughty has criticised the UK Government's proposed aid for the self-employed as having a ""huge sting in the tail."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced on Thursday up to Â£2,500 a month will be paid, but will not begin to arrive until the start of June. Mr Doughty said: ""What are millions of people supposed to do until June, not least when there's a five-week wait for universal credit? ""How do they put food on table and pay their bills? ""This is a big announcement but with a huge sting in the tail for millions of self-employed and freelancers."" The scheme must be brought forward, he said. ""Most people simply don't have the cash reserves in their bank accounts to get through one month, let alone three,"" he said. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales has welcomed chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement of support for self-employed people. Mr Sunak said self-employed people facing financial difficulties will be able to have 80% of their monthly wages covered by the government. It will be capped at Â£2,500 per month and will initially last three months. Speaking to Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales, FSB Wales' Ben Cottam said Mr Sunak's announcement went ""further than many people were expecting so is very much welcome"". But Mr Sunak also revealed people would have to wait until June to receive the money. There are nearly 211,000 self-employed people in Wales - that's 17% of the workforce. Mr Cottam said FSB Wales ""would want to sit down"" with the Welsh Government ""in very quick order"" to discuss the possibility of setting up a hardship fund for the self-employed to help ""plug the gap"" before June. The Royal College of Nursing in Wales has branded the wait for equipment to keep staff safe from Covid-19 ""intolerable"". Its director Helen Whyley said personal protection equipment, or PPE, was âessential"" for keeping staff safe. ""Letâs be clear: nurses have been committed, dedicated and patient while awaiting PPE but their altruism is drying up,"" she said. ""The added stress and anxiety of not knowing if they will receive PPE is intolerable. ""We would never ask any member to work in an environment that would leave them vulnerable. The number of people to have died with coronavirus in the UK has risen to 578, the Department of Health said. It said that, as of 09:00 GMT, a total of 11,658 people had tested positive for the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The government has urged people not to move house to try to limit the spread of coronavirus across the UK. Buyers and renters should delay moving while emergency stay-at-home measures are in place, it said. Its comments come amid reports banks are pressing for a full suspension of the UK housing market. Lenders are concerned about the effect of the pandemic on valuations,according to the Financial Times,external. Banks are also worried about granting mortgages during this period of extreme economic uncertainty, the FT said. The government said,externalthat while there ""is no need to pull out of transactions"", ""we all need to ensure we are following guidance to stay at home and away from others at all times"". If a property is vacant, people can continue with the transaction, although they must ensure they are following guidelines with regards to home removals. But if the house is occupied ""we encourage all parties to do all they can to amicably agree alternative dates to move"". Tenants 'should get a rent break' Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Property listings websites say that interest in moving home has slumped amid the coronavirus outbreak. Zoopla said demand in the week to 22 Marchfell 40% from the week before,externaland it predicted housing transactions would drop by up to 60% over the next three months. Meanwhile, it said a ""rapidly increasing"" proportion of sales were falling through, as would-be buyers ""reassess whether to make a big financial decision in these shifting times"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Moving house during a pandemic Geoff Grant, aged 60 and his wife Tanya, aged 52, from Dorset had been hoping to move house on 9 April. However, Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa and the couple face having to pay rent to two landlords if their removal firm changes its mind about helping them move. Mr Grant says there is already an overlap on the leases - the agreement for the new rental property begins on 1 April while the existing one ends on 9 April. ""If the move is delayed we'll have to negotiate with two landlords,"" he says. As it stands, the removal company the couple is using said at the beginning of the week it will still do the job. And while Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa on business, luckily his 20 year-old daughter is home from university to help lug boxes - at a six foot distance from the removers of course. Rival website Rightmove also said the slowdown in the UK housing markethad been ""significant"".,external ""The number of property transactions failing to complete in recent days and likely changes in tenant behaviour following the announcement of the renters' protections by the government may put further pressure on estate and lettings agents,"" it said, referring to the recentban on evictions.,external LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills UK, told the BBC the practical problems of buying and selling properties at the moment would have ""a real impact on transaction levels"". ""There are real difficulties around viewings, getting mortgage valuations done, [and] the conveyancing progress."" ""Whenever we've had a fall in transactions, we've also had a fall in prices - I think 5-10% in a period of low transactional activity. ""We would stand by our five-year forecast of 15% growth over the medium-term. That's because we have low interest rates, low levels of price growth in the run-up to this and a pretty swift response from the government to protect jobs and earnings."" In response to the crisis, UK Finance, which was formerly known as the British Bankers' Association, said lenders would extend mortgage offers for people who were due to move house during the lockdown. ""Current social distancing measures mean many house moves will need to be delayed,"" said UK Finance chief executive Stephen Jones. ""Where people have already exchanged contracts for house purchases and set dates for completion this is likely to be particularly stressful. ""To support these customers at this time, all mortgage lenders are working to find ways to enable customers who have exchanged contracts to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to enable them to move at a later date."" Buying a home is the biggest financial transaction most people will ever make. No one wants to get it wrong. Across the UK buyers are thinking again about whether they should take the plunge and whether they are paying too much. Potential sellers are wondering if it is worth putting a house on the market. So activity has already plummeted. One analysis suggests the number of properties being put up for sale has dropped by two thirds comparing this week to last week and is set to drop further. Now the government is telling us to put off thoughts of moving until the crisis is over. Moves can go ahead, with safeguards on human contact, but only if they are unavoidable or to unoccupied properties. The result may not be a total standstill, but most likely a huge fall in completed sales. Has your house purchase or move been affected by the coronavirus pandemic?

The naval hospital ship USNS Comfort will leave Virginia on Saturday, reaching New York Harbour on Monday, three weeks ahead of schedule, President Trump said at his daily press briefing. The ship will help lighten the load for New Yorkâs hospitals - now overwhelmed by the coronavirus outbreak. The state is the centre of the US crisis, home to at least 37,258 Covid-19 infections and 385 deaths. Trump will travel to Virginia to âkiss it goodbye,â he said. âItâs an extraordinary step,â New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week of the ship. âItâs literally a floating hospital.â The president also repeated his calls for Americans to return to work as soon as possible. âWe have to get back to work, our people want to work,â he said. âThis is the United States of America, they donât want to sit around and wait.â A cold beer or glass of red wine might seem exactly what you want right now if you have been ordered to stay at home, but experts have warned alcohol is an ""unhelpful coping strategy"". Experts from the European arm of the World Health Organization (WHO) say it is ""natural"" to feel anxious or lonely because of coronavirus restrictions but that substances like alcohol ""will not help to manage the stress of self-isolation"". The recommendation comes a day afteroff-licences were addedto the UK government's list of retailers allowed to stay open. Dr Aiysha Malik, technical officer for the WHO department of mental health, says: ""When weâre staying at home routines are very important for creating a sense of structure. ""Minimising the unhelpful coping strategies of using tobacco or alcohol can also be important for wellbeing and minimising content you might find distressing in the news."" For most people, the answer is no. At the moment, only patients in hospital with flu-like symptoms are being routinely tested for the virus. The government's priority is to increase the number of people being tested to see if they currently have the disease. The test being used is known as a PCR test. A swab from your throat or nose has to be taken and tested in the lab. But scientists are also looking at tests which can check whether someone has had the disease in the past. These look for markers of immunity called antibodies in the blood. They are faster than PCR tests, using a drop of blood on a device a bit like a pregnancy test. However, it could be a while before they are available. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer answers some other frequently asked questions about tests. With the UK on coronavirus lockdown, some young people have been forced to isolate alongside parents who don't accept their sexuality. After the coronavirus outbreak suddenly ended a UK tour he was performing in, Sam, 23, a dancer, from Birmingham, says he had ""no choice"" but to move back to his ""strict"" Christian family home. ""I saw the career I love disappear overnight, and now I'm stuck in isolation with homophobes."" Even though Sam chose to return home, he says he is ""struggling"" because he can't be himself. ""My mum says that homosexuality is an evil disease and that the devil is making me gay. She loudly prays every day that I'll be delivered from sin and find a wife. ""I genuinely have nowhere else to go during this mad time, so I'm just putting up with the abuse.""Click here for more from our LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte on people living in lockdown with homophobic parents.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Is it all doom and gloom? It was just a brief moment in the daily press briefing, but England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries did offer some positive news. She said the coronavirus outbreak was âstarting to move in the right directionâ. Other countries which have been on a steep curve have seen the number of new cases rise by a third every day. But the UK trajectory is nowhere near that steep. Five days ago 1,000 new cases were reported. Today 2,000 were. That may seem alarming, but if we had been on a steep upwards path todayâs figures would have been twice as high. It suggests some of the early social distancing measures taken before the lockdown have maybe started to have an impact. We should be cautious. It is only a few days worth of data - and Dr Harries was clear we must not take  âour foot off the pedalâ. But with all the bad news around, the words offer a glimmer of hope to an anxious nation. As we reported earlier, there are now more confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US than in any other country in the world. At 82,404 cases, it has overtaken both China with 81,782 cases and Italy with 80,589 cases, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Asked at a press conference if he was surprised America had overtaken China, US President Donald Trump said ""itâs a tribute to the amount of testing that weâre doing"". The president also suggested that Chinaâs numbers were higher than was being reported. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News From the team thatâs been assessing the risks to the UK
comes a study of the global impact of the pandemic, and it makes grim reading. The scientists conclude that only with the most draconian and rapid action can
a death toll running into many millions be avoided. Around the world as many as 30 million lives could be saved if governments take quick action, a study by scientists at Imperial College London says. In the least developed
countries, with large households including older people more at risk from
infection, the effects may be devastating. In the worst scenarios, where
healthcare systems are weak, the numbers needing intensive care may be 25 times
greater than what can be provided. The work is based on computer simulations,
known as models. The scientists are careful to say theyâre not offering
exact predictions but instead a broad perspective of the dangers for governments
of not responding quickly. Craig Spencer, the director of global health in emergency medicine at New York Medical Center, has been speaking to the BBC of fears that hospitals in New York are already very close to being overwhelmed. The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, had compared the speed of the spread to ""a bullet train"" but has since said there are signs the spread may be slowing.

Well, very quiet. Here's Buckingham Palace just a couple of weeks ago... And this week... See more images from around the UKbefore and after lockdown here. Our technology desk editor Leo Kelion reports how the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is working with three US technology firms to co-ordinate medical equipment during the coronavirus outbreak. The NHS will partner with Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir - as well as UK-based Faculty AI - to develop a ""dashboard"" to bring together data including where ventilators are being used and how long patients with Covid-19 are spending in hospital. The scheme hopes to flag emerging hotspots and that a version of the dashboard could be released to the public. Read more here. Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Top US indexes just
notched their third day in a row of gains with the Dow and S&P 500 up more
than 6% - despite the fact that the number of Americans filing for unemployment
skyrocketed to a record 3.28 million. The stock market, which had seen trillions in value wiped out in recent weeks
as the coronavirus reset investor expectations, is famously forward looking, so
does that mean things could be on the upswing? Some of the rally is due to the more than $2tn relief package set to clear the
US Congress, which includes aid for households and companies. But share prices have gyrated wildly in recent weeks, and analysts warn that
the economic shock from the near overnight elimination of incomes is
unprecedented. A State of Michigan Unemployment Agency office in Detroit As the coronavirus outbreak continues to pummel the US, nearly nine in 10 Americans - 88% - say the virus is a major threat to the health of the US economy, while 66% see it as a major threat to the health of the US population as a whole, according to anew report from the Pew Research Center.,external The number of Americans filing for unemployment has surged to a record high as the economy goes into shutdown. Minority groups have been hardest hit by the punishing economic trends, according to the report. Almost half of Hispanics - 49% - say that someone in their household has lost their job or taken a pay cut as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Among young adults - aged 18 to 29 - 46% say the same. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999999
"This video can not be played Trump attributes rise in US cases to testing The US now has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country, with more than 86,000 positive tests. According to the latest figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, the US has overtaken China (81,897 cases) and Italy (80,589). But with over 1,300 Covid-19-related fatalities, the US death toll is still behind China (3,296) and Italy (8,215). The grim milestone came as President Donald Trump predicted the nation would get back to work ""pretty quickly"". Asked about thelatest figures,externalat a White House briefing on Thursday afternoon, President Trump said it was ""a tribute to the amount of testing that we're doing"". Vice-President Mike Pence said coronavirus tests were now available in all 50 states and more than 552,000 tests had been conducted nationwide. Trump says US tested more than S Korea - is he right? Mr Trump also cast doubt on the figures coming out of Beijing, telling reporters: ""You don't know what the numbers are in China."" But later, he tweeted that he had had a ""very good conversation"" with China's President Xi Jinping. ""China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!"" President Trump said. Mr Trump has set a much-criticised goal of Easter Sunday, 12 April, for reopening the country. That plan seemed to gather impetus on Thursday as it emergedan unprecedented 3.3 million Americans have been laid off because of the virus. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed At Thursday's briefing, he said: ""They [the American people] have to go back to work, our country has to go back, our country is based on that and I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. ""We may take sections of our country, we may take large sections of our country that aren't so seriously affected and we may do it that way."" He added: ""A lot of people misinterpret when I say go back - they're going to be practising as much as you can social distancing, and washing your hands and not shaking hands and all of the things we talked about."" He promised more details next week. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In a letter to state governors on Thursday, Mr Trump said his team plans to release federal social distancing guidelines that may advise some regions to loosen restrictions. Mr Trump wrote of a ""long battle ahead"" and said ""robust"" testing protocols might allow some counties to lift their safeguards against the coronavirus. He said the ""new guidelines"" would create low, medium and high risk zones that would allow the government to advise on ""maintaining, increasing, or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place"". Trump knows economic meltdown brings political pain What this crisis reveals about US - and its president On Thursday night, Mr Trump phoned in to Fox News host Sean Hannity's programme and said he believed Iowa, Idaho, Nebraska and parts of Texas could reopen earlier than other states. The plan emerged as new research on Thursday estimated Covid-19-related deaths in the US could top 80,000 over the coming four months - even if people observe strict social distancing. As many as 2,300 patients could be dying every day by April,according to the study,externalfrom the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's School of Medicine. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Inside a Covid-19 intensive care unit The Republican president's get-back-to-work goal found unexpected support on Thursday from a prominent Democrat. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current coronavirus epicentre in the US, said statewide quarantine orders may not have been the best approach to coronavirus. ""Young people then quarantined with older people was probably not the best public health strategy,"" he told a news conference, ""because the younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection."" Mr Cuomo said a better way forward might be a ""get-back-to-work strategy"" in tandem with a public health strategy. Public health experts on the White House task force have demurred when asked about reopening the country by Easter, suggesting the timeline should be ""very flexible"". No. On 16 March, he set a 15-day period to slow down the spread of Covid-19 by urging all Americans to drastically scale back their public interactions. But those guidelines were voluntary and did not amount to a national order. The US Constitution makes clear states have the power for maintaining public order and safety, which scholars say means it is the responsibility of governors to decide when virus-related restrictions get lifted. Currently 21 US states have told residents to stay in their homes or ordered the closure of non-essential businesses in order to contain the pandemic. There were growing fears that Louisiana could become the country's next hotspot, with the governor warning that the state's biggest city, New Orleans, could be out of ventilators by 2 April and potentially out of beds by 7 April. ""It's not conjecture, it's not some flimsy theory,"" John Bel Edwards told a news conference. ""This is what is going to happen."" Additionally, Dr Deborah Birx, the co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus response, said two other cities showed signs of rapidly rising new infections - Detroit, where the mayor described the situation as ""really concerning"", and Chicago.

"The government says a communications mix-up meant it missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to get extra ventilators for the coronavirus crisis. Ministers were earlier accused of putting Brexit before public health when Downing Street said the UK had decided to pursue its own scheme. But No 10 now says officials did not get emails inviting the UK to join and it could join future schemes. Labour is demanding to know why the government had changed its message. Government orders 10,000 ventilators from Dyson Sunak to unveil financial aid for self-employed Can I get tested for coronavirus? The party's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Given the huge need for PPE, testing capacity and crucial medical equipment including ventilators, people will want to know why on Monday ministers were saying they had 'chosen other routes' over the joint EU procurement initiatives but now they are claiming that they missed the relevant emails. ""We need an urgent explanation from ministers about how they will get crucial supplies to the frontline as a matter of urgency."" He has said the UK ""should be co-operating through international schemes to ensure we get these desperately needed pieces of kit"". The EU has said the UK can take part in the procurement project, which will use the EU's buying power to purchase more stock, even though it is no longer a member of the bloc. But earlier on Thursday, Downing Street said the UK would not be joining the scheme because ""we are no longer members of the EU"". The spokesman added: âWe are conducting our own work on ventilators and weâve had a very strong response from business, and weâve also procured ventilators from the private sector in the UK and from international manufacturers."" Mr Johnson's spokesman denied the decision was motivated by Brexit, adding: ""This is an area where weâre making our own efforts.â The government faced a backlash from opposition MPs following the statement, with Liberal Democrat Layla Moran accusing the prime minister of putting ""Brexit over breathing"". Downing Street has now issued a statement saying the UK had missed the deadline for the first round of procurements. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""As the (European) Commission has confirmed, we are eligible to participate in joint procurements during the transition period, following our departure from the EU earlier this year. ""As those four initial procurement schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part in these, but we will consider participating in future procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time."" The UK currently has 8,000 ventilators available and has placed orders for another 8,000 from existing manufacturers, but there are concerns about capacity in hospitals as the spread of the virus worsens. Last week, the government put out a call for other British businesses to convert their factories to make the equipment, and has since signed a contract for 10,000 ventilators with Dyson. But Boris Johnson's spokesman confirmed the ventilators still needed to go through standards checks and would not be bought and distributed until that happened. The EU scheme will use the bloc's joint procurement agreement, which helps member states get the medical supplies it needs to tackle cross-border pandemics. It has also created a stockpile of medical equipment - 90% of it financed by the European Commission - to help EU countries.

Our technology desk editor Leo Kelion reports how the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is working with three US technology firms to co-ordinate medical equipment during the coronavirus outbreak. The NHS will partner with Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir - as well as UK-based Faculty AI - to develop a ""dashboard"" to bring together data including where ventilators are being used and how long patients with Covid-19 are spending in hospital. The scheme hopes to flag emerging hotspots and that a version of the dashboard could be released to the public. Read more here. Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Top US indexes just
notched their third day in a row of gains with the Dow and S&P 500 up more
than 6% - despite the fact that the number of Americans filing for unemployment
skyrocketed to a record 3.28 million. The stock market, which had seen trillions in value wiped out in recent weeks
as the coronavirus reset investor expectations, is famously forward looking, so
does that mean things could be on the upswing? Some of the rally is due to the more than $2tn relief package set to clear the
US Congress, which includes aid for households and companies. But share prices have gyrated wildly in recent weeks, and analysts warn that
the economic shock from the near overnight elimination of incomes is
unprecedented. A State of Michigan Unemployment Agency office in Detroit As the coronavirus outbreak continues to pummel the US, nearly nine in 10 Americans - 88% - say the virus is a major threat to the health of the US economy, while 66% see it as a major threat to the health of the US population as a whole, according to anew report from the Pew Research Center.,external The number of Americans filing for unemployment has surged to a record high as the economy goes into shutdown. Minority groups have been hardest hit by the punishing economic trends, according to the report. Almost half of Hispanics - 49% - say that someone in their household has lost their job or taken a pay cut as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Among young adults - aged 18 to 29 - 46% say the same. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,7.123302e-11

"Italy is the worst-hit European country by the coronavirus outbreak The Italian region hardest hit by coronavirus has seen a steep decline in the number of deaths and infections but worries are growing that the country's south could become the next hotspot. Recent numbers from the northern region of Lombardy suggested the epidemic might be slowing at its epicentre. But poorer southern parts are seeing a sharp rise in deaths, raising fears the health service could be overwhelmed. Italy has reported 8,215 deaths from coronavirus and 80,539 confirmed cases. A four-day trend of a slight decline in the number of cases ended on Thursday when both infections and deaths rose compared to the previous 24-hour reporting period. Italy is the worst-affected in Europe where almost everything has been closed for over two weeks and people told to stay at home. Contagion and deaths are far less widespread there, but worrying signs are coming from regions such as Campania around Naples and Rome's Lazio where the health system is considered much less equipped than in the rich north. So far there have been 74 deaths in Campania and 95 in Lazio. In an open letter to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Vincenzo De Luca, president of the Campania region, complained that the central government had not provided promised ventilators and other life-saving equipment. ""At this point there is the real prospect that Lombardy's tragedy is about to become the south's tragedy,"" he said. ""We are on the eve of a major expansion of infections which may not be sustainable."" On Thursday, Mr Conte told the Italian Senate that all of Europe would be hit by a ""hard, severe"" recession following the coronavirus emergency, and that ""extraordinary and exceptional measures"" were needed to face the shock. With analysts predicting that the strict measures will result in Italy sliding into its deepest recession in a generation, Mr Conte promised a second stimulus package worth at least â¬25bn (Â£23bn; $27bn). LIVE UPDATES:Deaths in Spain surge A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In Spain, the second-worst hit European country, the daily death toll fell for the first time in a week, according to the health ministry. There were 655 new deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the country's total to 4,089. On Wednesday,the country's death toll surpassed that of China, where the outbreak began. Meanwhile, the overall number of coronavirus cases in Spain soared to 56,188 from 47,610, a new daily high. Nursing homes, whose elderly residents are highly vulnerable to the disease, have been particularly hard hit by Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. A report by Cadena Ser radio network suggested at least 397 deaths had occurred in such places.

"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

"Terry Litherland, who supports his wife and three kids, says he won't get any help under the chancellor's plan The chancellorâs plan to support self-employed people through the crisis has received a cautious welcome from some who are set to benefit, but others have found they wonât qualify. Self-employed workers will be able to claim up to Â£2,500 per month but only if they have been operating for at least a year and have a trading profit of less than Â£50,000. Those who do qualify won't see the money until June. âIâm devastated,â says Terry Litherland, an electrician in Blackpool. ""I watched [the chancellorâs announcement] with bated breath,"" he tells the BBC. ""My wife got a bit upset."" ""Weâre a family of five - three young children - and he said thereâs no support for us.â What help will the self-employed get from government? Terry was made redundant after ten years working for RBS. Rather than claim benefits, he used his redundancy money to tide him over before setting up last year as a self-employed electrician. âI donât do cash-in-hand, everything goes straight into the bank. I have all the evidence youâd need for what I earn,â he says. But, because heâs only been trading for eight months, he wonât get any support. âI went down this path because I thought, if I go self-employed I can get a regular income and I donât have to worry about redundancy again. I feel like I tried to do everything the right way. I funded it all myself. Now Iâm thinking why did I bother?â Heâs going online now to look for any work he can find in construction or delivery, maybe in the next town, anywhere that can give him paid work. âI just need to bring money into the house and put food onto the table for the wife and children.â Vicki Crocker and her daughter Kendra, who also works at Trousseaux Vicki Crocker owns Trousseaux, a bridalwear shop in Swindon, but wedding dresses are sitting waiting to be collected and no new customers will be coming through the door for some time. She isnât sure exactly how much the new package will benefit her without going through the figures from the last three years, which will provide an average of her earnings. Business had been improving since the shop moved to a new site in the city's old town. âWe will get something, but we wonât get anything near what we would have expected to get [without the shutdown],â she says. In the bridal business a lot of money has to be ploughed into new stock each season, which means shops often make losses, so some bridalwear stores are likely to get nothing, she thinks. âWeâre lucky. We donât owe a lot of money,â she says. But sheâs also worried about her suppliers, some of whom make more than the Â£50,000 threshold. âI think [the government] has done the best they can in the time theyâve had,â she says. âItâs a good package for the people who it is going to help, but not for the people who donât get it.â Handyman Roderick Zuskar Roderick Zuskar works as a handyman in Macclesfield. He earned around Â£18,000 last year painting peopleâs houses, mending fences and other odd jobs so he will be able to access the chancellorâs support package. âIt will definitely help, thank you very much. But June?â he says. He canât see how he and his partner will manage until then. She works part-time, earning around Â£11,000 a year, and they have two children, seven and 10. âI know trying to help everybody is difficult,â he says, but he questions what he will do for money until June. Having spent the last week trying and failing to get through to utility companies, the bank and the supermarkets on the phone, heâs worried that the process to access the new finance package, or Universal Credit to tide him over, will be just as difficult. Roderick is sceptical it can all be handled smoothly and worried it could take even longer than is being suggested. âWhy canât they pay the broadband or electricity â give us that for free - something simple,â he asks. Elaine (not her real name) is a self-employed criminal barrister in Birmingham, but she falls through the cracks of the chancellorâs new provisions. She earned Â£51,000 last year, just over the threshold for being able to access the support. âI understand Â£51k is a lot of money for a lot of people, but I am in debt [from taking maternity leave] so there isnât much left over at the end of the month.â âMy last day in court was Tuesday and I donât know how long that is going to be for.â âItâs a bit of a kick in the teeth,â she says, after almost 20 years working for the Crown Prosecution Service. âI think itâs great that thereâs a rescue package, but I donât think itâs treating the self-employed equally to the employed. If there isnât an [income] ceiling for the employed, why is there for the self-employed?â âIâm trying to be stoic and British about it but it irritates me that those who take cash-in-hand payments will benefit because theyâll say their profits were under Â£50k when we know they werenât.â âI might have to go cap-in-hand to family, but it is not what I want to do.â UK government unveils aid for self-employed What extra help will the self-employed get?

"Almost everybody agrees that the government can't afford not to make huge interventions to keep businesses, households, workers and the economy afloat through the coronavirus crisis. But the costs are now racking up. The government is set to unveil a new multi-billion pound scheme for the self-employed, on top of the coronavirus job retention scheme for workers, cash handouts for small businesses, tax holidays and extra welfare payments. On top of that it is also covering the losses of the railways and funding public spending on health. In ordinary times, a recession means less tax and more spending, sending deficits higher as a result of the so-called ""fiscal stabilisers"". But this is no ordinary downturn. It is - for an undefined period - shutting down large swathes of the economy. For some companies and sectors we are talking not about less tax but zero tax, and the need for subsidies. Massive borrowing is needed to spend tens - and perhaps hundreds - of billions more at a time when the tax base is eroding. A new study by Richard Hughes, a former top Treasury official for the Resolution Foundation points out that previous pandemics have not led to a ""V-shaped"" recovery - as some had predicted - suggesting that the government should plan for a more prolonged downturn. Well, at the very moment of this immense financing need, the markets that have routinely and reliably been throwing money at governments, almost for free, have taken fright. There is basically a financial riot going on, and government bonds are no longer perceived to be equivalent to cash. Insurance companies and pension funds want and need actual cash, because their customers ask for it as global stock markets fall. Banks, meanwhile, must deal with millions taking mortgage holidays for at least three months, a spike in non-performing loans and demands to lend more. All the while, international investors are rushing to buy dollars. These events have distracted the traditional customers for government debt - lending cash to the Treasury - who are now far from guaranteed to be at the table. Indeed, the auctions of even some short-term UK government borrowing suggest a lack of demand in recent days. That leaves one institution capable of swallowing this: the Bank of England. And last week, after the announcement of the restarting of quantitative easing - the purchase from the open market of Â£200bn of borrowing - there was a little-spotted sentence in the official notice to markets on the purchase of gilts and corporate bonds. It said: ""The MPC will keep under review the case for participating in the primary market."" In English, this means that the Monetary Policy Committee is considering buying UK government bonds directly from the Treasury. Now, the Bank might well argue that this is to fulfil a statutory remit to keep markets functioning, in this case that market is the gilt market for UK government borrowing. But for many economists this will step over a red line into what is called ""monetary financing"", the modern day electronic equivalent of printing money - and the usual historical comparisons will undoubtedly be made with the 1930s. For Mr Hughes, the official who for three years was in charge of the Treasury's relationship with the government bond market, the unique global damage from the wretched pandemic, highlights a significant point. ""Governments may need to turn to their central banks for the liquidity needed to pay out against their commitments while government bond markets are temporarily disrupted,"" he says. ""Given current levels of market turbulence and the likely dramatic falls in revenue and increases in expenditure in the coming months, these actions may need to happen sooner rather than later."" He suggests that the government's effective overdraft at the Bank of England, the ""ways and means account"", could be lifted, massively, but temporarily. US markets close higher after emergency virus deal Banks under fire for coronavirus loan tactics No extra help for airlines, chancellor says The key thing is to communicate that such a move would be temporary, and will be withdrawn after the outbreak is properly contained. It is not clear whether the MPC is discussing this option today, or indeed discussing it in these terms. But last week Governor Andrew Bailey said ""we do have an eye on what the effect of the government's financing needs are, and the government's very, very sensible responses to the crisis we're in. ""I just want to emphasise that we're not abandoning the very clear, central bank philosophy in terms of monetary financing because you know history tells us where that leads."" It goes against the grain of what central bankers do. There are famous cartoons hung up at the Bank decrying an ancient history of this type of move. But the UK will not be alone, many nations are now in this zone, not through excess spending, but the debilitating effects of a global health crisis. A move in this direction could come very quickly.

"People who do not comply with social distancing rules in Scotland could be fined by the police, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. Emergency legislation has been passed at Westminster to curb the spread of coronavirus. Ms Sturgeon said it meant Police Scotland could have new powers as early as today to enforce social distancing. There have now been 894 confirmed cases of the virus in Scotland, with 25 people having died. This was an increase of 175 confirmed cases and three deaths since Wednesday. The actual number of cases is likely to be much higher. Live: Day three of coronavirus lockdown in Scotland Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? The new powers will allow police to hand out fixed penalties to anyone caught flouting the social distancing rules that were imposed earlier this week, which have left the whole of the UK effectively in ""lockdown"". Ms Sturgeon said these were ""last resort"" measures, but that ""ultimately this is about saving lives"". Police Scotland's Chief Constable, Iain Livingstone, told BBC Radio Four that officers would be able to instruct people to go home, and ""to use reasonable force if required"" - but said the power to make arrests was an ""absolute backstop"". Nicola Sturgeon said she expected the vast majority of people to ""do the right thing"" People across the UK have been urged to stay at home to help slow the spread of Covid-19 and reduce pressure on health services. Only limited trips out of the house are to be permitted - for exercise, to buy vital supplies or to attend essential work - and gatherings of more than two people, unless they are from the same household, are banned. The first minister said that ""those found not to be acting in line with regulations can be made to return home"". And she said police officers will also have the power to  give out ""prohibition notices"" and to close businesses and premises if needed. People could also be given spot fines - the level of which is currently being decided - ""and ultimately if necessary be prosecuted"", Ms Sturgeon warned. The first minister said she hoped the new powers would not have to be used, with officers taking a ""soft approach to enforcement"" - but ""they will have the power to act if that is deemed necessary"". The first minister said she expected the ""vast majority"" of people to ""do the right thing"" and comply with social distancing voluntarily. She said: ""This will get harder with every day that passes, to stay at home and follow all of the advice, but it remains essential that we all do so. ""This has to be a collective effort. The power to stop this epidemic rests with each and everyone of us as individuals."" Mr Livingstone later said there had been ""overwhelming levels of compliance"" with the new regulations, and that officers had already been speaking to people to ""make it very, very clear what the expectations are"". He said: ""If there is continued defiance, the absolute back-stop is a power of arrest. I would expect that to be used very, very infrequently, if at all, but I do think it is important that people know that that power is there."" The NHS in Scotland is scaling up to cope with the coronavirus crisis, and the country's chief medical officer says she believes we are behind London and the rest of England in terms of the accelerating caseload. This means the lockdown may have a bigger impact here. However, Scotland is still facing significant capacity issues. The authorities say they are on track to double intensive care capacity, and then want to quadruple it. The postponement of elective surgery has meant they are just short of freeing up 3,000 other hospital beds. There has also been a lot of talk about ""field hospitals"". One interesting point made at this morning's briefing was that they are still saying the empty Sick Children's hospital in Edinburgh is not safe to use. Even if they look elsewhere, a field hospital could be for non-Covid 19 patients rather than the ""fever hospitals"" we've been seeing in China and elsewhere. This video can not be played Coronavirus: '40,000 to 50,000 Scots' estimated to have virus Ms Sturgeon also announced that an extra 1.5 million facemasks have been ""brought back into use from the NHS Scotland central stockpile"". These masks had passed their expiry date, but have undergone ""extensive testing which has shown them to be fit for use"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was no shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers, with supplies being monitored ""daily"". World Health Organisation guidelines currently recommend health staff wear a full gown and visor She said: ""We are paying very close and detailed attention to the overall stock of PPE for our health and social care staff, and we have now taken over the ordering, supply and distribution of PPE to social care and care at home staff. ""As of today we have no shortages. We are increasing the distribution routes and networks to ensure the supplies people need get to where they are needed, including in remote and rural areas, as quickly as possible. ""The safety of our health and social care staff is of absolute critical importance, so we are taking every step we can to make sure they have the equipment they need, and we have orders in the pipeline to make sure stocks are replenished.""

"The government has urged people not to move house to try to limit the spread of coronavirus across the UK. Buyers and renters should delay moving while emergency stay-at-home measures are in place, it said. Its comments come amid reports banks are pressing for a full suspension of the UK housing market. Lenders are concerned about the effect of the pandemic on valuations,according to the Financial Times,external. Banks are also worried about granting mortgages during this period of extreme economic uncertainty, the FT said. The government said,externalthat while there ""is no need to pull out of transactions"", ""we all need to ensure we are following guidance to stay at home and away from others at all times"". If a property is vacant, people can continue with the transaction, although they must ensure they are following guidelines with regards to home removals. But if the house is occupied ""we encourage all parties to do all they can to amicably agree alternative dates to move"". Tenants 'should get a rent break' Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Property listings websites say that interest in moving home has slumped amid the coronavirus outbreak. Zoopla said demand in the week to 22 Marchfell 40% from the week before,externaland it predicted housing transactions would drop by up to 60% over the next three months. Meanwhile, it said a ""rapidly increasing"" proportion of sales were falling through, as would-be buyers ""reassess whether to make a big financial decision in these shifting times"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Moving house during a pandemic Geoff Grant, aged 60 and his wife Tanya, aged 52, from Dorset had been hoping to move house on 9 April. However, Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa and the couple face having to pay rent to two landlords if their removal firm changes its mind about helping them move. Mr Grant says there is already an overlap on the leases - the agreement for the new rental property begins on 1 April while the existing one ends on 9 April. ""If the move is delayed we'll have to negotiate with two landlords,"" he says. As it stands, the removal company the couple is using said at the beginning of the week it will still do the job. And while Mr Grant is stuck in South Africa on business, luckily his 20 year-old daughter is home from university to help lug boxes - at a six foot distance from the removers of course. Rival website Rightmove also said the slowdown in the UK housing markethad been ""significant"".,external ""The number of property transactions failing to complete in recent days and likely changes in tenant behaviour following the announcement of the renters' protections by the government may put further pressure on estate and lettings agents,"" it said, referring to the recentban on evictions.,external LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills UK, told the BBC the practical problems of buying and selling properties at the moment would have ""a real impact on transaction levels"". ""There are real difficulties around viewings, getting mortgage valuations done, [and] the conveyancing progress."" ""Whenever we've had a fall in transactions, we've also had a fall in prices - I think 5-10% in a period of low transactional activity. ""We would stand by our five-year forecast of 15% growth over the medium-term. That's because we have low interest rates, low levels of price growth in the run-up to this and a pretty swift response from the government to protect jobs and earnings."" In response to the crisis, UK Finance, which was formerly known as the British Bankers' Association, said lenders would extend mortgage offers for people who were due to move house during the lockdown. ""Current social distancing measures mean many house moves will need to be delayed,"" said UK Finance chief executive Stephen Jones. ""Where people have already exchanged contracts for house purchases and set dates for completion this is likely to be particularly stressful. ""To support these customers at this time, all mortgage lenders are working to find ways to enable customers who have exchanged contracts to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months to enable them to move at a later date."" Buying a home is the biggest financial transaction most people will ever make. No one wants to get it wrong. Across the UK buyers are thinking again about whether they should take the plunge and whether they are paying too much. Potential sellers are wondering if it is worth putting a house on the market. So activity has already plummeted. One analysis suggests the number of properties being put up for sale has dropped by two thirds comparing this week to last week and is set to drop further. Now the government is telling us to put off thoughts of moving until the crisis is over. Moves can go ahead, with safeguards on human contact, but only if they are unavoidable or to unoccupied properties. The result may not be a total standstill, but most likely a huge fall in completed sales. Has your house purchase or move been affected by the coronavirus pandemic?

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed The number of Americans filing for unemployment has surged to a record high as the economy goes into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 3.3 million people registered to claim jobless benefits for the week ended 21 March, according to Department of Labor data. That is nearly five times more than the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. The rush overwhelmed many state offices handling the claims and signalled an abrupt end to a decade of expansion. The shift comes as officials in states across the country close restaurants, bars, cinemas, hotels and gyms in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Live updates Car firms have halted production and air travel has fallen dramatically. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is on some form of lockdown. Analysts said the situation could be even worse than the data currently shows, noting the reports of jammed call lines and crashing state websites. Some kinds of workers, such as people working part-time, do not qualify. ""I've been writing about the US economy ... since 1996, and this is the single worst data point I've seen, by far,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Economics. Nationally, the figures are nearly five times higher than the worst point of the 2008 financial crisis. In Illinois, weekly jobless claims increased 10-fold. They more than quintupled in New York and more than tripled in California, which were among the earliest and biggest states to impose restrictions. The effects were even more dramatic in smaller states. While some retailers, such as Walmart and Amazon, have announced plans to hire, economists said that will not make up for the jobs lost. As incomes evaporate, the economic damage is likely to snowball, since consumer spending accounts for the majority of the US economy. ""Once the risks around the virus pass, it will not be just easy to flip the switch and employment returns to pre-crisis levels,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM wrote on Twitter. ""That is not how this is going to work and will require more aid."" LIVE UPDATES:Deaths in Spain surge A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In Washington, Congress is expected to pass a more than $2tn (Â£1.7tn) stimulus bill, which includes direct payments of $1,200 (Â£999) to adults, an expansion of unemployment benefits, and financing for affected industries, such as airlines. The Federal Reserve has also taken unprecedented steps to shore up the economy. But even with such action, a sharp economic contraction is inevitable, analysts said. Lower income workers are particularly vulnerable, as the lockdown forces retailers, fast food outlets and other low wage employers to cut back or close. Mr Shepherdson said he expects to see the unemployment rate increase to at least 6.5% shortly - nearly double the prior rate - and continue to accelerate in future months. ""Fed action and fiscal measures can only ameliorate the pain and we remain worried that the latter aren't yet on a sufficient scale,"" Mr Shepherdson wrote. As recently as February, the US unemployment rate was hovering near historic lows at 3.5%. The number of jobless claims was only about 210,000 three weeks ago and President Donald Trump was trumpeting the labour market's health on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump, who has made the strength of the economy his political calling card, recently said he wants to loosen restrictions on activity as early as next month. However, state and local officials worried about the rise in cases may decide not to follow the federal government as the number of cases continues to rise. The US had more than 69,000 cases as of Thursday. In a television interview on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said ""the first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity"". ""The sooner we get through this period and get the virus under control, the sooner the recovery can come...We know that economic activity will decline probably substantially in the second quarter but I think many expect and I would expect economic activity to resume and move back up in the second half of the year,"" he said. More than 3 million Americans lost their jobs in a week - a single week - and it is possible this number is underestimating the actual figure. To think just a few weeks ago, the monthly jobless rate was at a 50-year low and we were talking about the continuing strength of the US labour market. Now some experts are expecting to see the unemployment rate hit 13% or more. It is incredible just how quickly the American economy has cratered. So it comes as no surprise that President Trump wants to reopen the country for business fast. This is a president that staked his reputation partly on the strength of the US economy, often highlighting low unemployment and a record breaking stock market. Now, in an election year, he can point to neither.

Police have warned walkers heading to beauty spots in the Peak District they are being watched by a fleet of drones. Derbyshire Policeshared footage,externalshowing a number of people enjoying scenery around Curbar Edge. The force is using the tactic in a bid to highlight the importance of following the current government guidelines over reducing unnecessary journeys for their daily exercise. Some of the registration plates captured on Wednesday came from addresses in Sheffield, a 30-minute drive away. Chris JonesBBC rugby union correspondent England rugby union head coach Eddie Jones will take a pay cut of more than 25% as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Jones has joined the Rugby Football Union's highest-paid executives in accepting a reduction to help limit the financial impact of the pandemic, which could cost the union up to Â£50m. ""When I contacted Eddie regarding our executive pay reduction proposals he immediately agreed,""said RFU boss Bill Sweeney. Jennifer MeierhansBBC News Here I am with another reason to smile âºï¸ Ethel has had her day brightened at Fulford Care Home Children have been sending hand-drawn pictures and waving through the windows of a care home to keep up the spirits of its residents. People living at Fulford Nursing Home in York also received cards, cakes and flowers after posting an appeal on social media. You can read about the residents' reactionhere. How adorable is this - Evelyn-Rose Wiggans baked cupcakes yesterday and delivered them to neighbours stuck inside their homes. The two-year-old, from Verwood in Dorset, made sure she washed her hands thoroughly before making her creations, her dad, Rob, was quick to point out. ""She said she wanted to give one to Colin and Grace - our neighbours. She placed the cakes on the doorstep, knocked and walked away."" Rob said people were ""so appreciative"". ""Evelyn even had a card delivered this morning as it turns out it was one of the neighbour's birthdays. ""This makes us so, so proud of her and to see what a kind, loving and thoughtful little girl she is."" Struggling businesses were told the government would cover 80% of their employees wages as long as they were kept on during the coronavirus outbreak. However ministers were criticised for not doing the same for the five million people across the UK who are self-employed. This evening that's changed with the announcement of a taxable grant for the self-employed or partnerships, worth 80% of their profits up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. You can read more here.  Birdwatchers who flocked to a beauty spot in Gloucestershire to catch a glimpse of a rare bird have been sent home. About 15 twitchers congregated in Cleeve Common, near Cheltenham, after the ring ouzel was reportedly spotted. Ignoring the government's advice, the group had travelled from as far as Birmingham to see the bird. The RSPB said it was ""totally unacceptable"". Here's a reminder of the reasons to leave home during lockdown: Rishi Sunak says self-employed people facing financial difficulties will be able to have 80% of their monthly wages covered by the government. He says this will be calculated using average monthly profits over last three financial years. He says support will be capped at Â£2,500 per month, and will initially last three months. We're expecting to hear shortly what measures Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce to help self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus. He set out plans for 80% wage subsidies for staff kept on by employers last week -and the PM has said he wants similar protection for freelancers. The government's briefing is at 17:00 GMT.

Eleven-year-old goalkeeper Nathan Fanaganâs novel approach to isolation-enforced training has seen him offered sponsorship deals and the chance to hone his skills with Championship side Leeds United. His mum posted a video of him training by himself in his back garden and some of the best goalkeepers around, including David de Gea, Jack Butland and Ben Foster, have shown their support for his creative drills during self-isolation.  A man has pleaded guilty to shoplifting following claims he spat and coughed at shop staff while shouting ""I've got coronavirus"". West Midlands Police said,externalthey were called to a B&M store on Stechford Retail Park, Birmingham, at 15:45 on Wednesday after reports a suspected shoplifter had been detained in the car park. The 35-year-old, from Saltley, appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday, accused of stealing two beard trimmers and then deliberately coughing in the faces of security staff. He pleaded not guilty to common assault, but admitted shoplifting. The man, who was deemed by a nurse as not having coronavirus, will next appear in court in June. Many workers say they are being made to continue doing non-essential work, despite government advice. People staying at home due to the coronavirus pandemic appear to be listening to more radio rather than music apps, figures suggest. Global, which owns Capital FM and talk station LBC, said online radio listening had risen by 15%. The BBC said streaming of its radio stations had risen 18% since last week. Meanwhile, data from two US analytics companies suggested use of music-streaming apps such as Spotify haddipped by about 8%. An NHS nurse who had been stranded in Cambodia and called on Boris Johnson to help get her home has landed back in the UK. Cheryl Baxter said she âhad a few tearsâ when she arrived back at her front door in St Maryâs Bay in Kent on Thursday morning after her ordeal in South East Asia. Mrs Baxter works in Hastings where she is head of the Conquest Hospitalâs Covid-19 ward, and is looking forward to rejoining her colleagues soon. Speaking after she and her husband Ivon arrived home, she said the whole experience had been a âmental roller-coasterâ. Mrs Baxter, 52, and her husband had been travelling before the UK pandemic commenced and were due to fly home on March 22 via Bangkok. But as the coronavirus crisis intensified, they had huge trouble securing the right medical certificates to fly home, with different agencies demanding different papers.

"The government says a communications mix-up meant it missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to get extra ventilators for the coronavirus crisis. Ministers were earlier accused of putting Brexit before public health when Downing Street said the UK had decided to pursue its own scheme. But No 10 now says officials did not get emails inviting the UK to join and it could join future schemes. Labour is demanding to know why the government had changed its message. Government orders 10,000 ventilators from Dyson Sunak to unveil financial aid for self-employed Can I get tested for coronavirus? The party's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Given the huge need for PPE, testing capacity and crucial medical equipment including ventilators, people will want to know why on Monday ministers were saying they had 'chosen other routes' over the joint EU procurement initiatives but now they are claiming that they missed the relevant emails. ""We need an urgent explanation from ministers about how they will get crucial supplies to the frontline as a matter of urgency."" He has said the UK ""should be co-operating through international schemes to ensure we get these desperately needed pieces of kit"". The EU has said the UK can take part in the procurement project, which will use the EU's buying power to purchase more stock, even though it is no longer a member of the bloc. But earlier on Thursday, Downing Street said the UK would not be joining the scheme because ""we are no longer members of the EU"". The spokesman added: âWe are conducting our own work on ventilators and weâve had a very strong response from business, and weâve also procured ventilators from the private sector in the UK and from international manufacturers."" Mr Johnson's spokesman denied the decision was motivated by Brexit, adding: ""This is an area where weâre making our own efforts.â The government faced a backlash from opposition MPs following the statement, with Liberal Democrat Layla Moran accusing the prime minister of putting ""Brexit over breathing"". Downing Street has now issued a statement saying the UK had missed the deadline for the first round of procurements. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""As the (European) Commission has confirmed, we are eligible to participate in joint procurements during the transition period, following our departure from the EU earlier this year. ""As those four initial procurement schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part in these, but we will consider participating in future procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time."" The UK currently has 8,000 ventilators available and has placed orders for another 8,000 from existing manufacturers, but there are concerns about capacity in hospitals as the spread of the virus worsens. Last week, the government put out a call for other British businesses to convert their factories to make the equipment, and has since signed a contract for 10,000 ventilators with Dyson. But Boris Johnson's spokesman confirmed the ventilators still needed to go through standards checks and would not be bought and distributed until that happened. The EU scheme will use the bloc's joint procurement agreement, which helps member states get the medical supplies it needs to tackle cross-border pandemics. It has also created a stockpile of medical equipment - 90% of it financed by the European Commission - to help EU countries.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Fox gets hands on with Huawei's P40 Pro Huawei has launched a range of new flagship smartphones despite the coronavirus pandemic. The firm unveiled the P40 phones a day after the firm's founder announced that 90% of the company's 150,000 China-based employees had returned to work. But experts say demand for the handsets will likely be weak outside of its home market, at least in the short-term. They say many consumers and businesses are focused on buying laptops, PCs and tablets if they are spending at all. The new phones lack Google's apps or access to its software store ""Smartphones are not a priority and certainly not premium ones,"" commented Marta Pinto from market research firm IDC. ""People's consumption confidence is falling because they are more concerned about buying things like groceries and whether they will keep their jobs. ""Even if you are still buying, because you're working from home, you'll probably purchase a laptop and monitor. Or because kids need to go to school online, you might buy them a tablet or Chromebook."" Ren Zhengfei said strong smartphone sales in China had helped offset weaker demand elsewhere The new handsets were unveiled via a livestreamed video feed rather than at one of the big-budget events Huawei typically hosts. Unlike last year's models, the P40 phones lack Google services - including its YouTube, Maps and Play Store apps, and the Google Assistant - because of a US trade ban. That makes them a difficult sale outside of China, where Android phones come preinstalled with alternatives. Huawei said the phones had been designed to feel comfortable in the hand But as a result, one company-watcher suggested that the firm might actually be in a better place to deal with the consequences of Covid-19 than its rivals. ""Huawei was already pretty much locked out of markets outside of China, and had factored in a pretty tough trading environment for the next year or two,"" explained Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""So, it is other phone-makers that have a bigger shock to deal with. LG and Sony's smartphone divisions, in particular, were already sub-scale and may not survive. ""And don't forget, that the majority of Huawei's sales are still coming from its home market in China, where it's been selling over 40 million units on a quarterly basis. And that market is recovering faster than others having already endured coronavirus and seems to be coming out the other side."" LIVE:Latest updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Huawei remains the world's second bestselling handset-maker, but had once aimed to overtake Samsung before the end of 2019. Founder Ren Zhengfei told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat his firm now planned to boost its wider research and development budget by $5.8bn (Â£4.8bn) this year, taking it to more than $20bn. And part of that is being spent on building up its own library of apps. ""In markets outside of China, we don't see significant [smartphone] growth,"" he added. ""We are taking measures to address that."" There are three versions of the new phones: the standard P40, with a 6.1in screen, and a larger mid-range P40 Pro and high-end Pro+, which both have 6.58in displays. That makes then slightly bigger than Apple's iPhone 11 Pro Max. The top two models have several rear cameras and a depth sensor All support 5G. The basic model has three rear cameras, including one that is capable of a 3x optical zoom - meaning users can tighten in on the subject without sacrificing quality. The P40 Pro adds a time-of-flight depth sensor and upgrades the telephoto lens to a periscope design, allowing light to be reflected into the device to deliver a 5x optical zoom. And the Pro+ betters this with a 10x optical zoom periscope lens. If a digital effect is employed, the Pro+ can achieve 100x zoom. This matches Samsung's Galaxy S20 Ultra - but Huawei claims to produce a better shot. Huawei also said its phones featured bigger camera sensors than those found in either the Galaxy S20 series or iPhone 11 range, giving it an advantage in low-light situations when the owner does not want to use the flash. Other standout features include: artificial intelligence techniques that can remove undesired objects from a scene and to eliminate reflections in glass a super-slow motion video mode that captures footage at 7,680 frames per second a 32 megapixel selfie camera that can record in 4K. In the two higher models, this is enhanced with its own depth-sensing tech to create background blur in portrait snaps a smart assistant summoned by saying ""Hey Celia"", which can identify flowers and other objects the phone is shown The Huawei App Gallery includes TikTok, Telegram, Viber, and Microsoft Office among other products. But beyond Google's apps, it is also missing Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. To help make up for the loss of YouTube, the firm has created its own Huawei Video app. It has signed a deal with BBC Studios to provide access to 300 hours of content. Huawei Video will include BBC drama, comedy and factual TV shows in 26 countries outside the UK. And to replace the Duo video chat app, it offers MeeTime, which it claims offers superior performance in low-light conditions. ""The design of the devices is superb - they are very sleek,"" commented Ms Pinto. ""And it's clever that they've been able to bring more stability to the ultra-zoom lens than Samsung did with its S20 Ultra, assuming the P40 Pro+ lives up to its promise. ""But it remains a hard sell, because would you actually want to use something like MeeTime rather than WhatsApp?"" The P40 and P40 Pro go on sale on 7 April, and start from â¬799 (Â£742, $890) and â¬999 respectively, The P40 Pro+ will be released in June, and is priced at â¬1,399.

"People who do not comply with social distancing rules in Scotland could be fined by the police, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. Emergency legislation has been passed at Westminster to curb the spread of coronavirus. Ms Sturgeon said it meant Police Scotland could have new powers as early as today to enforce social distancing. There have now been 894 confirmed cases of the virus in Scotland, with 25 people having died. This was an increase of 175 confirmed cases and three deaths since Wednesday. The actual number of cases is likely to be much higher. Live: Day three of coronavirus lockdown in Scotland Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? The new powers will allow police to hand out fixed penalties to anyone caught flouting the social distancing rules that were imposed earlier this week, which have left the whole of the UK effectively in ""lockdown"". Ms Sturgeon said these were ""last resort"" measures, but that ""ultimately this is about saving lives"". Police Scotland's Chief Constable, Iain Livingstone, told BBC Radio Four that officers would be able to instruct people to go home, and ""to use reasonable force if required"" - but said the power to make arrests was an ""absolute backstop"". Nicola Sturgeon said she expected the vast majority of people to ""do the right thing"" People across the UK have been urged to stay at home to help slow the spread of Covid-19 and reduce pressure on health services. Only limited trips out of the house are to be permitted - for exercise, to buy vital supplies or to attend essential work - and gatherings of more than two people, unless they are from the same household, are banned. The first minister said that ""those found not to be acting in line with regulations can be made to return home"". And she said police officers will also have the power to  give out ""prohibition notices"" and to close businesses and premises if needed. People could also be given spot fines - the level of which is currently being decided - ""and ultimately if necessary be prosecuted"", Ms Sturgeon warned. The first minister said she hoped the new powers would not have to be used, with officers taking a ""soft approach to enforcement"" - but ""they will have the power to act if that is deemed necessary"". The first minister said she expected the ""vast majority"" of people to ""do the right thing"" and comply with social distancing voluntarily. She said: ""This will get harder with every day that passes, to stay at home and follow all of the advice, but it remains essential that we all do so. ""This has to be a collective effort. The power to stop this epidemic rests with each and everyone of us as individuals."" Mr Livingstone later said there had been ""overwhelming levels of compliance"" with the new regulations, and that officers had already been speaking to people to ""make it very, very clear what the expectations are"". He said: ""If there is continued defiance, the absolute back-stop is a power of arrest. I would expect that to be used very, very infrequently, if at all, but I do think it is important that people know that that power is there."" The NHS in Scotland is scaling up to cope with the coronavirus crisis, and the country's chief medical officer says she believes we are behind London and the rest of England in terms of the accelerating caseload. This means the lockdown may have a bigger impact here. However, Scotland is still facing significant capacity issues. The authorities say they are on track to double intensive care capacity, and then want to quadruple it. The postponement of elective surgery has meant they are just short of freeing up 3,000 other hospital beds. There has also been a lot of talk about ""field hospitals"". One interesting point made at this morning's briefing was that they are still saying the empty Sick Children's hospital in Edinburgh is not safe to use. Even if they look elsewhere, a field hospital could be for non-Covid 19 patients rather than the ""fever hospitals"" we've been seeing in China and elsewhere. This video can not be played Coronavirus: '40,000 to 50,000 Scots' estimated to have virus Ms Sturgeon also announced that an extra 1.5 million facemasks have been ""brought back into use from the NHS Scotland central stockpile"". These masks had passed their expiry date, but have undergone ""extensive testing which has shown them to be fit for use"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was no shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers, with supplies being monitored ""daily"". World Health Organisation guidelines currently recommend health staff wear a full gown and visor She said: ""We are paying very close and detailed attention to the overall stock of PPE for our health and social care staff, and we have now taken over the ordering, supply and distribution of PPE to social care and care at home staff. ""As of today we have no shortages. We are increasing the distribution routes and networks to ensure the supplies people need get to where they are needed, including in remote and rural areas, as quickly as possible. ""The safety of our health and social care staff is of absolute critical importance, so we are taking every step we can to make sure they have the equipment they need, and we have orders in the pipeline to make sure stocks are replenished.""

"Italy is the worst-hit European country by the coronavirus outbreak The Italian region hardest hit by coronavirus has seen a steep decline in the number of deaths and infections but worries are growing that the country's south could become the next hotspot. Recent numbers from the northern region of Lombardy suggested the epidemic might be slowing at its epicentre. But poorer southern parts are seeing a sharp rise in deaths, raising fears the health service could be overwhelmed. Italy has reported 8,215 deaths from coronavirus and 80,539 confirmed cases. A four-day trend of a slight decline in the number of cases ended on Thursday when both infections and deaths rose compared to the previous 24-hour reporting period. Italy is the worst-affected in Europe where almost everything has been closed for over two weeks and people told to stay at home. Contagion and deaths are far less widespread there, but worrying signs are coming from regions such as Campania around Naples and Rome's Lazio where the health system is considered much less equipped than in the rich north. So far there have been 74 deaths in Campania and 95 in Lazio. In an open letter to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Vincenzo De Luca, president of the Campania region, complained that the central government had not provided promised ventilators and other life-saving equipment. ""At this point there is the real prospect that Lombardy's tragedy is about to become the south's tragedy,"" he said. ""We are on the eve of a major expansion of infections which may not be sustainable."" On Thursday, Mr Conte told the Italian Senate that all of Europe would be hit by a ""hard, severe"" recession following the coronavirus emergency, and that ""extraordinary and exceptional measures"" were needed to face the shock. With analysts predicting that the strict measures will result in Italy sliding into its deepest recession in a generation, Mr Conte promised a second stimulus package worth at least â¬25bn (Â£23bn; $27bn).

STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In Spain, the second-worst hit European country, the daily death toll fell for the first time in a week, according to the health ministry. There were 655 new deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the country's total to 4,089. On Wednesday,the country's death toll surpassed that of China, where the outbreak began. Meanwhile, the overall number of coronavirus cases in Spain soared to 56,188 from 47,610, a new daily high. Nursing homes, whose elderly residents are highly vulnerable to the disease, have been particularly hard hit by Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. A report by Cadena Ser radio network suggested at least 397 deaths had occurred in such places.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Fox gets hands on with Huawei's P40 Pro Huawei has launched a range of new flagship smartphones despite the coronavirus pandemic. The firm unveiled the P40 phones a day after the firm's founder announced that 90% of the company's 150,000 China-based employees had returned to work. But experts say demand for the handsets will likely be weak outside of its home market, at least in the short-term. They say many consumers and businesses are focused on buying laptops, PCs and tablets if they are spending at all. The new phones lack Google's apps or access to its software store ""Smartphones are not a priority and certainly not premium ones,"" commented Marta Pinto from market research firm IDC. ""People's consumption confidence is falling because they are more concerned about buying things like groceries and whether they will keep their jobs. ""Even if you are still buying, because you're working from home, you'll probably purchase a laptop and monitor. Or because kids need to go to school online, you might buy them a tablet or Chromebook."" Ren Zhengfei said strong smartphone sales in China had helped offset weaker demand elsewhere The new handsets were unveiled via a livestreamed video feed rather than at one of the big-budget events Huawei typically hosts. Unlike last year's models, the P40 phones lack Google services - including its YouTube, Maps and Play Store apps, and the Google Assistant - because of a US trade ban. That makes them a difficult sale outside of China, where Android phones come preinstalled with alternatives. Huawei said the phones had been designed to feel comfortable in the hand But as a result, one company-watcher suggested that the firm might actually be in a better place to deal with the consequences of Covid-19 than its rivals. ""Huawei was already pretty much locked out of markets outside of China, and had factored in a pretty tough trading environment for the next year or two,"" explained Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""So, it is other phone-makers that have a bigger shock to deal with. LG and Sony's smartphone divisions, in particular, were already sub-scale and may not survive. ""And don't forget, that the majority of Huawei's sales are still coming from its home market in China, where it's been selling over 40 million units on a quarterly basis. And that market is recovering faster than others having already endured coronavirus and seems to be coming out the other side."" LIVE:Latest updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Huawei remains the world's second bestselling handset-maker, but had once aimed to overtake Samsung before the end of 2019. Founder Ren Zhengfei told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat his firm now planned to boost its wider research and development budget by $5.8bn (Â£4.8bn) this year, taking it to more than $20bn. And part of that is being spent on building up its own library of apps. ""In markets outside of China, we don't see significant [smartphone] growth,"" he added. ""We are taking measures to address that."" There are three versions of the new phones: the standard P40, with a 6.1in screen, and a larger mid-range P40 Pro and high-end Pro+, which both have 6.58in displays. That makes then slightly bigger than Apple's iPhone 11 Pro Max. The top two models have several rear cameras and a depth sensor All support 5G. The basic model has three rear cameras, including one that is capable of a 3x optical zoom - meaning users can tighten in on the subject without sacrificing quality. The P40 Pro adds a time-of-flight depth sensor and upgrades the telephoto lens to a periscope design, allowing light to be reflected into the device to deliver a 5x optical zoom. And the Pro+ betters this with a 10x optical zoom periscope lens. If a digital effect is employed, the Pro+ can achieve 100x zoom. This matches Samsung's Galaxy S20 Ultra - but Huawei claims to produce a better shot. Huawei also said its phones featured bigger camera sensors than those found in either the Galaxy S20 series or iPhone 11 range, giving it an advantage in low-light situations when the owner does not want to use the flash. Other standout features include: artificial intelligence techniques that can remove undesired objects from a scene and to eliminate reflections in glass a super-slow motion video mode that captures footage at 7,680 frames per second a 32 megapixel selfie camera that can record in 4K. In the two higher models, this is enhanced with its own depth-sensing tech to create background blur in portrait snaps a smart assistant summoned by saying ""Hey Celia"", which can identify flowers and other objects the phone is shown The Huawei App Gallery includes TikTok, Telegram, Viber, and Microsoft Office among other products. But beyond Google's apps, it is also missing Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. To help make up for the loss of YouTube, the firm has created its own Huawei Video app. It has signed a deal with BBC Studios to provide access to 300 hours of content. Huawei Video will include BBC drama, comedy and factual TV shows in 26 countries outside the UK. And to replace the Duo video chat app, it offers MeeTime, which it claims offers superior performance in low-light conditions. ""The design of the devices is superb - they are very sleek,"" commented Ms Pinto. ""And it's clever that they've been able to bring more stability to the ultra-zoom lens than Samsung did with its S20 Ultra, assuming the P40 Pro+ lives up to its promise. ""But it remains a hard sell, because would you actually want to use something like MeeTime rather than WhatsApp?"" The P40 and P40 Pro go on sale on 7 April, and start from â¬799 (Â£742, $890) and â¬999 respectively, The P40 Pro+ will be released in June, and is priced at â¬1,399.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the grant Self-employed workers can apply for a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits to help them cope with the financial impact of coronavirus, the chancellor has announced. The money - up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month - will be paid in a single lump sum, but will not begin to arrive until the start of June at the earliest. Rishi Sunak told the self-employed: ""You have not been forgotten."" Wage subsidies of 80% for salaried employees were announced last week. Shortly after the chancellor spoke, the number of people in the UK who have died with Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus -jumped by more than 100 in a day for the first time. The total now stands at 578. âIâm devastated thereâs no support for meâ What help will the self-employed get? Where is the cash going to come from? Live updates on the coronavirus crisis around the world The government had faced criticism for failing to provide support for self-employed and freelance workers in itsearlier package of economic measures. Mr Sunak said the steps taken so far were ""already making a difference"" but it was right to go further ""in the economic fight against the coronavirus"". Self-employed people will be able to apply for a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to Â£2,500 a month. At least half their income needs to have come from self-employment as registered on the 2018-19 tax return filed in January - anyone who missed the filing deadline has four weeks from now to get it done and still qualify. The scheme is open to those who earn under Â£50,000 a year - up to 3.8 million of the 5 million people registered as self-employed. Unlike the employee scheme, the self-employed can continue to work as they receive support. The money, backdated to March, will arrive directly into people's banks accounts from HMRC, but not until June. The grants will be taxable, and will need to be declared on tax returns by January 2022. Company owners who pay themselves a dividend are not covered. The scheme does not cover people who only became self-employed very recently - the chancellor said they would have to look to the benefits system for support. Coming up with a workable scheme had been ""difficult"", he continued, because the self-employed were a ""diverse population"" and some of them earned a great deal. But in all, the ""fair, targeted and deliverable"" plan would help 95% of people who earn most of their income via self-employment. ""We have not left you behind, we all stand together,"" he added. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick later told the BBC's Question Time that even where self-employed workers were unable to provide full financial records going back three years, the government was urging people to ""give us what they've got and we will work through it with HMRC to see if there's a way to support you"". 'When can I go out?' Social distancing rules explained In Pictures: UK before and after lockdown The Federation of Small Business, which represents many self-employed workers, welcomed the intervention, saying:  ""Although the deal is not perfect, the government has moved a very long way today."" But Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was worried the money would come ""too late for millions"". ""People need support in the coming days and fortnight... there is a real risk that without support until June the self-employed will feel they have to keep working, putting their own and others' health at risk."" Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the government had been too slow to recognise the severity of the crisis. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Jeremy Corbyn says government has been ""too slow"" Torsten Bell, from think tank the Resolution Foundation, said the very significant package stood in ""stark contrast"" to the ""much less generous"" support being given to employees who lose their jobs or see their hours cut during the crisis. The Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support scheme is another extraordinary, multi-billion pound support, reflecting the brutal economic impact of a shutdown designed to keep the pandemic in check. In recent days, Treasury ministers appeared to be trying to dampen down expectations, telling MPs it was problematic to establish a fair scheme, and the employee job retention scheme would be the logistical priority. The government wants to set up the scheme to keep employed jobs as the priority first, so the banks will need to be relied on to support many of the self-employed with overdrafts to tide them over until the grant goes into their bank accounts in about 10 weeks' time. The sting in the tail? The chancellor said he can no longer justify, after things get back to normal, that self-employed people pay less tax than the employed. But that is for another day. In the UK, more than 11,600 people have now tested positive for coronavirus - although the actual number of cases is likely to be far higher. The peak of demand for intensive care was expected to come in two to three weeks, but speaking alongside the chancellor at Thursday's briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, refused to be drawn on any predictions. She said the UK was ""only just starting to see a bite in the interventions - the social distancing - that have been put into place"", but things appeared to be ""starting to move in the right direction"". The government has imposed strict controls on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the disease. LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"The government says a communications mix-up meant it missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to get extra ventilators for the coronavirus crisis. Ministers were earlier accused of putting Brexit before public health when Downing Street said the UK had decided to pursue its own scheme. But No 10 now says officials did not get emails inviting the UK to join and it could join future schemes. Labour is demanding to know why the government had changed its message. Government orders 10,000 ventilators from Dyson Sunak to unveil financial aid for self-employed Can I get tested for coronavirus? The party's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Given the huge need for PPE, testing capacity and crucial medical equipment including ventilators, people will want to know why on Monday ministers were saying they had 'chosen other routes' over the joint EU procurement initiatives but now they are claiming that they missed the relevant emails. ""We need an urgent explanation from ministers about how they will get crucial supplies to the frontline as a matter of urgency."" He has said the UK ""should be co-operating through international schemes to ensure we get these desperately needed pieces of kit"". The EU has said the UK can take part in the procurement project, which will use the EU's buying power to purchase more stock, even though it is no longer a member of the bloc. But earlier on Thursday, Downing Street said the UK would not be joining the scheme because ""we are no longer members of the EU"". The spokesman added: âWe are conducting our own work on ventilators and weâve had a very strong response from business, and weâve also procured ventilators from the private sector in the UK and from international manufacturers."" Mr Johnson's spokesman denied the decision was motivated by Brexit, adding: ""This is an area where weâre making our own efforts.â The government faced a backlash from opposition MPs following the statement, with Liberal Democrat Layla Moran accusing the prime minister of putting ""Brexit over breathing"". Downing Street has now issued a statement saying the UK had missed the deadline for the first round of procurements. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""As the (European) Commission has confirmed, we are eligible to participate in joint procurements during the transition period, following our departure from the EU earlier this year. ""As those four initial procurement schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part in these, but we will consider participating in future procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time."" The UK currently has 8,000 ventilators available and has placed orders for another 8,000 from existing manufacturers, but there are concerns about capacity in hospitals as the spread of the virus worsens. Last week, the government put out a call for other British businesses to convert their factories to make the equipment, and has since signed a contract for 10,000 ventilators with Dyson. But Boris Johnson's spokesman confirmed the ventilators still needed to go through standards checks and would not be bought and distributed until that happened. The EU scheme will use the bloc's joint procurement agreement, which helps member states get the medical supplies it needs to tackle cross-border pandemics. It has also created a stockpile of medical equipment - 90% of it financed by the European Commission - to help EU countries.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed The number of Americans filing for unemployment has surged to a record high as the economy goes into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 3.3 million people registered to claim jobless benefits for the week ended 21 March, according to Department of Labor data. That is nearly five times more than the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. The rush overwhelmed many state offices handling the claims and signalled an abrupt end to a decade of expansion. The shift comes as officials in states across the country close restaurants, bars, cinemas, hotels and gyms in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Live updates Car firms have halted production and air travel has fallen dramatically. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is on some form of lockdown. Analysts said the situation could be even worse than the data currently shows, noting the reports of jammed call lines and crashing state websites. Some kinds of workers, such as people working part-time, do not qualify. ""I've been writing about the US economy ... since 1996, and this is the single worst data point I've seen, by far,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Economics. Nationally, the figures are nearly five times higher than the worst point of the 2008 financial crisis. In Illinois, weekly jobless claims increased 10-fold. They more than quintupled in New York and more than tripled in California, which were among the earliest and biggest states to impose restrictions. The effects were even more dramatic in smaller states. While some retailers, such as Walmart and Amazon, have announced plans to hire, economists said that will not make up for the jobs lost. As incomes evaporate, the economic damage is likely to snowball, since consumer spending accounts for the majority of the US economy. ""Once the risks around the virus pass, it will not be just easy to flip the switch and employment returns to pre-crisis levels,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM wrote on Twitter. ""That is not how this is going to work and will require more aid."" LIVE UPDATES:Deaths in Spain surge A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In Washington, Congress is expected to pass a more than $2tn (Â£1.7tn) stimulus bill, which includes direct payments of $1,200 (Â£999) to adults, an expansion of unemployment benefits, and financing for affected industries, such as airlines. The Federal Reserve has also taken unprecedented steps to shore up the economy. But even with such action, a sharp economic contraction is inevitable, analysts said. Lower income workers are particularly vulnerable, as the lockdown forces retailers, fast food outlets and other low wage employers to cut back or close. Mr Shepherdson said he expects to see the unemployment rate increase to at least 6.5% shortly - nearly double the prior rate - and continue to accelerate in future months. ""Fed action and fiscal measures can only ameliorate the pain and we remain worried that the latter aren't yet on a sufficient scale,"" Mr Shepherdson wrote. As recently as February, the US unemployment rate was hovering near historic lows at 3.5%. The number of jobless claims was only about 210,000 three weeks ago and President Donald Trump was trumpeting the labour market's health on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump, who has made the strength of the economy his political calling card, recently said he wants to loosen restrictions on activity as early as next month. However, state and local officials worried about the rise in cases may decide not to follow the federal government as the number of cases continues to rise. The US had more than 69,000 cases as of Thursday. In a television interview on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said ""the first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity"". ""The sooner we get through this period and get the virus under control, the sooner the recovery can come...We know that economic activity will decline probably substantially in the second quarter but I think many expect and I would expect economic activity to resume and move back up in the second half of the year,"" he said. More than 3 million Americans lost their jobs in a week - a single week - and it is possible this number is underestimating the actual figure. To think just a few weeks ago, the monthly jobless rate was at a 50-year low and we were talking about the continuing strength of the US labour market. Now some experts are expecting to see the unemployment rate hit 13% or more. It is incredible just how quickly the American economy has cratered. So it comes as no surprise that President Trump wants to reopen the country for business fast. This is a president that staked his reputation partly on the strength of the US economy, often highlighting low unemployment and a record breaking stock market. Now, in an election year, he can point to neither.

"NHS and social care staff will be given free car parking during the coronavirus outbreak, the government has said. It comes after 400,000 people signed a petition urging the government to thank NHS workers by scrapping charges. GP Anthony Gallagher, who began the petition, welcomed the move but said fees should be abolished permanently. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: âI will do everything I can to ensure our dedicated staff have whatever they need during this unprecedented time.â The government has promised to provide NHS trusts with the money so they can offer free parking to workers at hospital car parks.

Free NHS hospital parking for thousands 'in greatest need' Coronavirus: Tears as NHS staff given flowers The government says councils will ensure NHS staff, care workers and volunteers can provide suitable evidence to be displayed in their vehicles in order to avoid charges. The National Car Parking Group earlier confirmed it would offer free parking to NHS staff at its 150 car parks in England. Responding to the announcement, Dr Gallagher said: âI hope after this nightmare has passed, that the government will still notice how NHS workers go above and beyond every day.

"Initially, the bot failed to respond to some users and they had to say 'hi' again A Covid-19 WhatsApp bot set up by the UK government is finally working after problems during launch on Wednesday. Members of the public who message the bot can access pre-determined chunks of advice on symptoms or how to avoid spreading the disease, for example. But it failed to work for some users after its launch, providing nothing more than an error message. However, the BBC has verified that the bot, which also warns about coronavirus myths, is now working as intended. One of those who encountered initial teething problems, Hashir Milhan, says all seems to be resolved. âI tried sending the opening âhiâ message with no response,â London-based designer Mr Milhan told the BBC. He said the bot did respond later â but only to send him an error message. But on Thursday, he was able to access the information without problems. He noted that the information was generally available online but added: âItâs reassuring that this comes from a verified account.â The government said the service was designed to allow members of the public to ""get answers to the most common questions about coronavirus"". But Mr Milhan said he had hoped the bot would be able to engage in and understand conversations, in order to respond to queries people might have on the spot. To start receiving messages, users should send âhiâ via WhatsApp to the number 07860 064422. International users can use +44 7860 064 422. LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The UK government does not have an official emergency alert system with which to contact citizens directly during a crisis. However, authorities are distributing information through various channels, including websites and social media, as well as the new WhatsApp bot. Telecoms firms were also asked to send out an alert to all customers via text message this week, stating that people must now stay at home as much as possible. The texts have rolled out gradually to users and scammers have already tried to take advantage of the situation. Some have sent fake messages accusing individuals of leaving their homes more than once a day - the limit set by the government - and telling them they are now liable to pay a fine. Number 10 said people should trust only the official message. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Banks have been criticised by firms and MPs for insisting on personal guarantees to issue government-backed emergency loans to business owners. The requirement loads most of the risk that the loan goes bad on the business owner, rather than the banks. It means that the banks can go after the personal property of the owner of a firm if their business goes under and they cannot afford to pay off the debt. Their main home would be protected but the bank could go after other assets. Those can include things like personal savings, shares or holiday homes. And some think that will stop business owners from making use of the emergency loan scheme, which the government put in place to stop businesses from going under during the coronavirus crisis. Alex Harris says the interest rate he was offered would bankrupt his bar The coronavirus business interruption loans (CBIL) are a key plank of the government's package to protect businesses throughout the ongoing shutdown. Alex Harris owns bar Behind This Wall in Hackney, east London. He told the BBC's Today programme that he asked his bank about the government's coronavirus loan scheme, but was offered something quite different. ""The government-backed loans are from Â£25,000 up to Â£5m,"" he said. ""We got offered a financial product of theirs, another loan which is not part of the coronavirus package. ""It's for up to Â£24,999, but will come at up to 22% interest, which would initially bankrupt my business."" Mr Harris said he was being asked to borrow against his house and questioned why he was being asked to do so, ""faced with this level of uncertainty"". How to apply for business support Coronavirus support 'not open to firms like mine' Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, advised Mr Harris to visit the website of the British Business Bank (BBB), which is overseeing the scheme, to look for another lender. He told the programme that no-one borrowing money under the government's coronavirus loan scheme would be required to use their main private residence as security. The BBB has told lenders they have discretion over the security they require. According to UK Finance, formerly the British Bankers Association, the scheme should offer loans of up to Â£5m, where the government promises to cover 80% of losses if the money is not repaid. But, it notes: ""Lenders may require security for the facility."" And that could allow banks to repossess the owner's personal property as well as the assets of the business if the firm goes under. Barclays has told customers they will be required to sign personal guarantees to access the government-supported emergency finance. And HSBC told the BBC it will require a form of personal guarantee for loans over Â£100,000. However, Royal Bank of Scotland, which also owns NatWest, has confirmed it will offer business interruption loans without asking business owners for personal guarantees - proving that more generous terms can be offered. The other banks will now come under pressure from business customers to copy RBS. Personal guarantees allow banks to lend more because it means they are more likely to get their money back. That means they don't have to put as much money aside to cover failures, which is one of the biggest costs for a bank. But the use of personal guarantees shifts the risk from the bank and the government on to the business owner themselves. If a loan of Â£100,000 was made to a failed business and the owner had signed a personal guarantee, the bank would first repossess the assets of the owner or the business. Only then would the government step in to cover 80% of whatever loss remained and the bank would only have to fund whatever was left after that. Business owners and MPs say that is not fair when the firms themselves are only seeking the loans because of emergency measures introduced by the government. The SME Alliance, which represents small and medium sized enterprises and is led by business owner Andy Keats, said that while business owners were grateful for the recognition that most firms will need help to survive the crisis, ""yet again, it is the banks and not businesses who will receive the funds to help SMEs"". It said banks were seeking security - property they can repossess if the loan is not repaid - for the entire value of the business interruption loans. ""We would appreciate some clarity because, as things stand, the proposed loans mean the banks have no risk, the government has a small risk and businesses and their officers have 100% risk,"" said Mr Keats. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking tweeted: ""There is confusion about [coronavirus business interruption loan schemes]. Treasury must issue clear guidance on parameters and not allow security at 'discretion of the lender' to muddy the waters. Unprecedented times require emergency funding. Keep it simple, and no [personal guarantees]."" Kevin Hollinrake MP, a former business owner who chairs the group, said: ""I asked the chief secretary to the Treasury [Steve Barclay] in the House of Commons - does the new scheme include personal guarantees and he said it was his understanding that it would not. Well it's my understanding now that it will. ""It should not include [personal guarantees]. If it does, very few business owners are going to want to take it up. In normal business circumstances, you can't expect banks to lend money without some sort of commitment. But these are unheralded times and unprecedented measures.""

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed The number of Americans filing for unemployment has surged to a record high as the economy goes into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 3.3 million people registered to claim jobless benefits for the week ended 21 March, according to Department of Labor data. That is nearly five times more than the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. The rush overwhelmed many state offices handling the claims and signalled an abrupt end to a decade of expansion. The shift comes as officials in states across the country close restaurants, bars, cinemas, hotels and gyms in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Live updates Car firms have halted production and air travel has fallen dramatically. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is on some form of lockdown. Analysts said the situation could be even worse than the data currently shows, noting the reports of jammed call lines and crashing state websites. Some kinds of workers, such as people working part-time, do not qualify. ""I've been writing about the US economy ... since 1996, and this is the single worst data point I've seen, by far,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Economics. Nationally, the figures are nearly five times higher than the worst point of the 2008 financial crisis. In Illinois, weekly jobless claims increased 10-fold. They more than quintupled in New York and more than tripled in California, which were among the earliest and biggest states to impose restrictions. The effects were even more dramatic in smaller states. While some retailers, such as Walmart and Amazon, have announced plans to hire, economists said that will not make up for the jobs lost. As incomes evaporate, the economic damage is likely to snowball, since consumer spending accounts for the majority of the US economy. ""Once the risks around the virus pass, it will not be just easy to flip the switch and employment returns to pre-crisis levels,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM wrote on Twitter. ""That is not how this is going to work and will require more aid."" LIVE UPDATES:Deaths in Spain surge A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In Washington, Congress is expected to pass a more than $2tn (Â£1.7tn) stimulus bill, which includes direct payments of $1,200 (Â£999) to adults, an expansion of unemployment benefits, and financing for affected industries, such as airlines. The Federal Reserve has also taken unprecedented steps to shore up the economy. But even with such action, a sharp economic contraction is inevitable, analysts said. Lower income workers are particularly vulnerable, as the lockdown forces retailers, fast food outlets and other low wage employers to cut back or close. Mr Shepherdson said he expects to see the unemployment rate increase to at least 6.5% shortly - nearly double the prior rate - and continue to accelerate in future months. ""Fed action and fiscal measures can only ameliorate the pain and we remain worried that the latter aren't yet on a sufficient scale,"" Mr Shepherdson wrote. As recently as February, the US unemployment rate was hovering near historic lows at 3.5%. The number of jobless claims was only about 210,000 three weeks ago and President Donald Trump was trumpeting the labour market's health on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump, who has made the strength of the economy his political calling card, recently said he wants to loosen restrictions on activity as early as next month. However, state and local officials worried about the rise in cases may decide not to follow the federal government as the number of cases continues to rise. The US had more than 69,000 cases as of Thursday. In a television interview on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said ""the first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity"". ""The sooner we get through this period and get the virus under control, the sooner the recovery can come...We know that economic activity will decline probably substantially in the second quarter but I think many expect and I would expect economic activity to resume and move back up in the second half of the year,"" he said. More than 3 million Americans lost their jobs in a week - a single week - and it is possible this number is underestimating the actual figure. To think just a few weeks ago, the monthly jobless rate was at a 50-year low and we were talking about the continuing strength of the US labour market. Now some experts are expecting to see the unemployment rate hit 13% or more. It is incredible just how quickly the American economy has cratered. So it comes as no surprise that President Trump wants to reopen the country for business fast. This is a president that staked his reputation partly on the strength of the US economy, often highlighting low unemployment and a record breaking stock market. Now, in an election year, he can point to neither.

"The world has been given an indication of the economic impact of coronavirus as Singapore released its initial growth figures for this quarter. The trade-reliant city state now looks to be heading for its first full-year recession in about two decades. The figures suggest that the global economy is also set for a sharp contraction. This week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of a global recession worse than the one after the 2008 financial crisis. Singapore said gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 2.2% year-on-year while, compared with the previous quarter, GDP fell by 10.6%. It marks the biggest quarterly contraction for the South East Asian nation since 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis.

As one of first countries to release economic growth data for the period in which the outbreak has been spreading globally, the numbers from Singapore provide a glimpse of how the ongoing pandemic could affect economies around the world. Singapore was also one of the first countries outside China to report cases of the coronavirus.

"WHO guidelines, which currently recommend health staff wear a full gown and visor. GPs are demanding ""urgent clarification"" from the government on whether they should now wear protective equipment to examine all patients. Family doctors now wear it if they see a patient with suspected coronavirus. But the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) has written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock to ask if GPs should wear it for all face-to-face consultations. It says patients with the virus but no symptoms could still infect staff. The BBC understands GPs in some surgeries have decided to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for all face-to-face consultations, but this is not currently recommended by Public Health England. ExCeL Centre planned as NHS field hospital Home tests won't be available 'next week' Thousands volunteer to help NHS with vulnerable In the letter, Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the RCGP, wrote: ""GPs across the country have never been more concerned, not just for the safety of themselves and their teams, but for patients too. ""They are unsure as to whether they have enough supplies [of PPE], either now, or as the crisis deepens. ""They are not confident that the current guidance provides the necessary clarity about whether GPs are using the right type of equipment, at the right times,"" he said. Prof Marshall also noted the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends family doctors have eye protection for consultations but most practices do not have sufficient access to it, and there are concerns about the use of aprons that doctors have been given, rather than full body cover. There has been widespread concern and anger at the shortages of personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. The prime minister said he has been ""assured"" stocks of PPE - such as masks, gloves and gowns - were on the way to NHS staff, saying the Army had distributed 7.5 million pieces of equipment in the past 24 hours. A dedicated hotline has also been set up allowing organisations to order PPE 24 hours a day, the government previously announced. However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Healthcare Supply Association has been forced to use Twitter to ask DIY shops to donate equipment to NHS staff.

"This video can not be played ""People in your profession write fake news - you do"", President Trump tells journalist The US Senate has passed a $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill that is the largest economic stimulus in US history. The vote was delayed by a last-minute row between Republican and Democratic senators over unemployment benefits. The plan includes direct payments of $1,200 to most American adults and aid to help small businesses pay workers. US coronavirus deaths are around the 1,000 mark and there have been nearly 70,000 confirmed infections. More than 21,000 people with coronavirus have died across the world since it emerged in China's Hubei province in December, while the number of infections is racing towards half a million. Southern Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. One case lays bare America's testing failure A visual guide to the pandemic Coronavirus slowdown in US seen from space President Donald Trump, a Republican, said on Wednesday he would sign the fast-tracked bill as soon as it reached his desk. But the plan hit a speed bump as Republican senators Tim Scott, Rick Scott, Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham said its major expansion of unemployment benefits provided ""a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work"". They said they would oppose the bill unless it was fixed to ensure workers could not have a higher income while unemployed than in a job. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he would oppose the bill unless the Republicans dropped their objections. He also demanded tougher conditions on the legislation's ""corporate welfare"". This video can not be played 'My income vanished overnight with no safety net' In the end the Republican senators were allowed a vote on their amendment, which failed. The bill does have cross-party support but it must still be passed in votes in the Senate and House of Representatives before the president signs it into law. With revisions being made to the bill late into Wednesday, the Republican-majority Senate finally, and unanimously, approved it with a 96-0 vote. It now moves on to the House which is expected to vote on Friday. The face of America's fight against Covid-19 Trump says US tested more than S Korea - is he right? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was ""proud"" that not a single senator voted against the bill. The chamber's senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, said: ""And so this is a good ending, twists and turns were enormous. I always had faith we would [pass this bill] because America and the American people demanded it."" The agreement reached by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages. The nearly 900-page bill has a price tag that amounts to roughly half the size of the US government's annual budget, and includes: Direct payments of $1,200 to millions of individuals who earn $75,000 or less, and an additional $500 per each child An expansion of unemployment aid including payments, for the first time, to people who are self-employed or work in the gig economy A $500bn fund to help companies, which includes loans to hard-hit sectors such as the airline industry $350bn in loans for small businesses $100bn for hospitals and related health systems on the frontlines of the pandemic Mr McConnell described the package as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the US nation. The Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said she hoped the bill could be passed by voice vote. That would allow members of Congress - several of whom have coronavirus or are self-isolating - to stay away from the chamber in order to cast their votes. But if any member objected, lawmakers would be asked to return to Washington and vote over the course of an entire day, in order to limit how many people are present on the House floor at one time. LIVE UPDATES:Virus surges in US A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday it was likely half of America's most populous city of more than eight million would catch coronavirus by the time the pandemic ran its course. The city's death toll reached 280, officials said on Wednesday night, with 20,011 confirmed cases. On Tuesday,13 patients died in a matter of hours at a hospital,externalin the Queens borough of the city, with a young doctor there describing ""apocalyptic"" scenes, according to the New York Times. But there were signs of hope. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke of tentative indications that the spread of the disease may be slowing. On Sunday, hospital admissions were doubling every two days. But by Monday that rate had fallen to every 3.4 days, and on Tuesday every 4.7 days, Mr Cuomo said. The whole of New York state has had 285 coronavirus deaths and more than 33,000 patients - about half the total US caseload.  The US Federal Emergency Management Agency said New York, North Carolina and Hawaii had requested special mortuary teams to be ready for mass casualties. New Orleans, in Louisiana, where crowds celebrated Mardi Gras last month, has recorded the world's highest growth rate in coronavirus cases. California's Governor Gavin Newsom said one million Californians had registered as unemployed just this month. This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat The US is more than midway through a 15-day attempt to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing. Two more states - Minnesota and Idaho - issued state-wide ""stay at home"" orders on Wednesday, joining at least 17 others. The president said on Tuesday that reopening the country by Easter would be a ""beautiful timeline"". But Dr Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease expert who is helping lead the US response to coronavirus, told CNN on Wednesday: ""The virus makes the timeline.""

"The world has been given an indication of the economic impact of coronavirus as Singapore released its initial growth figures for this quarter. The trade-reliant city state now looks to be heading for its first full-year recession in about two decades. The figures suggest that the global economy is also set for a sharp contraction. This week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of a global recession worse than the one after the 2008 financial crisis. Singapore said gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 2.2% year-on-year while, compared with the previous quarter, GDP fell by 10.6%. It marks the biggest quarterly contraction for the South East Asian nation since 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis. US markets close higher after emergency virus deal How Singapore stayed one step ahead of the virus Should street food vendors be cleared off the streets? As one of first countries to release economic growth data for the period in which the outbreak has been spreading globally, the numbers from Singapore provide a glimpse of how the ongoing pandemic could affect economies around the world. Singapore was also one of the first countries outside China to report cases of the coronavirus. Later on Thursday Singapore announced a package worth $33.7bn (Â£28.3bn) to help cushion its economy from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes after the IMF this week forecast a global recession this year which would be at least as bad as the one seen in the wake of the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Lockdowns and other measures imposed by governments around the world to slow the spread of the virus are battering the global economy, with many analysts now expecting a deep, long recession.

They also hope to create a map that shows where outbreaks are happening and a method of distinguishing cases from those of the common cold. Experts have warned people to be cautious about which apps they download in relation to the virus. At present, Covid Symptom Tracker is the third most popular app in Apple's UK store and second in Google Play's new releases chart for the country. A health board in one of the worst affected areas of the UK is urgently seeking new staff.

Firms should get the same level of support wherever they are based, according to CBI Cymru director Ian Price. The business support group says this will allow them all to operate ""on a level playing field"". He called on the Welsh and UK governments to co-ordinate help for all. Mr Price said:

âFirms being hit hardest by Covid-19 donât care what government is providing help or what mechanisms are used, they need immediate, easy to access support that avoids excessive bureaucracy and puts protection of jobs first."" Workers have told BBC Wales they fear their safety is being put at risk by being told to go to work during the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government has saidpeople should only travel to work if it is absolutely essential or they are key workers. But a postal worker said he was ""really worried"" about contracting coronavirus at work and passing it on. And a mechanic says he felt ""bullied"" into going to work. British manufacturer Dyson has received an order for 10,000 ventilators from the UK government. BBC Business editor Simon Jack,externalreports the order will be ready in April and the firm will also donate an extra 1,000 to the UK, and 4,000 to other countries. Ministers have asked manufacturers to switch their production in order to make the equipment, which can be used to help keep the worst-affected Covid-19 patients alive. The UK has evenpublished the design online,externalin a bid to help. Around the world, major car firms - including Ford, Tesla and Fiat - have been among those toanswer similar calls from governments. Waste and recycling centres have closed and bin collections face disruption in five local authority areas. In Newport, collections are operating with reduced staff, with residents urged to have rubbish ready outside by 06:00 GMT on the morning it's due to be picked up. In Torfaen, green bin collections have been suspended while in Monmouthshire, grounds maintenance teams have been redeployed to support bin collection services, which are operating as normal as a result. Blaenau Gwent has seen the roll-out of a new commercial recycling service suspended. Key workers in Cardiff will no longer have to pay to park their vehicle on-street or in council-owned car parks. Cardiff council have lifted fees in 14 car parks across the city for key workers during the outbreak. âThese are unprecedented times,"" said councillor Caro Wild. ""Our key workers are doing a magnificent job and we want to do all that we can to support them, while also doing our best to ensure transmission of the virus is slowed or halted."" Heath Park car park, close to the University Hospital of Wales, has already been limited to NHS workers only. Major supermarkets in the UK are bringing in measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including limiting the number of people in stores and floor markings to help customers maintain a safe distance while queuing. Sainsburyâs, Tesco, Asda and the Co-Op are among those to implement changes, including extra hand sanitisers in stores for staff and customers to use, cleaning products to wipe down baskets or trolleys and putting up protective screens at checkouts. Stores have also asked people to try to arrive throughout the day, rather than first thing in the morning, and to pay by card. Sainsburyâs chief executive Mike Coupe wrote to customers on Wednesday to say âwe will limit the number of people allowed in our stores and at our ATMs at any one timeâ. Transport for Wales have shared a video on social media showing staff thanking passengers for staying home. ""We are supporting our key workers and health professionals during these difficult times,"" TfW said. Gwent Police have shared a video on social media which features Chief Constable Pam Kelly pleading with people to ""work with us"". She said the force would ""need to take action"" against people who ignored government advice in order to ""protect  our communities, vulnerable people and our NHS"".

""The site is currently operating within government guidelines for social distancing and guidance has been issued to all workers at the site, including advice about the regular washing of hands with soap and hot water,"" said a spokesman.

Opthalmologist James Morgan of Cardiff University said: ""While itâs tempting to undertake much needed DIY there is a risk and what we donât want is people coming in with injuries because they could displace other patients with a greater clinical need. ""Please take care. The services are really under stress and if thereâs one thing you can do to help the NHS, leave that DIY project for another day.â Welsh Government has welcomed the UK government's plans to help the
self-employed. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak
said self-employed people facing financial difficulties will be able to have
80% of their monthly wages covered by the UK government. Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said Mr Sunak's announcement was ""warmly welcomed"" in Cardiff. ""It will provide huge relief for hundreds of
thousands of people in Wales who are self-employed,"" he said. ""Of course, details are emerging about how the scheme will operate and we
will be looking very closely at what gaps there are that individuals may fall
through"". There are around 211,000 self-employed people in Wales. FSB Wales had earlier welcomed the commitment but said it would be calling on the Welsh Government to create a hardship fund to ""plug the gap"" until money was available in June. Mr Skates added the Welsh Government would be announcing news of a ""cross-sector, cross-government fund"" which ""matches
seamlessly"" with UK government support already announced. A council says its call centre staff have received a number of ""aggressive"" and ""abusive"" calls. A ""large majority"" of the calls were from ""patient and co-operative"",Flintshire council said in a statement,external. ""Sadly, a small minority of callers into our contact centres have been aggressive and at times abusive,"" the council said. ""Examples include council tax payers expecting a council tax âholidayâ because a local service such as a library has been temporarily closed. Behaviour of this type is unacceptable."" The council asked for ""good and caring"" conduct from residents calling in. Fifteen Welsh Labour MPs are urging UK ministers to state clearly when measures to deal with the coronavirus crisis apply to England only. They warn ""mixed messages"" could mean people lose confidence in their actions and refuse to comply with their advice. In a letter, the MPs highlight ""confusion"" over a business rates plan that did not specify Welsh ministers would have their own programme. They describe similar problems with an England-only NHS volunteering scheme.

A driving instructor does not know how she will get by while she waits to receive money from the government's fund for the self-employed. Lauren Cook said the payment was good ""in terms of the amount."" The 29-year-old, from Raglan, Monmouthshire, said: âHaving to wait for over two months for it is the problem, because of the bills - household bills but also with the business, paying the car and the insurance, things like that. âThere are a few clauses in it. How long you have got to wait.
You have got to wait 10 weeks, over two months. ""Just wondering how we are going to cope until I can get the money.â People who breach stringent new rules brought in to
tackle the coronavirus outbreak risk a fine of up to Â£120. First Minister Mark Drakeford has signed into law new
regulations setting out how the measures will be enforced. People found in breach of the rules will be fined Â£60 for a first offence, which rises to Â£120 for second and subsequent offences -
although people ignoring the new law could risk arrest if they do not comply. But while fines in England could reach as high as Â£960, that
will not happen in Wales. A fixed penalty notice for a first offence falls
to Â£30 if paid within 14 days. Ceri Welchman and her family A family trapped in South America by coronavius have spoken about their ordeal. As the pandemic rapidly spreads globally, many countries have introduced strict controls on domestic and foreign travel. Cardiff NHS occupational therapist, Ceri Welchman, her partner Salvatore Ledda and their four-year-old daughter Nicole had been touring South America since 4 January. When countries began closing borders, the family fled La Paz, Bolivia, to Sao Paulo, Brazil, to get a flight home. Two hours from the border, the Brazilian government closed its doors. ""There wasn't much thought given for tourists who were trying to get out,"" Ms Welchman said. ""My biggest worry is if anything happens to Nicole while we are here and couldn't leave."" A doctor at a hospital in one of the worst hit areas of the UK has told BBC Wales that colleagues were ""very, very nervous"". Gethin Williams, a
consultant surgeon at the Royal Gwent Hospital, said comparisons with Italy had made staff anxious at their level of exposure to the Covid-19 virus. On Wednesday, Sarah Aitken, director of public health at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which operates the Royal Gwent,said the area could be ""following Italy""as it is overwhelmed by a rapid rise in cases. Dr Williams said: ""We've read reports
from Italy and heard from colleagues in London that young, healthy doctors -
presumably exposed to a lot of viral load - are getting severe Covid infection
and being placed themselves on ventilators."" Labour MP Stephen Doughty has criticised the UK Government's proposed aid for the self-employed as having a ""huge sting in the tail."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced on Thursday up to Â£2,500 a month will be paid, but will not begin to arrive until the start of June. Mr Doughty said: ""What are millions of people supposed to do until June, not least when there's a five-week wait for universal credit? ""How do they put food on table and pay their bills? ""This is a big announcement but with a huge sting in the tail for millions of self-employed and freelancers."" The scheme must be brought forward, he said. ""Most people simply don't have the cash reserves in their bank accounts to get through one month, let alone three,"" he said. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales has welcomed chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement of support for self-employed people. Mr Sunak said self-employed people facing financial difficulties will be able to have 80% of their monthly wages covered by the government. It will be capped at Â£2,500 per month and will initially last three months. Speaking to Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales, FSB Wales' Ben Cottam said Mr Sunak's announcement went ""further than many people were expecting so is very much welcome"". But Mr Sunak also revealed people would have to wait until June to receive the money. There are nearly 211,000 self-employed people in Wales - that's 17% of the workforce. Mr Cottam said FSB Wales ""would want to sit down"" with the Welsh Government ""in very quick order"" to discuss the possibility of setting up a hardship fund for the self-employed to help ""plug the gap"" before June. The Royal College of Nursing in Wales has branded the wait for equipment to keep staff safe from Covid-19 ""intolerable"". Its director Helen Whyley said personal protection equipment, or PPE, was âessential"" for keeping staff safe. ""Letâs be clear: nurses have been committed, dedicated and patient while awaiting PPE but their altruism is drying up,"" she said. ""The added stress and anxiety of not knowing if they will receive PPE is intolerable. ""We would never ask any member to work in an environment that would leave them vulnerable. The number of people to have died with coronavirus in the UK has risen to 578, the Department of Health said.

"People wearing masks has become an ubiquitous sight in many places in Asia, including China Step outside your door without a face mask in Hong Kong, Seoul or Tokyo, and you may well get a disapproving look. In recent weeks, many European nations have issued advisories to wear a mask in certain public settings, and in England the latest advice is to wear a face coveringin ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"", such as public transport and some shops. Several US states have also given similar advice, and even the White House now makes it compulsory for all staff to wear face masks - though President Donald Trump still refuses to wear one. How to make your own face mask Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Many people are still not wearing masks despite official advice though, and some governments remain unconvinced about the science. Why some people embrace masks while others shun them is not just about government directives and medical advice - it's also about culture and history, a debate over evidence, and even about personal liberties. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the official advice from the World Health Organization has been that only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus. Nobody else needs to wear a mask, and experts have given several reasons for that. One is that a mask is not seen as reliable protection as other methods, given that current research shows the virus is spread by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. So it could protect you, but only in certain situations such as when you're in close quarters with others where someone infected might sneeze or cough near your face. This is why experts say frequent hand washing with soap and water is far more effective. This video can not be played With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus Removing a mask requires special attention to avoid hand contamination, and it could also breed a false sense of security where you end up ignoring or forgetting to practice good hygiene. Yet in some parts of Asia everyone wears a mask by default - it is seen as safer and more considerate. In mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, the broad assumption is that anyone could be a carrier of the virus, even healthy people. So in the spirit of solidarity, you need to protect others from yourself. Some places take this idea very seriously: in some parts of China, you could be arrested or punished for not wearing a mask. In Singapore, which used to discourage citizens from wearing masks, it's now compulsory to wear one outside or risk a fine of S$300 (Â£170, $210). Meanwhile in Indonesia and the Philippines, where there are suspicions that there are many under-reported cases, most people in major cities wear masks to protect themselves from others. For many of these countries, mask-wearing was a cultural norm even before the coronavirus outbreak. They've even become fashion statements - at one point Hello Kitty face masks were all the rage in the street markets of Hong Kong. How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared What can the West learn from Asia's coronavirus fight? In East Asia, many people are used to wearing masks when they are sick or when it's hay fever season, because it's considered impolite to be sneezing or coughing openly. In Hong Kong, you can buy different designs of masks The 2003 Sars virus outbreak, which affected several countries in the region, also drove home the importance of wearing masks, particularly in Hong Kong, where many died as a result of the virus. So one key difference between these societies and Western ones, is that they have experienced contagion before - and the memories are still fresh and painful. In some parts of Asia, seasonal air pollution or heavy traffic pollution in crowded cities have also made it pretty normal for people to wear masks outside. Some argue that ubiquitous mask wearing, as a very visual reminder of the dangers of the virus, could actually act as a ""behavioural nudge"" to you and others for overall better personal hygiene. ""Putting on a mask every day before you go out is like a ritual, like putting on a uniform, and in ritual behaviour you feel you have to live up to what the uniform stands for, which is more hygienic behaviour like not touching your face or avoiding crowded places and social distancing,"" said Donald Low, a behavioural economist and professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Can wearing a mask act as a daily reminder to yourself and others to practise better hygiene? Then, there's the idea that every little bit counts in the war the world is waging against the virus. ""We can't say if face masks are ineffective, but we presume they have some effect because that's the protection we give to healthcare workers,"" said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with Hong Kong University. ""If face masks are used on a lot of people in crowded areas, I think it would have some effect on public transmission, and at the moment we're looking for every small measure we can to reduce transmission - it adds up."" But there are down sides of course. Some places such as Japan, Indonesia and Thailand have faced shortages, and South Korea has had to ration out surgical masks. There is the fear that people may end up re-using disposable masks, which is unhygienic, or use inferior masks sold on the black market. Japan and Singapore have since given out reusable masks to its citizens. People who do not wear masks in these places have also been stigmatised, to the point that they are shunned and blocked from shops and buildings. In Hong Kong, some tabloids have splashed pictures on their covers of Westerners not wearing masks and congregating in groups in the city's nightlife district, and criticised expatriates and tourists for not taking enough precautions. But the discrimination works both ways. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In places where mask wearing is still not the norm despite government advisories, those who do wear masks have been shunned or even attacked. It hasn't helped that many of these mask wearers are Asians. In the US, it's become an issue of personal freedoms, with some arguing that making everyone wear face masks infringes on civil liberties. The city of Stillwater in Oklahoma was forced to soften a mask law to an advisory after threats of violence, while a Michigan security guard was killedafter he barred a shopper who didn't have a mask from entering a store. But those societies that do advocate everyone wearing a mask may have a point and increasingly,experts are now questioning the official WHO advice,external. Firstly, there is some emerging evidence that there are more ""silent carriers"", or healthy people with the virus who show little or no symptoms, than experts initially thought. In China,it is estimated that a third of all positive cases show no symptoms,external, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. On the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, about half of the more than 600 positive cases found onboard were found to have no symptoms.  A similar proportion of asymptomatic cases has been reported in Iceland. In Wuhan and Guangzhou, Chinese authorities have said those not wearing masks could face arrest The prevailing belief has been that because these people do not exhibit symptoms, they are not very contagious. But some are questioning this now. A recently published study of cases in China found that ""undocumented cases of infection"", or those with either mild or no symptoms, were significantly contagious andcould have been responsible for nearly 80% of positive virus cases,external. Meanwhile a Hong Kong study estimates thatup to 44% of virus transmission from an infected person can happen before that person starts showing any symptoms,external. So does that mean if everyone wore a mask, these silent carriers wouldn't turn into spreaders? The jury is still out on this issue, with various studies proving and disproving the effectiveness of a mask in stopping transmission of the coronavirus.  This is why some places have so far held back from mask laws and advisories, such as New Zealand which successfully controlled its outbreak andis holding back on advising citizens to wear masks because of the lack of scientific consensus,externaland clinical trials. Research is ongoing, and future studies will no doubt add nuance to the overall picture. The face mask may be a product of recent history, experience with contagion, and cultural norm. But as this pandemic evolves, along with evidence and research, our behaviour may change again.

"This video can not be played PM: Number of NHS volunteers in 24 hours equal to ""population of Coventry"" The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus has passed half a million, double the government's recruitment target. Speaking at his daily news conference, PM Boris Johnson said all 504,303 could now play an ""absolutely crucial"" role. The helpers are needed for delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments and phoning the isolated. The scheme is one of a number aimed at relieving pressure on the NHS. Mr Johnson said he a wanted to offer ""special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS"". He added: ""And to all of you, and all the former NHS staff who are coming back into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country."" About 11,000 former medics have also agreed to return to the health service and more than 24,000 final year student nurses and medics will join them. Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said there had been ""outbreaks of altruism"" and he was ""bowled over"" by the medics returning to the front line and the response from volunteers. This comes as it was confirmedPrince Charles, the 71-year-old heir to the throne, tested positive for coronavirusafter displaying mild symptoms. He is now self-isolating at home in Scotland with the Duchess of Cornwall, who tested negative. A Clarence House spokesman said it was not possible to know who he had caught it from due to a ""high number of engagements"" in recent weeks. Buckingham Palace shared a picture of the Queen at Windsor Castle, holding her weekly meeting with the prime minister over the phone Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the death toll in England to 414. There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures. The government scheme to recruit 250,000 helpers - who must be over 18 and in good health - went live on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, they had exceeded their target, after many thousands signed up toGood Sam,external, the group coordinating the response. The help is being targeted at the 1.5 million people with underlying health conditions who have been asked to shield themselves from the virus by staying at home for 12 weeks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick tweeted a photo of what he said was the first box of food and supplies ready to be sent out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are nowcalls to replicate the volunteering scheme- which is currently only for those in England - in Wales. Meanwhile,Parliament has shut down until 21 April at the earliest, after sweeping emergency powers to tackle the coronavirus crisis were passed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the emergency legislation will allow ""extraordinary measures"" never seen in peacetime in the UK. What is in emergency coronavirus legislation? Claudia is an actress and her industry has shut down Technology expertAlex Hamilton, from Northampton, was among the first to sign up. ""I'm working from home but it's quiet. I'm doing a lot of gardening and this is an opportunity to do something to help - I've volunteered to do anything necessary."" His wife has a low immune system after having breast cancer twice and says she has concerns ""about what I could be bringing back"". ""But I want to do good,"" he said. University tutorRobert Howarth, 23, from Blackburn, has also signed up. ""I just want to help,"" he says. He is currently working remotely and part-time, which he says gives him the chance to do more. ""I've signed up for two roles out of the four on offer - to be a befriender helping people in self-isolation and delivering vital products."" ActressClaudia Grantis another to have signed up. With much of her industry having shutdown, she says she has time to help. ""I hate to think of anyone struggling and I know the NHS is going to be stretched - I just want to do anything I can to help."" On Tuesday, it was also announced thatthe NHS will treat coronavirus patients in a makeshift field hospitalin the ExCeL Centre in east London. There has been widespread concern and anger at the shortages of personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Healthcare Supply Association has been forced to use Twitter to ask DIY shops to donate equipment to NHS staff. The prime minister said he has been ""assured"" stocks were on the way, saying the army had distributed 7.5 million pieces of equipment in the past 24 hours.

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The government is also facing growing pressure to stop non-essential construction work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock saidthose who cannot do their jobs from home should go to work to ""keep the country running""and construction work could continue so long as people were 2m (6.5ft) apart. But critics said public health should be prioritised over the economy. Some builders and construction workers have said they feel ""angry and unprotected""going to work, while others are under pressure from employers to go in. Mr Johnson has so far resistedpressure from politicians, unions and workers themselvesto halt construction work. This video can not be played A construction worker filmed colleagues failing to distance themselves The confusion over who should and should not be travelling for work came after government guidance announced by Mr Johnson on Monday curtailed many freedoms on life in the UK. The prime minister said people should only leave their home to shop for basic goods, to fulfil medical or care needs, to exercise, and to travel to and from work - but only where ""absolutely necessary"". Since Tuesday evening, hundreds of British Transport Police have been deployed onto the rail network to tell travellers that only those making essential journeys for work should be using tubes and trains. The prime minister confirmed the government was considering asking black taxi drivers to take NHS workers to work so that they can avoid public transport. Public services are coming under increasing strain - London Ambulance Service said it was receiving 8,000 calls a day - up 3,000 on a ""very busy"" day before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, calls to the 111 service have increased by up to 400%. The Department for Work and Pensions processed almost half a million benefit claims over nine days. What is banned and what isn't? Doctor 'kicked out by landlady' amid virus fears Meanwhile,the government is considering the early releaseof some prisoners in England and Wales to relieve pressure. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the virus posed an ""acute"" risk in prisons, many of which were overcrowded and faced staff shortages as officers self-isolated. Some 19 inmates have now tested positive for coronavirus in 10 different prisons. Elsewhere, the government remains under pressure to provide financial support for self-employed workers who face a loss of income if forced to stop working due to sickness or quarantine. Mr Johnson said a package of support for those workers would be announced on Thursday.

"This video can not be played Shafee Elsheikh and Alexander Kotey: Could face trial in US The UK acted unlawfully by passing evidence to the US that could lead to the execution of two British members of an Islamic State murder squad. The Supreme Court said former Home Secretary Sajid Javid should not have passed information on Shafee Elsheikh and Alexander Kotey to the US. Lord Kerr said the seven justices concluded the decision in 2018 breached the UK's strict data protection laws. The Londoners, linked to 27 murders, are in US custody in Iraq. Along with two other British men, they formed a foursome known as ""The Beatles"", allegedly helping to kidnap, torture and murder hostages. They were seized by Kurdish forces in 2018 as the Islamic State group began to crumble - and the US says it wants to prosecute them if the UK won't put the men on trial in London. Last year, the government agreed to hand over as many as 600 witness statements and related material after initially refusing to do so without a  guarantee they wouldn't face the death penalty. Elsheikh's mother, Maha Elgizouli, challenged the home secretary's decision to share that information with the US - not to prevent him from being prosecuted and jailed but to protect him from the death penalty. Welcoming the ruling, her lawyers said she recognised the difficult issues her case had raised. ""She has always expressed her belief that her son, if accused, should face justice - and that any trial should take place in the UK,"" they said in a statement. ""She has been asking since November 2018 for the CPS to conduct a review of the claim that there was insufficient evidence for him to be charged and tried in the UK - a review that the CPS now says should be completed by April 2020."" Now the court has ruled in her favour. There must be a further decision over what the UK must now do to comply with the law - including potentially asking the US to hand back information. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The government's priority has always been to maintain national security and to deliver justice for the victims and their families. This has not changed. We are clearly very disappointed with today's judgment and are carefully considering next steps."" Explaining the judgment over an unprecedented video link, due to coronavirus measures, Lord Kerr said: ""Much of the information provided, or to be provided, to the US authorities consisted of personal data. He said a transfer of personal data to a third country was only lawful if it was based on there being appropriate safeguards or on special circumstances. ""Here there was no adequacy decision and no appropriate safeguards,"" he added. Lord Kerr: Delivering judgment by video link due to coronavirus measures In the weeks leading up to the decision, British diplomats in Washington warned Mr Javid that US President Donald Trump would be ""wound up"" by any continued refusal by London to hand over the information American prosecutors needed. Lord Kerr said the decision by Mr Javid to transfer the information was ""based on political expediency, rather than strict necessity"". The seven justices however were split over whether the UK had a more wide-ranging legal bar on sharing any information with the US that could put someone at risk of capital punishment. The UK currently won't extradite someone to face trial in the US or other countries unless it first receives an assurance that they will not be put to death. However, the law on sharing information that could be used against someone already in the other country's custody, is less clear. Lord Kerr said: ""Law must be responsive to society's contemporary needs, standards and values, which are in a state of constant change. That is an essential part of the human condition and experience. ""I concluded, therefore, that a common law principle should be recognised whereby it is deemed unlawful to facilitate the trial of any individual in a foreign country where, to do so, would put that person in peril of being executed."" A majority of the other justices disagreed - concluding that the law did not extend that far because Parliament had not explicitly banned ministers from sharing information on criminals with countries that use the death penalty.

Here's a recap of the day's main developments:  You can keep up to date with all the latest developments on this storyon the BBC website. The naval hospital ship USNS Comfort will leave Virginia on Saturday, reaching New York Harbour on Monday, three weeks ahead of schedule, President Trump said at his daily press briefing. The ship will help lighten the load for New Yorkâs hospitals - now overwhelmed by the coronavirus outbreak. The state is the centre of the US crisis, home to at least 37,258 Covid-19 infections and 385 deaths. Trump will travel to Virginia to âkiss it goodbye,â he said. âItâs an extraordinary step,â New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week of the ship. âItâs literally a floating hospital.â The president also repeated his calls for Americans to return to work as soon as possible. âWe have to get back to work, our people want to work,â he said. âThis is the United States of America, they donât want to sit around and wait.â A cold beer or glass of red wine might seem exactly what you want right now if you have been ordered to stay at home, but experts have warned alcohol is an ""unhelpful coping strategy"". Experts from the European arm of the World Health Organization (WHO) say it is ""natural"" to feel anxious or lonely because of coronavirus restrictions but that substances like alcohol ""will not help to manage the stress of self-isolation"". The recommendation comes a day afteroff-licences were addedto the UK government's list of retailers allowed to stay open. Dr Aiysha Malik, technical officer for the WHO department of mental health, says: ""When weâre staying at home routines are very important for creating a sense of structure. ""Minimising the unhelpful coping strategies of using tobacco or alcohol can also be important for wellbeing and minimising content you might find distressing in the news."" For most people, the answer is no. At the moment, only patients in hospital with flu-like symptoms are being routinely tested for the virus. The government's priority is to increase the number of people being tested to see if they currently have the disease. The test being used is known as a PCR test. A swab from your throat or nose has to be taken and tested in the lab. But scientists are also looking at tests which can check whether someone has had the disease in the past. These look for markers of immunity called antibodies in the blood. They are faster than PCR tests, using a drop of blood on a device a bit like a pregnancy test. However, it could be a while before they are available. Our health reporter Rachel Schraer answers some other frequently asked questions about tests. With the UK on coronavirus lockdown, some young people have been forced to isolate alongside parents who don't accept their sexuality. After the coronavirus outbreak suddenly ended a UK tour he was performing in, Sam, 23, a dancer, from Birmingham, says he had ""no choice"" but to move back to his ""strict"" Christian family home. ""I saw the career I love disappear overnight, and now I'm stuck in isolation with homophobes."" Even though Sam chose to return home, he says he is ""struggling"" because he can't be himself. ""My mum says that homosexuality is an evil disease and that the devil is making me gay. She loudly prays every day that I'll be delivered from sin and find a wife. ""I genuinely have nowhere else to go during this mad time, so I'm just putting up with the abuse.""Click here for more from our LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte on people living in lockdown with homophobic parents. The UK government has announced an extra Â£210m in funding for international researchers working to find a coronavirus vaccine. The latest donation, announced following a call between G20 leaders earlier, is on top of Â£40m already pledged by the UK. It will go towards research done by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, headquartered in Norway. The foundation recently called on governments to provide an extra $2bn (Â£1.64bn) to help it develop a vaccine. The Indy 500 - one of the biggest motorsport races in the world - has become the latest major sporting event to be postponed. The American race will now take place on 23 August instead of 24 May because of the coronavirus. Several other sports competitions have been moved or cancelled today. Millions of parents are trying to school their children at home and anEnglish teacher has amassed thousands of followersworldwide after just three online lessons. Holly King-Mand from Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire is providing her daily English Live sessions on Facebook. She had 74 followers last week and that number has risen to more than 18,000. ""It's quite overwhelming,"" she said. ""I guess I just posted in the right place at the right time."" As parts of the world adjust to self-isolation and lockdown, more than 600,000 people have signed up in March alone for a free online course from Yale University designed to help live a more fulfilling life. The Science of Well Being, which was taught in classrooms at the US university in 2018, is now the most popular course in Yale's 319-year history. It is ""designed to increase your own happiness and build more productive habits"" as well as ""revealing misconceptions about happiness and annoying features of the mind that lead us to think the way we do"". More than 1.1 million people are enrolled on the course in total. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Is it all doom and gloom? It was just a brief moment in the daily press briefing, but England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries did offer some positive news. She said the coronavirus outbreak was âstarting to move in the right directionâ. Other countries which have been on a steep curve have seen the number of new cases rise by a third every day. But the UK trajectory is nowhere near that steep. Five days ago 1,000 new cases were reported. Today 2,000 were. That may seem alarming, but if we had been on a steep upwards path todayâs figures would have been twice as high. It suggests some of the early social distancing measures taken before the lockdown have maybe started to have an impact. We should be cautious. It is only a few days worth of data - and Dr Harries was clear we must not take  âour foot off the pedalâ. But with all the bad news around, the words offer a glimmer of hope to an anxious nation. As we reported earlier, there are now more confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US than in any other country in the world. At 82,404 cases, it has overtaken both China with 81,782 cases and Italy with 80,589 cases, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Asked at a press conference if he was surprised America had overtaken China, US President Donald Trump said ""itâs a tribute to the amount of testing that weâre doing"". The president also suggested that Chinaâs numbers were higher than was being reported. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News From the team thatâs been assessing the risks to the UK
comes a study of the global impact of the pandemic, and it makes grim reading. The scientists conclude that only with the most draconian and rapid action can
a death toll running into many millions be avoided. Around the world as many as 30 million lives could be saved if governments take quick action, a study by scientists at Imperial College London says. In the least developed
countries, with large households including older people more at risk from
infection, the effects may be devastating. In the worst scenarios, where
healthcare systems are weak, the numbers needing intensive care may be 25 times
greater than what can be provided. The work is based on computer simulations,
known as models. The scientists are careful to say theyâre not offering
exact predictions but instead a broad perspective of the dangers for governments
of not responding quickly. Craig Spencer, the director of global health in emergency medicine at New York Medical Center, has been speaking to the BBC of fears that hospitals in New York are already very close to being overwhelmed. The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, had compared the speed of the spread to ""a bullet train"" but has since said there are signs the spread may be slowing. This video can not be played Coronavirus: âHospitals in New York are already reaching capacityâ The US has become the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, which says it now has overtaken China with 82,404 confirmed cases. Earlier we shared the Queen Elizabeth II's message of thanks for the UK's frontline health and care workers. And the Queen's great grandchildren have also shown their support for the National Health Service (NHS) and emergency staff in a touching tribute on Instagram. Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis are seen clapping in a video recorded sometime before the nation celebrated key workers at 20:00 GMT. ""To all the doctors, nurses, carers, GPs, pharmacists, volunteers and other NHS staff working tirelessly to help those affected by Covid-19: thank you,"" the caption reads. Allow Instagram content?

Well, very quiet. Here's Buckingham Palace just a couple of weeks ago... And this week... See more images from around the UKbefore and after lockdown here. Our technology desk editor Leo Kelion reports how the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is working with three US technology firms to co-ordinate medical equipment during the coronavirus outbreak. The NHS will partner with Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir - as well as UK-based Faculty AI - to develop a ""dashboard"" to bring together data including where ventilators are being used and how long patients with Covid-19 are spending in hospital. The scheme hopes to flag emerging hotspots and that a version of the dashboard could be released to the public. Read more here. Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Top US indexes just
notched their third day in a row of gains with the Dow and S&P 500 up more
than 6% - despite the fact that the number of Americans filing for unemployment
skyrocketed to a record 3.28 million. The stock market, which had seen trillions in value wiped out in recent weeks
as the coronavirus reset investor expectations, is famously forward looking, so
does that mean things could be on the upswing? Some of the rally is due to the more than $2tn relief package set to clear the
US Congress, which includes aid for households and companies. But share prices have gyrated wildly in recent weeks, and analysts warn that
the economic shock from the near overnight elimination of incomes is
unprecedented. A State of Michigan Unemployment Agency office in Detroit As the coronavirus outbreak continues to pummel the US, nearly nine in 10 Americans - 88% - say the virus is a major threat to the health of the US economy, while 66% see it as a major threat to the health of the US population as a whole, according to anew report from the Pew Research Center.,external The number of Americans filing for unemployment has surged to a record high as the economy goes into shutdown. Minority groups have been hardest hit by the punishing economic trends, according to the report. Almost half of Hispanics - 49% - say that someone in their household has lost their job or taken a pay cut as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Among young adults - aged 18 to 29 - 46% say the same. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (Â£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%. Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal. Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday saidhe wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus. The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" THE LATEST:Live updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. US stocks surged in anticipation of the massive economic stimulus deal Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment.

"This video can not be played ""People in your profession write fake news - you do"", President Trump tells journalist The US Senate has passed a $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill that is the largest economic stimulus in US history. The vote was delayed by a last-minute row between Republican and Democratic senators over unemployment benefits. The plan includes direct payments of $1,200 to most American adults and aid to help small businesses pay workers. US coronavirus deaths are around the 1,000 mark and there have been nearly 70,000 confirmed infections. More than 21,000 people with coronavirus have died across the world since it emerged in China's Hubei province in December, while the number of infections is racing towards half a million. Southern Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. One case lays bare America's testing failure A visual guide to the pandemic Coronavirus slowdown in US seen from space President Donald Trump, a Republican, said on Wednesday he would sign the fast-tracked bill as soon as it reached his desk. But the plan hit a speed bump as Republican senators Tim Scott, Rick Scott, Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham said its major expansion of unemployment benefits provided ""a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work"". They said they would oppose the bill unless it was fixed to ensure workers could not have a higher income while unemployed than in a job. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he would oppose the bill unless the Republicans dropped their objections. He also demanded tougher conditions on the legislation's ""corporate welfare"". This video can not be played 'My income vanished overnight with no safety net' In the end the Republican senators were allowed a vote on their amendment, which failed. The bill does have cross-party support but it must still be passed in votes in the Senate and House of Representatives before the president signs it into law. With revisions being made to the bill late into Wednesday, the Republican-majority Senate finally, and unanimously, approved it with a 96-0 vote. It now moves on to the House which is expected to vote on Friday. The face of America's fight against Covid-19 Trump says US tested more than S Korea - is he right? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was ""proud"" that not a single senator voted against the bill. The chamber's senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, said: ""And so this is a good ending, twists and turns were enormous. I always had faith we would [pass this bill] because America and the American people demanded it."" The agreement reached by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages. The nearly 900-page bill has a price tag that amounts to roughly half the size of the US government's annual budget, and includes: Direct payments of $1,200 to millions of individuals who earn $75,000 or less, and an additional $500 per each child An expansion of unemployment aid including payments, for the first time, to people who are self-employed or work in the gig economy A $500bn fund to help companies, which includes loans to hard-hit sectors such as the airline industry $350bn in loans for small businesses $100bn for hospitals and related health systems on the frontlines of the pandemic Mr McConnell described the package as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the US nation. The Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said she hoped the bill could be passed by voice vote. That would allow members of Congress - several of whom have coronavirus or are self-isolating - to stay away from the chamber in order to cast their votes. But if any member objected, lawmakers would be asked to return to Washington and vote over the course of an entire day, in order to limit how many people are present on the House floor at one time. LIVE UPDATES:Virus surges in US A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday it was likely half of America's most populous city of more than eight million would catch coronavirus by the time the pandemic ran its course. The city's death toll reached 280, officials said on Wednesday night, with 20,011 confirmed cases. On Tuesday,13 patients died in a matter of hours at a hospital,externalin the Queens borough of the city, with a young doctor there describing ""apocalyptic"" scenes, according to the New York Times. But there were signs of hope. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke of tentative indications that the spread of the disease may be slowing. On Sunday, hospital admissions were doubling every two days. But by Monday that rate had fallen to every 3.4 days, and on Tuesday every 4.7 days, Mr Cuomo said. The whole of New York state has had 285 coronavirus deaths and more than 33,000 patients - about half the total US caseload.  The US Federal Emergency Management Agency said New York, North Carolina and Hawaii had requested special mortuary teams to be ready for mass casualties. New Orleans, in Louisiana, where crowds celebrated Mardi Gras last month, has recorded the world's highest growth rate in coronavirus cases. California's Governor Gavin Newsom said one million Californians had registered as unemployed just this month. This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat The US is more than midway through a 15-day attempt to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing. Two more states - Minnesota and Idaho - issued state-wide ""stay at home"" orders on Wednesday, joining at least 17 others. The president said on Tuesday that reopening the country by Easter would be a ""beautiful timeline"". But Dr Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease expert who is helping lead the US response to coronavirus, told CNN on Wednesday: ""The virus makes the timeline.""
