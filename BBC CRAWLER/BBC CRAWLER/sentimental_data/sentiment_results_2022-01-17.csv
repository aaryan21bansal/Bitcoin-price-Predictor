"This video can not be played ""The earlier you release people from isolation, the more risk there is that they'll pass it on"" Cutting Wales' Covid self-isolation period to five days would help Labour ministers ""atone for the damage"" they have done to business, opposition Tories have said. The party has joined calls for Wales toadopt England's new rules. A charity boss said cutting the isolation period would help people return to work more quickly. Wales' chief medical officer (CMO) said nations that took a more precautionary approach have seen better Covid rates. Dr Sir Frank Atherton said ministers would look at whether they should change the self-isolation rules this week. Wales case rate has fallen to the lowest level since 18 December - 650.02 cases per 100,000 people. What are the new Covid rules for Wales? Christmas Covid rules 'cost pubs Â£16,000 each' The Welsh Conservatives have been critical of Mr Drakeford's handling of the Omicron wave, and argued against new restrictions imposed during the winter. Health spokesman Russell George said: ""With the booster jab rollout so advanced, the need to keep public services staffed, and the increasing desire to move to a point where we live with the virus, the time for cutting the self-isolation has come. ""We've already seen Labour's botched over-reaction to Omicron and how that has impacted businesses. By cutting the self-isolation period, they can start atoning for the damage they have done."" Lakshmy Pengelly said any reduction in the isolation period would be a help Care home owner Lakshmy Pengelly backed cutting the isolation period from seven to five days. Ms Pengelly, owner of Ashley Court Care, in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said the home was dealing with three to four staff testing positive every week. ""You're losing batches of staff each week and then having to scramble around changing roles,"" Ms Pengelly said. She described it as ""a struggle"", but said the care home had managed to continue providing the basic service levels required to keep people safe. She would ""definitely"" welcome a reduction in isolation, adding: ""Anything less than what it is now would be a help. Rhun ap Iorwerth, health spokesman for Plaid Cymru, said his party wanted to see the self-isolation time reduced, but it ""must be led by the evidence that it is safe to do so, rather than pressure from political opportunists"". A charity that gives care and support to people with learning difficulties, Perthyn, is also asking for changes. It employs about 850 staff, providing support for more than 250 people across Wales and the east Midlands, according to its website. ""Getting staff back has been an absolute priority"", says Perthyn chief executive Steve Cox Boss Steve Cox said January had been the most challenging period in the pandemic and said ""it would be really helpful if we were able to get staff back as quickly as possible and we want to do that in a way that is safe for them and safe for the people they support"". ""Given there's a criteria of having two negative tests to come back, we feel that is enough of a safeguard,"" he added. Announcing the changes in England, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said UK Health Security Agency data showed thattwo-thirds of positive cases were no longer infectious by day five. Jane Dodds, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said her party would also cautiously welcome the isolation period being cut, but sought a guarantee from ministers that it would change it back ""if case rates dramatically increase and the evidence warrants it"". Dr Sir Frank Atherton, Wales' CMO, said there was a ""trade-off"" between the economic benefits of reducing the isolation time and the risk you face by reducing it. ""If everyone was to be released on day five after they tested positive or developed symptoms or coronavirus, then about 30% of people would still be infectious,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""That can be reduced if we if we use lateral flow test sequentially on the two days before release. ""But whatever you choose to do, the risk of infectious people in the community does increase if you reduce the number of days, so that's advice that we'll be putting up to ministers this week."" Virologist Richard Stanton warned Omicron could stay in the body longer than other forms of the virus Cardiff University virology reader Richard Stanton said Omicron could stay in the body longer than previous variants. With the Alpha and Delta variants, he said infected people continued producing the virus for two to three days after showing symptoms. ""We are getting data through which suggests that Omicron maybe in your nose and mouth for longer,"" explained Dr Stanton. ""If we look at day six, after you start having symptoms, about half of people will still have infectious virus in their mouth and nose at that time."" ""It's risky if we just say you can come out of your self-isolation after five days. The important point is that it's being combined with lateral flow tests."" Responding to Conservative criticism, the CMO said UK nations that took a more precautionary approach to Omicron have seen lower rates than England. ""If we look at our rates of hospitalisation, they'll be lower,"" he said. ""There's good evidence to suggest that the measures we put in place were appropriate and have actually helped to save people from harm and save lives."" From Monday, people in England will be able to leave isolation after negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Ministers touted the move as a way to reduce staffing pressures in some sectors. The self-isolation period was previously cut from 10 to seven days, and that isstill the case in Wales. On Friday, Mr Drakeford said: ""We will study whatever evidence is now available and if we think it is safe, if our chief medical officer and scientific adviser say to us that we can now move down the days in a way that doesn't cause risk to others, of course that's what we will do. ""But we are yet to see that evidence or to get that advice."" Covid rules easing welcomed by sports clubs What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

"MI5 issued an alert about Christine Lee on Thursday The shockwaves are still being felt from MI5's interference alert to Parliament last week but the signs are it will not be the last. MI5 said Christine Lee, a well known lawyer in the UK Chinese community, was working covertly on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to further its interests. Ms Lee is not accused of being engaged in espionage - stealing secrets - but interference. Ministers and officials say that there will be more alerts in the future as the security services seek to disrupt those covertly influencing public life. But there are questions about whether enough has been done to counter foreign interference and why new laws have yet to be passed. Whitehall sources say the decision to issue the alert was taken months ago and after a long running investigation. The view was that the only way to disrupt the threat was to effectively go public, issuing a warning to Parliament that everyone knew would immediately gain huge publicity - only the second time this has been done. And future alerts may be issued even beyond Parliament to reflect the fact this is not the only area of public life believed to be at risk. MI5 warning over 'Chinese agent' in Parliament UK MPs banned by China vow to 'redouble' efforts Christine Lee is not being prosecuted and has not yet responded to the allegations. The alert alleged that she had facilitated donations designed to look as if they came from within the UK but actually came from China and Hong Kong. Labour MP Barry Gardiner received more than Â£400,000 of funding for his office over five years and looks to have been the largest recipient of money - although the effort to gain influence is alleged to have crossed party lines. He told Parliament the issuing of the alert was not based on the donations to his office, which stopped in 2020, raising the question of whether it was new funding to others that generated the concern. It is notable the warning refers to aspiring as well as existing parliamentarians, and the accusation seems to be that the Chinese Communist Party may have been trying to cultivate a new set of politicians. Labour MP Barry Gardiner received donations from Christine Lee's company Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Home Secretary Priti Patel denied the government had been complacent about the threat of foreign influence. But there have been questions about whether enough has been done on the issue. The Russia Report of July 2020highlighted concerns over Moscow's interference in public life. It criticised the security services and politicians for not doing enough to counter the issue. One problem is that the security services are nervous of getting too involved in politics. Even though Parliament has long been a target for espionage (and some past MPs have even been spies themselves), MI5 has been cautious about being drawn into being used as a tool to target political opponents. Some inside feared this was happening in the 1980s when the Conservative government pushed it to investigate alleged foreign backing for striking miners and peace campaigners. But events such as Russian trolls intervening in the US 2016 election forced the issue of interference back up the national security agenda. And in recent years, China has also risen up that agenda with concerns it is using its economic power - often with the offer of business deals or money - to secure influence. The worry is that states like Russia and China are not just openly lobbying in the way many other states operate, but using covert techniques to influence politics in their favour. This might mean deploying undercover agents, providing funding or creating dependency through business deals to do things like soften foreign policy, approve business takeovers or investments decisions, or prevent criticism on human rights. But a challenge has been that even when foreign interference is uncovered, it is not always breaking existing laws. That is why there has been growing pressure to close down loopholes and introduce new powers. One that has been looked at is a foreign agent registration act - the US has a law which allows individuals to be prosecuted if they have failed to register that they are working on behalf of another country. The British government consulted on new powers to ""counter hostile state activity"" last year which are designed to offer new tools. But they have still not yet come before Parliament. There are also calls to do more to clamp down on political donations - for instance those through shell companies which might be used to mask foreign cash. The government is now promising action on many of these areas but there is still no timetable for those new powers and in the meantime, the security services may well feel the only option they have to disrupt foreign interference is to issue more alerts.

"An auction of seabed plots for major offshore wind projects around the Scottish coast has netted Â£700m. Seventeen projects covering a total of 7,000km2 have been chosen in the first such leasing round in a decade. They have a combined potential generating capacity of 25GW - well above the expected auction outcome of 10GW. Scotland has 1.9GW of operational offshore wind, and another 8.4GW in construction or advanced development. The ScotWind leasing auction attracted more than 70 bids frommajor oil companies, utility firms and investment fundsfrom around the world. Will ScotWind auction deliver a renewables revolution? ScotWind offshore wind auction attracts 74 bids Most of the sites are on the east, north east or northern coast, with just one on the western side of Scotland. Successful bidders include Scottish Power, which won the seabed rights to develop three new offshore wind farms with a total capacity of 7GW. They include two new floating projects in conjunction with Shell and one fixed project. Shell New Energies is the lead applicant on the most expensive development, off the coast of Aberdeen, estimated to cost Â£86m in option fees. BP Alternative Energy Investments and SSE Renewables will each pay Â£85.9m in fees for two sites. The auction process was overseen by Crown Estate Scotland, with funds raised from the process going to the Scottish government. The winners have now been offered option agreements which reserve the rights to specific areas of seabed. They include parts of the North Sea to the east of Angus, the outer Moray Firth, west of Orkney and north-west of both Lewis and Islay. Although there was a sea area east of Shetland offered for the auction, this was not allocated to any bidder. ScotWind represents a major sea-change in how we generate our electricity in Scotland. By the time they're all built, an estimated six million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be prevented from entering our atmosphere each year. That's about an eighth of all Scotland's emissions for 2019. But we've already largely decarbonised our electricity sector. So, why build more offshore wind farms? The inherent unpredictability of the wind means we need masses of overcapacity to allow us to keep the lights on when some of the turbines are not turning.  But those looking after the grid need to be more clever than just building more turbines. That means a growing use of smart technology and increased storage - through batteries or green hydrogen - will become critical in the coming years. Crown Estate Scotland chief executive Simon Hodge said: ""Today's results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland's ability to transform our energy sector. ""In addition to the environmental benefits, this also represents a major investment in the Scottish economy, with around Â£700m being delivered straight into the public finances and billions of pounds worth of supply chain commitments."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the ScotWind auction as a ""truly historic opportunity for Scotland's net zero economy"". She added: ""The scale of opportunity represented in today's announcement exceeds our current planning assumption of 10GW of offshore wind - which is a massive vote of confidence in Scotland."" Scottish Renewables said the announcement was ""an exciting and significant moment in Scotland's renewable energy story"". Chief executive Claire Mack added: ""The potential for 17 new projects creates huge ambition for our sector to deliver on, and will require strong collaboration to deliver maximum impact for our economy and environment."" WWF Scotland said the outcome was a ""big vote of confidence in renewable power and Scotland's green economy"". The environmental group's climate and energy lead, Fabrice Leveque, said: ""Offshore wind has a vital role to play in helping to cut our climate emissions, and is already powering hundreds of thousands of Scottish homes. ""Each of these projects could create hundreds of jobs and will have a role in helping put Scotland on a path to a green recovery."" However, RSPB Scotland criticised the announcement, claiming it could ""accelerate some seabird species towards extinction in Scotland"". Aedan Smith, the charity's head of policy and advocacy said: ""Offshore wind has an important role to play in helping halt climate change. ""However, the offshore wind projects already consented in Scotland are predicted to kill hundreds of seabirds like kittiwakes, gannets and puffins every year. ""The potential projects announced today would be many times bigger than those existing projects and would greatly increase those impacts."" RSPB Scotland is concerned about the impact of the new wind farm projects on seabirds such as puffins Meanwhile, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) raised concerns about what the projects would mean for their industry. Chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said: ""In the rush to energy transition, it is vital that our industry's voice is properly heard and that the fleet's access to Scotland's productive fishing grounds is protected. ""In particular, proper scrutiny must be given to developers' claims that offshore windfarms and fishing activity can co-exist with little change to existing patterns of activity, since our experience to date shows very strongly that the opposite is the case."" The auction was originally meant to close at the end of March last year, but was delayed after a parallel English and Welsh auctionresulted in far higher prices than expected. At risk of losing out on hundreds of millions of pounds if it stuck to its original auction price guidelines, CES raised the cap for the auction bids from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 per square kilometre. The Scottish government has set a target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. Will ScotWind auction deliver a renewables revolution?

"Fans arriving in Glasgow faced a higher level of vaccine passport checks Large outdoor public events such as football matches can take place again after some of Scotland's Covid restrictions were relaxed. The Celtic vs Hibs match in Glasgow was the first test of revised rules which require the vaccine certification of at least 50% of attendees to be checked. Restrictions on indoor sports, events and venues remain in place. But Holyrood will be updated on Tuesday as to when these will be removed. Nicola Sturgeon has previously saidshe is hopeful that the restrictions on indoor events can be liftedon 24 January. As well as the changes to outdoor events, the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" for the purpose of vaccine passports has changed and now includes having a booster if the second dose was more than four months ago. Is the pandemic entering its endgame? 'Cause for optimism' in case rate data Number of Covid deaths in Scotland passes 10,000 Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said the latest data indicates ""encouraging signs of progress"". He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that the full effect of schools returning and the increased socialising that brings remains to be seen. But Sir Gregor added: ""At this moment in time I am feeling quite optimistic."" On the return of football he urged fans to be wary of shared transport and going somewhere before the game. The chief medical officer highlighted the importance of taking a lateral flow beforehand, avoiding ""choke points"" in the stadium and wearing a face covering. He also warned it was too early to ""big bold steps"" such asreported plans to scrap self isolation,external. Fans have become used to vaccine passports checks. It was the inconvenience most were willing to accept to get back through the turnstiles after a year of being locked out during lockdown. Now, after a three week winter break, they're being asked once again to provide proof, not only of double vaccination but also of a booster jag. Spot checks will increase and that could potentially lead to longer queues but it was the trade off between sport and government to get things moving again. With Covid figures looking more positive, the hope is that we've seen the last of fans being locked out. If nothing else, the restrictions have served as a stark reminder of the importance of spectators to the sporting experience. The clicking sound of the turnstiles, for thousands across the country, will be the welcome sound of normality. SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster told BBC Scotland that bringing the winter break forward for top-flight clubs to coincide with the three-week crowd restrictions was a gamble that had paid off. About 60,000 fans were expected at Monday's game. He said: ""Football really is nothing without the fans as we have seen with some games effectively played behind closed doors. ""It doesn't work for anyone; financially for the clubs and from a fan point of view. ""I sincerely hope we have seen the back of these restrictions and look forward to the fans returning."" The hospitality trade has been required to introduce a raft of changes as part of the latest Covid restrictions which are in force until at least 24 January All outdoor events have been limited to just 500 people for the last three weeks as part of a raft of measures to help slow the spread of Omicron variant. In recent days, a slowdown in infection rates hasgiven experts ""cause for optimism""that the country might be over the worse of the infection surge. But the number of Covid patients in hospital remains high and staff shortages as a result of the pandemic are putting pressure on the NHS and social care services. Prof Helen Colquhoun told Good Morning Scotland that it was ""entirely appropriate"" that the restrictions were lifted. The University of Edinburgh public health expert said the translation of cases to hospital numbers was not as bad as feared last month and described the current wave as ""mild"". She believes the Scottish government should now focus on protecting the vulnerable and promoting the booster campaign while considering the ""end game"". Prof Colquhoun said: ""At the moment there is still very much an emphasis on keeping transmissions down because there remains concern about pressure on the NHS. ""But it's time to consider where we are really trying to get to at this stage as we move towards endemicity of the virus."" The hospitality trade will be closely watching the first minister's update to Holyrood on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon is expected to given an indication on when nightclubs will be able to reopen and when restrictions on hospitality venues - such as the need for table service and social distancing - will be relaxed. The first minister may also give more detail on whether the vaccine passport scheme will be extended to more venues. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"The armed forces are set to take charge of operations looking to limit migrant crossings in the English Channel. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the MoD had been commissioned as a ""crucial operational partner to protect our Channel against illegal migration"". But Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood criticised the plans as ""rushed"" and a ""massive distraction"" for the military. The move could begin within weeks, the BBC understands. Rear Admiral Mike Utley, the commander of the UK strike force, has been appointed to co-ordinate the plans. The number of people who crossed last year wastreble that of 2020. On Saturday alone, 197 people were intercepted or rescued attempting to cross the English Channel, the Home Office said. French authorities stopped 95 people on five vessels from making the journey. Ministry of Defence (MoD)Â sources told the BBC discussions about the armed forces working with the Home Office and UK Border Force had been taking place for several weeks. They said no decisions had been made over how the Royal Navy or other services would be involved, and there was no indication it would involve pushing migrant boats back to France. That is despite Ms Patel suggesting in the House of Commons that the armed forces could be involved in the controversial policy, saying this was ""absolutely the policy of this government"". A source added the details of how the military could co-ordinate operations were still to be worked out, while another said there was ""trepidation"" within the MoD about getting involved in such a complex issue. It is understood overall policy on migration and migrant management would still be led by the Home Office. But the plans, firstreported in the Times,external, could see Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the navy authority over government vessels in the channel. Channel migrants tragedy - Terrifying final hours of their fatal journey Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in small boats in 2021 - up from 8,417 people the year before - despite huge UK investment in France to prevent crossings. On 24 November at least27 people died after their boat sank, in the largest single loss of life in the Channel since records began in 2014. Ms Patel told MPs crossings were ""unfair, unacceptable and lethally dangerous"" as well as ""totally unnecessary"". She said France, and other EU member states, were ""safe countries with long-established asylum systems"". She added she had asked for ""naval MoD assets and support back in 2020"". ""No one department can resolve the complex issue of Channel crossings on their own,"" she added. Asked about the move on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it would help to avoid a situation where ""Border Force or other vessels in the Channel are being co-ordinated separately"". But Mr Ellwood, who is also a former veterans minister, described the proposals as being ""rushed out"". Speaking to Sky News, the Conservative MP said the plans were a ""massive distraction"" for the military amid growing threats from Russia and China, adding: ""This isn't what our navy should be doing."" For a prime minister who promised his Brexit deal would see the UK take back control of its borders, the failure to stop record numbers of asylum seekers arriving on the Kent coast in small boats is a political embarrassment. However, putting a rear admiral in charge of operations in the Channel is unlikely to make much difference. The Royal Navy may be able to provide better intelligence on where inflatables and dinghies are expected to make landfall, but the great majority of those coming to seek sanctuary in Britain are already intercepted before they reach the coast. Plans to push small boats back into French waters appear to have been deemed too dangerous and the often-trailed idea of processing migrants ""offshore"" in another country has so far failed to materialise. Migrant arrival facilities in Kent are currently being expanded. The reason for the increase in asylum seekers risking the perilous journey across the Channel is that Covid and improved security at Calais has effectively closed traditional points of entry. The government and refugee organisations agree the long-term solution is the creation of official safe routes for migrants fleeing conflict zones. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had failed to do the serious and practical work with France needed to stop lives being lost and criminal gangs profiting from crossings. The Labour MP said the government had brought the navy in to patrol the Channel in 2019 but the two vessels used had intercepted no boats and had cost the government Â£780,000. ""They need to explain what is different in these latest plans,"" she said. A government spokesperson said the public had had enough of people smugglers disregarding immigration laws and ministers were bringing in long-term changes. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said unacceptable numbers continued to cross and the government was exploring every avenue to stop them. Responding to the plans, CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon described them as ""cruel and inhumane"". ""It's a desperate move by a government that isn't able to find solutions that will ensure an orderly, manageable and fair asylum system,"" he added. But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the news sent ""a clear message"" over how serious the government was about putting a stop to small boat crossings which were incredibly unsafe. In March last year, Ms Patel set outplans to overhaulthe way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Under the proposals, people who arrive in the UK by what the government calls illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. The Labour Party has criticised the plans for lacking compassion and being ineffective at discouraging crossings.  Human rights lawyers warned they would be unlawful because they ignored Britain's international obligations. In December, four Iranian men who crossed in small boats had theirconvictions for immigration offences quashedby the Court of Appeal, which concluded it had not been proven they intended to enter the UK illegally.

"Anne Frank's diary, written in hiding from the Nazis, is widely read more than 70 years after her death A new investigation has identified a suspect who may have betrayed Anne Frank and her family to the Nazis. The Jewish diarist died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, aged 15, after two years in hiding. Her diary, published after her death, is the most famous first-hand account of Jewish life during the war. A team including an ex-FBI agent said Arnold van den Bergh, a Jewish figure in Amsterdam, probably ""gave up"" the Franks to save his own family. The team, made up of historians and other experts, spent six years using modern investigative techniques to crack the ""cold case"". That included using computer algorithms to search for connections between many different people, something that would have taken humans thousands of hours. Van den Bergh had been a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council, a body forced to implement Nazi policy in Jewish areas. It was disbanded in 1943, and its members were dispatched to concentration camps. The world's most-read diary in pictures Anne Frank 'may not have been betrayed' Anne Frank's 'dirty jokes' uncovered But the team found that van den Bergh was not sent to a camp, and was instead living in Amsterdam as normal at the time. There was also a suggestion that a member of the Jewish Council had been feeding the Nazis information. ""When van den Bergh lost all his series of protections exempting him from having to go to the camps, he had to provide something valuable to the Nazis that he's had contact with to let him and his wife at that time stay safe,"" former FBI agent Vince Pankoketold CBS 60 Minutes,external. The team said it had struggled with the revelation that another Jewish person was probably the betrayer. But it also found evidence suggesting Otto Frank, Anne's father, may himself have known that and kept it secret. This video can not be played Anne Frank's step-sister: 'Anne has become immortal' In the files of a previous investigator, they found a copy of an anonymous note sent to Otto Frank identifying Arnold van den Bergh as his betrayer. Mr Pankoke told 60 Minutes that anti-Semitism may have been the reason it was never made public. ""Perhaps he just felt that if I bring this up againâ¦ it'll only stoke the fires further,"" he said. ""But we have to keep in mind that the fact that [van den Bergh] was Jewish just meant that he was placed into an untenable position by the Nazis to do something to save his life."" Dutch newspaper de Volkskrantreports that van den Bergh died in 1950,external. In a statement, the Anne Frank House museum said it was ""impressed"" with the investigation team's work. Its executive director, Ronald Leopold, added thatÂ the new research had ""generated important new information and a fascinating hypothesis that merits further research"". The museum said it was not directly involved in the investigation but had shared its archives and museum with the team. As one of the bleakest periods in Dutch living memory, these claims linked to one of its most painful, pivotal moments, have unsurprisingly ignited some consternation. ""Defamatory nonsense,"" concluded Bart van der Boom from the university of Leiden. Emeritus professor of Holocaust and Genocide studies at Amsterdam University Johannes Houwink ten Cate said if there were lists of Jews in hiding, they would have surfaced before now. He told investigators: ""With big accusations you also need big evidence."" Earlier I visited the Anne Frank House - with special permission to film as cultural institutions are temporarily closed under Covid rules. Clambering up the steep staircase, behind the original bookcase which disguised the entrance to the secret annex, I was struck by the silence. The Netherlands is currently a polarised country, witnessing an emboldened far-right. Here, Anne Frank remains a reminder of the oppression and prejudice inflicted on sections of Dutch society in the not so distant past, and a warning of what can become of a nation overrun by fascists. While there is still a degree of scepticism, and acknowledgement that we may never know the true identity of the betrayer, this tale serves as a warning - a lesson of what humanity may be capable of in its darkest time. And Anne Frank's legacy lives on.

"The government has admitted that its efforts to insulate the UK from climate change impacts have been inadequate. The costs of climate change to Britain are ""high and increasing"", it says, and could reach many billions of pounds a year. Ministers say they'll have to go much further and faster to curb the worst impacts. It means climate change must be built into all long-term decisions, such as new housing or infrastructure. The aim should be to avoid costly remedial actions in the future. The government has also accepted that it must consider low-probability but high-impact events arising from a heating climate. The report is a response to an analysis of the UKâs vulnerability to climate change by the official advisers, the Climate Change Committee. ""Climate change is happening now. It is one of the biggest challenges of our generation and has already begun to cause irreversible damage to our planet and way of life,""the report begins.,external It earmarks 61 climate risks cutting across multiple sectors of society. Health and productivity could be affected, it says, with impacts on many households, businesses and public services. The report warns of worsening soil health and farm productivity, reduced water availability, and impacts on alternative energy supply. A really simple guide to climate change 'Adapt or die' warning from Environment Agency UK warned it is unprepared for climate chaos For example, it notes, unless the UK takes further action, the cost of flood-related damages for non-residential properties is expected to increase by 27% by 2050 and 40% by 2080. That's with a temperature rise of just 2C - and even that relatively low figure is looking very hard to achieve. If temperature rises to 4C â which the governmentâs science advisers say is possible - this increases to 44% and 75% respectively. The government says itâs already investing to adapt to climate change. It mentions: Â£5.2bn for 2,000 new flood defences by 2027 Increasing cash for peat restoration, woodland creation and management to more than Â£750m by 2025 Continuing work on the Green Finance Strategy to help money reach âgreenâ projects But critics say efforts so far have been diluted by inadequate finance from the Treasury for long-term schemes. Indeed the chancellor didnât mention climate change once in his Budget. Green MP Caroline Lucas MP said: ""It's crystal clear that we are moving nothing like fast enough to net zero emissions and the longer we delay, the more it will cost. The government acknowledges the risks. We have yet to see the action plan that will deal with them."" Ministers admit they must do much more. Climate Adaptation Minister Jo Churchill said: âThe scale and severity of the challenge posed by climate change means we canât tackle it overnight, and although weâve made good progress in recent year, there is clearly much more that we need to do."" Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said: ""After more than a decade in power, the Conservatives have failed to build the efficient homes, strengthened flood defences, and resilient natural habitats necessary to tackle the climate crisis. ""Their lack of action and empty promises are putting people, nature, and our economy at risk.""

"Dr Prit Buttar's post has generated hundreds of responses from people with their own stories A retired GP says he has been ""humbled"" by the response to a social media post on why he broke Covid rules to hug a bereaved woman at a vaccine clinic. Dr Prit Buttar's Twitter thread has generated hundreds of responses and thousands of likes and retweets. He said he had been prompted to post by the political rowsurrounding gatherings at 10 Downing Street. Dr Buttar said that showed a ""huge disconnection"" from the lives of ordinary people. He retired to near Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway in 2016 but worked part-time in practices across the region until 2019. However, he volunteered to assist - helping to set up local Covid hubs - when the coronavirus pandemic began a year later. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programmewhy he decided to breach social distancing regulations. ""This was just under a year ago,"" he said. ""I was working in one of the vaccine clinics and one of the reception staff came through and asked if we could fit in somebody who should have come a few days before but had missed her appointment. ""Of course, we said that's fine and when she came in - this was a lady in her late 60s or early 70s, I can't remember the details now - she was so apologetic that she had wasted an appointment and apologised again and again and we reassured her."" He said they had told the woman someone else would have used the slot she had missed and then she had explained why she had not attended. Dr Buttar was working at a vaccination clinic when he decided to hug the woman ""She and her husband had moved to Scotland just immediately before the pandemic broke and as soon as they arrived in Scotland, her husband discovered that he had cancer,"" said Dr Buttar. ""She had cared for him through the first lockdown and through the summer that followed and he had died shortly before her appointment to come to see us. ""Because her son lived in England and his wife had Covid, he was unable to come up to be with her."" He said that meant she had had to deal with the death of her husband having had little chance to establish a friend network in the area. ""This poor woman was very, very much alone,"" he said. ""And I just took the decision that this was an occasion where I was going to break the rules, and I leaned forward and embraced her. ""This poor person just dissolved into tears and as she sobbed, she told me that I was the first person who had embraced her since her husband had died."" He explained why he had taken to social media to share his experience. ""I posted on Twitter about this just to make the point that, you know, ordinary people dealt with their loss and their loneliness with tremendous fortitude and resignation and stoicism and what a contrast to the behaviour of the prime minister and his entourage,"" he said. Dr Buttar said many people had responded to the story. ""Everyone in the thread who said they'd broken the rules had done so in order to help somebody else, not because they wanted to have a party,"" he said. ""The other thread of it was the people who hadn't broken the rules who had watched loved ones die over an iPad and now bitterly regretted that they hadn't taken that moment just to say goodbye to their loved one. ""One of the universal comments that I have seen when I've looked at the thread from people is that the gulf between everyday experiences and the behaviour of the prime minister is so vast. ""This is not something for which an apology - a promise to do better - will ever suffice."" Boris Johnson admitted at Prime Minister's Questions last week that he had joined colleagues for drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 for around 25 minutes, to thank them for their hard work during the pandemic, but had ""believed implicitly"" it was a work event. He apologised for his handling of the event, saying he understood people's ""rage"".

"Amazon has dropped plans to block UK Visa credit card payments this week, as the two sides continue to try to resolve a dispute over payment fees. ""The expected â¯change regardingâ¯ the use of â¯Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19,"" Amazon said. Visa said it was ""working closely to reach an agreement"". Amazon said last year that Visa payment costs were ""an obstacle"" to providing the best prices for customers. But Visa accused Amazon of threatening to restrict consumer choice. ""When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins,"" Visa said. Neither company has indicated when the talks might conclude. In an email to customers on Monday, Amazon said it was working closely with Visa on ""a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk"". An EU-enforced cap on fees charged by card issuers is no longer in place in the UK following Brexit. Both Visa and its rival Mastercard have raised the so-called interchange fee on cross-border transactions between businesses in the UK and the European Union following Brexit. However, Amazon and Visa said last year that their dispute had nothing to do with the UK leaving the EU. They have been slugging it out in public and in private, now these two corporate heavyweights are going in for an extra round. Amazon is ahead on points in this bout. Given this announcement has come so close to the deadline, many customers would have already switched their primary Amazon payment method away from Visa. But the online retailer would also have been hurt financially if it had followed through on its threat. The cancelling of the deadline, and the fact a new end date has not been set, suggests a deal is near. Neither Amazon nor Visa are saying much to be able to judge quite how close they are to a compromise. This dispute is about more than just fees. It is also about control. Don't forget that Amazon has taken a different course with Mastercard, which is behind Amazon's reward card.

"The armed forces are set to take charge of operations looking to limit migrant crossings in the English Channel. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the MoD had been commissioned as a ""crucial operational partner to protect our Channel against illegal migration"". But Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood criticised the plans as ""rushed"" and a ""massive distraction"" for the military. The move could begin within weeks, the BBC understands. Rear Admiral Mike Utley, the commander of the UK strike force, has been appointed to co-ordinate the plans. The number of people who crossed last year wastreble that of 2020. On Saturday alone, 197 people were intercepted or rescued attempting to cross the English Channel, the Home Office said. French authorities stopped 95 people on five vessels from making the journey. Ministry of Defence (MoD)Â sources told the BBC discussions about the armed forces working with the Home Office and UK Border Force had been taking place for several weeks. They said no decisions had been made over how the Royal Navy or other services would be involved, and there was no indication it would involve pushing migrant boats back to France. That is despite Ms Patel suggesting in the House of Commons that the armed forces could be involved in the controversial policy, saying this was ""absolutely the policy of this government"". A source added the details of how the military could co-ordinate operations were still to be worked out, while another said there was ""trepidation"" within the MoD about getting involved in such a complex issue. It is understood overall policy on migration and migrant management would still be led by the Home Office. But the plans, firstreported in the Times,external, could see Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the navy authority over government vessels in the channel. Channel migrants tragedy - Terrifying final hours of their fatal journey Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in small boats in 2021 - up from 8,417 people the year before - despite huge UK investment in France to prevent crossings. On 24 November at least27 people died after their boat sank, in the largest single loss of life in the Channel since records began in 2014. Ms Patel told MPs crossings were ""unfair, unacceptable and lethally dangerous"" as well as ""totally unnecessary"". She said France, and other EU member states, were ""safe countries with long-established asylum systems"". She added she had asked for ""naval MoD assets and support back in 2020"". ""No one department can resolve the complex issue of Channel crossings on their own,"" she added. Asked about the move on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it would help to avoid a situation where ""Border Force or other vessels in the Channel are being co-ordinated separately"". But Mr Ellwood, who is also a former veterans minister, described the proposals as being ""rushed out"". Speaking to Sky News, the Conservative MP said the plans were a ""massive distraction"" for the military amid growing threats from Russia and China, adding: ""This isn't what our navy should be doing."" For a prime minister who promised his Brexit deal would see the UK take back control of its borders, the failure to stop record numbers of asylum seekers arriving on the Kent coast in small boats is a political embarrassment. However, putting a rear admiral in charge of operations in the Channel is unlikely to make much difference. The Royal Navy may be able to provide better intelligence on where inflatables and dinghies are expected to make landfall, but the great majority of those coming to seek sanctuary in Britain are already intercepted before they reach the coast. Plans to push small boats back into French waters appear to have been deemed too dangerous and the often-trailed idea of processing migrants ""offshore"" in another country has so far failed to materialise. Migrant arrival facilities in Kent are currently being expanded. The reason for the increase in asylum seekers risking the perilous journey across the Channel is that Covid and improved security at Calais has effectively closed traditional points of entry. The government and refugee organisations agree the long-term solution is the creation of official safe routes for migrants fleeing conflict zones. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had failed to do the serious and practical work with France needed to stop lives being lost and criminal gangs profiting from crossings. The Labour MP said the government had brought the navy in to patrol the Channel in 2019 but the two vessels used had intercepted no boats and had cost the government Â£780,000. ""They need to explain what is different in these latest plans,"" she said. A government spokesperson said the public had had enough of people smugglers disregarding immigration laws and ministers were bringing in long-term changes. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said unacceptable numbers continued to cross and the government was exploring every avenue to stop them. Responding to the plans, CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon described them as ""cruel and inhumane"". ""It's a desperate move by a government that isn't able to find solutions that will ensure an orderly, manageable and fair asylum system,"" he added. But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the news sent ""a clear message"" over how serious the government was about putting a stop to small boat crossings which were incredibly unsafe. In March last year, Ms Patel set outplans to overhaulthe way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Under the proposals, people who arrive in the UK by what the government calls illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. The Labour Party has criticised the plans for lacking compassion and being ineffective at discouraging crossings.  Human rights lawyers warned they would be unlawful because they ignored Britain's international obligations. In December, four Iranian men who crossed in small boats had theirconvictions for immigration offences quashedby the Court of Appeal, which concluded it had not been proven they intended to enter the UK illegally.

"Mr Horta-Osorio joined Credit Suisse in April last year The chairman of global banking giant Credit Suisse, Antonio Horta-Osorio, has resigned with immediate effect after breaking Covid quarantine rules. Mr Horta-Osorio, who was with the bank for just nine months, left following an internal investigation. The former boss of Lloyds Banking Group joined Credit Suisse after a series of scandals at the Swiss bank. But it has emerged he breached Covid rules last year, including by attending the Wimbledon tennis finals. ""I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,"" Mr Horta-Osorio said ina statement issued by the bank,external. ""I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time,"" he added. Mr Horta-Osorio has been replaced by board member Axel Lehmann. Antonio Horta-Osorio broke Covid rules when he attended Wimbledon, where Novak Djokovic won the male singles title Last month, a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse had found that Mr Horta-Osorio had breached Covid-19 rules. He attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in July at a time when the UK's Covid-19 restrictions required him to be in quarantine. Mr Horta-Osorio also breached Swiss Covid restrictions when,according to Reuters,external, he flew into the country on 28 November but left on 1 December. Swiss rules meant he should have quarantined for 10 days upon his arrival. Mr Horta-Osorio joined Credit Suisse in April last year following a series of scandals at the bank, In February 2020, then-Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam resigned after it was revealed the bank had spied on senior employees. Mr Thiam denied knowledge of the spying operations. Credit Suisse has also been hit with huge losses in connection with the failed financial firm Greensill - which backed Liberty Steel - and Archegos, the US hedge fund which collapsed last year. Last year, in a report into its relationship with Archegos, Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability."" There are two narratives emerging from Antonio Horta-Osorio's short-lived tenure at the top of one of Swiss banking giants. One is that he broke the rules, was investigated and, having been found in breach, was asked to step down. But allies of the former boss of Lloyds Banking Group insist that the board of Credit Suisse could have censured him rather than forced him out and suggest that the Swiss bank had not appreciated his efforts to reform an executive team and a culture that has been hit a series of scandals in recent years. Credit Suisse clients lost billions after the bank funnelled them into financial products designed by the collapsed Greensill Capital while the bank itself took a multi-billion hit from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos. The bank also found itself at the centre of an unusual spying scandal which saw the departure of chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Ironically, the man Credit Suisse brought in to bring an end to a string of negative headlines is the subject of them this morning. Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment firm United First Partners, said Credit Suisse ""has been in the 'damaged goods' section for a while now"". ""While Horta-Osorio was responsible for the new strategy, his short tenure means that the revamp is likely to only be in the nascent stage. The irony of it is that Horta was hired to fix the reputational damage to Credit Suisse and revamp its risk taking culture in the bank."" In his statement, Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank."" But George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC: ""Only [nine] months in is not really time to achieve much. ""He was brought in to turn around the business - it is a bank that has been hit by scandal - and so it means that his reign has been cut short. ""Not everybody is above the law for Covid restrictions."" Mr Horta-Osorio was chief executive at Lloyds Banking Group for 10 years, the start of which was marked by a surprise two month leave of absence todeal with severe sleep deprivation. Later on, amidmedia reports of an extra-marital affair, Mr Horta-Osorio emailed Lloyds staff, saying: ""I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group's reputation. ""I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me."" Speaking to the BBC, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse said that the bank would give no further details on Mr Horta-Osorio's resignation other than those in its statement. They also said that there were no plans to release the findings of the investigation.

"The armed forces are set to take charge of operations looking to limit migrant crossings in the English Channel. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the MoD had been commissioned as a ""crucial operational partner to protect our Channel against illegal migration"". But Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood criticised the plans as ""rushed"" and a ""massive distraction"" for the military. The move could begin within weeks, the BBC understands. Rear Admiral Mike Utley, the commander of the UK strike force, has been appointed to co-ordinate the plans. The number of people who crossed last year wastreble that of 2020. On Saturday alone, 197 people were intercepted or rescued attempting to cross the English Channel, the Home Office said. French authorities stopped 95 people on five vessels from making the journey. Ministry of Defence (MoD)Â sources told the BBC discussions about the armed forces working with the Home Office and UK Border Force had been taking place for several weeks. They said no decisions had been made over how the Royal Navy or other services would be involved, and there was no indication it would involve pushing migrant boats back to France. That is despite Ms Patel suggesting in the House of Commons that the armed forces could be involved in the controversial policy, saying this was ""absolutely the policy of this government"". A source added the details of how the military could co-ordinate operations were still to be worked out, while another said there was ""trepidation"" within the MoD about getting involved in such a complex issue. It is understood overall policy on migration and migrant management would still be led by the Home Office. But the plans, firstreported in the Times,external, could see Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the navy authority over government vessels in the channel. Channel migrants tragedy - Terrifying final hours of their fatal journey Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in small boats in 2021 - up from 8,417 people the year before - despite huge UK investment in France to prevent crossings. On 24 November at least27 people died after their boat sank, in the largest single loss of life in the Channel since records began in 2014. Ms Patel told MPs crossings were ""unfair, unacceptable and lethally dangerous"" as well as ""totally unnecessary"". She said France, and other EU member states, were ""safe countries with long-established asylum systems"". She added she had asked for ""naval MoD assets and support back in 2020"". ""No one department can resolve the complex issue of Channel crossings on their own,"" she added. Asked about the move on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it would help to avoid a situation where ""Border Force or other vessels in the Channel are being co-ordinated separately"". But Mr Ellwood, who is also a former veterans minister, described the proposals as being ""rushed out"". Speaking to Sky News, the Conservative MP said the plans were a ""massive distraction"" for the military amid growing threats from Russia and China, adding: ""This isn't what our navy should be doing."" For a prime minister who promised his Brexit deal would see the UK take back control of its borders, the failure to stop record numbers of asylum seekers arriving on the Kent coast in small boats is a political embarrassment. However, putting a rear admiral in charge of operations in the Channel is unlikely to make much difference. The Royal Navy may be able to provide better intelligence on where inflatables and dinghies are expected to make landfall, but the great majority of those coming to seek sanctuary in Britain are already intercepted before they reach the coast. Plans to push small boats back into French waters appear to have been deemed too dangerous and the often-trailed idea of processing migrants ""offshore"" in another country has so far failed to materialise. Migrant arrival facilities in Kent are currently being expanded. The reason for the increase in asylum seekers risking the perilous journey across the Channel is that Covid and improved security at Calais has effectively closed traditional points of entry. The government and refugee organisations agree the long-term solution is the creation of official safe routes for migrants fleeing conflict zones. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had failed to do the serious and practical work with France needed to stop lives being lost and criminal gangs profiting from crossings. The Labour MP said the government had brought the navy in to patrol the Channel in 2019 but the two vessels used had intercepted no boats and had cost the government Â£780,000. ""They need to explain what is different in these latest plans,"" she said. A government spokesperson said the public had had enough of people smugglers disregarding immigration laws and ministers were bringing in long-term changes. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said unacceptable numbers continued to cross and the government was exploring every avenue to stop them. Responding to the plans, CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon described them as ""cruel and inhumane"". ""It's a desperate move by a government that isn't able to find solutions that will ensure an orderly, manageable and fair asylum system,"" he added. But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the news sent ""a clear message"" over how serious the government was about putting a stop to small boat crossings which were incredibly unsafe. In March last year, Ms Patel set outplans to overhaulthe way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Under the proposals, people who arrive in the UK by what the government calls illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. The Labour Party has criticised the plans for lacking compassion and being ineffective at discouraging crossings.  Human rights lawyers warned they would be unlawful because they ignored Britain's international obligations. In December, four Iranian men who crossed in small boats had theirconvictions for immigration offences quashedby the Court of Appeal, which concluded it had not been proven they intended to enter the UK illegally.

"An auction of seabed plots for major offshore wind projects around the Scottish coast has netted Â£700m. Seventeen projects covering a total of 7,000km2 have been chosen in the first such leasing round in a decade. They have a combined potential generating capacity of 25GW - well above the expected auction outcome of 10GW. Scotland has 1.9GW of operational offshore wind, and another 8.4GW in construction or advanced development. The ScotWind leasing auction attracted more than 70 bids frommajor oil companies, utility firms and investment fundsfrom around the world. Will ScotWind auction deliver a renewables revolution? ScotWind offshore wind auction attracts 74 bids Most of the sites are on the east, north east or northern coast, with just one on the western side of Scotland. Successful bidders include Scottish Power, which won the seabed rights to develop three new offshore wind farms with a total capacity of 7GW. They include two new floating projects in conjunction with Shell and one fixed project. Shell New Energies is the lead applicant on the most expensive development, off the coast of Aberdeen, estimated to cost Â£86m in option fees. BP Alternative Energy Investments and SSE Renewables will each pay Â£85.9m in fees for two sites. The auction process was overseen by Crown Estate Scotland, with funds raised from the process going to the Scottish government. The winners have now been offered option agreements which reserve the rights to specific areas of seabed. They include parts of the North Sea to the east of Angus, the outer Moray Firth, west of Orkney and north-west of both Lewis and Islay. Although there was a sea area east of Shetland offered for the auction, this was not allocated to any bidder. ScotWind represents a major sea-change in how we generate our electricity in Scotland. By the time they're all built, an estimated six million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be prevented from entering our atmosphere each year. That's about an eighth of all Scotland's emissions for 2019. But we've already largely decarbonised our electricity sector. So, why build more offshore wind farms? The inherent unpredictability of the wind means we need masses of overcapacity to allow us to keep the lights on when some of the turbines are not turning.  But those looking after the grid need to be more clever than just building more turbines. That means a growing use of smart technology and increased storage - through batteries or green hydrogen - will become critical in the coming years. Crown Estate Scotland chief executive Simon Hodge said: ""Today's results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland's ability to transform our energy sector. ""In addition to the environmental benefits, this also represents a major investment in the Scottish economy, with around Â£700m being delivered straight into the public finances and billions of pounds worth of supply chain commitments."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the ScotWind auction as a ""truly historic opportunity for Scotland's net zero economy"". She added: ""The scale of opportunity represented in today's announcement exceeds our current planning assumption of 10GW of offshore wind - which is a massive vote of confidence in Scotland."" Scottish Renewables said the announcement was ""an exciting and significant moment in Scotland's renewable energy story"". Chief executive Claire Mack added: ""The potential for 17 new projects creates huge ambition for our sector to deliver on, and will require strong collaboration to deliver maximum impact for our economy and environment."" WWF Scotland said the outcome was a ""big vote of confidence in renewable power and Scotland's green economy"". The environmental group's climate and energy lead, Fabrice Leveque, said: ""Offshore wind has a vital role to play in helping to cut our climate emissions, and is already powering hundreds of thousands of Scottish homes. ""Each of these projects could create hundreds of jobs and will have a role in helping put Scotland on a path to a green recovery."" However, RSPB Scotland criticised the announcement, claiming it could ""accelerate some seabird species towards extinction in Scotland"". Aedan Smith, the charity's head of policy and advocacy said: ""Offshore wind has an important role to play in helping halt climate change. ""However, the offshore wind projects already consented in Scotland are predicted to kill hundreds of seabirds like kittiwakes, gannets and puffins every year. ""The potential projects announced today would be many times bigger than those existing projects and would greatly increase those impacts."" RSPB Scotland is concerned about the impact of the new wind farm projects on seabirds such as puffins Meanwhile, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) raised concerns about what the projects would mean for their industry. Chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said: ""In the rush to energy transition, it is vital that our industry's voice is properly heard and that the fleet's access to Scotland's productive fishing grounds is protected. ""In particular, proper scrutiny must be given to developers' claims that offshore windfarms and fishing activity can co-exist with little change to existing patterns of activity, since our experience to date shows very strongly that the opposite is the case."" The auction was originally meant to close at the end of March last year, but was delayed after a parallel English and Welsh auctionresulted in far higher prices than expected. At risk of losing out on hundreds of millions of pounds if it stuck to its original auction price guidelines, CES raised the cap for the auction bids from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 per square kilometre. The Scottish government has set a target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. Will ScotWind auction deliver a renewables revolution?

"Jeff Bezos has spent much of his wealth on his space travel project Blue Origin The pandemic has made the world's wealthiest far richer but has led to more people living in poverty, according to the charity Oxfam. Lower incomes for the world's poorest contributed to the death of 21,000 people each day, its report claims. But the world's 10 richest men have more than doubled their collective fortunes since March 2020, Oxfam said. Oxfam typically releases a report on global inequality at the start of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. That event usually sees thousands of corporate and political leaders, celebrities, campaigners, economists and journalists gather in the Swiss ski resort for panel discussions, drinks parties and schmoozing. However for the second year running, the meeting (scheduled for this week) will be online-only after the emergence of the Omicron variant derailed plans to return to an in-person event. Davos business leaders' event postponed over Omicron Global economy faces grim outlook, says World Bank More Covid victims in 'left behind' communities This week's discussions will include the likely future path of the pandemic, vaccine equity and the energy transition. Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam GB's chief executive, said the charity timed the report each year to coincide with Davos to attract the attention of economic, business and political elites. ""This year, what's happening is off the scale,"" he said. ""There's been a new billionaire created almost every day during this pandemic, meanwhile 99% of the world's population are worse off because of lockdowns, lower international trade, less international tourism, and as a result of that, 160 million more people have been pushed into poverty."" ""Something is deeply flawed with our economic system,"" he added. According to Forbes figures cited by the charity, the world's 10 richest men are: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault and family, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Ballmer and Warren Buffet. While collectively their wealth grew from $700bn to $1.5tn between March 2020 and November 2021, there is significant variation between them, with Mr Musk's fortune growing by more than 1,000%, while Mr Gates' rose by a more modest 30%. Oxfam's decision to measure the growth from the start of the pandemic, when global share prices plummeted, also skews the findings slightly. The wealth of the world's richest is typically tied up in their stock holdings, which fell sharply in March 2020, meaning the subsequent growth was from this lower base. If Oxfam had measured from just before the pandemic began, the growth would have been less pronounced. However, one of the report's authors Max Lawson told the BBC: ""If you take the wealth of billionaires in mid-February 2020 instead, we estimate that the increase in the top ten richest men is more like 70% - which would still represent a record breaking increase, and something the like of which we have never seen before."" Oxfam's report is based on data from the Forbes Billionaires List and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth report, which gives the distribution of global wealth going back to 2000. The Forbes survey uses the value of an individual's assets, mainly property and land, minus debts, to determine what he or she ""owns"". The data excludes wages or income. The methodology has been criticised in the past as it means that a student with high debts, but with high future earning potential, for example, would be considered poor under the criteria used. Oxfam also says that due to the fact prices have risen during the pandemic, it has adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks how fast the cost of living is increasing over time. Oxfam's report, which was also based on data from the World Bank, said a lack of access to healthcare, hunger, gender-based violence and climate breakdown contributed to one death every four seconds. It said 160 million more people were living on less than $5.50 (Â£4.02) a day than would have been without the impact of the Covid pandemic. The World Bank uses $5.50 a day as a measure of poverty in upper-middle-income countries. The report also says: The pandemic is forcing developing countries to slash social spending as national debts rise Gender equality has been set back, with 13 million fewer women in work now than in 2019 and over 20 million girls at risk of never returning to school Ethnic minority groups have been hardest hit by Covid, including UK Bangladeshis and the US's black population ""Even during a global crisis our unfair economic systems manage to deliver eye-watering windfalls for the wealthiest but fail to protect the poorest,"" Mr Sriskandarajah said. He said political leaders now had an historic opportunity to back bolder economic strategies to ""change the deadly course we are on"". Many girls are unlikely to return to school after the pandemic, according to Oxfam That should include more progressive tax regimes, which impose higher levies on capital and wealth, with the revenue spent on ""quality universal healthcare and social protection for all"" Mr Sriskandarajah said. Oxfam is also calling for the intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines to be waived to enable wider production and faster distribution. Earlier this month the president of the World Bank, David Malpass, voiced his concerns over widening global inequality, arguing the impact of inflation and measures to tackle it were likely to cause more damage to poorer countries. ""The outlook for the weaker countries is still to fall further and further behind,"" he said.

Speaking to Sky News, the Conservative MP said the plans were a ""massive distraction"" for the military amid growing threats from Russia and China, adding: ""This isn't what our navy should be doing."" For a prime minister who promised his Brexit deal would see the UK take back control of its borders, the failure to stop record numbers of asylum seekers arriving on the Kent coast in small boats is a political embarrassment. However, putting a rear admiral in charge of operations in the Channel is unlikely to make much difference. The Royal Navy may be able to provide better intelligence on where inflatables and dinghies are expected to make landfall, but the great majority of those coming to seek sanctuary in Britain are already intercepted before they reach the coast. Plans to push small boats back into French waters appear to have been deemed too dangerous and the often-trailed idea of processing migrants ""offshore"" in another country has so far failed to materialise. Migrant arrival facilities in Kent are currently being expanded. The reason for the increase in asylum seekers risking the perilous journey across the Channel is that Covid and improved security at Calais has effectively closed traditional points of entry. The government and refugee organisations agree the long-term solution is the creation of official safe routes for migrants fleeing conflict zones. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had failed to do the serious and practical work with France needed to stop lives being lost and criminal gangs profiting from crossings. The Labour MP said the government had brought the navy in to patrol the Channel in 2019 but the two vessels used had intercepted no boats and had cost the government Â£780,000. ""They need to explain what is different in these latest plans,"" she said. A government spokesperson said the public had had enough of people smugglers disregarding immigration laws and ministers were bringing in long-term changes. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said unacceptable numbers continued to cross and the government was exploring every avenue to stop them. Responding to the plans, CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon described them as ""cruel and inhumane"". ""It's a desperate move by a government that isn't able to find solutions that will ensure an orderly, manageable and fair asylum system,"" he added. But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the news sent ""a clear message"" over how serious the government was about putting a stop to small boat crossings which were incredibly unsafe. In March last year, Ms Patel set outplans to overhaulthe way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Under the proposals, people who arrive in the UK by what the government calls illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. The Labour Party has criticised the plans for lacking compassion and being ineffective at discouraging crossings.  Human rights lawyers warned they would be unlawful because they ignored Britain's international obligations. In December, four Iranian men who crossed in small boats had theirconvictions for immigration offences quashedby the Court of Appeal, which concluded it had not been proven they intended to enter the UK illegally.

"The volcano erupted for several days. This photo was taken a day before the eruption that caused the tsunami New Zealand has sent a plane to Tonga to assess the damage after a huge volcanic eruption triggered a tsunami. The eruption has covered the Pacific islands in ash, cut power and severed communications. Up to 80,000 people there could be affected, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) told the BBC. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the tsunami had wreaked ""significant damage"". No deaths have been reported so far. Information remains scarce, however, and New Zealand and Australia are sending surveillance flights to assess the extent of the damage. The New Zealand Defence Force tweeted that an aircraft had left to ""assist in an initial impact assessment of the area and low-lying islands"". ANALYSIS:Satellites key to understanding Pacific volcano Katie Greenwood of the IFRC in Fiji said that help was urgently needed. ""We suspect there could be up to 80,000 people throughout Tonga affected by either the eruption itself or from the tsunami wave and inundation as a result of the eruption,"" she said. ""That was a shock to people, so we do hold some concern for those outer islands and we're very keen to hear from people."" The underwater volcano erupted on Saturday, sending a plume of ash into the sky and triggering warnings of 1.2m (4ft) waves reaching Tonga. The eruption was so loud it could be heard in New Zealand, some 2,383km (1,481 miles) from Tonga. This video can not be played Watch: Satellite images capture eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai New Zealand's Acting High Commissioner in Tonga Peter Lund has said the island nation looks ""like a moonscape"" after it was coated in a layer of volcanic ash. The dust was reportedly contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need, Ms Ardern said on Sunday. Aid charities said the ash had prompted authorities to tell people to drink bottled water and wear face masks to protect their lungs. As the sky darkened with ash, videos showed traffic jams as people fled low-lying areas by car. Hours later, Tonga's internet and phone lines went down, making the island's 105,000 residents almost entirely unreachable. Images on social media showed flooding as the tsunami waves began Prior to the largest eruption, the volcano had been erupting for several days. The Tonga Meteorological Agency had warned that the smell of sulphur and ammonia was being reported in some areas. Ms Ardern said power was being restored to some parts of the island and mobile phones were slowly starting to work again. But the situation in some coastal areas remained unknown. Unable to speak to their friends and family, many Tongans in Australia and New Zealand have grown concerned for their safety. Fatima said she had not heard anything from her colleague who runs a seafront restaurant in Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa. ""It's all very sad, we are hoping for the best,"" she told the BBC. ""This will hit them so hard as they have been in lockdown a long time with no tourists visiting and now this."" Satellite images suggest some outlying islands have been completely submerged by seawater. Experts say the eruption of the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano is one of the most violent in the region in decades. It triggeredtsunami warnings in several countries, including Japan and the US, where flooding hit some coastal parts of California and Alaska. UK Foreign Office minister Zac Goldsmith called the situation in Tonga ""shocking"" and said Britain stood ""ready to help and support our Commonwealth friend and partner in any way we can"". Scientists got their first look at Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai post-eruption on Saturday when the EU's Sentinel-1A satellite flew overhead. This spacecraft is a radar platform and can see through obscuring cloud and ash to the surface below. It showed clearly that much of the crater rim that stood above the ocean waters had been destroyed - a testament to the ferocity of the blast. Researchers will be keen to understand the cause of a tsunami that produced waves not just on nearby islands but at beaches right around the Pacific. To what extent was the explosion itself responsible? Pressure waves can make what are termed ""meteotsunami"". Or perhaps the displacement of water was the result of an unseen collapse of part of the volcano below the ocean surface. More data in the coming days and weeks will establish the facts.

"The powerful storm uprooted trees, making some roads impassable in Charlotte, North Carolina A major winter storm has brought heavy snow and ice to parts of the US and Canada, putting more than 80 million people under weather warnings. More than 145,000 people are without power in some south-eastern states, and thousands of flights are cancelled. Virginia, Georgia, and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. The US National Weather Service (NWS) says more than 1ft (30cm) of snow is expected in some areas. Snow and ice could result in ""dangerous travel, power outages, and tree damage"", the NWS warned. Highway patrols reported hundreds of vehicle accidents, according to the Associated Press news agency. There were also forecasts of possible coastal flooding in some areas, including in New York City and parts of Connecticut, with warnings that roads and infrastructure could be affected. This video can not be played More disruption possible from US Storm In Canada's Ontario province, which shares a border with New York state, officials issued storm warnings on Sunday morning for much of the south. Toronto, the capital of the province and Canada's largest city, is forecast to get seven inches (20cm) of snow. More than 3,000 flights into and out of the US were cancelled on Sunday, according to the FlightAware data tracking website. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina was among the worst hit, with almost 90% of flights scrapped, and a message on its website urged passengers to check with their airlines before travelling to the airport. How to stay safe in freezing weather In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster called on residents to stay off the roads. ""This is going to be a pretty bad storm in the upper part of the state,"" he said, adding that it was ""good news"" that the storm was forecast to hit on a weekend and on a public holiday on Monday, when fewer people would need to travel. ""Hopefully, the storm will underdeliver, but it could overdeliver. We just don't know,"" Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said as he announced preparations for his state.

"MPs have not been allowed to sit at Stormont since 2016 The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have said other parties should ""stop faking outrage"" over the proposed reintroduction of double jobbing. The plan would allow MPs to be elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly but keep their Westminster seats. Four of the five Stormont Executiveparties have said they are against the move. A DUP spokesman said the move would ""encourage stability at a time when devolution is deeply unstable"". Details of the plan wereoutlined in a letter from government peer Lord Caine to fellow lordson Friday. It will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and is proposed to last until the next Westminster election, due in 2024. Double jobbing, also known as dual mandates, was banned in Northern Ireland in 2016, when a number of MPs were forced to give up their seats in the assembly. If the new proposal goes through, it would allow DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to stand for election to the assembly in May while retaining his seat at Westminster. Under existing rules if he was elected to Stormont he would have had to stand down as an MP, leading to a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency. MPs to be able to sit in Stormont as MLAs Four executive parties oppose double jobbing return The SDLP and Alliance Party have said their three MPs will vote against the mandate when comes to the House of Commons. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill called it ""blatant and disgraceful interference"", while Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie tweeted that the Northern Ireland Office was ""now directly supporting DUP the election campaign"". The proposal would allow DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to stand for election to the assembly in May while retaining his seat at Westminster On Sunday, a DUP spokesman said other parties in Northern Ireland were ""throwing dust in the air"". ""This proposed step by the government would bring Northern Ireland into line with other parts of the United Kingdom and encourage stability at a time when devolution is deeply unstable because of a one-sided and undemocratic Protocol,"" he continued. ""It was first proposed by the SDLP's sister party in the House of Commons before Sir Jeffrey was Leader of the DUP. ""Therefore if parties are surprised, they were asleep at the wheel when this was being discussed in the House of Commons."" Multi-tasking has never been a problem for our politicians. Why have one job when you can have two, or maybe three? Ian Paisley and John Hume, for example, were for many years simultaneously members of the House of Commons, the European Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. For a while in the 1980s, the North Down MP James Kilfedder was famously paid more than the prime minister when he was also speaker of the assembly. And for years after Stormont returned post-1998, the vast majority of Northern Ireland's 18 MPs also held seats in the assembly and some even had third roles as executive ministers. It was the political norm until theexpenses scandalhit Westminster and trust in politicians hit rock bottom. In the public outcry which followed, the acceptable dual mandate was re-labelled unacceptable double jobbing. Ironically, the man who helped draw up the rules ending the practice here, Lord Caine, is the same man who has laid out the plan to bring it back now in a time-limited way. Read more here. The plan was proposed by Lord Alderdice during a committee stage reading of the NI (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill on Wednesday. Lord Alderdice, whoquit the Alliance Party in 2006,externaland is now a Liberal Democrat peer, argued that dual mandates would encourage easier transitions between serving in London and Belfast, and benefit the Northern Ireland Assembly. Former UUP leader Lord Trimble and former DUP deputy leader Lord Dodds spoke in favour of the move in the House of Lords. However, former SDLP leader Baroness Ritchie said that while there was a case to be made for the amendment, she was strongly opposed to double jobbing. In his letter, Lord Caine said he was opposed to the possibility of double jobbing remaining indefinitely so the amendment was reworked with a time limit. The Lords are due to consider the amended proposal this week. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the plan was ""out of touch with public opinion"" Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said the move was ""a backwards step"" and that the party's former leader Lord Alderdice made ""a fundamentally poor judgement call"" to propose the reintroduction of double jobbing. Mr Farry told BBC's Sunday Politics show that the move coming so close to an election amounted to ""interfering with democratic process"". The North Down MP said Lord Alderdice ""does not speak for the Alliance Party, does not represent them"". He said members of the House of Lords who supported the proposal were ""out of touch with public opinion here in Northern Ireland, which is very much against this move"". ""We've been told all along this legislation is about faithfully implementingthe New Decade, New Approach agreementand putting in place provisions for that new legislative provision,"" he said. ""There has not been any proper consultation with Northern Ireland parties on this particular development bar a few members of the House of Lords who do not represent mainstream views. ""The government has acted beyond their remit."" Ulster Unionist assembly member Mike Nesbitt said he was ""nearly speechless"" at the proposal which ""goes totally against [the] spirit of what we tried to do"" to share power in Stormont. The Strangford MLA accused the government of ""going out of its way to prop up and support the DUP"". ""Why did we stop it six years ago, why are we bringing it back now and why are we making it time limited? I think the answer is obvious, to help out the DUP,"" he said. ""There are five parties in government and the spirit of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement is that it is fair to all five. ""This is not fair to all five."" A spokesperson from the Northern Ireland Office said the proposals would be ""subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny"". ""The government's proposal is for any dual mandates to be strictly time limited to the subsequent Westminster election. ""ItÂ will enable the smoother transition between legislatures should an MP wish to take a seat in the NI Assembly,Â and therefore supports the objectives of the bill in promoting greater stability,"" the spokesperson said.Â MPs to be able to sit in Stormont as MLAs Four executive parties oppose double jobbing return Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Mr Horta-Osorio joined Credit Suisse in April last year The chairman of global banking giant Credit Suisse, Antonio Horta-Osorio, has resigned with immediate effect after breaking Covid quarantine rules. Mr Horta-Osorio, who was with the bank for just nine months, left following an internal investigation. The former boss of Lloyds Banking Group joined Credit Suisse after a series of scandals at the Swiss bank. But it has emerged he breached Covid rules last year, including by attending the Wimbledon tennis finals. ""I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,"" Mr Horta-Osorio said ina statement issued by the bank,external. ""I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time,"" he added. Mr Horta-Osorio has been replaced by board member Axel Lehmann. Antonio Horta-Osorio broke Covid rules when he attended Wimbledon, where Novak Djokovic won the male singles title Last month, a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse had found that Mr Horta-Osorio had breached Covid-19 rules. He attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in July at a time when the UK's Covid-19 restrictions required him to be in quarantine. Mr Horta-Osorio also breached Swiss Covid restrictions when,according to Reuters,external, he flew into the country on 28 November but left on 1 December. Swiss rules meant he should have quarantined for 10 days upon his arrival. Mr Horta-Osorio joined Credit Suisse in April last year following a series of scandals at the bank, In February 2020, then-Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam resigned after it was revealed the bank had spied on senior employees. Mr Thiam denied knowledge of the spying operations. Credit Suisse has also been hit with huge losses in connection with the failed financial firm Greensill - which backed Liberty Steel - and Archegos, the US hedge fund which collapsed last year. Last year, in a report into its relationship with Archegos, Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""We are committed to developing a culture of personal responsibility and accountability."" There are two narratives emerging from Antonio Horta-Osorio's short-lived tenure at the top of one of Swiss banking giants. One is that he broke the rules, was investigated and, having been found in breach, was asked to step down. But allies of the former boss of Lloyds Banking Group insist that the board of Credit Suisse could have censured him rather than forced him out and suggest that the Swiss bank had not appreciated his efforts to reform an executive team and a culture that has been hit a series of scandals in recent years. Credit Suisse clients lost billions after the bank funnelled them into financial products designed by the collapsed Greensill Capital while the bank itself took a multi-billion hit from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos. The bank also found itself at the centre of an unusual spying scandal which saw the departure of chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Ironically, the man Credit Suisse brought in to bring an end to a string of negative headlines is the subject of them this morning. Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment firm United First Partners, said Credit Suisse ""has been in the 'damaged goods' section for a while now"". ""While Horta-Osorio was responsible for the new strategy, his short tenure means that the revamp is likely to only be in the nascent stage. The irony of it is that Horta was hired to fix the reputational damage to Credit Suisse and revamp its risk taking culture in the bank."" In his statement, Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""I am proud of what we have achieved together in my short time at the bank."" But George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC: ""Only [nine] months in is not really time to achieve much. ""He was brought in to turn around the business - it is a bank that has been hit by scandal - and so it means that his reign has been cut short. ""Not everybody is above the law for Covid restrictions."" Mr Horta-Osorio was chief executive at Lloyds Banking Group for 10 years, the start of which was marked by a surprise two month leave of absence todeal with severe sleep deprivation. Later on, amidmedia reports of an extra-marital affair, Mr Horta-Osorio emailed Lloyds staff, saying: ""I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group's reputation. ""I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me."" Speaking to the BBC, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse said that the bank would give no further details on Mr Horta-Osorio's resignation other than those in its statement. They also said that there were no plans to release the findings of the investigation.

"The powerful storm uprooted trees, making some roads impassable in Charlotte, North Carolina A major winter storm has brought heavy snow and ice to parts of the US and Canada, putting more than 80 million people under weather warnings. More than 145,000 people are without power in some south-eastern states, and thousands of flights are cancelled. Virginia, Georgia, and North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. The US National Weather Service (NWS) says more than 1ft (30cm) of snow is expected in some areas. Snow and ice could result in ""dangerous travel, power outages, and tree damage"", the NWS warned. Highway patrols reported hundreds of vehicle accidents, according to the Associated Press news agency. There were also forecasts of possible coastal flooding in some areas, including in New York City and parts of Connecticut, with warnings that roads and infrastructure could be affected. This video can not be played More disruption possible from US Storm In Canada's Ontario province, which shares a border with New York state, officials issued storm warnings on Sunday morning for much of the south. Toronto, the capital of the province and Canada's largest city, is forecast to get seven inches (20cm) of snow. More than 3,000 flights into and out of the US were cancelled on Sunday, according to the FlightAware data tracking website. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina was among the worst hit, with almost 90% of flights scrapped, and a message on its website urged passengers to check with their airlines before travelling to the airport. How to stay safe in freezing weather In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster called on residents to stay off the roads. ""This is going to be a pretty bad storm in the upper part of the state,"" he said, adding that it was ""good news"" that the storm was forecast to hit on a weekend and on a public holiday on Monday, when fewer people would need to travel. ""Hopefully, the storm will underdeliver, but it could overdeliver. We just don't know,"" Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said as he announced preparations for his state. Winter storm bears down on Canada and USA.

"A community trust in Glasgow is having to choose between paying energy bills and paying staff, its manager said. Dramatic increases in the price of electricity have blown apart the budgets at Govanhill Baths Community Trust. Trust Manager Fatima Uygun said price increases meant it now costs the same to provide power to some areas as it did to pay for a staff member. Without help, she fears the charity will be forced to make more cuts. The community trust provides a range of mental health support as well as food and other services to people who need them. Like every household, it is affected by recent soaring energy costs. How to smooth over the energy price shock Energy firm failures will mean higher bills, says Scottish Power What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ms Uygan toldBBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Show: ""Almost overnight, it has dramatically affected our work."" ""Our budgets are usually set at the start of the financial year and very quickly we have had to adjust to prioritising our energy bills over delivering services, sometimes quite vital services around mental health which has come as a bit of a shock to us."" Like many charities in the same position, the trust has been forced to make urgent adjustments. Ms Uygun said: ""In one venue our prices went up by 50% overnight because our energy provider went bankrupt. We were put on a different provider and  where we had been paying Â£200 a month it went to Â£400 a month. ""That is the equivalent to someone doing sessional work or part-time work to deliver mental health services."" Having to pay more in bills means the trust has had to cut back on fresh fruit and vegetables for its People's Pantry food bank. Mrs Uygun said the trust has had to cut back on fresh fruit and vegetables for its food bank Last week,British Gas owner Centrica warned that high energy bills could affect household bills for the next two years. Chief executive Chris O'Shea said there was ""no reason"" to expect gas prices would come down ""any time soon"". Households and businesses are not the only ones feeling the pinch. Charities and volunteer groups are also struggling. Those working out of old buildings which are not energy efficient are finding that heating them with increased prices puts a dent in the running costs. And volunteer and community services are already stretched due to Covid. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations told BBC Scotland that rising costs were already having a significant impact on the services its members could provide. It is likely to mean an increase in demand for things like money advice services and mental health support. Ms Uygun said: ""We'll have to make cuts if things don't change and that usually affects projects which are already a bit under-funded and are difficult to find funding for. ""So mental health support groups such as the local knitting club, or the lunch club, or cutting back on the variety of fresh fruit and vegetables for the People's Pantry, people will notice the difference unfortunately."" Mental health support groups such as the local knitting club are likely to be affected, Mrs Uygun said So far, Govanhill Baths Trust has had no support from the local council or the Scottish government. The charity feels it is something which will have to be addressed at a government level. ""The idea that energy companies are out of the goodness of their heart will cut profit - which is where this is all going - is not going to happen, Ms Uygun said. ""We are hoping the voluntary sector is putting enough pressure on the Scottish government to at least offer a price freeze or a reduction through some kind of exemption or subsidy. ""Without it, organisations like us at the coal face who provide these services are going to have to make difficult decisions and that is going to mean quite a lot more people are going to fall through the cracks."" Kirsten Hogg, Head of Policy at the SCVO said: ""It can be difficult for organisations to secure funding to cover overhead costs.Â Funding is often available for the direct costs of providing a project, but not the core costs of running the organisation, which could include heating and lighting of buildings. ""And it is common for voluntary sector contracts and grants not to be uplifted for inflation. We are aware of organisations that have received the same amount of money for up to six years, and have been expected to deliver the same service with no increase to cover rising costs. ""A dramatic increase in costs, such as we are currently seeing in relation to energy prices, is therefore unlikely to be covered by existing funders and will have a significant impact."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The third sector is a valued partner and we recognise the impact of rising fuel costs on our charities and voluntary organisations. ""Pricing in the gas and electricity markets is reserved, meaning the Scottish government's options to mitigate these costs are limited. Ministers have written to the UK government to call for urgent action to tackle rising energy costs.""
