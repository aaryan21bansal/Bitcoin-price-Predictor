"People queued up to receive monkeypox vaccinations at a pop-up clinic at Guy's Hospital last month Sexual health charities and LGBT groups are calling for the government to step up efforts to control the monkeypox outbreak in the UK. In an open letter to Health Secretary Steven Barclay, they say that without a quicker and wider vaccine rollout, the virus could become ""endemic"". There have been more than 2,600 cases ofmonkeypoxin the UK so far, mostly among men who have sex with men. The Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) says it is working ""rapidly"" to vaccinate those at risk. With two of the UK's most popular Pride events, inBrightonthis weekend, and Manchester later in August, many people are trying to get vaccinated in order to feel safer. BBC News has spoken to gay and bisexual men who say they have struggled to get the jab at their local clinics, and have had to travel to London or other large cities. A spokesperson for the DHSC said it had already administered thousands of vaccines and that it is ""working rapidly"" to offer more appointments. They said: ""We have procured over 150,000 vaccines, and we're working with partners - including the NHS and UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) - to share targeted, non-stigmatising communications with the LGBTQ+ community."" Currently about75% of monkeypox cases are in London, which is where the majority of vaccines have been targeted, but numbers outside the city are also increasing. What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? We have 100,000 monkeypox vaccine doses - minister 'Formidable' challenges as monkeypox spreads - WHO Monkeypox: 'I never thought it would be something I'd get' The Terrence Higgins Trust, which co-wrotethe letter,external, says the rollout needs to be speeded up across the UK to help combat ""fear and anxiety"" within the LGBT community. Its head of policy Ceri Smith told BBC News: ""We need to see far better co-ordination, increased vaccine procurement, improved delivery and a cash injection to sexual health services to treat monkeypox."" The letter was also signed by representatives from LGBT groups for the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the Green Party. It reads: ""Without urgent action, we risk monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK. This poses a serious risk to health and will exacerbate thehealth inequalities already experienced by gay and bisexual menand other men who have sex with men. ""Vaccinating those most at risk of monkeypox must be a priority if we are to stand a chance of preventing the virus from becoming endemic in the UK."" The letter also asks the government to deliver clearer messaging aimed at men who have sex with men about the symptoms of the virus, and what steps people should take if they believe they have become infected. As of 1 August, NHS England stated that more than 14,000 people had received Imvanex, a vaccine designed to protect against smallpox, which the UKHSA says helps protect people who could be exposed to monkeypox. The UK is expecting to receive 100,000 more vaccines in September The UKHSA saysan extra 100,000 vaccineswill arrive in the UK in September, with the aim of delivering the first 20,000 for use by the NHS this month. Current guidance is to give most people a single dose. But some sexual health expertsestimate around 250,000,externalvaccines are needed, and have recommended that people should be given two doses for maximum protection. The monkeypox vaccine rollout is being co-ordinated locally by sexual health clinics across the UK, with each clinic taking an individual approach based on urgency and need. This means there are different approaches to inviting people to appointments, and differences in who is considered high risk across the country. Dr Mary Ramsay, director of clinical programmes at UKHSA, told the BBC that the vaccine is ""being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox, in order to offer them protection and contain the current outbreak."" She added: ""We continue to monitor supply and remain in discussion with the manufacturer."" Alex Bradbrook, a civil servant from Manchester, considers himself to be in a high-risk category for acquiring monkeypox. He was vaccinated at a clinic in London while visiting for the weekend, after struggling to get one closer to home for several weeks. Alex received a jab in London, where he was visiting to attend a Lady Gaga concert He told the BBC: ""I was in London for the weekend and found out via Twitter that a clinic in Hammersmith was offering the vaccine, so I called about 20 times and finally got through to someone and got an appointment."" While he's aware the vaccine isn't 100% effective in preventing monkeypox, Alex says it's a relief when heading to Pride events that he has some protection. He added: ""Now that I've got my jab I feel much more reassured. The minute that needle went in, it was like a huge weight being lifted off my mind. ""I'm really fortunate that I was already in London and able to get one. There are lots of people who just aren't in my position - people who either can't afford a train or can't get down there for whatever reason. It makes me quite angry that some people don't seem to be getting an adequate service who might be at high risk."" What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?

"This video can not be played Watch as Alex Jones is told his text messages were sent to opposing lawyers by mistake Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $4.1m (Â£3.3m) in damages after falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. The parents of a victim have sought at least $150m in the Texas defamation trial against the Infowars founder. They said they endured harassment and emotional distress because of the right-wing host's misinformation. Twenty children and six adults were shot dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The jury in the city of Austin decided compensatory damages on Thursday, and must still determine any punitive damages. BACKGROUND:Sandy Hook: What happened that day LEGAL CASE:Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation Jones - who was not in court when the outcome was announced - has repeatedly argued that the shooting was a hoax organised by the government in order to strip Americans of gun ownership rights, and that the parents of the dead children were ""crisis actors"". He has already lost a series of defamation cases brought by parents of the victims by default after failing to produce documents and testimony. But this is the first in which financial damages were agreed by a jury. The case was brought by Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, the separated parents of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who died in the school shooting. Ahead of Thursday's decision, a lawyer for the plaintiffs revealed that Jones' lawyer had inadvertently sent him two years of texts from his client's phone. The attorney said a congressional panel investigating last year's US Capitol riot had already requested access to the messages. The committee has said Jones helped organise a rally that took place just before the riot. Despite retracting his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones has continued to use his platform to attack jurors and the judge in this case. Jesse Lewis, six, was killed at Sandy Hook He also claimed he was bankrupt despite evidence that his companies were earning about $800,000 a day selling diet supplements, gun paraphernalia and survivalist equipment. During the emotionally charged two-week trial, Jones portrayed the case as an attack on his free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. ""Speech is free, but lies you have to pay for,"" lawyers for the families countered in their opening arguments. Testifying on Wednesday, Jones acknowledged the Sandy Hook attack was ""100% real"" and apologised for having ""hurt these people's feelings"". But in her testimony, Mrs Lewis addressed Jones in court, saying: ""Jesse was realâ¦ I'm a real mom."" She went on to say it is ""incredible to me that we have to do this"". ""That we have to implore you - not just implore you, punish you - to get you to stop lying,"" she continued, adding: ""It is surreal what is going on in here."" Mr Heslin said that Jones' lies ""tarnished the honour and legacy"" of his son, adding that he had gone through nearly 10 years of ""hell"" since the attack. According to lawyers for the parents, they were forced to hire private security for the trial out of concern that followers of Jones could seek to harm them. The parents said Jones had made their lives ""hell"" One forensic psychiatrist testified that the parents were suffering from ""complex post-traumatic stress disorder"" similar to what battlefield soldiers or victims of child abuse endure. Lawyers for the parents accused Jones of trying to hide evidence, and argued that he had committed perjury when he denied sending messages related to the Sandy Hook attack. Jones' Infowars parent company, Free Speech Systems LLC, declared bankruptcy last week. The outlet has been banned by YouTube, Spotify and Twitter for hate speech, but continues to operate. Other wild conspiracies pushed by Jones include that the US government is creating floods and tornados as ""weather weapons"" and that chemicals in drinking water are making frogs homosexual. Lawyer Mark Banston, who represented the parents in the case, told reporters outside court on Thursday that his clients were not disappointed with the sum awarded by the jury. ""We aren't done folks,"" the attorney was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. ""We knew coming into this case it was necessary to shoot for the moon to get the jury to understand we were serious and passionate. After tomorrow, he's going to owe a lot more.""

"Armoured police cars were brought in to try to safeguard the blast site Explosions at an ammunition storage facility have caused a large wildfire in a forest in western Berlin. The site in Grunewald forest is used by German police to store and detonate unexploded ordnance, often from World War Two, which continues to be dug up during construction. Firefighters' efforts have been hampered by sporadic explosions which could be seen and heard miles away. Questions are being asked about why the facility is in a forest prone to fires. Some 140 firefighters are at the scene, and have set up a safety perimeter of 1,000m (3,280ft) because of the ongoing blasts. ""We had explosion-like combustions and detonations. Debris was flying through the air, leading to a high danger to the life of the first responders, so they had to withdraw,"" Berlin fire brigade spokesman Thomas Kirstein told reporters at the scene. While the situation was ""extremely extraordinary"", he added, there was ""no danger for Berliners"". An army tank has been sent in to evacuate munitions at the storage facility, which is run by Berlin police's weapons disposal units. Remote-controlled de-mining robots and drones are also being used to help assess the situation, according to German media. On Thursday afternoon, the blaze was still not under control and had burned 15,000 square metres of the forest, authorities said. Munitions of all sizes are stored at the blast site, including fireworks. Videos shared online show how large some of the blasts were, and fireworks exploding in colour over the treetops.

"This video can not be played WATCH: The Battle for Number 10 - Moments from the Sky News special Tory leadership rivals Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have set out competing plans to deal with the economic recession forecast by the Bank of England in their latest TV clash. Ms Truss said a recession was ""not inevitable"" if ""bold"" action was taken. But Mr Sunak said the foreign secretary's ""unfunded"" tax cuts would pour ""fuel on the fire"" of inflation. The Bank's gloomy forecast of a recession this year loomed large in the TV special, hosted by Sky News. It earlierraised interest rates by the steepest amount in almost three decades, from 1.25% to 1.75%, in an attempt to curb soaring prices. The inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13.3% this year, while the UK economy is expected to shrink for more than a year. The Bank said the main reason for high inflation and low growth was rising energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign, with both candidates putting forward rival visions to deal with the fallout. Pressure on for next PM to deliver on economy When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss's bid to be PM Mr Sunak, who has trailed in recent polls, has repeatedly said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he became prime minister. Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn soon after she enters office, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and the cost of borrowing. The former chancellor told the Sky News programme: ""We in the Conservative Party need to get real and fast - because the lights on the economy are flashing red and the root cause is inflation."" Ms Truss reiterated her pledge to immediately reverse April's increase in National Insurance and cut other taxes, which she claimed would stimulate economic growth and prevent a recession. ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable,"" she said. ""We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, an ally of Ms Truss, has criticised the Bank of England's performance. He told Sky News there was a ""strong argument"" interest rates should have been raised ""slightly sooner"". ""The job of the Bank was to deal with the inflation,"" he said. ""They have got a 2% inflation target. That's actually their mandate."" He said the predicted inflation rate peak showed ""clearly something has gone wrong"". But former cabinet minister Liam Fox - who is supporting Mr Sunak - said the Truss campaign needed to be ""more precise"" about how their proposed changes to the Bank of England's mandate would work. He said: ""The Bank of England's going to be independent or not. The government's going to maintain its 2% inflation target or not."" While the governor of the Bank of England gave a sombre press conference, the candidates to be the next prime minister were preparing for their next turn in a TV studio. The two candidates - once again - took the chance to have a pop at each other's economic plans. Liz Truss claimed the tax levels Rishi Sunak advocates will lead to recession, not growth; Rishi Sunak claimed Liz Truss' plan to cut taxes will exacerbate inflation and prolong economic pain. It is territory the two have clashed over before, but while the wannabe PMs keep exchanging blows on the finer points of fiscal policy, there will be many worried families and businesses simply wondering whether the help on offer will be anywhere near enough - or what more may come. Read more from Alex. The pair are vying to win over Conservative Party members, whose votes will determine which of them will become the next Tory leader and prime minister. The party's roughly 160,000 members started receiving ballot papers on Monday, with the result due on 5 September, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson will leave office. Despite trailing in many polls of members, Mr Sunak appeared to win the most support among the Sky News audience members in a show of hands. The programme saw an audience made up of Conservative members grill the candidates on a range of issues, including NHS funding, immigration and climate change. The worsening state of the UK economy has dominated the Tory leadership campaign In one testy exchange, Ms Truss disagreed with an audience member who expressed concerns about debt that would be incurred by the foreign secretary's tax plans. Ms Truss said in response that ""trying to balance the books prematurely is actually counterproductive"" and growing the economy was more important. Asked if she was happy with the answer, the Conservative member said she was not. She told Ms Truss that what former Tory prime minister Margaret Thatcher ""believed in was sound money"", adding ""this is not sound economics"". Liz Truss insisted her regional pay policy was ""misrepresented by various people"" Ms Truss was also put on the back foot by programme host Kay Burley, who repeatedly asked the foreign secretary if hernow-scrapped proposal to link public sector pay to local living costswas ""a mistake"". But Ms Truss resisted such an admission, and instead insisted her regional pay policy was ""misrepresented by various people"". At times, Mr Sunak looked uncomfortable when pressed by Ms Burley, too. She asked how he felt about so many former cabinet colleagues - including Nadhim Zahawi, Ben Wallace and Sajid Javid - backing Ms Truss's campaign and not his. ""Plenty of people who have sat around the cabinet table also support me,"" Mr Sunak said, highlighting Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab as one of his supporters. On whether there was nothing he could do about a recession, Mr Sunak said: ""Of course, there is, of course."" He said Ms Truss was wrong to suggest the tax burden was causing the recession, pointing instead to inflation. In other parts of the TV programme,Ms Truss: said she wanted to encourage doctors who came out of retirement to help the NHS during the pandemic ""to come back into the profession"" refused to say whether she would suspend Boris Johnson as a Tory MP if he was found to have lied to Parliament insisted she has nothing to hide, telling the audience ""there are no skeletons in my closet"" AndMr Sunak: insisted he would ""fight incredibly hard 'til the last day"" of the leadership campaign and not quit before results day said an ""enormous difference"" can be made between now and next winter to reduce the UK's dependence on Russian energy defended an old video where he claimed not to have any working-class friends, saying ""we all say silly things when we are younger"" Speaking after the debate, Labour shadow minister without portfolio Conor McGinn said whichever candidate won their ""low-growth, low-wage plans"" would not fix the economic crisis. ""The two continuity candidates have no answers to sky-high inflation, rocketing energy bills and the lengthy recession the Bank of England has warned is on the horizon,"" he said. Asked about energy bills on Friday morning, Ms Truss acknowledged it was ""going to be a tough winter"" and pledged to release reserves of gas in the North Sea, as well as supporting fracking and nuclear power.

"Tory leadership hopefuls Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have been taking questions in another TV event - this one hosted by Sky News The foreign secretary defends her U-turn on regional pay policy; sets out how she would rescue the economy; and is asked whether she owes the Queen an apology Meanwhile, Sunak defends his role in Boris Johnson's downfall; says nothing off the table to solve cost of living crisis; and pledges to go further to punish Putin The candidates will take part in more hustings in front of Tory members throughout the rest of August It's those Conservative Party members who will choose the next PM, with a result due on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles That's it from us for tonight - thank you for joining our coverage of tonight's Tory leadership special on Sky News. It was brought to you by Arryn Moy, James Harness, Emily McGarvey, Adam Durbin, George Bowden, James FitzGerald, Claire Heald and Chris Giles. The finalists in the Tory leadership contest, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have been taking part in a leadership special on Sky News. Here's a round up of some of the main things they were asked about. Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak  It also seems Sunak won the room after a majority of Sky Newsâs live studio audience
said they would be more likely to vote for him following an old-fashioned show
of hands at the end of the broadcast. Weâve heard more this evening about some of Rishi Sunak and Liz Trussâs policies. The contenders have different views on tax, the cost of living crisis and restoring trust in politics and politicians. So what exactly are the leadership hopefuls promising to deliver if they win the keys to No 10? Find out from our guide. Liz Truss supporter, Adele, says Sunak's missed appointment fines would affect the poorest and most vulnerable Conservative voters in Worcester have had a mixed reaction after tonight's programme. Adele, a Liz Truss supporter, says that Rishi Sunak suggests ""the economy is the most important thing - I'm not sure I agree with him. I think there are other things just as important, like the issue of healthcare."" She says Sunak's pledge to issue a fine for missed NHS appointments will affect the poorest and most vulnerable unfairly. Christy was undecided before the show, but she is now convinced Rishi Sunak would make the better PM. She says he came across ""very strong, principled and honest and that's what the public need. You can trust him with the economy, he's been a very good chancellor, he's looked after people during the pandemic. He would make a fine prime minister."" She says she doesn't think Liz Truss has the ""experience or the drive to be prime minster"". One undecided voter, Mark, thinks both candidates are excellent and would beat Labour leader Keir Starmer. ""Either of them will keep the conservative flag flying high."" Christy from Worcester says Rishi Sunak would make a fine prime minister The BBC's Nick Robinson has been revisiting interviews he did with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak for his Political Thinking podcast. Here you can listen to the interview he did with Liz Trussin December 2021, where, as foreign secretary, she discusses facing down Russia on the global stage and talks comparisons of her with former Tory PM Margaret Thatcher. Click here to revisit Robinson's interview with Rishi Sunakfrom 2019, where he talks about working in his motherâs pharmacy and why he chose to vote Leave in the Brexit referendum. Kwasi Kwarteng - who supports Liz Truss in the leadership race - gives Sky News his reaction to what he's heard tonight. He concedes that ""Rishi did well"" but says it was only fair that Tory members were able to raise their ""doubts"" over pledges made during Sunak's campaign. Kwarteng is quizzed on whether Truss appeared too ""strident"" in some of her answers, for example by refusing to apologise following a U-turn over a public sector pay proposal. He acknowledges that Truss is ""not as slick as other presenters"", but insists she is ""sincere, honest and hard-working"". The national polls may put Liz Truss well ahead in the leadership race but, as we've been reporting, Rishi Sunak won the audience vote tonight from those taking part in the Sky News programme. Sunak backer Dominic Raab says he wasn't surprised by this but admits it was a good debate from both candidates. ""Rishi was more credible on the economy, and more compelling on the issue of uniting the party and he responded very strongly to tricky questions,"" Raab says. ""He got the most applause out of the two candidates and the more people see Rishi Sunak, the more compelling and the more they warm towards him."" Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News It will be a boost for Rishi Sunak that at the end of the debate a majority of those undecided conservative members in the studio said they would vote for him. Given the prediction of polls, putting Liz Truss ahead, that might surprise many. The optics of lots of people putting their hands up in support of Rishi Sunak might be just what he needs to change the narrative of this contest. The majority of audience members raised their hands for Rishi Sunak The live studio audience has expressed who they are most likely to vote for prime minister after hearing both candidates speak tonight. After a computer voting system crashed, an old-fashioned show of hands revealed the majority of the audience supported Rishi Sunak for party leader after the debate. A much smaller number of audience members raise their hands in favour of Liz Truss to be the next PM - in the unscientific poll. ""I wasn't expecting that,"" remarks presenter Kay Burley. Fewer audience members raised their hand for Liz Truss Presenter Kay Burley asks Sunak about the fact that so many of his former colleagues in government are backing Liz Truss. Sunak replies by pointing out he topped the polls of fellow MPs at every possible stage. He says he is ""really humbled"" by the support he has received from colleagues from ""every part of the parliamentary party"" and refuses to be drawn on who will be in his cabinet. ""But I will build a team that reflects all the talent and traditions of our party,"" Sunak says, concluding that they will come together after this contest and defeat Labour at the next general election. Some quick-fire questions for Sunak on climate issues next. Whether or not to open new coal mines are ""local decisions"" Sunak says - but he says he opposes importing the fuel. As for fracking - he says he's in favour ""where it's supported by locals"". When it comes to setting up new onshore wind farms, he says he is opposed - clarifying that he ""didn't fully understand"" a question put to him last night which appeared to signal a different view. Sunak says he supports the UK's Rwanda policy - which sees asylum seekers sent to the African country. But he says reports he was lukewarm towards the idea perhaps came about because he asks ""tough questions when cabinet ministers come to me and say 'oh we'd like to do this new things?'"" He says ""my job is to make sure everyone's money is spent properly"". Sunak adds that the Rwanda plan, which cost Â£120m, is a pilot programme which is why it was expensive. ""I believe in the policy but it's not good enough in government to just announce things, you need to deliver."" Sunak is asked if he is tough enough to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. The former chancellor says he was responsible for ""the most stringent set of economic sanctions the world has ever seen"" in punishing Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. He says he can go even further if he becomes the prime minister. ""Yes, I'm tough enough,"" he says. Kay Burley asks the level energy and food bills would need to go to before the UK assesses its support for Ukraine. Sunak says he doesn't think that is the right way to look at the situation. He argues the UK can make an ""enormous difference"" between now and next winter in ""reducing our dependence on Russian energy"". Sunak adds he will announce more support for people as the economic situation has deteriorated, but says there are lots of things that can be done to improve energy storage and energy efficiency. He says investment in improving insulation in peoples homes can be done quickly to both reduce usage and save them money. Asked if Ukraine support will continue ""if we lag our loft"", Sunak says people ought to be doing it anyway because of climate change. Rishi Sunak says the cause of the recession that was forecasted by the Bank of England today is inflation, not the tax burden. ""That's the root of the problems we have,"" he says. He says gripping inflation is his priority and he's not going to embark on a ""borrowing spree worth tens of billions of pounds, put that on the country's credit card, ask our kids and grandkids to pick up the tab because that's not right, it's not responsible and it's not conservative"". He says inflation will be under control when ""we're on a clearly downward trajectory and have a good line of sight that it's returning back to target"". Income tax cuts will happen in Sunak's longer term plan, he says, because he says he believes really strongly in rewarding hard work. Now Sunak is asked by Kay Burley why voters should trust him given that the UK appears to be heading for recession following his work as chancellor. He says it's precisely because of his work in the Treasury that people should back him. He says he acted ""boldly and radically"" as chancellor during the pandemic - with policies including the furlough scheme. He claims to have saved 10 million jobs and over a million businesses. ""People are grateful for it,"" he says. The final question from the audience is about how Sunak would balance solving the cost of living crisis with keeping government debt under control. Sunak says that, given the Bank of England's dire forecasts this afternoon, the Conservative Party needs to ""get real and fast because the lights on the economy are flashing red"". He says the root cause of this is inflation and that he's worried that Liz Truss' plans will make things worse. Sunak adds he wants to do something different and the government's number one priority should be grappling with inflation and helping people with the cost of living crisis. He also says he wants to grow the economy, but that all starts with ""not making the situation worse"". ""Because if we put fuel on the fire of this inflation spiral, all of us are going to end up with higher mortgages rates, savings and pensions eaten away and misery for millions,"" Sunak concludes. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Rishi Sunak seemed to get very animated when he was defending his decision to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet. There are some who think it was an act of betrayal. It's an area he is vulnerable and a question that keeps coming up. Perhaps that's why he seemed frustrated by the end of his answer. After being asked if he can be trusted, following accusations that he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back, Sunak says he is ""proud"" of the work he achieved alongside the prime minister. But he says that it became ""too difficult"" to stay in his job. They had ""well documented differences on economic policy"", he says. The government was also on the ""wrong side of an ethical problem"" he adds, referring to the scandal involving MP Chris Pincher. Alexander asks Rishi Sunak what does honesty mean to him in politics and leadership? ""Honesty in a sense means telling you the truth, even when that's not easy. I think you can see in this leadership election that's why I'm doing - I'm saying some things are not the easiest thing in the world to hear. ""I'm not standing here promising you tens and tens of billions of pounds of goodies straight away because it's not right for our economy. ""My life would be far easier if I wasn't saying that but I want to be honest with you and straight about the challenges we face and what going to be required to fix them."" Audience member Steve responds by pointing out that Sunak worked with Boris Johnson but now wants to take over his role. Sunak says that while he is proud of the work they did together, ""it got to a point where it was too difficult for me to stay. ""It came to a point where the government was on the wrong side of an ethical dilemma that I could not defend,"" Sunak says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Liz Truss's team insists she had no part in organising the event at a London club last year Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss should be investigated over allegations she did not declare thousands of pounds spent on wooing MPs at a dinner event, Labour has said. Labour says a so-called ""Fizz with Liz"" event at a London club last year may have breached spending rules for MPs. The Independent said Â£3,000 was spent and paid by club owner Robin Birley. MPs must declare hospitality worth over Â£300, but Ms Truss's team says she did not organise the event. A spokesperson for Ms Truss said: ""A declaration would only need to made if there was a benefit to Liz, or it was above the threshold for individual declarations for MPs register of interests."" A source added the foreign secretary was one of a number of MPs in attendance at the event, which was hosted at the 5 Hertford Street club in Mayfair, London. When will we know who the new PM is? Truss backtracks on public worker pay plan What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? The event wasfirst reported by the Independent newspaper,external, which said about a dozen Tory MPs attended the ""champagne dinner"" at the private members' club. Ms Truss's campaign told the paper the event was ""put on"" by the club's owner Mr Birley, who has previously donated to the Conservative Party. The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Birley to request his comment on the event. A copy of an invitation to ""a dinner at 5 Hereford Street on Tuesday 26 October"", which came from Ms Truss's office and was apparently printed on parliamentary paper, has been shared with the BBC. Parliament's code of conduct,externalsays MPs must register ""any gifts, benefits or hospitality with a value of over Â£300 which they receive from a UK source"". This includes ""benefits which relate in any way to their membership of the House or political activities, if provided by a UK source either free or at concessionary rates"". An ally of Ms Truss's Tory leadership rival, Rishi Sunak, said there were questions to be answered ""about who organised the event, who paid for it and why nothing was declared"". In a letter, Labour said Ms Truss had ""serious questions"" to answer about spending on the event and asked the Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to investigate the matter. The letter - written by Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner and shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire - said the Â£3,000 reportedly spent on the event had ""not been declared either on the foreign secretary's ministerial gifts declaration, October to December 2021, or in her Register of Members' Financial Interests, as at 1 November 2021"". The letter says there are ""questions about whether the foreign secretary was acting in her ministerial capacity, or her capacity as a member of Parliament"" at the event. ""The public has a right to know why such a significant donation for hospitality was not properly declared by the foreign secretary,"" the letter says. The Liberal Democrats have called on Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone to open an investigation into the matter. Located on the corner of Shepherd Market in Mayfair, 5 Hertford Street is reported to be one of London's most exclusive clubs. The club made headlines earlier this yearwhen the Sunday Times reported,externalMs Truss had used the venue to host receptions with Tory MPs in preparation for a possible leadership bid.

It was brought to you by Arryn Moy, James Harness, Emily McGarvey, Adam Durbin, George Bowden, James FitzGerald, Claire Heald and Chris Giles. The finalists in the Tory leadership contest, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have been taking part in a leadership special on Sky News. Here's a round up of some of the main things they were asked about. Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak  It also seems Sunak won the room after a majority of Sky Newsâs live studio audience
said they would be more likely to vote for him following an old-fashioned show
of hands at the end of the broadcast. Weâve heard more this evening about some of Rishi Sunak and Liz Trussâs policies. The contenders have different views on tax, the cost of living crisis and restoring trust in politics and politicians. So what exactly are the leadership hopefuls promising to deliver if they win the keys to No 10? Find out from our guide. Liz Truss supporter, Adele, says Sunak's missed appointment fines would affect the poorest and most vulnerable Conservative voters in Worcester have had a mixed reaction after tonight's programme. Adele, a Liz Truss supporter, says that Rishi Sunak suggests ""the economy is the most important thing - I'm not sure I agree with him. I think there are other things just as important, like the issue of healthcare."" She says Sunak's pledge to issue a fine for missed NHS appointments will affect the poorest and most vulnerable unfairly. Christy was undecided before the show, but she is now convinced Rishi Sunak would make the better PM. She says he came across ""very strong, principled and honest and that's what the public need. You can trust him with the economy, he's been a very good chancellor, he's looked after people during the pandemic. He would make a fine prime minister."" She says she doesn't think Liz Truss has the ""experience or the drive to be prime minster"". One undecided voter, Mark, thinks both candidates are excellent and would beat Labour leader Keir Starmer. ""Either of them will keep the conservative flag flying high."" Christy from Worcester says Rishi Sunak would make a fine prime minister The BBC's Nick Robinson has been revisiting interviews he did with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak for his Political Thinking podcast. Here you can listen to the interview he did with Liz Trussin December 2021, where, as foreign secretary, she discusses facing down Russia on the global stage and talks comparisons of her with former Tory PM Margaret Thatcher. Click here to revisit Robinson's interview with Rishi Sunakfrom 2019, where he talks about working in his motherâs pharmacy and why he chose to vote Leave in the Brexit referendum. Kwasi Kwarteng - who supports Liz Truss in the leadership race - gives Sky News his reaction to what he's heard tonight. He concedes that ""Rishi did well"" but says it was only fair that Tory members were able to raise their ""doubts"" over pledges made during Sunak's campaign. Kwarteng is quizzed on whether Truss appeared too ""strident"" in some of her answers, for example by refusing to apologise following a U-turn over a public sector pay proposal. He acknowledges that Truss is ""not as slick as other presenters"", but insists she is ""sincere, honest and hard-working"". The national polls may put Liz Truss well ahead in the leadership race but, as we've been reporting, Rishi Sunak won the audience vote tonight from those taking part in the Sky News programme. Sunak backer Dominic Raab says he wasn't surprised by this but admits it was a good debate from both candidates. ""Rishi was more credible on the economy, and more compelling on the issue of uniting the party and he responded very strongly to tricky questions,"" Raab says. ""He got the most applause out of the two candidates and the more people see Rishi Sunak, the more compelling and the more they warm towards him."" Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News It will be a boost for Rishi Sunak that at the end of the debate a majority of those undecided conservative members in the studio said they would vote for him. Given the prediction of polls, putting Liz Truss ahead, that might surprise many. The optics of lots of people putting their hands up in support of Rishi Sunak might be just what he needs to change the narrative of this contest. The majority of audience members raised their hands for Rishi Sunak The live studio audience has expressed who they are most likely to vote for prime minister after hearing both candidates speak tonight. After a computer voting system crashed, an old-fashioned show of hands revealed the majority of the audience supported Rishi Sunak for party leader after the debate. A much smaller number of audience members raise their hands in favour of Liz Truss to be the next PM - in the unscientific poll. ""I wasn't expecting that,"" remarks presenter Kay Burley. Fewer audience members raised their hand for Liz Truss Presenter Kay Burley asks Sunak about the fact that so many of his former colleagues in government are backing Liz Truss. Sunak replies by pointing out he topped the polls of fellow MPs at every possible stage. He says he is ""really humbled"" by the support he has received from colleagues from ""every part of the parliamentary party"" and refuses to be drawn on who will be in his cabinet. ""But I will build a team that reflects all the talent and traditions of our party,"" Sunak says, concluding that they will come together after this contest and defeat Labour at the next general election. Some quick-fire questions for Sunak on climate issues next. Whether or not to open new coal mines are ""local decisions"" Sunak says - but he says he opposes importing the fuel. As for fracking - he says he's in favour ""where it's supported by locals"". When it comes to setting up new onshore wind farms, he says he is opposed - clarifying that he ""didn't fully understand"" a question put to him last night which appeared to signal a different view. Sunak says he supports the UK's Rwanda policy - which sees asylum seekers sent to the African country. But he says reports he was lukewarm towards the idea perhaps came about because he asks ""tough questions when cabinet ministers come to me and say 'oh we'd like to do this new things?'"" He says ""my job is to make sure everyone's money is spent properly"". Sunak adds that the Rwanda plan, which cost Â£120m, is a pilot programme which is why it was expensive. ""I believe in the policy but it's not good enough in government to just announce things, you need to deliver."" Sunak is asked if he is tough enough to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. The former chancellor says he was responsible for ""the most stringent set of economic sanctions the world has ever seen"" in punishing Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. He says he can go even further if he becomes the prime minister. ""Yes, I'm tough enough,"" he says. Kay Burley asks the level energy and food bills would need to go to before the UK assesses its support for Ukraine. Sunak says he doesn't think that is the right way to look at the situation. He argues the UK can make an ""enormous difference"" between now and next winter in ""reducing our dependence on Russian energy"". Sunak adds he will announce more support for people as the economic situation has deteriorated, but says there are lots of things that can be done to improve energy storage and energy efficiency. He says investment in improving insulation in peoples homes can be done quickly to both reduce usage and save them money. Asked if Ukraine support will continue ""if we lag our loft"", Sunak says people ought to be doing it anyway because of climate change. Rishi Sunak says the cause of the recession that was forecasted by the Bank of England today is inflation, not the tax burden. ""That's the root of the problems we have,"" he says. He says gripping inflation is his priority and he's not going to embark on a ""borrowing spree worth tens of billions of pounds, put that on the country's credit card, ask our kids and grandkids to pick up the tab because that's not right, it's not responsible and it's not conservative"". He says inflation will be under control when ""we're on a clearly downward trajectory and have a good line of sight that it's returning back to target"". Income tax cuts will happen in Sunak's longer term plan, he says, because he says he believes really strongly in rewarding hard work. Now Sunak is asked by Kay Burley why voters should trust him given that the UK appears to be heading for recession following his work as chancellor. He says it's precisely because of his work in the Treasury that people should back him. He says he acted ""boldly and radically"" as chancellor during the pandemic - with policies including the furlough scheme. He claims to have saved 10 million jobs and over a million businesses. ""People are grateful for it,"" he says. The final question from the audience is about how Sunak would balance solving the cost of living crisis with keeping government debt under control. Sunak says that, given the Bank of England's dire forecasts this afternoon, the Conservative Party needs to ""get real and fast because the lights on the economy are flashing red"". He says the root cause of this is inflation and that he's worried that Liz Truss' plans will make things worse. Sunak adds he wants to do something different and the government's number one priority should be grappling with inflation and helping people with the cost of living crisis. He also says he wants to grow the economy, but that all starts with ""not making the situation worse"". ""Because if we put fuel on the fire of this inflation spiral, all of us are going to end up with higher mortgages rates, savings and pensions eaten away and misery for millions,"" Sunak concludes.

Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News It will be a boost for Rishi Sunak that at the end of the debate a majority of those undecided conservative members in the studio said they would vote for him. Given the prediction of polls, putting Liz Truss ahead, that might surprise many. The optics of lots of people putting their hands up in support of Rishi Sunak might be just what he needs to change the narrative of this contest. The majority of audience members raised their hands for Rishi Sunak The live studio audience has expressed who they are most likely to vote for prime minister after hearing both candidates speak tonight. After a computer voting system crashed, an old-fashioned show of hands revealed the majority of the audience supported Rishi Sunak for party leader after the debate. A much smaller number of audience members raise their hands in favour of Liz Truss to be the next PM - in the unscientific poll. ""I wasn't expecting that,"" remarks presenter Kay Burley. Fewer audience members raised their hand for Liz Truss Presenter Kay Burley asks Sunak about the fact that so many of his former colleagues in government are backing Liz Truss. Sunak replies by pointing out he topped the polls of fellow MPs at every possible stage. He says he is ""really humbled"" by the support he has received from colleagues from ""every part of the parliamentary party"" and refuses to be drawn on who will be in his cabinet. ""But I will build a team that reflects all the talent and traditions of our party,"" Sunak says, concluding that they will come together after this contest and defeat Labour at the next general election. Some quick-fire questions for Sunak on climate issues next. Whether or not to open new coal mines are ""local decisions"" Sunak says - but he says he opposes importing the fuel. As for fracking - he says he's in favour ""where it's supported by locals"". When it comes to setting up new onshore wind farms, he says he is opposed - clarifying that he ""didn't fully understand"" a question put to him last night which appeared to signal a different view. Sunak says he supports the UK's Rwanda policy - which sees asylum seekers sent to the African country. But he says reports he was lukewarm towards the idea perhaps came about because he asks ""tough questions when cabinet ministers come to me and say 'oh we'd like to do this new things?'"" He says ""my job is to make sure everyone's money is spent properly"". Sunak adds that the Rwanda plan, which cost Â£120m, is a pilot programme which is why it was expensive. ""I believe in the policy but it's not good enough in government to just announce things, you need to deliver."" Sunak is asked if he is tough enough to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. The former chancellor says he was responsible for ""the most stringent set of economic sanctions the world has ever seen"" in punishing Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. He says he can go even further if he becomes the prime minister. ""Yes, I'm tough enough,"" he says. Kay Burley asks the level energy and food bills would need to go to before the UK assesses its support for Ukraine. Sunak says he doesn't think that is the right way to look at the situation. He argues the UK can make an ""enormous difference"" between now and next winter in ""reducing our dependence on Russian energy"". Sunak adds he will announce more support for people as the economic situation has deteriorated, but says there are lots of things that can be done to improve energy storage and energy efficiency. He says investment in improving insulation in peoples homes can be done quickly to both reduce usage and save them money. Asked if Ukraine support will continue ""if we lag our loft"", Sunak says people ought to be doing it anyway because of climate change. Rishi Sunak says the cause of the recession that was forecasted by the Bank of England today is inflation, not the tax burden. ""That's the root of the problems we have,"" he says. He says gripping inflation is his priority and he's not going to embark on a ""borrowing spree worth tens of billions of pounds, put that on the country's credit card, ask our kids and grandkids to pick up the tab because that's not right, it's not responsible and it's not conservative"". He says inflation will be under control when ""we're on a clearly downward trajectory and have a good line of sight that it's returning back to target"". Income tax cuts will happen in Sunak's longer term plan, he says, because he says he believes really strongly in rewarding hard work. Now Sunak is asked by Kay Burley why voters should trust him given that the UK appears to be heading for recession following his work as chancellor. He says it's precisely because of his work in the Treasury that people should back him. He says he acted ""boldly and radically"" as chancellor during the pandemic - with policies including the furlough scheme. He claims to have saved 10 million jobs and over a million businesses. ""People are grateful for it,"" he says. The final question from the audience is about how Sunak would balance solving the cost of living crisis with keeping government debt under control. Sunak says that, given the Bank of England's dire forecasts this afternoon, the Conservative Party needs to ""get real and fast because the lights on the economy are flashing red"". He says the root cause of this is inflation and that he's worried that Liz Truss' plans will make things worse. Sunak adds he wants to do something different and the government's number one priority should be grappling with inflation and helping people with the cost of living crisis. He also says he wants to grow the economy, but that all starts with ""not making the situation worse"". ""Because if we put fuel on the fire of this inflation spiral, all of us are going to end up with higher mortgages rates, savings and pensions eaten away and misery for millions,"" Sunak concludes. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Rishi Sunak seemed to get very animated when he was defending his decision to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet. There are some who think it was an act of betrayal. It's an area he is vulnerable and a question that keeps coming up. Perhaps that's why he seemed frustrated by the end of his answer. After being asked if he can be trusted, following accusations that he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back, Sunak says he is ""proud"" of the work he achieved alongside the prime minister. But he says that it became ""too difficult"" to stay in his job. They had ""well documented differences on economic policy"", he says. The government was also on the ""wrong side of an ethical problem"" he adds, referring to the scandal involving MP Chris Pincher. Alexander asks Rishi Sunak what does honesty mean to him in politics and leadership? ""Honesty in a sense means telling you the truth, even when that's not easy. I think you can see in this leadership election that's why I'm doing - I'm saying some things are not the easiest thing in the world to hear. ""I'm not standing here promising you tens and tens of billions of pounds of goodies straight away because it's not right for our economy. ""My life would be far easier if I wasn't saying that but I want to be honest with you and straight about the challenges we face and what going to be required to fix them."" Audience member Steve responds by pointing out that Sunak worked with Boris Johnson but now wants to take over his role. Sunak says that while he is proud of the work they did together, ""it got to a point where it was too difficult for me to stay. ""It came to a point where the government was on the wrong side of an ethical dilemma that I could not defend,"" Sunak says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Workers left the depot in Tilbury, Essex, on Wednesday and Thursday as they sought a rise of Â£2 an hour Staff at an Amazon warehouse have staged a walkout over a 35p an hour pay increase offer. Workers left the depot in Tilbury, Essex, on Wednesday and Thursday as they sought a rise of Â£2 an hour. The GMB union said the rise asked for would better match the demands of the role and help meet the cost of living crisis. Amazon said its pay was ""competitive"" and staff were also offered a benefits package worth thousands annually. Steve Garelick, GMB regional organiser, said:  ""Amazon is one of the most profitable companies on the planet. ""With household costs spiralling, the least they can do is offer decent pay. ""Amazon continues to reject working with trade unions to deliver better working conditions and fair pay. ""Their repeated use of short-term contracts is designed to undermine worker's rights. ""The image the company likes to project, and the reality for their workers could not be more different. ""They need to drastically improve pay and working conditions."" Marius Brezeanu said he estimated 1,000 staff had gone on strike Marius Brezeanu, 24, of Reading, took part in a sit-in protest at the warehouse, where he is a packer. ""I've got to work six days in order to pay my rent, bills and live a normal life; I don't think this should be normal,"" he told the BBC. ""For a couple of months, I have been eating just one meal a day [to save money]. ""I think there were around 1,000 people on the day and night shifts striking yesterday and overnight. ""We will continue [to protest], everyone is still motivated to do it."" Amazon said starting pay was increasing to a minimum of between Â£10.50 and Â£11.45 an hour, depending on location. ""This is for all full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary roles in the UK,"" it added. ""In addition to this competitive pay, employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package that includes private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection, subsidised meals and an employee discount among others, which combined are worth thousands annually, as well as a company pension plan.""

"Armoured police cars were brought in to try to safeguard the blast site Explosions at an ammunition storage facility have caused a large wildfire in a forest in western Berlin. The site in Grunewald forest is used by German police to store and detonate unexploded ordnance, often from World War Two, which continues to be dug up during construction. Firefighters' efforts have been hampered by sporadic explosions which could be seen and heard miles away. Questions are being asked about why the facility is in a forest prone to fires. Some 140 firefighters are at the scene, and have set up a safety perimeter of 1,000m (3,280ft) because of the ongoing blasts. ""We had explosion-like combustions and detonations. Debris was flying through the air, leading to a high danger to the life of the first responders, so they had to withdraw,"" Berlin fire brigade spokesman Thomas Kirstein told reporters at the scene. While the situation was ""extremely extraordinary"", he added, there was ""no danger for Berliners"". An army tank has been sent in to evacuate munitions at the storage facility, which is run by Berlin police's weapons disposal units. Remote-controlled de-mining robots and drones are also being used to help assess the situation, according to German media. On Thursday afternoon, the blaze was still not under control and had burned 15,000 square metres of the forest, authorities said. Munitions of all sizes are stored at the blast site, including fireworks. Videos shared online show how large some of the blasts were, and fireworks exploding in colour over the treetops.

The forest is suffering from drought and is ""bone dry"", Jan Thomsen from the Department for Environment told Deutsche Welle radio station. No firefighting helicopters were available to help, authorities said, because they were already busy in eastern Germany where there have been days of wildfires.

Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak  It also seems Sunak won the room after a majority of Sky Newsâs live studio audience
said they would be more likely to vote for him following an old-fashioned show

The contenders have different views on tax, the cost of living crisis and restoring trust in politics and politicians. So what exactly are the leadership hopefuls promising to deliver if they win the keys to No 10? Find out from our guide. Liz Truss supporter, Adele, says Sunak's missed appointment fines would affect the poorest and most vulnerable Conservative voters in Worcester have had a mixed reaction after tonight's programme. Adele, a Liz Truss supporter, says that Rishi Sunak suggests ""the economy is the most important thing - I'm not sure I agree with him. I think there are other things just as important, like the issue of healthcare."" She says Sunak's pledge to issue a fine for missed NHS appointments will affect the poorest and most vulnerable unfairly. Christy was undecided before the show, but she is now convinced Rishi Sunak would make the better PM. She says he came across ""very strong, principled and honest and that's what the public need. You can trust him with the economy, he's been a very good chancellor, he's looked after people during the pandemic. He would make a fine prime minister."" She says she doesn't think Liz Truss has the ""experience or the drive to be prime minster"". One undecided voter, Mark, thinks both candidates are excellent and would beat Labour leader Keir Starmer. ""Either of them will keep the conservative flag flying high.""

Kwarteng is quizzed on whether Truss appeared too ""strident"" in some of her answers, for example by refusing to apologise following a U-turn over a public sector pay proposal. He acknowledges that Truss is ""not as slick as other presenters"", but insists she is ""sincere, honest and hard-working"".

Kay Burley asks the level energy and food bills would need to go to before the UK assesses its support for Ukraine. Sunak says he doesn't think that is the right way to look at the situation. He argues the UK can make an ""enormous difference"" between now and next winter in ""reducing our dependence on Russian energy"". Sunak adds he will announce more support for people as the economic situation has deteriorated, but says there are lots of things that can be done to improve energy storage and energy efficiency. He says investment in improving insulation in peoples homes can be done quickly to both reduce usage and save them money. Asked if Ukraine support will continue ""if we lag our loft"", Sunak says people ought to be doing it anyway because of climate change. Rishi Sunak says the cause of the recession that was forecasted by the Bank of England today is inflation, not the tax burden. ""That's the root of the problems we have,"" he says. He says gripping inflation is his priority and he's not going to embark on a ""borrowing spree worth tens of billions of pounds, put that on the country's credit card, ask our kids and grandkids to pick up the tab because that's not right, it's not responsible and it's not conservative"". He says inflation will be under control when ""we're on a clearly downward trajectory and have a good line of sight that it's returning back to target"". Income tax cuts will happen in Sunak's longer term plan, he says, because he says he believes really strongly in rewarding hard work. Now Sunak is asked by Kay Burley why voters should trust him given that the UK appears to be heading for recession following his work as chancellor. He says it's precisely because of his work in the Treasury that people should back him. He says he acted ""boldly and radically"" as chancellor during the pandemic - with policies including the furlough scheme. He claims to have saved 10 million jobs and over a million businesses. ""People are grateful for it,"" he says. The final question from the audience is about how Sunak would balance solving the cost of living crisis with keeping government debt under control. Sunak says that, given the Bank of England's dire forecasts this afternoon, the Conservative Party needs to ""get real and fast because the lights on the economy are flashing red"". He says the root cause of this is inflation and that he's worried that Liz Truss' plans will make things worse. Sunak adds he wants to do something different and the government's number one priority should be grappling with inflation and helping people with the cost of living crisis. He also says he wants to grow the economy, but that all starts with ""not making the situation worse"". ""Because if we put fuel on the fire of this inflation spiral, all of us are going to end up with higher mortgages rates, savings and pensions eaten away and misery for millions,"" Sunak concludes. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Rishi Sunak seemed to get very animated when he was defending his decision to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet. There are some who think it was an act of betrayal. It's an area he is vulnerable and a question that keeps coming up. Perhaps that's why he seemed frustrated by the end of his answer. After being asked if he can be trusted, following accusations that he stabbed Boris Johnson in the back, Sunak says he is ""proud"" of the work he achieved alongside the prime minister. But he says that it became ""too difficult"" to stay in his job. They had ""well documented differences on economic policy"", he says. The government was also on the ""wrong side of an ethical problem"" he adds, referring to the scandal involving MP Chris Pincher. Alexander asks Rishi Sunak what does honesty mean to him in politics and leadership? ""Honesty in a sense means telling you the truth, even when that's not easy. I think you can see in this leadership election that's why I'm doing - I'm saying some things are not the easiest thing in the world to hear. ""I'm not standing here promising you tens and tens of billions of pounds of goodies straight away because it's not right for our economy. ""My life would be far easier if I wasn't saying that but I want to be honest with you and straight about the challenges we face and what going to be required to fix them."" Audience member Steve responds by pointing out that Sunak worked with Boris Johnson but now wants to take over his role. Sunak says that while he is proud of the work they did together, ""it got to a point where it was too difficult for me to stay. ""It came to a point where the government was on the wrong side of an ethical dilemma that I could not defend,"" Sunak says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth.

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

"Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards The Bank of England has increased interest rates by half a percentage point - the biggest amount for 27 years. Rising interest rates can affect people in different ways, often creating extra costs and worries. But while it can increase the cost of borrowing, hitting business plans or mortgage hopes, savers may give a small cheer. The BBC spoke to five people about how higher interest rates would change their circumstances. London-based Patrick Reid owes thousands on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. ""I have personal loans and credit cards totalling Â£25,000 so any increase will be hugely noticeable. ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a year to keep up with the debts. ""My income is good as I own my own business and hopefully that will continue - but if my customers drop off it will be financially painful. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget. ""I'm very worried about future rate rises. I honestly don't think the UK can take another hike. It will cripple the economic outlook and businesses will suffer."" Correction 5 August: This story has been updated to clarify that the Â£250 owed was per year not per month. Wayne Trim, 38, works as a customer services manager at Morrison's in Verwood, Dorset. He's worried about the impact of rising interest rates on his mortgage. ""My mortgage payments were Â£416 last year and now they're Â£515 and will keep going up. ""That could start hindering my commute to work. I moved to a new store a little while ago. It's an hour's drive. They did give me a pay rise to move stores, but I needed a new car, which took a fair chunk of my pay rise. ""I bought a hybrid. I'm spending about Â£200 a month filling it up. ""If you look at everything globally, everything is going up. Fuel, food. We can look at the food shop and be a bit more crafty with that. I do get a discount for working at Morrison's. ""You think you're in a position where you're financially comfortable and then all these things start. It's like a never-ending cycle of trying to make ends meet. ""I'm also repaying some loans, that's about Â£270 a month. That finishes in April, so I'm looking forward to that. ""I'm a simple person. I don't understand why they're doing the rate increases. They tell us it's to curb borrowing but all it means for me is I'm cancelling Netflix and Amazon."" Louise Parker and her husband have been saving to move home in Brighton since 2020, but are having to have a major rethink because of rising interest rates. ""I know that we are in a very privileged position to be in a home that we own in the first place with a decent mortgage rate fixed for two years. ""But we've had to substantially reconsider the amount of money we can borrow. It's meant we're looking at smaller houses which, considering we were wanting to move to start a family, is making us wonder whether we should bother moving at all. Interest rates widely expected to go up again ""Our options are either to stay put where we are or move to something about Â£200,000 cheaper than we had hoped. ""We're also worried about how long we should fix for if we move. We don't want to be stung after two years if rates have gone up even more, or have to downsize because we can no longer afford the repayments. ""It's just such an adjustment to have to think about interest rates. It's a new hurdle in the mix."" Edmund Wood is saving to buy a home close to London so hopes the interest rate rise will help his deposit grow more quickly. He also hopes rising rates will help the rum business that he owns. ""An increase in interest rates is good for me. I'm saving up a deposit, so more interest will mean my savings will go up quicker. ""And as I look further ahead to actually buying a house, I've been worried about rising property prices - they have climbed every month for the last 12 months in a row. ""That wouldn't be good if I was ready to buy now, but in two years when I've saved up during a period of increasing interest rates, hopefully house prices will fall again, which will leave me in a better position to buy. ""Also hopefully by then interest rates will have stabilised somewhat, meaning I'll be able to get a stable interest rate on a mortgage. ""I think rising interest rates will also be good for my rum business if they bring inflation down. That in turn should reduce the cost of living, leaving people having more money in their pocket at the end of the month."" Paola Dyboski runs a small manufacturing business in North Wales called Dr Zigs Extraordinary Bubbles and fears the rate rise will put her expansion plans in jeopardy. ""We're ambitious and currently expanding globally and finding growth in export markets. ""But, with expansion on the cards we would look to borrow to increase production and outputs and manage this growth. ""Increased interest rates will make this hugely more risky and challenging. It will bring into question the viability of our UK manufacturing base. ""I am also concerned that if our trade customers can't borrow, they will then cut on their spending and their purchases from us. We will all be affected.""

"This video can not be played In a 'blunt message"" the Bank of England governor warns interest rates may have to rise even higher The Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession as it raised interest rates by the most in 27 years. The economy is forecast to shrink in the last three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. Interest rates rose to 1.75% as the Bank battles to stem soaring prices, with inflation now set to hit over 13%. Governor Andrew Bailey said he knew the cost of living squeeze was difficult but if it didn't raise interest rates it would get ""even worse"". The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A typical household will be paying almost Â£300 a month for their energy by October, the Bank warned. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. The Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he had ""huge sympathy and huge understanding for those who are struggling most"" with the cost of living. ""I know that they will feel, 'Well, why have you raised interest rates today, doesn't that make it worse from that perspective in terms of consumption?', I'm afraid my answer to that is, it doesn't because I'm afraid the alternative is even worse in terms of persistent inflation."" Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs and should encourage people to borrow and spend less. It can also encourage people to save more. However, many households will be squeezed further following the interest rate rise including some mortgage-holders. How does an interest rate rise affect me? 'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a month more on loans' Did the Bank of England make the right call? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Now rates have gone up to 1.75%, homeowners on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£52 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£59 increase. It means tracker mortgage holders could be paying about Â£167 more a month compared to pre-December 2021, with variable mortgage holders paying up to Â£132 more. Interest rates have risen six times in a row since the end of last year. Higher interest rates also mean higher charges on things like credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Patrick Reid, a business owner in London, owesÂ£25,000 on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a month to keep up with the debts,"" he said. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget."" Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said ""staggeringly"" high inflation was ""going to hit low income families hard"". ""Many took on credit to pay their bills and are falling behind on their payments. This will be much harder to pay off with higher interest rates putting more families in financial peril."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support announced so far was ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" he said. He said a Labour government would reduce VAT on energy bills, abolish the tax relief currently offered to oil and gas companies who invest, and provide support to help people retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said he was confident the action the government was taking meant it could overcome the economic challenges. Both Mr Zahawi and Boris Johnson have also been criticised by Labour for being on holiday when the Bank detailed its gloomy outlook. Mr Zahawi insisted he was still working and had a call with Governor Andrew Bailey after the interest rate announcement. ""For me, like I'm sure lots of others, there is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, not in government,"" he said. He added: ""The privilege and responsibility of public service means that you never get to switch off, that's why I have had calls and briefings every day and continue to do so."" It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. Announcing the largest rate rise in more than a quarter of a century in an attempt to temper even higher peaks in inflation of an incredible 13% is what the Bank of England actually did. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. This is a proper full fat recession at the same time as the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high. It is a textbook example of the combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Read more from Faisal here Energy bills have already risen sharply this year, squeezing household incomes and leading to slower growth for the UK economy. Russia has reduced supplies to Europe as it wages war in Ukraine and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. As well as energy, households have been hit by higher petrol and diesel costs and food prices. The Bank warned UK economic growth was already slowing, adding: ""The latest rise in gas prices has led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for the UK and the rest of Europe"". The rate of inflation is expected to stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, the Bank said. It will eventually return to the Bank's 2% target the following year.

Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth. How will the UK economy compare to others in 2024?

"It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. It announced the largest interest rate rise in a quarter of a century, in an attempt to temper a peak in inflation of 13%. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank How does an interest rate rise affect me? The Bank thinks that energy bills hitting nearly Â£300 per month on average, treble their level of a year before, will plunge the economy in the final quarter of this year into a recession. If global energy costs remain where they are, that recession will then last the whole of next year, with inflation barely below 10% even in a year's time. This is a proper full fat recession now being predicted by the Bank, and at the same time a 42-year high in the rate of inflation. It is a textbook example of the combination of stagnation of the economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession, at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Mortgage costs are now soaring. Markets expect further rises in the base rate - taking it up to 3% - even during this predicted recession. That affects those on variable rates, and about half of those set to come off their fixed rate mortgages in the coming couple of years. The Bank's answer will be that rates are still low by historic standards, and they just cannot provide further fuel for these extraordinary but hopefully temporary high inflation rates, to last for years. But make no mistake, a forecast such as this, would mean a wrecking ball to the forecasts for government borrowing. Tax revenues would plummet, and spending would increase naturally. Forget about the Â£30bn room for manoeuvre or ""fiscal headroom"" we heard so much about. But with this level of energy shock, whoever is in power, would need to prepare further massive consumer support, and feasibly, rescue schemes for the energy sector too. I cannot recall the Bank of England predicting a recession of this length in advance of the event. And that certainly has not happened in the middle of the selection of a new prime minister. It is the sort of forecast that in other circumstances might have prompted an immediate emergency Budget. It may just upend all the plans we have heard so much about.

"Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards The Bank of England has increased interest rates by half a percentage point - the biggest amount for 27 years. Rising interest rates can affect people in different ways, often creating extra costs and worries. But while it can increase the cost of borrowing, hitting business plans or mortgage hopes, savers may give a small cheer. The BBC spoke to five people about how higher interest rates would change their circumstances. London-based Patrick Reid owes thousands on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. ""I have personal loans and credit cards totalling Â£25,000 so any increase will be hugely noticeable. ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a year to keep up with the debts. ""My income is good as I own my own business and hopefully that will continue - but if my customers drop off it will be financially painful. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget. ""I'm very worried about future rate rises. I honestly don't think the UK can take another hike. It will cripple the economic outlook and businesses will suffer."" Correction 5 August: This story has been updated to clarify that the Â£250 owed was per year not per month. Wayne Trim, 38, works as a customer services manager at Morrison's in Verwood, Dorset. He's worried about the impact of rising interest rates on his mortgage. ""My mortgage payments were Â£416 last year and now they're Â£515 and will keep going up. ""That could start hindering my commute to work. I moved to a new store a little while ago. It's an hour's drive. They did give me a pay rise to move stores, but I needed a new car, which took a fair chunk of my pay rise. ""I bought a hybrid. I'm spending about Â£200 a month filling it up. ""If you look at everything globally, everything is going up. Fuel, food. We can look at the food shop and be a bit more crafty with that. I do get a discount for working at Morrison's. ""You think you're in a position where you're financially comfortable and then all these things start. It's like a never-ending cycle of trying to make ends meet. ""I'm also repaying some loans, that's about Â£270 a month. That finishes in April, so I'm looking forward to that. ""I'm a simple person. I don't understand why they're doing the rate increases. They tell us it's to curb borrowing but all it means for me is I'm cancelling Netflix and Amazon."" Louise Parker and her husband have been saving to move home in Brighton since 2020, but are having to have a major rethink because of rising interest rates. ""I know that we are in a very privileged position to be in a home that we own in the first place with a decent mortgage rate fixed for two years. ""But we've had to substantially reconsider the amount of money we can borrow. It's meant we're looking at smaller houses which, considering we were wanting to move to start a family, is making us wonder whether we should bother moving at all. Interest rates widely expected to go up again ""Our options are either to stay put where we are or move to something about Â£200,000 cheaper than we had hoped. ""We're also worried about how long we should fix for if we move. We don't want to be stung after two years if rates have gone up even more, or have to downsize because we can no longer afford the repayments. ""It's just such an adjustment to have to think about interest rates. It's a new hurdle in the mix."" Edmund Wood is saving to buy a home close to London so hopes the interest rate rise will help his deposit grow more quickly. He also hopes rising rates will help the rum business that he owns. ""An increase in interest rates is good for me. I'm saving up a deposit, so more interest will mean my savings will go up quicker. ""And as I look further ahead to actually buying a house, I've been worried about rising property prices - they have climbed every month for the last 12 months in a row. ""That wouldn't be good if I was ready to buy now, but in two years when I've saved up during a period of increasing interest rates, hopefully house prices will fall again, which will leave me in a better position to buy. ""Also hopefully by then interest rates will have stabilised somewhat, meaning I'll be able to get a stable interest rate on a mortgage. ""I think rising interest rates will also be good for my rum business if they bring inflation down. That in turn should reduce the cost of living, leaving people having more money in their pocket at the end of the month."" Paola Dyboski runs a small manufacturing business in North Wales called Dr Zigs Extraordinary Bubbles and fears the rate rise will put her expansion plans in jeopardy. ""We're ambitious and currently expanding globally and finding growth in export markets. ""But, with expansion on the cards we would look to borrow to increase production and outputs and manage this growth. ""Increased interest rates will make this hugely more risky and challenging. It will bring into question the viability of our UK manufacturing base. ""I am also concerned that if our trade customers can't borrow, they will then cut on their spending and their purchases from us. We will all be affected.""

"Ministers urgently need to provide more money for adult social care in England which has been ""ravaged"" by the Covid pandemic, a committee of MPs has said. The government has increased National Insurance contributions to tackle NHS backlogs and fund social care. However, the committee highlighted concerns the cash for social care ""wouldn't touch the sides"". Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss has made scrapping the National Insurance tax rise a key part of her campaign. The foreign secretary has argued that there is already ""money available"" in the budget to cover extra funding. Will National Insurance changes save me money? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? 'It's the worst it's been in my 36 years in care' On dealing with care backlogs, she has promised to appoint a ""strong"" health secretary to tackle the problems. Her rival, the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, has defended his decision to introduce the Â£12bn a year tax increase. Since April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound for National Insurance. Under current plans, National Insurance will return to its old rate from April 2023 at which point the extra money will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. Speaking in a TV debate last week, Mr Sunak said he had received ""flak"" for implementing the rise, but insisted it was ""right thing to do"" to protect public health. However,a new report from the House of Commons levelling up committee,externalhas warned that, even with the levy, there will still be a ""large funding gap in adult social care sector which needs filling"". The cross-party group of MPs said the industry has been put under pressure, not only by coronavirus, but also rising demand, difficulties with staff recruitment, growing inflation and increases in the National Minimum Wage. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are competing to be the next prime minister - whoever wins will face questions about funding social care It also expressed concern that the majority of funding raised from the levy will go to the NHS and that the money earmarked for social care will be for introducing reforms rather than helping ease cost pressures. During its inquiry, the committee had been told the new money ""won't touch the sides"". Committee chair Clive Betts told BBC News an extra Â£7bn a year was needed to address funding shortfalls. ""The issue is going to grow more profound and if we don't address it then the pressures on the NHS and the pressures on families who are trying to support their loved ones without the proper resources are just going to grow and grow,"" he said. ""As a civilised society we have to address it we have to make sure that finance is available."" A government spokesman said ministers had taken ""decisive action"" investing an extra Â£5.4bn in adult social care over the next three years and giving local authorities an additional Â£3.7bn which could be spent on social care. ""We are also delivering on our ambitious 10-year vision for adult social care, which provides detail on the measures to implement over the next three years to reform the sector and deliver for people.""

"Workers left the depot in Tilbury, Essex, on Wednesday and Thursday as they sought a rise of Â£2 an hour Staff at an Amazon warehouse have staged a walkout over a 35p an hour pay increase offer. Workers left the depot in Tilbury, Essex, on Wednesday and Thursday as they sought a rise of Â£2 an hour. The GMB union said the rise asked for would better match the demands of the role and help meet the cost of living crisis. Amazon said its pay was ""competitive"" and staff were also offered a benefits package worth thousands annually. Steve Garelick, GMB regional organiser, said:  ""Amazon is one of the most profitable companies on the planet. ""With household costs spiralling, the least they can do is offer decent pay. ""Amazon continues to reject working with trade unions to deliver better working conditions and fair pay. ""Their repeated use of short-term contracts is designed to undermine worker's rights. ""The image the company likes to project, and the reality for their workers could not be more different. ""They need to drastically improve pay and working conditions."" Marius Brezeanu said he estimated 1,000 staff had gone on strike Marius Brezeanu, 24, of Reading, took part in a sit-in protest at the warehouse, where he is a packer. ""I've got to work six days in order to pay my rent, bills and live a normal life; I don't think this should be normal,"" he told the BBC. ""For a couple of months, I have been eating just one meal a day [to save money]. ""I think there were around 1,000 people on the day and night shifts striking yesterday and overnight. ""We will continue [to protest], everyone is still motivated to do it."" Amazon said starting pay was increasing to a minimum of between Â£10.50 and Â£11.45 an hour, depending on location. ""This is for all full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary roles in the UK,"" it added. ""In addition to this competitive pay, employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package that includes private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection, subsidised meals and an employee discount among others, which combined are worth thousands annually, as well as a company pension plan.""

Nicky Desmond, from Cardiff, went swimming in the sea off Callao Salvaje, Tenerife, within hours of arriving on 29 July, the eve of his 30th birthday. Family friend Sacha Pugsley, 29, said Mr Desmond was ""very bubbly, very outgoing"" and ""always had a helping hand for everybody"". His friends and family are hoping to raise Â£10,000 to cover the cost of repatriating his body. Mr Desmond was on his first day of his holiday in south-west Tenerife to celebrate his birthday.

"This video can not be played In a 'blunt message"" the Bank of England governor warns interest rates may have to rise even higher The Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession as it raised interest rates by the most in 27 years. The economy is forecast to shrink in the last three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. Interest rates rose to 1.75% as the Bank battles to stem soaring prices, with inflation now set to hit over 13%. Governor Andrew Bailey said he knew the cost of living squeeze was difficult but if it didn't raise interest rates it would get ""even worse"". The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A typical household will be paying almost Â£300 a month for their energy by October, the Bank warned. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. The Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he had ""huge sympathy and huge understanding for those who are struggling most"" with the cost of living. ""I know that they will feel, 'Well, why have you raised interest rates today, doesn't that make it worse from that perspective in terms of consumption?', I'm afraid my answer to that is, it doesn't because I'm afraid the alternative is even worse in terms of persistent inflation."" Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs and should encourage people to borrow and spend less. It can also encourage people to save more. However, many households will be squeezed further following the interest rate rise including some mortgage-holders. How does an interest rate rise affect me? 'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a month more on loans' Did the Bank of England make the right call? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Now rates have gone up to 1.75%, homeowners on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£52 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£59 increase. It means tracker mortgage holders could be paying about Â£167 more a month compared to pre-December 2021, with variable mortgage holders paying up to Â£132 more. Interest rates have risen six times in a row since the end of last year. Higher interest rates also mean higher charges on things like credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Patrick Reid, a business owner in London, owesÂ£25,000 on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a month to keep up with the debts,"" he said. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget."" Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said ""staggeringly"" high inflation was ""going to hit low income families hard"". ""Many took on credit to pay their bills and are falling behind on their payments. This will be much harder to pay off with higher interest rates putting more families in financial peril."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support announced so far was ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" he said. He said a Labour government would reduce VAT on energy bills, abolish the tax relief currently offered to oil and gas companies who invest, and provide support to help people retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said he was confident the action the government was taking meant it could overcome the economic challenges. Both Mr Zahawi and Boris Johnson have also been criticised by Labour for being on holiday when the Bank detailed its gloomy outlook. Mr Zahawi insisted he was still working and had a call with Governor Andrew Bailey after the interest rate announcement. ""For me, like I'm sure lots of others, there is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, not in government,"" he said. He added: ""The privilege and responsibility of public service means that you never get to switch off, that's why I have had calls and briefings every day and continue to do so."" It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. Announcing the largest rate rise in more than a quarter of a century in an attempt to temper even higher peaks in inflation of an incredible 13% is what the Bank of England actually did. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. This is a proper full fat recession at the same time as the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high. It is a textbook example of the combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Read more from Faisal here Energy bills have already risen sharply this year, squeezing household incomes and leading to slower growth for the UK economy. Russia has reduced supplies to Europe as it wages war in Ukraine and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. As well as energy, households have been hit by higher petrol and diesel costs and food prices. The Bank warned UK economic growth was already slowing, adding: ""The latest rise in gas prices has led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for the UK and the rest of Europe"". The rate of inflation is expected to stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, the Bank said. It will eventually return to the Bank's 2% target the following year.

"It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. It announced the largest interest rate rise in a quarter of a century, in an attempt to temper a peak in inflation of 13%. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank How does an interest rate rise affect me? The Bank thinks that energy bills hitting nearly Â£300 per month on average, treble their level of a year before, will plunge the economy in the final quarter of this year into a recession. If global energy costs remain where they are, that recession will then last the whole of next year, with inflation barely below 10% even in a year's time. This is a proper full fat recession now being predicted by the Bank, and at the same time a 42-year high in the rate of inflation. It is a textbook example of the combination of stagnation of the economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession, at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Mortgage costs are now soaring. Markets expect further rises in the base rate - taking it up to 3% - even during this predicted recession. That affects those on variable rates, and about half of those set to come off their fixed rate mortgages in the coming couple of years. The Bank's answer will be that rates are still low by historic standards, and they just cannot provide further fuel for these extraordinary but hopefully temporary high inflation rates, to last for years. But make no mistake, a forecast such as this, would mean a wrecking ball to the forecasts for government borrowing. Tax revenues would plummet, and spending would increase naturally. Forget about the Â£30bn room for manoeuvre or ""fiscal headroom"" we heard so much about. But with this level of energy shock, whoever is in power, would need to prepare further massive consumer support, and feasibly, rescue schemes for the energy sector too. I cannot recall the Bank of England predicting a recession of this length in advance of the event. And that certainly has not happened in the middle of the selection of a new prime minister. It is the sort of forecast that in other circumstances might have prompted an immediate emergency Budget. It may just upend all the plans we have heard so much about.

"This video can not be played Hosepipe ban: 'How will I water my tomatoes?' A hosepipe ban, expected to last weeks, will be introduced in parts of Wales amid the driest year since 1976. The ban, covering Pembrokeshire and a small part of Carmarthenshire, starts on 19 August as Welsh Water is under pressure to maintain supplies after low rainfall. It means people will not be allowed to water their plants, wash their cars or clean windows using a hose. The water company said the planned ban would be its first since 1989. It follows similar bans announced for parts of southern England. Anyone who would like to apply for an exemption to the ban should apply to Welsh Water during the consultation period between 10 and 17 August. How can you save water during a hosepipe ban? Welsh rivers run low as lack of rain impacts country Welsh Water boss Peter Perry toldBBC Radio Wales Drivehe was ""not pleased"" to have to implement the ban. ""We're doing our bit. We've got 600 people finding and fixing leaks at the moment,"" he said. He said the hosepipe ban was likely to be in place ""for weeks"", adding that the organisation had the power to levy financial penalties on people who persistently flout the rules. The ban covers much of Pembrokeshire and a small part of Carmarthenshire One man told the BBC he was ""horrified"" at the thought that he might not be able to water his tomatoes. ""I'm not on a meter. I know it's a bit selfish but I pay Â£800 for water and there's only two of us in the house,"" said Jonathan Frost, from Cardiff. ""I'm pretty horrified because how am I going to water my tomatoes?"" Ellie Gent said she believes a hosepipe ban is reasonable given the circumstance ""If we need drinking water we have to accept a hosepipe ban is a necessity giving what is happening with climate change and we've had no rain,"" said Ellie Gent. Rita Evans, from Narberth, Pembrokeshire, said she had a water butt and believed it was important to conserve as much water as possible. ""We have a lot of visitors here in Pembrokeshire at the moment and we've not had enough rain so I do understand why."" Rita Evans said she could understand why the ban was in place Welsh Water's managing director of water services, Ian Christie, said: ""We have not seen such prolonged dry conditions in Pembrokeshire since 1976. ""Introducing the hosepipe ban is not a decision we have taken lightly, however if we are to make sure there is enough water to see us through the rest of the summer and into the autumn then we need to act now to try and prevent any further restrictions later on."" Reservoirs in Pembrokeshire, such as Llys Y Fran, are close to drought levels ""The ban will apply to just over 2% of the three million population we serve in Wales. More broadly we do not intend to introduce restrictions more widely across our operating area."" The company said it was taking the measures as there was an increased demand for water and its reservoirs in Pembrokeshire were approaching drought levels. It added that this will not risk immediate supplies but it was bringing in the restrictions to ensure there would be enough supplies for customers and wildlife over the coming months. Rocks are not usually so visible on the River Usk at Llangynidr this time of year Restrictions during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or outside tap. During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: Water a garden or plants Fill a paddling or swimming pool Clean a car Fill a pond Clean walls or windows Welsh Water will hold a consultation over the planned hosepipe ban However, there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used: To water a new lawn within 28 days of it being laid For business use To fill pools needed for medical treatment To fill a fountain used for religious practices To top up a fishpond Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Welsh Water added that Pembrokeshire has only seen just over 60% of the expected rainfall between March and July. Data from the Met Office shows Wales experienced its lowest July rainfall since 2006. BBC weather presenter Sue Charles said there was no significant rain in the forecast. ""In some parts of Wales - especially further east in places such as Cardiff and Wrexham - temperatures could reach the mid to high 20s,"" she said. Welsh Water had earlier warned that people in some areas of Wales could face a hosepipe ban this summer. ""There is a slight concern about the situation in Pembrokeshire,"" it said. ""Between March and April, rainfall across Wales was only 50% of the long term average while between March and May it was just 60%."" Pressure group Welsh Rivers Union has been calling for an immediate hosepipe ban in parts of Wales following a period of hot weather with little rainfall. Arid conditions in Pembrokeshire caused a grass fire above Newgale, in very hot conditions during the heatwave last month ""We don't want to get to crisis point before we act,"" Kim Waters, co-founder of the Welsh Rivers Union, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""We have to be sensible as a society now. Water in Wales is just not a throwaway resource and we just need to manage it in a better way."" He said the group wanted Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water to be open with the data they have. ""I just want them to be open, honest, tell us what the state is and act accordingly,"" he added. The Welsh government said: ""The current prolonged dry weather period reflects the challenges we all face in tackling climate change.Â ""We continue to encourage everyone to be considerate in their water usage to maintain water flow over the coming months.""

"Alun Morgan's health can be checked daily via the app without leaving his home Mobile apps to track patients' health are keeping them out of hospital and could cut waiting times, experts have said. It follows a trial of a new app which heart patients are using through their mobile phones. The trial allows clinicians to change treatments quickly and uses video consultations, avoiding unnecessary hospital visits. One 80-year-old patient using the app said it was ""brilliant"". In March, Alun Morgan was told he had heart failure and doctors said stress could be a factor. He was placed on the trial to log his weight, blood pressure and the oxygen levels from the comfort of his home. ""I now appreciate four months on just how many trips to hospital it's saved me,"" the grandfather of seven said. ""As far as I'm concerned I'm on a daily check up without having to move from the house, which is brilliant. ""If I've got a problem they'll ring me up and say 'look, I'm not happy with that blood pressure reading, can you do it again in an hour'. The former banker said he finds the technology easy to use, but knows he can call on relatives should he need help. Rhodri Griffiths said money would be needed to keep up with technology Rhodri Griffiths is the innovation adoption director at Life Sciences Hub Wales, and is looking for more ways to introduce similar technology. He believes the pandemic accelerated the use and acceptance of digital solutions in healthcare, by patients and clinicians. ""We really are looking at a big digital revolution within healthcare and there are an amazing myriad of things coming through,"" he said. He explained data collected by smartphones and watches can help predict who is likely to have a heart attack. ""We can avoid that happening. So prevention is key but it's also looking at how some of this can impact on waiting lists,"" he said. ""So, looking at how theatres are used, which patients can be prioritised? Heart app aims to cut NHS waiting lists Covid innovations 'will reshape future NHS' ""In social care it's looking at how pain is managed by face recognition. Mr Griffiths said he believed the data collected could also identify wider problems. ""It's combining these digital solutions with our genetic information - bringing big data together on a population level we can start spotting trends. ""We can start understanding who may be at risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke in the future. ""Services can be designed around it - there's huge prospects out there."" However, he warned this would need a lot of investment. Mandie Welch says she has received positive feedback from patients The heart trial app was produced by developers Huma and has been trialled in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Betsi Cadwaladr health board areas. The first evaluation showed a 19% decrease in face-to-face outpatient appointments in Cwm Taf Morgannwg. In north Wales, 90% of the trial patients who received additional or ""escalated"" care, did so due to data collected by their devices. Proactive care is believed to reduce the number of patients going to accident and emergency departments. Latest figures show almost 10,300 people in Wales waited 12 hours or more in A&E in June, technology that cuts those numbers will be welcomed. Mandie Welch, lead heart failure advanced nurse practitioner at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said the technology had already ""facilitated the early discharge of patients from cardiac care units"". She added it ""allowed us to quickly see the difference medications are making to heart rates and blood pressure"". She said: ""Crucially, patients told us that they feel better supported, and having the ability to track their own progress is helping to reassure them and better manage their conditions. ""We've already gone to a patient's home within a day to give them high dose water tablets to get rid of their fluid so they don't come to A&E, and the only reason we know that is because their weight has shot up on the app, and their heart rate has shot up, their symptoms are worse. ""Heart failure is known as the revolving door to A&E, so this app has identified those patients who are getting worse. ""Our main aim is to keep them living longer, to make them feel better and to reduce their readmission rate."" The pilot is one of several remote monitoring technologies funded by Welsh government's Covid-19 digital solutions fund, supported by the Life Sciences Hub Wales.

TheNew York Post reported,externalthat the decision had followed a poor reaction to test screenings, but Variety suggested that the cost of putting the film into cinemas and marketing it may have contributed to the decision. As the film was unfinished, Warner Media would have had to spend more money completing, releasing and advertising it. Halting the process now means it can cut its existing losses without creating more. According to US trade publications, the company may also be able to recoup some of the money it had already spent by using what's called a tax write-down, which would save money by reducing the company's tax liability as a result of not releasing the film and recording it as a straight loss. ""When Warner Bros files its taxes this year, the company will combine the income from its profitable movies with its losses to determine its taxable income.

"It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. It announced the largest interest rate rise in a quarter of a century, in an attempt to temper a peak in inflation of 13%. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank How does an interest rate rise affect me? The Bank thinks that energy bills hitting nearly Â£300 per month on average, treble their level of a year before, will plunge the economy in the final quarter of this year into a recession. If global energy costs remain where they are, that recession will then last the whole of next year, with inflation barely below 10% even in a year's time. This is a proper full fat recession now being predicted by the Bank, and at the same time a 42-year high in the rate of inflation. It is a textbook example of the combination of stagnation of the economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession, at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Mortgage costs are now soaring. Markets expect further rises in the base rate - taking it up to 3% - even during this predicted recession. That affects those on variable rates, and about half of those set to come off their fixed rate mortgages in the coming couple of years. The Bank's answer will be that rates are still low by historic standards, and they just cannot provide further fuel for these extraordinary but hopefully temporary high inflation rates, to last for years. But make no mistake, a forecast such as this, would mean a wrecking ball to the forecasts for government borrowing. Tax revenues would plummet, and spending would increase naturally. Forget about the Â£30bn room for manoeuvre or ""fiscal headroom"" we heard so much about. But with this level of energy shock, whoever is in power, would need to prepare further massive consumer support, and feasibly, rescue schemes for the energy sector too. I cannot recall the Bank of England predicting a recession of this length in advance of the event. And that certainly has not happened in the middle of the selection of a new prime minister.

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates again from 1.25% to 1.75% as it battles to curb rising prices The increase is the biggest in 27 years and will increase pressure on households already struggling with the cost of living Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, blamed Russia for the high energy prices which are pushing up inflation It makes mortgages and loans more expensive but increases the return on savings Inflation, the rate at which prices grow, is expected to rise even further this year, peaking at 13% in October The UK is expected to fall into recession - which means the economy is shrinking - in the final three months of this year Edited by Chris Giles Your live page writers were Emily McGarvey, Jack Burgess, Catherine Evans, Oliver Slow, Victoria Lindrea, Aoife Walsh and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Andrew Humphrey, Shanaz Musafer and Chris Giles. We'll be closing today's live page on the Bank of England interest rate hike shortly. But before we go here are the key headlines of the day:  This video can not be played Andrew Bailey on Bank of England interest rate rise warning More now from the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, who tells the BBC that the UK has been hit by a severe shock thanks to soaring energy prices - which he blames on Russia. He says the increase in gas prices since May has had ""a very big impact.. that is passing through directly into inflation. ""It will have an effect on the economy, and, yes, we are forecasting a recession,"" he adds. ""The really blunt message I have to give, is if that does become more embedded and the problem gets worse, we will have high inflation for longer and the Bank of England will have to raise rates even higher,"" the governor concludes. Labour has urged the government to scrap tax breaks on oil and gas companies in order to provide more help to the public with rising bills. Shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden says the Bank of England's forecasts show ""how hard this crisis is hitting families"". He adds that it also demonstrates ""how much is left to come"" as the situation worsens and ""how vulnerable 12 years of economic mismanagement by the Conservatives has left us"". The government must act fast if we are going to avoid one of the worst recessions since the 1990s, by scrapping tax breaks on oil and gas producers and providing more help to people who are struggling to pay their energy bills.""  A rise in interest rates isn't bad news for everyone. Edmund Wood is saving to buy a home close to London, so hopes a rate rise will help his deposit grow more quickly. ""An increase in interest rates is good for me,"" he says. ""I've been worried about rising property prices - they have climbed every month for the last 12 months in a row. ""That wouldn't be good if I was ready to buy now, but in two years when I've saved up during a period of increasing interest rates, hopefully house prices will fall again, which will leave me in a better position to buy. ""Also hopefully by then interest rates will have stabilised somewhat, meaning I'll be able to get a stable interest rate on a mortgage."" The Bank of England ""left it far too late"" to raise interests rates in order to curb inflation, an expert who specialises in monetary policy has told BBC News. Patrick Reid, from the University of Cambridge, draws a comparison between the bank's current interest rate of 1.75% to the US Federal Reserve's decision last month to raise rates by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. He says if the BoE had decided to raise interest rates more and earlier then ""maybe we wouldn't have got into this stagflationary environment"". Stagflation is the term used to describe the damaging combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation. Andrew Bailey can blame energy and Russia, but he really needs to look inward at when he should have acted, which in my opinion should have been a lot sooner.  Economists have warned that the Bank of England could be forced to increase rates a
further half point as early as next month, bringing the tariff to 2.25%. 
James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said: âThe fact that the Bank
reiterated its willingness to act âforcefullyâ to curb inflation, we think
thereâs a strong possibility of another 50 basis point hike in September,
particularly if thatâs what both the Fed [in the US] and European Central
Bank end up doing too.â He added that the fact the Bank is increasing the pace of rate hikes, while also
forecasting a recession, demonstrates how worried it is that worker shortages
and supply issues could keep inflation high, even as the economy weakens. ""The Bank will want to see signs
that skill shortages are easing and that wage pressures are showing signs of
abating"" before stemming rate hikes, he suggested. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said ""all options"" are on the table for next month, although he stressed that policy is ""not on a pre-set path"". An economist has warned the decision to increase rates will not help with the cost of living crisis and could even ""exacerbate the risk of recession"". Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, tells BBC News that ""people who have already been squeezed will be hit"" by the Bank of England's decision. She also notes that millions of people are already ""having to borrow to get by"" as inflation drives prices higher. The Governor of the Bank of England has been speaking to the BBC, explaining the decision to raise interest rates. Andrew Bailey said that interest rates needed to rise in order to
control rising inflation, and despite his own predictions of a lengthy recession
starting later this year. Mr Bailey said that Russiaâs invasion was the cause
for the big increases in energy prices and that the Bank now predicted domestic
energy bills on average to rise up to Â£3,500 this October. He said that the Bankâs concern âis to ensure that this very big shock thatâs going
to hit inflation, thatâs going to hit people this winter doesnât then get
embedded in the system.â The Bank also revised its inflation forecast â it now says
inflation will hit 13%, its highest level for 42 years. Mr Bailey said âIâm
afraid if that does become embedded, the problem gets worse. ""We will have high
inflation for longer and the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates
even higher than we otherwise would do.â  The Bank of England has warned inflation could rise above 13% later this year. This is why the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has overwhelmingly voted to raise interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years. Although it's a big jump, interest rates are still currently at historically low levels. The Bank of England is predicting that the UK will fall into recession at the end of this year. But why does this matter? For most people, economic growth is good. It usually means there are more jobs, and companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also gives the government more money in taxes. So it can cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. How could a recession affect you? Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to get promotions, or a pay rise. Graduates and school leavers could find a first job harder to get. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many UK homeowners who kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. Mortgage interest payments for many fell considerably, leaving them with more spending money. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. Read more here. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Santander is one of the first big banks to publish its revised interest rates and, as usual, savers won't benefit from the full 0.5% increase. The bank will raise rates across some of its saver accounts and in-credit current accounts by 0.25%. For example its Junior ISA rate will increase from 1% to 1.25% from 2 September. Its current accounts that pay interest on credit balances will increase from 0.75% to 1% on 11 August. There's one exception where the full 0.5% rate will be applied: the Help to Buy ISA will increase from 0.75% to 1.25% from 2 September. Tracker and variable mortgage rates will climb 0.5% from 1 September. I'd expect other high street banks to introduce similar changes at similar times. The chief economist of a poverty charity has called today's recession forecast ""frightening"". Rebecca McDonald, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, told the BBC the news was worrying for many people, adding the situation was ""incredibly dire"". ""We know that by May this year over seven million low-income households had already had to go without an essential, so that means skipping a meal, skipping a shower, not being able to heat their home or heat their meal."" McDonald added a million people also had to go into extra debt to afford an essential meal. Today's news is a ""call to action"" for whoever is the next prime minister - and for the existing chancellor, she says. The Bank of England expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, after it raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%. This would make it the longest downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank blamed the slump largely on rising gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warning a typical energy bill will hit Â£3,500 in October. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey avoided getting drawn into commenting on Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss's plans for immediate tax cuts. Speaking at his earlier news conference he said it's ""not for the Bank of England to get involved"" in the Conservative Party leadership election. Mr Bailey said he looks forward ""to working with whoever the next prime minister is"" but also saids at this stage he would not comment ""on what might or might not happen"". Responding to the Bank of England's interest rate decision, Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has said she would enact an emergency Budget should she become the next prime minister. She says this would ""kickstart"" her plan to get the economy growing and ""offer immediate help to people struggling with their bills"". The foreign secretary says her plan is partly based on enacting ""supply side reforms"" - an economic theory that argues growing the supply of goods to a country leads to economic growth and often takes the form of lowering taxes, lowering borrowing rates (which the Bank of England has just raised), as well as deregulating industries. She denies her proposed tax cuts would be ""inflationary"", an attack levelled at her by her rival and former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. You cannot tax your way to growth. Business as usual will not do. Instead, we need a new approach on the economy, we need to challenge the failing economic orthodoxy and we need to deliver the necessary reform to tackle inflation and achieve sustainable growth.""  Rishi Sunak has said ""getting inflation under control as quickly as possible"" is one of the ""most urgent challenges"" the UK faces. Following the move by the Bank of England, the former chancellor and Tory leadership hopeful says it is ""imperative that any future government grips inflation, not exacerbates it"". He adds he would ""prioritise gripping inflation, growing the economy and then cutting taxes"" if he becomes the next prime minister Increasing borrowing will put upward pressure on interest rates, which will mean increased payments on people's mortgages. It will also make high inflation and high prices last for longer, making everyone poorer.""  If you're just joining us or want to catch up on what's been going on, here's what you need to know about the interest rates rise: Louise Parker and her husband have been saving to move home in Brighton since 2020, but they're having a major rethink. ""We've had to substantially reconsider the amount of money we can borrow, says Louise. They'd been hoping to move to a bigger house so they could start a family. But now they can only afford smaller houses, Louise says it's ""making us wonder whether we should bother moving at all"". ""Our options are either to stay put where we are or move to something about Â£200,000 cheaper than we had hoped."" And now they have the added question of how long to fix their rate if they move. ""We don't want to be stung after two years if rates have gone up even more, or have to downsize because we can no longer afford the repayments. ""It's just such an adjustment to have to think about interest rates. It's a new hurdle in the mix."" Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has responded to the Bank of England's announcement by saying he is ""confident"" the  UK can overcome the ""global challenges"" of rising inflation and recession predictions. Acknowledging that the forecasts will be ""concerning for many people"", Mr Zahawi says addressing the cost of living is a ""top priority"" for the government. He says the government has announced Â£37bn in support to help people with rising bills and prices, including ""direct payments of Â£1,200 to the most vulnerable families and a Â£400 discount on energy bills for everyone"". We are also taking important steps to get inflation under control through strong, independent monetary policy, responsible tax and spending decisions, and reforms to boost our productivity and growth.  The economy recovered strongly from the pandemic, with the fastest growth in the G7 last year, and Iâm confident that the action we are taking means we can also overcome these global challenges.

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

"Mortgage borrowing rules have been eased after the Bank of England scrapped an affordability test. The ""stress test"" forced lenders to calculate whether potential borrowers would be able to cope if interest rates climbed by up to 3%. Removing the test may help some potential borrowers get loans, such as the self-employed or freelance workers. But other rules such as strict loan-to-income limits will not make it easier for most people to get a mortgage. The withdrawal of the affordability test was announced in June but has come into effect on Monday. ""Scrapping the affordability test is not as reckless as it may sound,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. ""The loan-to-income framework remains so there will still be some restrictions in place; it is not turning into a free-for-all on the lending front. ""Lenders will also still use some form of testing but to their own choosing according to their risk appetite."" In other words there will not be an immediate impact for borrowers as lenders will not need to change the way they assess loans. However, some may well change their own rules in the future. Mark Yallop, chairman of the Financial Markets Standards Board, said although the change would make it ""slightly easier"" for some borrowers to get a mortgage, he did not think with would have a significant impact. ""The biggest constraint on new mortgages is the ability of borrowers to afford a deposit,"" he added. The mortgage affordability test was introduced in 2014 as part of a widescale tightening up of the mortgage market to ensure there were no repeats of the mis-selling scandal that partially contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The rule was put in place to ensure that borrowers did not become a threat to the financial stability of lenders by taking on debt they subsequently might not be able to repay. House prices defy expectations to hit record How is the risingcost of livingaffecting you? Get in touch. Lenders had to not only work out if borrowers could afford a mortgage at the rate they were being offered, but also work out how they would be affected if interest rates soared by 3%. Borrowers who could not prove they could cope with such an eventuality might have been turned down for a loan on that basis, even if they could easily afford a mortgage at the existing rate. For that reason the test was seen by some as a barrier for some borrowers. ""The rule change could have a positive effect on borrowers who have been disadvantaged when it comes to getting on the property ladder,"" said Mr Harris. For example, some potential first-time buyers who have been comfortably affording rents far higher than potential mortgage payments have failed affordability assessments. There are some key protections in place to help ensure that borrowers don't take on loans they may not be able to afford. The main one is a loan-to-income ""flow limit"" which limits the number of mortgages that lenders can grant to borrowers at ratios at or greater than 4.5 the borrowers' salary. In short, it is very rare that a lender will consider a higher loan-to-income ratio because of the restriction. After a review of the rules in 2021 the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee judged that ""the LTI flow limit is likely to play a stronger role than the affordability test in guarding against an increase in aggregate household indebtedness and the number of highly indebted households in a scenario of rapidly rising house prices"". ""The change in the affordability rules may not be as significant as it sounds as the loan-to-income 'flow limit' will not be withdrawn, which has much greater impact on people's ability to borrow,"" said Gemma Harle, managing director at Quilter Financial Planning. The FCA's Mortgage Conduct of Business responsible lending rules also require a wide assessment of affordability.

"Lady Gaga is often accompanied by her dogs at award shows and film premieres The alleged gunman in the violent theft of Lady Gaga's bulldogs has been arrested after his mistaken release from custody earlier this year. In February 2021,attackers shot dog walker Ryan Fischerin the chest and took Gaga's dogs, Koji and Gustav. James Howard Jackson, 19, was accidentally released in what the US Marshals Service described as a ""clerical error"". Five months on,police say he has now been arrested,external. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department had offered a reward of up to $5,000 (Â£4,105) for information leading to his arrest, saying that he should be considered ""armed and dangerous."" One of the other men involved, Jaylin Keyshawn White, was on Wednesday sentenced to four years in prison at a Los Angeles court where he had pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery. The 20-year-old hadbeen chargedalongside Jackson, and Lafayette Shon Whaley, now 28. The star's third bulldog, Miss Asia (pictured) escaped unharmed Surveillance footage from the scene of the attack shows a car stopping near Ryan Fischer and two people jumping out. One demanded that the dog walker ""give it up"" before a struggle in which a gunshot could be heard, and the dog walker seen falling to the ground screaming. The attackers grabbed one dog each and left Fischer shouting for help, with the third dog, Asia, running back to the dog walker after the robbers drove away. Ryan Fischer later described Asia as his ""guardian angel"" who gave him the determination to survive. Lady Gaga's dog walker tells of shooting ordeal Lady Gaga's dogs found safe after armed robbery Lady Gaga dog walker 'had part of his lung removed' Lady Gaga offered a $500,000 (Â£359,000) reward for the return of the animals, whose theft highlighted a growing trend targeting the valuable breed. The woman who handed the dogs in was charged with receiving stolen goods and being an accessory after the fact. Ryan Fischer sustained chest injuries in the attack, and said on Instagram a month later he had suffered a collapsed lung, and had to have part of his lung removed. Los Angeles police said at the time they did not believe the dogs had been targeted because of their owner, but because of the value of the breed on the black market.

"Household energy bills will change every three months under new plans aimed at avoiding price shocks. Currently, the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge their customers in England, Scotland and Wales - changes every six months. Energy regulator Ofgem says the change means price rises and falls will be passed on to customers more quickly. Energy bills soared in April and are expected to rise sharply again in October, when the cap goes up. Ofgem said customers ""face a very challenging winter ahead"" and acknowledged the situation was ""deeply worrying"" for many people. In May, Ofgem said the typical household should expect to see an Â£800 increase to Â£2,800 a year, but it now says prices are looking higher than when it made that estimate. Industry analysts Cornwall Insight saidthe typical household was likely to pay Â£3,358 a year from October, then Â£3,615 a year from January - up from its previous estimate. In October 2021 the average bill was Â£1,400 a year. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, buthouseholds there have also seen bills rise. Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Ofgem said updating the price cap more regularly would also help energy suppliers better predict how much energy they need to purchase for their customers. This in turn could help reduce the risk of more suppliers failing. Since early last year, more than 30 UK energy companies have failed after firms found themselves unable to pass on the full cost of soaring wholesale gas prices to their customers because of the price cap. ""Today's change will go some way to provide the stability needed in the energy market, reducing the risk of further large-scale supplier failures which cause huge disruption and push up costs for consumers. It is not in anyone's interests for more suppliers to fail and exit the market,"" said Ofgem. Energy minister Greg Hands said: ""It makes sense for the cap to be adjusted at a reasonable frequency. ""If energy prices were to start to fall people would see those benefits more quickly."" But Simon Francis, of the campaign group End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the decision was ""simply inhumane"". ""Ultimately, this decision will force more people into fuel poverty in the middle of winter, causing additional stress on the NHS and it may ultimately lead to increased levels of excess winter deaths this year,"" he said. ""Only a full programme of emergency financial support, a rapid expansion of energy efficiency programmes and a commitment to bringing more cheap renewable energy on stream will help people stay warm this winter and into the future.""

You can also get in touch viaWhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,externalandTwitter:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external The energy price cap introduced in 2018 is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for their electricity and gas. It sets a maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and caps the level of profits an energy supplier can make. The cap has already been increased - demand for gas rose after Covid restrictions eased then prices soared again following the war in Ukraine. Russia is one of the world's biggest gas producers and has already cut supplies to some European countries. Meanwhile, Western nations have also moved to phase out Russian imports in response to the invasion. This has increased demand for other sources of energy, increasing global prices. Ofgem warned this mean the price cap, which will be published at the end of August, would rise again, but by changing it every three months any reductions in wholesale prices would be passed on more quickly to customers. It said paying a rate that is up to six months out of date in the current changeable market was ""no longer sustainable and could mean either consumers paying too much for months if wholesale prices have fallen or suppliers left unable to supply gas with the money they are allowed to charge if prices have risen"". Ofgem says it wants to cut the lag-time between wholesale price changes and the amount customers are charged which would limit the risk of suppliers going bust and pass on potential savings to consumers more quickly. So when wholesale prices are going down that will mean you're not having to wait months before that money is taken off your bills - so far so good. But the flip side is also true - and that's the position we're in right now. When wholesale prices are going up that will get added onto customer's bills more quickly. That means sharper, more frequent shocks for the next while as analysts aren't expecting global energy prices to drop any time soon. More frequent changes will make it more difficult to budget as prices will change every three months, and there's less time for suppliers to inform customers of changes, so increases really will come as a shock to some. So don't bank on this change saving you any money right now. As we head into the most difficult winter for a generation in terms of living costs, more than three quarters of households in Britain now face an energy price rise in January too, when people can least afford it.

"Energy giant Shell is to give its workers a one-off 8% bonus after the company reported record profits from high oil and gas prices. Most of the 82,000 staff it employs worldwide will get the pay boost but top executives will be excluded. Shell said the award reflected its financial success and was ""not a response"" to the rising cost of living. Energy firms' bumper profits have prompted calls for tougher taxes to help families with rising bills. It's due to forecasters predicting typical household energy bills will hit more than Â£3,600 a year this winter. In October 2021, an average bill was Â£1,400 a year. Shell reported second quarter profits of Â£9bn last week after reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices. Its rival BP has also reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years, with underlying profits of Â£6.9bn. How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise Immoral oil and gas profits must be taxed - UN The firms' huge increase in profits has been fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. The high oil price has also led to the price of petrol and diesel reaching record highs at the pumps in recent months, with inflation - the rate at which prices rise - at a 40-year high. Shell said in a statement its staff would get 8% of their salaries as a bonus ""in recognition of the contribution our people have made to Shell's strong operational performance against a recent challenging backdrop"". ""The award enables those employees to share in our current operational and financial success - it is not a response to inflation or cost-of-living challenges,"" the company added. About 5,000 of Shell's employees in Britain are in line to benefit from the bonus, however, 1,200 employees of Shell Energy Retail, its loss-making household supply business, will not receive the bonuses Shell has also said it would return billions of dollars to its shareholders after posting its quarterly financial results last month. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for oil and gas companies to face special taxes, saying it was""immoral"" for firms to be profiting from the Ukraine war. ""This grotesque greed is punishing the poorest and most vulnerable people, while destroying our only common home,"" Mr Guterres said. The UK government has introduced a package of measures to help people with energy bills, such as a Â£400 discount, and also announced in May that oil and gas firms would pay an extra 25% on profits. The tax applies from 26 May to profit made in the UK, which for most oil and gas companies is a small part of their operations. And Shell and BP will not need to pay the levy on the majority of their recent profits made between April and June, due to when the legislation came into force. The Treasury expects thewindfall taxto raise about Â£5bn in its first year, but critics of such taxes argue they can hit pension funds invested in energy firms.

"Chinese planes and ships have again crossed the median line in the strait between the mainland and Taiwan It comes as China holds its second day of military drills around the island, Beijing's main response to Nancy Pelosi's visit Japan has demanded China cease the drills, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called them an ""unjustified escalation"" Taiwan's foreign minister has told the BBC that Taiwan won't be the ""last piece in [the] Chinese dream of expansionism"" China has not commented on reports it may have fired a missile over Taiwan on Thursday China sees self-ruled Taiwan - which lies 100 miles from the mainland - as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control Edited by Nathan Williams It's early evening in Taiwan and we'll be pausing our live coverage soon. But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline. She also brands the military drills encircling the island ""disproportionate and destabilising"". Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan.

One said the atmosphere this time was ""abnormal"" while another insisted they had to keep using Taiwan waters or they would not survive. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command said that it continued military exercises in the north, southwest and east of Taiwan Island as planned on Friday. The air and sea combat drills were for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces, it said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media site.

China's ambassador to the US was called to the White House yesterday. ""After Chinaâs actions overnight, we summoned [Peopleâs
Republic of China] Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to dÃ©marche him about
the PRCâs provocative actions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby says in a
statement provided to the newspaper. A dÃ©marche is a protest lodged through diplomatic channels. Kirby adds that the Biden administration condemned the PRCâs
military actions, ""which are irresponsible and at odds with our
long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait"". The meeting was between Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden's
Asia tsar, and Qin, according to a White House official who spoke to the Post
anonymously. News of the meeting - which took place on Thursday - came
shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, wassanctioned by China for her visit to
Taiwan. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting in English and Japanese - affirming the values Taiwan shares with democratic countries and asking the international community to ""halt escalation of the security situation"". In English, she said China's military threat was ""irresponsible to Taiwan and the international community"". Taiwan's government and military are closely monitoring China's military drills and are ready to respond as necessary, she said. Allow Twitter content?

China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying did not offer a comment when asked about whether missiles fired by China yesterday passed above Taiwan. The Japanese embassy in Washington said it believed four missiles fired by China had passed over the island's capital Taipei. But Hua said: ""I have no comment. Pelosi triggered the current tensions.

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. TheOne China policyis a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from theOne China principle- referred to in the Chinese statement sanctioning Pelosi - whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan,external, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself.

Friday's military drill. A video was published showing Chinese army medics conducting a
drill for sending wounded soldiers by a high speed train with surgery facilities. On China's Twitter-like Weibo the hashtag ""second day of
military drill"" is being promoted and people are asking: ""What's for
today?"" and ""Why so quiet today?"" In general, the feeling on Chinese social media is mixed. Some
people are impressed by the drills so far, others seem disappointed by what
they've seen. China has announced it is sanctioning US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family over her visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Pelosi had ""seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, seriously damaged China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampled on the one-China principle, and seriously threatened peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", according to a statement. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Cycling crash was nearly 'complete catastrophe', say family A family involved in the horror cycling crash during the Commonwealth Games say they came ""close to a complete catastrophe"" that could have ""seriously injured or killed"" their two young children. On the final lap of a qualifying heat for the men's scratch race on Sunday, a high-speed collision involving several riders resulted in England's Matt Walls being catapulted over the barriers and into the crowd with his bike. The incident has led to calls from Sir Chris Hoy and Dame Laura Kenny for improvements to velodrome safety, with Hoy saying it is a ""disgrace"" that there are not protective screens at venues. Walls flew into the front two rows of the stands, where Hugh Colvin was sitting with his two younger children, aged five and seven, and some family friends. ""It all happened so incredibly quickly at the speed the cyclists were going,"" Mr Colvin told BBC Sport. ""You can see the trajectory of the bike, it came through, grazed my daughter's shoulder, and one of the photos you can see we are obviously underneath the wheel. ""I was facing the other way because I'd turned my head, but looking back at the photos it must have been within centimetres, millimetres, of our heads and obviously close enough to graze my daughter."" He added that where Walls' bike landed was in the two seats where his five-year-old son and his friend's son had been sitting, before they moved back a row to get a better view. For Hugh's wife, Laura, who was not at the velodrome, it has sunk in over the past few days how much worse it could have been. Team England cyclist Matt Walls did not sustain any serious injuries in the crash ""What has been quite hard for us to get our head around is being able to see from the photographs that were taken of the incident exactly how close this came to being a complete catastrophe,"" she said. ""And how close our two younger children came to being seriously injured or killed. And that has been the main thing we've had to reflect on over the last few days."" Contrary to an early statement from the organisers that no members of the public required hospital treatment, a friend who attended the event with the Colvins is awaiting surgery for a serious arm injury. ""He suffered a laceration to the bone which the hospital have described as being like a machete injury,"" said Mrs Colvin. ""It's been really difficult for him, he's still waiting for surgery. In addition to the soft tissue and muscle injury he's got a partially severed tendon in his arm, so it is the start of a long road to recovery for him."" They said the three children were deeply concerned about the condition of the three cyclists - Walls, the Isle of Man's Matt Bostock and Canada's Derek Gee - who went to hospital after the crash. On Monday, Walls video-called the Colvins' daughter, which they said was a ""massive step forward"" in helping her come to terms with what she had seen. The Colvins praised the quick response of volunteers, paramedics and team coaches who helped them in the aftermath of the crash. However, the family want the incident to trigger a review of velodrome safety, to give them the reassurance that ""no family is ever going to find themselves in our situation"". They said they were ""completely unaware"" that a cyclist had ever flown off the track before. ""If we had known for a moment that there was a risk that a bike with an adult male going at that speed could come into contact with my seven-year-old daughter, my family would never have been there,"" said Mrs Colvin. This video can not be played 'Could have been an awful lot worse' - details shared on Walls cycling crash Bostock, who is still hoping to compete in Sunday's road race, told BBC Sport: ""There has to be something done because it's going down as a freak accident, but it has happened before. ""I don't know how many freak accidents become a normal accident. I dread to think if it had been worse. It should be a proactive decision to try and make it safer before it's a terrible accident."" A Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said they had been in regular contact with the Colvin family and apologised for any upset the initial wording of their statement had caused. They said ""a full and detailed accident investigation is already under way and we will pass our findings on to the relevant parties"". Shaun Dawson, Chief Executive of Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, said the venue complies with international regulations and that an accident of this kind has never taken place there before. He added: ""We appreciate that this was a shocking experience for those involved and we offer our heartfelt best wishes to all those involved."" British Cycling performance director Stephen Park said: ""After incidents of this nature it's appropriate to review matters relating to safety and we'll do everything we can to support conversations both nationally and internationally in this regard."" Cycling's world governing body, the UCI, said that they are taking the incident ""very seriously"" and will ""continue to work with event organisers and other key parties to ensure that the strictest safety measures are in place.""

"Lady Gaga is often accompanied by her dogs at award shows and film premieres The alleged gunman in the violent theft of Lady Gaga's bulldogs has been arrested after his mistaken release from custody earlier this year. In February 2021,attackers shot dog walker Ryan Fischerin the chest and took Gaga's dogs, Koji and Gustav. James Howard Jackson, 19, was accidentally released in what the US Marshals Service described as a ""clerical error"". Five months on,police say he has now been arrested,external. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department had offered a reward of up to $5,000 (Â£4,105) for information leading to his arrest, saying that he should be considered ""armed and dangerous."" One of the other men involved, Jaylin Keyshawn White, was on Wednesday sentenced to four years in prison at a Los Angeles court where he had pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery. The 20-year-old hadbeen chargedalongside Jackson, and Lafayette Shon Whaley, now 28. The star's third bulldog, Miss Asia (pictured) escaped unharmed Surveillance footage from the scene of the attack shows a car stopping near Ryan Fischer and two people jumping out. One demanded that the dog walker ""give it up"" before a struggle in which a gunshot could be heard, and the dog walker seen falling to the ground screaming. The attackers grabbed one dog each and left Fischer shouting for help, with the third dog, Asia, running back to the dog walker after the robbers drove away. Ryan Fischer later described Asia as his ""guardian angel"" who gave him the determination to survive. Lady Gaga's dog walker tells of shooting ordeal Lady Gaga's dogs found safe after armed robbery Lady Gaga dog walker 'had part of his lung removed' Lady Gaga offered a $500,000 (Â£359,000) reward for the return of the animals, whose theft highlighted a growing trend targeting the valuable breed. The woman who handed the dogs in was charged with receiving stolen goods and being an accessory after the fact. Ryan Fischer sustained chest injuries in the attack, and said on Instagram a month later he had suffered a collapsed lung, and had to have part of his lung removed. Los Angeles police said at the time they did not believe the dogs had been targeted because of their owner, but because of the value of the breed on the black market. With stars such as Lady Gaga, Reese Witherspoon, Chrissy Teigen and Leonardo DiCaprio having the breed, authorities say that they can change hands for thousands of dollars.

"This video can not be played In a 'blunt message"" the Bank of England governor warns interest rates may have to rise even higher The Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession as it raised interest rates by the most in 27 years. The economy is forecast to shrink in the last three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. Interest rates rose to 1.75% as the Bank battles to stem soaring prices, with inflation now set to hit over 13%. Governor Andrew Bailey said he knew the cost of living squeeze was difficult but if it didn't raise interest rates it would get ""even worse"". The main reason for high inflation and low growth is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A typical household will be paying almost Â£300 a month for their energy by October, the Bank warned. The expected recession would be the longest downturn since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse, bringing lending to a halt. The slump is not set to be as deep as 14 years ago but may last just as long. The Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he had ""huge sympathy and huge understanding for those who are struggling most"" with the cost of living. ""I know that they will feel, 'Well, why have you raised interest rates today, doesn't that make it worse from that perspective in terms of consumption?', I'm afraid my answer to that is, it doesn't because I'm afraid the alternative is even worse in terms of persistent inflation."" Increasing interest rates is one way to try and control inflation as it raises borrowing costs and should encourage people to borrow and spend less. It can also encourage people to save more. However, many households will be squeezed further following the interest rate rise including some mortgage-holders. How does an interest rate rise affect me? 'Rate rise means I owe Â£250 a month more on loans' Did the Bank of England make the right call? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Now rates have gone up to 1.75%, homeowners on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£52 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£59 increase. It means tracker mortgage holders could be paying about Â£167 more a month compared to pre-December 2021, with variable mortgage holders paying up to Â£132 more. Interest rates have risen six times in a row since the end of last year. Higher interest rates also mean higher charges on things like credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Patrick Reid, a business owner in London, owesÂ£25,000 on credit cards and loans and fears an interest rate rise will cost him. Patrick Reid owes Â£25,000 in loans and credit cards ""At present I repay around Â£1,800 a month but I have worked out that I will conservatively need to pay another Â£250 a month to keep up with the debts,"" he said. ""I will simply have to tighten my belt and be extra cautious in my spending, which means all of those non-essential items will be cut from my budget."" Rebecca McDonald, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said ""staggeringly"" high inflation was ""going to hit low income families hard"". ""Many took on credit to pay their bills and are falling behind on their payments. This will be much harder to pay off with higher interest rates putting more families in financial peril."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the cost of living support announced so far was ""clearly not enough"". ""There will be families and pensioners across the country waking up this morning, reading the news, who are absolutely terrified because a juggernaut is heading [their] way which will smash through family finances,"" he said. He said a Labour government would reduce VAT on energy bills, abolish the tax relief currently offered to oil and gas companies who invest, and provide support to help people retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said he was confident the action the government was taking meant it could overcome the economic challenges. Both Mr Zahawi and Boris Johnson have also been criticised by Labour for being on holiday when the Bank detailed its gloomy outlook. Mr Zahawi insisted he was still working and had a call with Governor Andrew Bailey after the interest rate announcement. ""For me, like I'm sure lots of others, there is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, not in government,"" he said. He added: ""The privilege and responsibility of public service means that you never get to switch off, that's why I have had calls and briefings every day and continue to do so."" It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England. Announcing the largest rate rise in more than a quarter of a century in an attempt to temper even higher peaks in inflation of an incredible 13% is what the Bank of England actually did. But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here. This is a proper full fat recession at the same time as the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high. It is a textbook example of the combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation - stagflation. It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. Read more from Faisal here Energy bills have already risen sharply this year, squeezing household incomes and leading to slower growth for the UK economy. Russia has reduced supplies to Europe as it wages war in Ukraine and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. As well as energy, households have been hit by higher petrol and diesel costs and food prices. The Bank warned UK economic growth was already slowing, adding: ""The latest rise in gas prices has led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for the UK and the rest of Europe"". The rate of inflation is expected to stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, the Bank said. It will eventually return to the Bank's 2% target the following year.

"Energy giant Shell is to give its workers a one-off 8% bonus after the company reported record profits from high oil and gas prices. Most of the 82,000 staff it employs worldwide will get the pay boost but top executives will be excluded. Shell said the award reflected its financial success and was ""not a response"" to the rising cost of living. Energy firms' bumper profits have prompted calls for tougher taxes to help families with rising bills. It's due to forecasters predicting typical household energy bills will hit more than Â£3,600 a year this winter. In October 2021, an average bill was Â£1,400 a year. Shell reported second quarter profits of Â£9bn last week after reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices. Its rival BP has also reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years, with underlying profits of Â£6.9bn. How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise Immoral oil and gas profits must be taxed - UN The firms' huge increase in profits has been fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. The high oil price has also led to the price of petrol and diesel reaching record highs at the pumps in recent months, with inflation - the rate at which prices rise - at a 40-year high. Shell said in a statement its staff would get 8% of their salaries as a bonus ""in recognition of the contribution our people have made to Shell's strong operational performance against a recent challenging backdrop"". ""The award enables those employees to share in our current operational and financial success - it is not a response to inflation or cost-of-living challenges,"" the company added. About 5,000 of Shell's employees in Britain are in line to benefit from the bonus, however, 1,200 employees of Shell Energy Retail, its loss-making household supply business, will not receive the bonuses Shell has also said it would return billions of dollars to its shareholders after posting its quarterly financial results last month. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for oil and gas companies to face special taxes, saying it was""immoral"" for firms to be profiting from the Ukraine war. ""This grotesque greed is punishing the poorest and most vulnerable people, while destroying our only common home,"" Mr Guterres said. The UK government has introduced a package of measures to help people with energy bills, such as a Â£400 discount, and also announced in May that oil and gas firms would pay an extra 25% on profits. The tax applies from 26 May to profit made in the UK, which for most oil and gas companies is a small part of their operations. And Shell and BP will not need to pay the levy on the majority of their recent profits made between April and June, due to when the legislation came into force. The Treasury expects thewindfall taxto raise about Â£5bn in its first year, but critics of such taxes argue they can hit pension funds invested in energy firms.

"This video can not be played Hosepipe ban: 'How will I water my tomatoes?' A hosepipe ban, expected to last weeks, will be introduced in parts of Wales amid the driest year since 1976. The ban, covering Pembrokeshire and a small part of Carmarthenshire, starts on 19 August as Welsh Water is under pressure to maintain supplies after low rainfall. It means people will not be allowed to water their plants, wash their cars or clean windows using a hose. The water company said the planned ban would be its first since 1989. It follows similar bans announced for parts of southern England. Anyone who would like to apply for an exemption to the ban should apply to Welsh Water during the consultation period between 10 and 17 August. How can you save water during a hosepipe ban? Welsh rivers run low as lack of rain impacts country Welsh Water boss Peter Perry toldBBC Radio Wales Drivehe was ""not pleased"" to have to implement the ban. ""We're doing our bit. We've got 600 people finding and fixing leaks at the moment,"" he said. He said the hosepipe ban was likely to be in place ""for weeks"", adding that the organisation had the power to levy financial penalties on people who persistently flout the rules. The ban covers much of Pembrokeshire and a small part of Carmarthenshire One man told the BBC he was ""horrified"" at the thought that he might not be able to water his tomatoes. ""I'm not on a meter. I know it's a bit selfish but I pay Â£800 for water and there's only two of us in the house,"" said Jonathan Frost, from Cardiff. ""I'm pretty horrified because how am I going to water my tomatoes?"" Ellie Gent said she believes a hosepipe ban is reasonable given the circumstance ""If we need drinking water we have to accept a hosepipe ban is a necessity giving what is happening with climate change and we've had no rain,"" said Ellie Gent. Rita Evans, from Narberth, Pembrokeshire, said she had a water butt and believed it was important to conserve as much water as possible. ""We have a lot of visitors here in Pembrokeshire at the moment and we've not had enough rain so I do understand why."" Rita Evans said she could understand why the ban was in place Welsh Water's managing director of water services, Ian Christie, said: ""We have not seen such prolonged dry conditions in Pembrokeshire since 1976. ""Introducing the hosepipe ban is not a decision we have taken lightly, however if we are to make sure there is enough water to see us through the rest of the summer and into the autumn then we need to act now to try and prevent any further restrictions later on."" Reservoirs in Pembrokeshire, such as Llys Y Fran, are close to drought levels ""The ban will apply to just over 2% of the three million population we serve in Wales. More broadly we do not intend to introduce restrictions more widely across our operating area."" The company said it was taking the measures as there was an increased demand for water and its reservoirs in Pembrokeshire were approaching drought levels. It added that this will not risk immediate supplies but it was bringing in the restrictions to ensure there would be enough supplies for customers and wildlife over the coming months. Rocks are not usually so visible on the River Usk at Llangynidr this time of year Restrictions during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or outside tap. During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: Water a garden or plants Fill a paddling or swimming pool Clean a car Fill a pond Clean walls or windows Welsh Water will hold a consultation over the planned hosepipe ban However, there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used: To water a new lawn within 28 days of it being laid For business use To fill pools needed for medical treatment To fill a fountain used for religious practices To top up a fishpond Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Welsh Water added that Pembrokeshire has only seen just over 60% of the expected rainfall between March and July. Data from the Met Office shows Wales experienced its lowest July rainfall since 2006. BBC weather presenter Sue Charles said there was no significant rain in the forecast. ""In some parts of Wales - especially further east in places such as Cardiff and Wrexham - temperatures could reach the mid to high 20s,"" she said. Welsh Water had earlier warned that people in some areas of Wales could face a hosepipe ban this summer. ""There is a slight concern about the situation in Pembrokeshire,"" it said. ""Between March and April, rainfall across Wales was only 50% of the long term average while between March and May it was just 60%."" Pressure group Welsh Rivers Union has been calling for an immediate hosepipe ban in parts of Wales following a period of hot weather with little rainfall. Arid conditions in Pembrokeshire caused a grass fire above Newgale, in very hot conditions during the heatwave last month ""We don't want to get to crisis point before we act,"" Kim Waters, co-founder of the Welsh Rivers Union, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""We have to be sensible as a society now. Water in Wales is just not a throwaway resource and we just need to manage it in a better way."" He said the group wanted Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water to be open with the data they have. ""I just want them to be open, honest, tell us what the state is and act accordingly,"" he added. The Welsh government said: ""The current prolonged dry weather period reflects the challenges we all face in tackling climate change.Â ""We continue to encourage everyone to be considerate in their water usage to maintain water flow over the coming months.""

"This video can not be played Cycling crash was nearly 'complete catastrophe', say family A family involved in the horror cycling crash during the Commonwealth Games say they came ""close to a complete catastrophe"" that could have ""seriously injured or killed"" their two young children. On the final lap of a qualifying heat for the men's scratch race on Sunday, a high-speed collision involving several riders resulted in England's Matt Walls being catapulted over the barriers and into the crowd with his bike. The incident has led to calls from Sir Chris Hoy and Dame Laura Kenny for improvements to velodrome safety, with Hoy saying it is a ""disgrace"" that there are not protective screens at venues. Walls flew into the front two rows of the stands, where Hugh Colvin was sitting with his two younger children, aged five and seven, and some family friends. ""It all happened so incredibly quickly at the speed the cyclists were going,"" Mr Colvin told BBC Sport. ""You can see the trajectory of the bike, it came through, grazed my daughter's shoulder, and one of the photos you can see we are obviously underneath the wheel. ""I was facing the other way because I'd turned my head, but looking back at the photos it must have been within centimetres, millimetres, of our heads and obviously close enough to graze my daughter."" He added that where Walls' bike landed was in the two seats where his five-year-old son and his friend's son had been sitting, before they moved back a row to get a better view. For Hugh's wife, Laura, who was not at the velodrome, it has sunk in over the past few days how much worse it could have been. Team England cyclist Matt Walls did not sustain any serious injuries in the crash ""What has been quite hard for us to get our head around is being able to see from the photographs that were taken of the incident exactly how close this came to being a complete catastrophe,"" she said. ""And how close our two younger children came to being seriously injured or killed. And that has been the main thing we've had to reflect on over the last few days."" Contrary to an early statement from the organisers that no members of the public required hospital treatment, a friend who attended the event with the Colvins is awaiting surgery for a serious arm injury. ""He suffered a laceration to the bone which the hospital have described as being like a machete injury,"" said Mrs Colvin. ""It's been really difficult for him, he's still waiting for surgery. In addition to the soft tissue and muscle injury he's got a partially severed tendon in his arm, so it is the start of a long road to recovery for him."" They said the three children were deeply concerned about the condition of the three cyclists - Walls, the Isle of Man's Matt Bostock and Canada's Derek Gee - who went to hospital after the crash. On Monday, Walls video-called the Colvins' daughter, which they said was a ""massive step forward"" in helping her come to terms with what she had seen. The Colvins praised the quick response of volunteers, paramedics and team coaches who helped them in the aftermath of the crash. However, the family want the incident to trigger a review of velodrome safety, to give them the reassurance that ""no family is ever going to find themselves in our situation"". They said they were ""completely unaware"" that a cyclist had ever flown off the track before. ""If we had known for a moment that there was a risk that a bike with an adult male going at that speed could come into contact with my seven-year-old daughter, my family would never have been there,"" said Mrs Colvin. This video can not be played 'Could have been an awful lot worse' - details shared on Walls cycling crash Bostock, who is still hoping to compete in Sunday's road race, told BBC Sport: ""There has to be something done because it's going down as a freak accident, but it has happened before. ""I don't know how many freak accidents become a normal accident. I dread to think if it had been worse. It should be a proactive decision to try and make it safer before it's a terrible accident."" A Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said they had been in regular contact with the Colvin family and apologised for any upset the initial wording of their statement had caused. They said ""a full and detailed accident investigation is already under way and we will pass our findings on to the relevant parties"". Shaun Dawson, Chief Executive of Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, said the venue complies with international regulations and that an accident of this kind has never taken place there before. He added: ""We appreciate that this was a shocking experience for those involved and we offer our heartfelt best wishes to all those involved."" British Cycling performance director Stephen Park said: ""After incidents of this nature it's appropriate to review matters relating to safety and we'll do everything we can to support conversations both nationally and internationally in this regard."" Cycling's world governing body, the UCI, said that they are taking the incident ""very seriously"" and will ""continue to work with event organisers and other key parties to ensure that the strictest safety measures are in place.""

"A section of a path leading up to the famous Edinburgh skyline walk will be fenced to protect walkers from a bull Fencing is to be installed on a path in the Pentland Hills after safety fears were raised over the presence of a bull in a field where walkers have previously been attacked by cows. The path on Turnhouse Hill is a right of way which leads to the popular Edinburgh skyline walk. The land's owner, Scotland's Rural College, said it had already removed the herd of cows from the lower slopes. Now it plans to fence off a corridor of the field containing the bull. It has been living in the field for more than a month, with a warning sign on the path gate. James Gentles is an experienced walker who has climbed all 282 Munros Some walkers have risked walking through the field, which does not have an alternative route around it, while others have turned back. When BBC Scotland raised the concerns with the college, it said it would build a fence before the end of the summer. James Gentles, from Edinburgh, said he was shocked and upset a bull had replaced the herd which had attacked him in October 2020. The 61-year-old needed stitches after being charged by a cow on the same route. Path may be rerouted after fourth attack by cows Runner attacked by charging cow in Pentland Hills He said it was the ""premier path"" in the regional park, and was very popular with walkers. ""Cows and bulls can't read signs, so it's not going to stop walkers being attacked,"" he said. ""It's not the cows' fault or the walkers' fault. ""I am therefore relieved they are now going to fence that section of the path from the bull."" There are also bulls in other nearby fields in the regional park Mark Hartree was also crushed by a cow at the same spot in September 2020. A spokesperson for Scotland's Rural College said it took safety at its farm operations very seriously. It said it had taken steps in 2020 to keep cattle ""entirely separate"" from the area's main right of way to safeguard public access. Since then, signs had been installed at ""appropriate times"" to notify walkers about the potential presence of bulls among livestock in fields. ""However, these arrangements remain under continuous review. We want walkers to continue to feel welcome and understand the signage we use,"" it said. ""We are therefore carrying out further works this summer to ensure that any small remaining potential for direct contact between people and cattle is removed through the construction of a short, fenced corridor. This will secure easy access to the rights of way all year round."" A Scottish government spokesman said that if there was a bull in a field, the public was expected to go into a neighbouring field or on to adjacent land. ""Land managers are urged to keep animals known to be dangerous away from fields crossed by a core path or other well-used route,"" he added. ""If this is not possible, land managers should inform the public and signpost a reasonable alternative route.""

"Sunak and Truss spoke at the All Nations Centre in Cardiff Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have attacked Mark Drakeford and his Welsh Labour government at a Tory leadership hustings. Frontrunner Ms Truss accused the first minister of being a ""low energy version"" of Jeremy Corbyn who was ""ashamed of our history"". Meanwhile Mr Sunak said he would be an ""activist prime minister"" who would call out ""failures of devolution"". The pair answered questions from party members in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales that he did not have time to watch the event and had ""only seen reports of it"". But, interviewed by Newyddion S4C, he said: ""Of course, the two contestants were welcome to make one of their rare visits to Wales and there's nothing that I could say about either of them that they haven't already said about each other."" In his opening speech, the former chancellor attacked plans for more Senedd members in Cardiff Bay, saying money should be spent on cost of living issues instead. He said a Welsh governmentfreeze on road building projects, which ministers say is necessary to reduce carbon emissions, would cause ""enormous economic self harm"". Rishi Sunak said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister Mr Sunak attacked Welsh Labour's record, saying that ""in spite of receiving 20% more funding, here in Wales waiting lists are the worse in the United Kingdom"". He indicated he was opposed to more devolution for the Senedd and said he would be an ""activist prime minister when it comes to Wales"". He said: ""We need to be more prepared to call out the failures of the devolved government here, because this path of onward devolution has not worked in actually delivering better health care and education"". Mr Sunak added: ""If the UK government is sending billions of pounds over to Wales, and it's being squandered, it's not being spent properly, and children are not being taught properly in schools and people are waiting unacceptably long for health care treatment, we need to call that out and we need to make sure we improve it."" Liz Truss said Mark Drakeford was ""ashamed of our history"" In her speech, Ms Truss said: ""The fact is that there are too many people in this country who are ashamed of our history, who talk our country down, who say the best days are behind us. They are completely wrong. ""I'm afraid one of them is Mark Drakeford."" ""Whether it's stopping the M4 relief road, whether it's whacking a tax on our tourist industry, I will crack down on his negativity about Wales, and about the United Kingdom."" Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss for Tory leadership When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss promised to change the Treasury's funding formula to get investment ""into places that have been left behind"". ""We need to help level up our country,"" she said, ""and you know that there are parts of Wales where it's very difficult to get a mobile phone signal, it's very difficult to get broadband. ""It's difficult to get on a train that goes anywhere very fast - and in particular, north Wales has been left behind."" She said she would build the M4 Relief Road. The project was ditched by the Welsh government, which has responsibility for motorways in Wales,in 2019. A small group of climate change protesters greeted arriving Conservatives at the All Nations Centre ahead of the event. If your question was whether Rishi Sunak will devolve more powers to the Welsh Parliament as prime minister, it seems clear he will not. He told Tory members - often assumed to be more devo-sceptic than some of their elected members in Cardiff Bay - that the answer to problems in Wales was ""not more devolution"", and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete - but he said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister - the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was where she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS - which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival.

"Chinese planes and ships have again crossed the median line in the strait between the mainland and Taiwan It comes as China holds its second day of military drills around the island, Beijing's main response to Nancy Pelosi's visit Japan has demanded China cease the drills, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called them an ""unjustified escalation"" Taiwan's foreign minister has told the BBC that Taiwan won't be the ""last piece in [the] Chinese dream of expansionism"" China has not commented on reports it may have fired a missile over Taiwan on Thursday China sees self-ruled Taiwan - which lies 100 miles from the mainland - as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control Edited by Nathan Williams It's early evening in Taiwan and we'll be pausing our live coverage soon. But before we go
here's a recap of today's key developments:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Thomas Spender, Yvette Tan, Melissa Zhu, Nathan Williams, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock. Let's head to Taiwan, where the defence ministry has spoken out
about the action of the Chinese military. In a statement, officials condemned Chinese vessels crossing the
Taiwan Strait and ""harassing"" the island's surrounding waters and air
space, Reuters reports. Chinese aircraft had crossed the median line a total of 68 times
by 17:00 local time (10:00 BST), the ministry reportedly said - before warning
its military would defend Taiwan's national security ""with firm
action"". It added China had ""seriously damaged"" the status quo
of the strait, which separates the island of Taiwan and mainland China. Reality Check There have been some more cyber-attacks reported against
official websites in Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defence was one target, as well as the
Environment Protection Bureau in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan,
according to local media. The Defence Ministry's website went offline
temporarily and on the environment bureau's website, the cyber-attackers put up
five Chinese national flags. The website of Taiwan's presidential office, the Foreign
Ministry and the governing party have all been targeted this week. Taiwan says the identities of
those responsible for the latest attacks remains unknown. We reported earlier on Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu'sinterview with the BBC- and here's some more. Refusing to apologise for US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brief but controversial trip to the island, Wu said visits from high profile figures are key to ""raise the profile of Taiwan and to allow the international community to understand that Taiwan is a democracy"". ""China has long been trying to isolate Taiwan internationally,"" he added. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control again. One poll suggests most Taiwanese are not
confident that the US would help defend the island. Some78.4%of those polled said they werenot at allornot very confidentthat theUS would provide assistance to defend
Taiwan. While 19.2% of the 19,500 questioned - between Wednesday and Friday - said
they were very or somewhat confident. The rest had no opinion. The share of Taiwanese people who believe that the US military
would provide support against a Chinese invasion appears to have been dropping
for some time. A poll in March, by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF)
think tank, found that 55.9% of more than a thousand respondents did
not believe at all or did not fully believe that the US would defend Taiwan if
China invaded. While 34.5% somewhat or fully believed it would. This was a sharp drop from just six months before - prior to the
Ukraine war - when a similar survey by TPOF found that 65% believed the US
would send troops to defend Taiwan and only 29% did not think it would. Reality Check Taipei's international airport was not hit by a missile Misleading information has been circulating in recent days as
tensions have surged. Reports emerged incorrectly claiming that the international
airport near Taiwanâs capital, Taipei, was hit by a missile on 2 August. But Taiwanâs Ministry of National Defencedenied this had happened,,externaland
pointed out the airport was working normally. There've also been claims in some Chinese-language media that
Taiwan has cancelled all leave for its military. But as yet this has not
happened, although personnel have been asked to remain ""on alert."" There's also been misleading video shared claiming to show
Chinese warships in the waters around Taiwan in recent days. But it uses old
footage of events held to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Chinese navy in
April. Similarly, social media users
have shared video said to show a recent Chinese military exercise, which was
actually a Taiwanese drill from nearly two years ago. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan has left Joe Biden with a serious headache as he tries to manage ties with America's biggest global rival. The relationship between China and the United States was founded on deliberate ambiguity over Taiwan. Maintaining the status quo - in which Beijing says Taiwan is part of China, Taiwan says it's independent, the US says it's not but treats it like an ally, and no one makes aggressive moves on their claims - has been the least-worst option of keeping a tenuous peace. But the US House Speaker has shone a harsh spotlight on the contradictions of this arrangement - which had already become strained. Read more Beijing has announced it is halting key climate talks with the US, and co-operation across multiple other areas. China and America unveiled a climate pact at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. China's foreign ministry says the country is also suspending dialogue between senior military commanders, talks over cross-border crime prevention and repatriating illegal migrants. All this follows US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan which angered China. Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, has had her say on the situation in Taiwan. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia, she says Australia is ""deeply concerned"" about China's launch of ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan's coastline. She also brands the military drills encircling the island ""disproportionate and destabilising"". Wong joins the likes of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who've both expressed concern over China's actions. In its own statement, Australiaâs foreign ministry adds: This is a serious matter for the region, including for our close strategic partner, Japan. Australia shares the regionâs concerns about this escalating military activity, especially the risks of miscalculation.  We urge restraint and de-escalation. It is in all our interests to have a region at peace and not in conflict. Australia does not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. There is no change to Australia's bipartisan One China policy.  Rupert Wingfield-HayesReporting from Taiwan That's how a Taiwanese retired navy captain Lu Li-Shin described
the military drills taking place around the island. ""What China is engaged in is psychological warfare,""
he said. ""All the missiles being fired, all the explosions - it's to
show China's domestic audience how tough Beijing is being while at the same
time intimidating the people of Taiwan."" It is nevertheless an impressive show and illustrates how far
China's military has come in the last two decades. Captain Lu says China's next step might be to fire a missile
over Taiwan. It appears that might have happened on Thursday - Japanese
officials suspect it did - but China is yet to confirm it. If that's true, this is something China has never done before. As the graphic shows, several of the zones where China has been conducting military exercises verge into Taiwan's territorial waters. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command claims the sea combat drills are for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces. Chinese jets have also been spotted flying above the mainland's Pingtan island - which lies across the water from northern Taiwan and is one of the closest points to Taiwan. This video can not be played Two fishermen have spoken about the impact China's military drills are having on their daily lives. One said the atmosphere this time was ""abnormal"" while another insisted they had to keep using Taiwan waters or they would not survive. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command said that it continued military exercises in the north, southwest and east of Taiwan Island as planned on Friday. The air and sea combat drills were for the purpose of ""continuously testing the joint combat capabilities"" of the armed forces, it said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media site. There's more from the US now, where areport in the Washington Post,externalreveals
China's ambassador to the US was called to the White House yesterday. ""After Chinaâs actions overnight, we summoned [Peopleâs
Republic of China] Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to dÃ©marche him about
the PRCâs provocative actions,"" White House spokesman John Kirby says in a
statement provided to the newspaper. A dÃ©marche is a protest lodged through diplomatic channels. Kirby adds that the Biden administration condemned the PRCâs
military actions, ""which are irresponsible and at odds with our
long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait"". The meeting was between Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden's
Asia tsar, and Qin, according to a White House official who spoke to the Post
anonymously. News of the meeting - which took place on Thursday - came
shortly after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, wassanctioned by China for her visit to
Taiwan. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting in English and Japanese - affirming the values Taiwan shares with democratic countries and asking the international community to ""halt escalation of the security situation"". In English, she said China's military threat was ""irresponsible to Taiwan and the international community"". Taiwan's government and military are closely monitoring China's military drills and are ready to respond as necessary, she said. Allow Twitter content?

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. TheOne China policyis a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from theOne China principle- referred to in the Chinese statement sanctioning Pelosi - whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a""robust unofficial"" relationship with Taiwan,external, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself. Read more Chinese state media has not yet released information about
Friday's military drill. A video was published showing Chinese army medics conducting a
drill for sending wounded soldiers by a high speed train with surgery facilities. On China's Twitter-like Weibo the hashtag ""second day of
military drill"" is being promoted and people are asking: ""What's for
today?"" and ""Why so quiet today?"" In general, the feeling on Chinese social media is mixed. Some
people are impressed by the drills so far, others seem disappointed by what
they've seen. China has announced it is sanctioning US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family over her visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Pelosi had ""seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, seriously damaged China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampled on the one-China principle, and seriously threatened peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", according to a statement. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Â© 2025 BBC.

The page was edited by Andrew Humphrey, Shanaz Musafer and Chris Giles. We'll be closing today's live page on the Bank of England interest rate hike shortly. But before we go here are the key headlines of the day:  This video can not be played Andrew Bailey on Bank of England interest rate rise warning More now from the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, who tells the BBC that the UK has been hit by a severe shock thanks to soaring energy prices - which he blames on Russia. He says the increase in gas prices since May has had ""a very big impact.. that is passing through directly into inflation. ""It will have an effect on the economy, and, yes, we are forecasting a recession,"" he adds. ""The really blunt message I have to give, is if that does become more embedded and the problem gets worse, we will have high inflation for longer and the Bank of England will have to raise rates even higher,"" the governor concludes. Labour has urged the government to scrap tax breaks on oil and gas companies in order to provide more help to the public with rising bills. Shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden says the Bank of England's forecasts show ""how hard this crisis is hitting families"". He adds that it also demonstrates ""how much is left to come"" as the situation worsens and ""how vulnerable 12 years of economic mismanagement by the Conservatives has left us"". The government must act fast if we are going to avoid one of the worst recessions since the 1990s, by scrapping tax breaks on oil and gas producers and providing more help to people who are struggling to pay their energy bills.""  A rise in interest rates isn't bad news for everyone. Edmund Wood is saving to buy a home close to London, so hopes a rate rise will help his deposit grow more quickly. ""An increase in interest rates is good for me,"" he says. ""I've been worried about rising property prices - they have climbed every month for the last 12 months in a row. ""That wouldn't be good if I was ready to buy now, but in two years when I've saved up during a period of increasing interest rates, hopefully house prices will fall again, which will leave me in a better position to buy. ""Also hopefully by then interest rates will have stabilised somewhat, meaning I'll be able to get a stable interest rate on a mortgage."" The Bank of England ""left it far too late"" to raise interests rates in order to curb inflation, an expert who specialises in monetary policy has told BBC News. Patrick Reid, from the University of Cambridge, draws a comparison between the bank's current interest rate of 1.75% to the US Federal Reserve's decision last month to raise rates by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. He says if the BoE had decided to raise interest rates more and earlier then ""maybe we wouldn't have got into this stagflationary environment"". Stagflation is the term used to describe the damaging combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation. Andrew Bailey can blame energy and Russia, but he really needs to look inward at when he should have acted, which in my opinion should have been a lot sooner.  Economists have warned that the Bank of England could be forced to increase rates a
further half point as early as next month, bringing the tariff to 2.25%. 
James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said: âThe fact that the Bank
reiterated its willingness to act âforcefullyâ to curb inflation, we think
thereâs a strong possibility of another 50 basis point hike in September,
particularly if thatâs what both the Fed [in the US] and European Central
Bank end up doing too.â He added that the fact the Bank is increasing the pace of rate hikes, while also
forecasting a recession, demonstrates how worried it is that worker shortages
and supply issues could keep inflation high, even as the economy weakens. ""The Bank will want to see signs
that skill shortages are easing and that wage pressures are showing signs of
abating"" before stemming rate hikes, he suggested. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said ""all options"" are on the table for next month, although he stressed that policy is ""not on a pre-set path"". An economist has warned the decision to increase rates will not help with the cost of living crisis and could even ""exacerbate the risk of recession"". Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, tells BBC News that ""people who have already been squeezed will be hit"" by the Bank of England's decision. She also notes that millions of people are already ""having to borrow to get by"" as inflation drives prices higher. The Governor of the Bank of England has been speaking to the BBC, explaining the decision to raise interest rates. Andrew Bailey said that interest rates needed to rise in order to
control rising inflation, and despite his own predictions of a lengthy recession
starting later this year. Mr Bailey said that Russiaâs invasion was the cause
for the big increases in energy prices and that the Bank now predicted domestic
energy bills on average to rise up to Â£3,500 this October. He said that the Bankâs concern âis to ensure that this very big shock thatâs going
to hit inflation, thatâs going to hit people this winter doesnât then get
embedded in the system.â The Bank also revised its inflation forecast â it now says
inflation will hit 13%, its highest level for 42 years. Mr Bailey said âIâm
afraid if that does become embedded, the problem gets worse. ""We will have high
inflation for longer and the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates
even higher than we otherwise would do.â  The Bank of England has warned inflation could rise above 13% later this year. This is why the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has overwhelmingly voted to raise interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years. Although it's a big jump, interest rates are still currently at historically low levels. The Bank of England is predicting that the UK will fall into recession at the end of this year. But why does this matter? For most people, economic growth is good. It usually means there are more jobs, and companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also gives the government more money in taxes. So it can cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. How could a recession affect you? Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to get promotions, or a pay rise. Graduates and school leavers could find a first job harder to get. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many UK homeowners who kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. Mortgage interest payments for many fell considerably, leaving them with more spending money. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. Read more here. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Santander is one of the first big banks to publish its revised interest rates and, as usual, savers won't benefit from the full 0.5% increase. The bank will raise rates across some of its saver accounts and in-credit current accounts by 0.25%. For example its Junior ISA rate will increase from 1% to 1.25% from 2 September. Its current accounts that pay interest on credit balances will increase from 0.75% to 1% on 11 August. There's one exception where the full 0.5% rate will be applied: the Help to Buy ISA will increase from 0.75% to 1.25% from 2 September. Tracker and variable mortgage rates will climb 0.5% from 1 September. I'd expect other high street banks to introduce similar changes at similar times. The chief economist of a poverty charity has called today's recession forecast ""frightening"". Rebecca McDonald, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, told the BBC the news was worrying for many people, adding the situation was ""incredibly dire"". ""We know that by May this year over seven million low-income households had already had to go without an essential, so that means skipping a meal, skipping a shower, not being able to heat their home or heat their meal."" McDonald added a million people also had to go into extra debt to afford an essential meal. Today's news is a ""call to action"" for whoever is the next prime minister - and for the existing chancellor, she says. The Bank of England expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, after it raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%. This would make it the longest downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank blamed the slump largely on rising gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warning a typical energy bill will hit Â£3,500 in October. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey avoided getting drawn into commenting on Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss's plans for immediate tax cuts. Speaking at his earlier news conference he said it's ""not for the Bank of England to get involved"" in the Conservative Party leadership election. Mr Bailey said he looks forward ""to working with whoever the next prime minister is"" but also saids at this stage he would not comment ""on what might or might not happen"". Responding to the Bank of England's interest rate decision, Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has said she would enact an emergency Budget should she become the next prime minister. She says this would ""kickstart"" her plan to get the economy growing and ""offer immediate help to people struggling with their bills"". The foreign secretary says her plan is partly based on enacting ""supply side reforms"" - an economic theory that argues growing the supply of goods to a country leads to economic growth and often takes the form of lowering taxes, lowering borrowing rates (which the Bank of England has just raised), as well as deregulating industries. She denies her proposed tax cuts would be ""inflationary"", an attack levelled at her by her rival and former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. You cannot tax your way to growth. Business as usual will not do. Instead, we need a new approach on the economy, we need to challenge the failing economic orthodoxy and we need to deliver the necessary reform to tackle inflation and achieve sustainable growth.""  Rishi Sunak has said ""getting inflation under control as quickly as possible"" is one of the ""most urgent challenges"" the UK faces. Following the move by the Bank of England, the former chancellor and Tory leadership hopeful says it is ""imperative that any future government grips inflation, not exacerbates it"". He adds he would ""prioritise gripping inflation, growing the economy and then cutting taxes"" if he becomes the next prime minister Increasing borrowing will put upward pressure on interest rates, which will mean increased payments on people's mortgages. It will also make high inflation and high prices last for longer, making everyone poorer.""  If you're just joining us or want to catch up on what's been going on, here's what you need to know about the interest rates rise: Louise Parker and her husband have been saving to move home in Brighton since 2020, but they're having a major rethink. ""We've had to substantially reconsider the amount of money we can borrow, says Louise. They'd been hoping to move to a bigger house so they could start a family. But now they can only afford smaller houses, Louise says it's ""making us wonder whether we should bother moving at all"". ""Our options are either to stay put where we are or move to something about Â£200,000 cheaper than we had hoped."" And now they have the added question of how long to fix their rate if they move. ""We don't want to be stung after two years if rates have gone up even more, or have to downsize because we can no longer afford the repayments. ""It's just such an adjustment to have to think about interest rates. It's a new hurdle in the mix."" Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has responded to the Bank of England's announcement by saying he is ""confident"" the  UK can overcome the ""global challenges"" of rising inflation and recession predictions. Acknowledging that the forecasts will be ""concerning for many people"", Mr Zahawi says addressing the cost of living is a ""top priority"" for the government. He says the government has announced Â£37bn in support to help people with rising bills and prices, including ""direct payments of Â£1,200 to the most vulnerable families and a Â£400 discount on energy bills for everyone"". We are also taking important steps to get inflation under control through strong, independent monetary policy, responsible tax and spending decisions, and reforms to boost our productivity and growth.  The economy recovered strongly from the pandemic, with the fastest growth in the G7 last year, and Iâm confident that the action we are taking means we can also overcome these global challenges.

"Claire York launched an online appeal to help replace her parents' melted chocolate A community has come together to help the owners of a corner shop whose entire stock of chocolate melted. Ellis Stores in Scunthorpe lost about Â£1,000 worth of goods after its air conditioning failed to cope during the recent heatwave. An online appeal by Claire York, the daughter of the shop's owners Stephen and Linda Ellis, has raised more than Â£450 to replace the lost sweets. Ms York said her parents were ""so, so grateful"" for the donations. ""My mum has just cried,"" she said. ""For the whole week she just cried every time anybody's given any money, anybody's done anything."" The shop lost about Â£1,000 worth of chocolate during the heatwave The couple have run the independent shop on Cottage Beck Road for more than 24 years. Ms York said that due to excesses and the rise in insurance premiums it was not worth making a claim. ""My mum was literally ready to pack in, shut the door and just leave it all, bless her,"" she said. ""They've had a really tough couple of years with price rises and everything else, so this was like the tip of the iceberg really."" One regular customer said the couple ""do a great job with the community and the shop"". ""Everybody knows them,"" he said. ""I think it's great that they've put some money forward to help them when they lost the chocolate."" Chocolate expert Jenny Culver, course manager at Bettys cookery school in Harrogate, said: ""Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature variations. ""From a scientific point of view, the crystals which make it perform as it does get confused about what state they are in and it becomes unstable."" Ms Culver said premium chocolate was more stable than our supermarket favourites due to its higher cocoa butter content. However, she said all chocolate needed to be stored at room temperature, away from direct heat sources and sunlight. Not doing so risked reducing its shelf life, she added. So, can you reset or freeze a melted chocolate bar? ""It just wouldn't be the same"", Ms Culver said. ""Much of the aroma and taste would be lost. In a really bad state it can be crumbly,"" she added. What can you do with your chocolate in an emergency situation? ""Sit in the corner and suck it out of the packet, or if it happens in the hot weather, add cream to make a lovely chocolate sauce to go over ice cream, or a thicker version to dunk biscuits in,"" Ms Culver said.

"A section of a path leading up to the famous Edinburgh skyline walk will be fenced to protect walkers from a bull Fencing is to be installed on a path in the Pentland Hills after safety fears were raised over the presence of a bull in a field where walkers have previously been attacked by cows. The path on Turnhouse Hill is a right of way which leads to the popular Edinburgh skyline walk. The land's owner, Scotland's Rural College, said it had already removed the herd of cows from the lower slopes. Now it plans to fence off a corridor of the field containing the bull. It has been living in the field for more than a month, with a warning sign on the path gate. James Gentles is an experienced walker who has climbed all 282 Munros Some walkers have risked walking through the field, which does not have an alternative route around it, while others have turned back. When BBC Scotland raised the concerns with the college, it said it would build a fence before the end of the summer. James Gentles, from Edinburgh, said he was shocked and upset a bull had replaced the herd which had attacked him in October 2020. The 61-year-old needed stitches after being charged by a cow on the same route. Path may be rerouted after fourth attack by cows Runner attacked by charging cow in Pentland Hills He said it was the ""premier path"" in the regional park, and was very popular with walkers. ""Cows and bulls can't read signs, so it's not going to stop walkers being attacked,"" he said. ""It's not the cows' fault or the walkers' fault. ""I am therefore relieved they are now going to fence that section of the path from the bull."" There are also bulls in other nearby fields in the regional park Mark Hartree was also crushed by a cow at the same spot in September 2020. A spokesperson for Scotland's Rural College said it took safety at its farm operations very seriously. It said it had taken steps in 2020 to keep cattle ""entirely separate"" from the area's main right of way to safeguard public access. Since then, signs had been installed at ""appropriate times"" to notify walkers about the potential presence of bulls among livestock in fields. ""However, these arrangements remain under continuous review. We want walkers to continue to feel welcome and understand the signage we use,"" it said. ""We are therefore carrying out further works this summer to ensure that any small remaining potential for direct contact between people and cattle is removed through the construction of a short, fenced corridor. This will secure easy access to the rights of way all year round."" A Scottish government spokesman said that if there was a bull in a field, the public was expected to go into a neighbouring field or on to adjacent land. ""Land managers are urged to keep animals known to be dangerous away from fields crossed by a core path or other well-used route,"" he added. ""If this is not possible, land managers should inform the public and signpost a reasonable alternative route.""

"Sunak and Truss spoke at the All Nations Centre in Cardiff Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have attacked Mark Drakeford and his Welsh Labour government at a Tory leadership hustings. Frontrunner Ms Truss accused the first minister of being a ""low energy version"" of Jeremy Corbyn who was ""ashamed of our history"". Meanwhile Mr Sunak said he would be an ""activist prime minister"" who would call out ""failures of devolution"". The pair answered questions from party members in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales that he did not have time to watch the event and had ""only seen reports of it"". But, interviewed by Newyddion S4C, he said: ""Of course, the two contestants were welcome to make one of their rare visits to Wales and there's nothing that I could say about either of them that they haven't already said about each other."" In his opening speech, the former chancellor attacked plans for more Senedd members in Cardiff Bay, saying money should be spent on cost of living issues instead. He said a Welsh governmentfreeze on road building projects, which ministers say is necessary to reduce carbon emissions, would cause ""enormous economic self harm"". Rishi Sunak said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister Mr Sunak attacked Welsh Labour's record, saying that ""in spite of receiving 20% more funding, here in Wales waiting lists are the worse in the United Kingdom"". He indicated he was opposed to more devolution for the Senedd and said he would be an ""activist prime minister when it comes to Wales"". He said: ""We need to be more prepared to call out the failures of the devolved government here, because this path of onward devolution has not worked in actually delivering better health care and education"". Mr Sunak added: ""If the UK government is sending billions of pounds over to Wales, and it's being squandered, it's not being spent properly, and children are not being taught properly in schools and people are waiting unacceptably long for health care treatment, we need to call that out and we need to make sure we improve it."" Liz Truss said Mark Drakeford was ""ashamed of our history"" In her speech, Ms Truss said: ""The fact is that there are too many people in this country who are ashamed of our history, who talk our country down, who say the best days are behind us. They are completely wrong. ""I'm afraid one of them is Mark Drakeford."" ""Whether it's stopping the M4 relief road, whether it's whacking a tax on our tourist industry, I will crack down on his negativity about Wales, and about the United Kingdom."" Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss for Tory leadership When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss promised to change the Treasury's funding formula to get investment ""into places that have been left behind"". ""We need to help level up our country,"" she said, ""and you know that there are parts of Wales where it's very difficult to get a mobile phone signal, it's very difficult to get broadband. ""It's difficult to get on a train that goes anywhere very fast - and in particular, north Wales has been left behind."" She said she would build the M4 Relief Road. The project was ditched by the Welsh government, which has responsibility for motorways in Wales,in 2019. A small group of climate change protesters greeted arriving Conservatives at the All Nations Centre ahead of the event. If your question was whether Rishi Sunak will devolve more powers to the Welsh Parliament as prime minister, it seems clear he will not. He told Tory members - often assumed to be more devo-sceptic than some of their elected members in Cardiff Bay - that the answer to problems in Wales was ""not more devolution"", and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete - but he said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister - the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was where she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS - which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival.

Frontrunner Ms Truss accused the first minister of being a ""low energy version"" of Jeremy Corbyn who was ""ashamed of our history"". Meanwhile Mr Sunak said he would be an ""activist prime minister"" who would call out ""failures of devolution"". The pair answered questions from party members in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales that he did not have time to watch the event and had ""only seen reports of it"". But, interviewed by Newyddion S4C, he said: ""Of course, the two contestants were welcome to make one of their rare visits to Wales and there's nothing that I could say about either of them that they haven't already said about each other."" In his opening speech, the former chancellor attacked plans for more Senedd members in Cardiff Bay, saying money should be spent on cost of living issues instead. He said a Welsh governmentfreeze on road building projects, which ministers say is necessary to reduce carbon emissions, would cause ""enormous economic self harm"". Rishi Sunak said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister Mr Sunak attacked Welsh Labour's record, saying that ""in spite of receiving 20% more funding, here in Wales waiting lists are the worse in the United Kingdom"". He indicated he was opposed to more devolution for the Senedd and said he would be an ""activist prime minister when it comes to Wales"". He said: ""We need to be more prepared to call out the failures of the devolved government here, because this path of onward devolution has not worked in actually delivering better health care and education"". Mr Sunak added: ""If the UK government is sending billions of pounds over to Wales, and it's being squandered, it's not being spent properly, and children are not being taught properly in schools and people are waiting unacceptably long for health care treatment, we need to call that out and we need to make sure we improve it."" Liz Truss said Mark Drakeford was ""ashamed of our history"" In her speech, Ms Truss said: ""The fact is that there are too many people in this country who are ashamed of our history, who talk our country down, who say the best days are behind us. They are completely wrong. ""I'm afraid one of them is Mark Drakeford."" ""Whether it's stopping the M4 relief road, whether it's whacking a tax on our tourist industry, I will crack down on his negativity about Wales, and about the United Kingdom."" Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss for Tory leadership When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss promised to change the Treasury's funding formula to get investment ""into places that have been left behind"". ""We need to help level up our country,"" she said, ""and you know that there are parts of Wales where it's very difficult to get a mobile phone signal, it's very difficult to get broadband. ""It's difficult to get on a train that goes anywhere very fast - and in particular, north Wales has been left behind."" She said she would build the M4 Relief Road. The project was ditched by the Welsh government, which has responsibility for motorways in Wales,in 2019. A small group of climate change protesters greeted arriving Conservatives at the All Nations Centre ahead of the event. If your question was whether Rishi Sunak will devolve more powers to the Welsh Parliament as prime minister, it seems clear he will not. He told Tory members - often assumed to be more devo-sceptic than some of their elected members in Cardiff Bay - that the answer to problems in Wales was ""not more devolution"", and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete - but he said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister - the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was where she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS - which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival.

"Assembly members are meeting following a recall petition, spearheaded by the SDLP A third attempt to elect a new Speaker at Stormont and allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to function fully again has failed. Assembly members met following a recall petition, spearheaded by the SDLP, which wanted a debate on the cost of living crisis. The DUP refuses to nominate a Speaker over issues withthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP leader said recalling the assembly would not solve the problem. But the SDLP said ""basic governance"" must return. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill says the DUP is ""punishing the public"" by its ""refusal to govern"" The Protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means checks on some items which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties are opposed to it, saying it undermines Northern Ireland's position in the UK. ControversialUK government legislationaimed at giving the government powers to override parts of the Protocol is making its way through Westminster. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie nominated party colleague Mike Nesbitt and the SDLP's Matthew O'Toole nominated his colleague Patsy McGlone as Speaker. This video can not be played The DUP's Brian Kingston says the recall of the Stormont assembly ""was stunt politics"" However, both bids failed. Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara said he was disappointed that the assembly had failed to elect a speaker. Hetweeted,external: ""People expect and deserve the Executive to be formed as soon as possible to address issues affecting everyone in Northern Ireland, including the rising cost of living."" Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the DUP's ""continued boycott of these institutions and their failure to accept the democratic outcome of the election"" were denying people ""the representation which they are entitled to and which they deserve"". ""It's totally unacceptable, it is untenable and it cannot continue,"" she added. Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain She said the DUP were the ""only party that are blocking and preventing the executive being formed, preventing the executive meeting that would allow us to distribute money to help workers and families"". ""So let me say to you, even at this late hour today, workers need help, families need help, businesses need help and you're continuing to punish the public that we're elected to serve by your continued refusal to govern with the rest of us."" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member Brian Kingston dismissed the assembly recall as ""stunt politics"". ""These proceedings are not a genuine attempt by the parties opposite to restore the political institutions, rather they demonstrate a wilful disregard for the views of unionists and the principle of power sharing itself in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Mr Kingston said the Northern Ireland Protocol had caused a ""deep fracture in our politics"". He said the party would be ""condition-led and not calendar-led"". At the same time, he made it clear that when its conditions were met, the DUP would be prepared to nominate a deputy first minister. The Stormont institutions have been in flux since February when the DUPwithdrew from the first minister role in protest over the part of the 2019 Brexit deal known as the protocol. Amid all of the words spoken during the 90-minute debate, one adjective stood out: ""undiminished"". The DUP's Brian Kingston said that if his party was to return to the power-sharing executive at Stormont, the Westminster bill to override the Protocol must emerge from Parliament ""undiminished"", in other words, without any amendments. It is clearly a DUP pre-condition. The other appears to be a commitment from the next prime minister that once he or she gets the power to override the Protocol, it will be used immediately. Diminished means reduced, lessened, made weaker. That is certainly the current state of the assembly, as all eyes now focus on Westminster and Downing Street. Since then, there has been an assembly election and two recall petitions. Sinn FÃ©in became the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time following May's election, with 27 seats, pushing the DUP into second place. The election cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the Protocol, including Sinn FÃ©in. However, overall unionists still hold the most seats in the assembly. During Wednesday's debate, the SDLP's Matthew O'Toole pointed to the cost of living. ""How long do they [people] have to wait, struggling to put food on the table, struggling to afford the cost of school uniforms and apprehensive about this winter? ""They said the Protocol Bill's passage would lead to a graduated response, it's passed the Commons, what now?"" Unionist parties in Northern Ireland are all opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol Alliance assembly member Patrick Brown called for reform to ""put an end to ransom politics"". He said it was no longer tenable for one party to be able to block the formation of an assembly and executive. ""Until this place can operate in a mature and democratic fashion, our ability to deal with situations like the cost-of-living crisis will continue to be curtailed,"" he said. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said many assembly members did not want to face ""reality"" that the Protocol was incompatible with Northern Ireland's constitutional position as an ""integral part of the United Kingdom"". ""The very same people who yesterday and in recent days were effusive in respect of Lord David Trimble, consciously and deliberately ignore the very telling of Lord Trimble about the Protocol when he said that the Protocol has ripped the heart out of the Belfast Agreement,"" he said. Stormont uses a system of government known as power sharing People Before Profit's Gerry Carroll said the DUP had shown themselves to be ""completely and utterly self-serving in their approach to politics"". ""They are wilfully ignoring the plight of the vast majority of people here who are struggling to keep their heads above water due to spiralling costs and political inaction,"" he said. Earlier, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he could not provide a timetable on when the Stormont Executive would be restored. ""The sooner we can get to a solution on the Protocol, the sooner we will see the cross-community consensus restored that is necessary to operate the political institutions in Northern Ireland,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. Sir Jeffrey said he recognised getting a ""fully-functioning executive and assembly was important for everyone in Northern Ireland"" but he wanted to ensure the foundations for that were ""sound"". The comments come as the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the Northern Ireland Protocolhad given the region's economy a temporary boost. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Northern Ireland Protocol Bill passes Commons An assembly Speaker can only be elected with support from a majority of unionist and nationalist members. Without a Speaker in place, there can be no nomination of first and deputy first ministers, meaning the assembly cannot function. The DUP has previously said it wants to see ""clear progress"" on thegovernment's controversial protocol billin Parliament first, before it would consider supporting the election of a Speaker. The bill passed the House of Commons in July but now must be debated in the House of Lords.

"Household energy bills will change every three months under new plans aimed at avoiding price shocks. Currently, the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge their customers in England, Scotland and Wales - changes every six months. Energy regulator Ofgem says the change means price rises and falls will be passed on to customers more quickly. Energy bills soared in April and are expected to rise sharply again in October, when the cap goes up. Ofgem said customers ""face a very challenging winter ahead"" and acknowledged the situation was ""deeply worrying"" for many people. In May, Ofgem said the typical household should expect to see an Â£800 increase to Â£2,800 a year, but it now says prices are looking higher than when it made that estimate. Industry analysts Cornwall Insight saidthe typical household was likely to pay Â£3,358 a year from October, then Â£3,615 a year from January - up from its previous estimate. In October 2021 the average bill was Â£1,400 a year. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, buthouseholds there have also seen bills rise. Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Ofgem said updating the price cap more regularly would also help energy suppliers better predict how much energy they need to purchase for their customers. This in turn could help reduce the risk of more suppliers failing. Since early last year, more than 30 UK energy companies have failed after firms found themselves unable to pass on the full cost of soaring wholesale gas prices to their customers because of the price cap. ""Today's change will go some way to provide the stability needed in the energy market, reducing the risk of further large-scale supplier failures which cause huge disruption and push up costs for consumers. It is not in anyone's interests for more suppliers to fail and exit the market,"" said Ofgem. Energy minister Greg Hands said: ""It makes sense for the cap to be adjusted at a reasonable frequency. ""If energy prices were to start to fall people would see those benefits more quickly."" But Simon Francis, of the campaign group End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the decision was ""simply inhumane"". ""Ultimately, this decision will force more people into fuel poverty in the middle of winter, causing additional stress on the NHS and it may ultimately lead to increased levels of excess winter deaths this year,"" he said. ""Only a full programme of emergency financial support, a rapid expansion of energy efficiency programmes and a commitment to bringing more cheap renewable energy on stream will help people stay warm this winter and into the future.""

You can also get in touch viaWhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,externalandTwitter:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external The energy price cap introduced in 2018 is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for their electricity and gas. It sets a maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and caps the level of profits an energy supplier can make. The cap has already been increased - demand for gas rose after Covid restrictions eased then prices soared again following the war in Ukraine. Russia is one of the world's biggest gas producers and has already cut supplies to some European countries. Meanwhile, Western nations have also moved to phase out Russian imports in response to the invasion. This has increased demand for other sources of energy, increasing global prices. Ofgem warned this mean the price cap, which will be published at the end of August, would rise again, but by changing it every three months any reductions in wholesale prices would be passed on more quickly to customers. It said paying a rate that is up to six months out of date in the current changeable market was ""no longer sustainable and could mean either consumers paying too much for months if wholesale prices have fallen or suppliers left unable to supply gas with the money they are allowed to charge if prices have risen"". Ofgem says it wants to cut the lag-time between wholesale price changes and the amount customers are charged which would limit the risk of suppliers going bust and pass on potential savings to consumers more quickly. So when wholesale prices are going down that will mean you're not having to wait months before that money is taken off your bills - so far so good. But the flip side is also true - and that's the position we're in right now. When wholesale prices are going up that will get added onto customer's bills more quickly. That means sharper, more frequent shocks for the next while as analysts aren't expecting global energy prices to drop any time soon. More frequent changes will make it more difficult to budget as prices will change every three months, and there's less time for suppliers to inform customers of changes, so increases really will come as a shock to some. So don't bank on this change saving you any money right now. As we head into the most difficult winter for a generation in terms of living costs, more than three quarters of households in Britain now face an energy price rise in January too, when people can least afford it.

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates again from 1.25% to 1.75% as it battles to curb rising prices The increase is the biggest in 27 years and will increase pressure on households already struggling with the cost of living Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, blamed Russia for the high energy prices which are pushing up inflation It makes mortgages and loans more expensive but increases the return on savings Inflation, the rate at which prices grow, is expected to rise even further this year, peaking at 13% in October The UK is expected to fall into recession - which means the economy is shrinking - in the final three months of this year Edited by Chris Giles Your live page writers were Emily McGarvey, Jack Burgess, Catherine Evans, Oliver Slow, Victoria Lindrea, Aoife Walsh and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Andrew Humphrey, Shanaz Musafer and Chris Giles. We'll be closing today's live page on the Bank of England interest rate hike shortly. But before we go here are the key headlines of the day:  This video can not be played Andrew Bailey on Bank of England interest rate rise warning More now from the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, who tells the BBC that the UK has been hit by a severe shock thanks to soaring energy prices - which he blames on Russia. He says the increase in gas prices since May has had ""a very big impact.. that is passing through directly into inflation. ""It will have an effect on the economy, and, yes, we are forecasting a recession,"" he adds. ""The really blunt message I have to give, is if that does become more embedded and the problem gets worse, we will have high inflation for longer and the Bank of England will have to raise rates even higher,"" the governor concludes. Labour has urged the government to scrap tax breaks on oil and gas companies in order to provide more help to the public with rising bills. Shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden says the Bank of England's forecasts show ""how hard this crisis is hitting families"". He adds that it also demonstrates ""how much is left to come"" as the situation worsens and ""how vulnerable 12 years of economic mismanagement by the Conservatives has left us"". The government must act fast if we are going to avoid one of the worst recessions since the 1990s, by scrapping tax breaks on oil and gas producers and providing more help to people who are struggling to pay their energy bills.""  A rise in interest rates isn't bad news for everyone. Edmund Wood is saving to buy a home close to London, so hopes a rate rise will help his deposit grow more quickly. ""An increase in interest rates is good for me,"" he says. ""I've been worried about rising property prices - they have climbed every month for the last 12 months in a row. ""That wouldn't be good if I was ready to buy now, but in two years when I've saved up during a period of increasing interest rates, hopefully house prices will fall again, which will leave me in a better position to buy. ""Also hopefully by then interest rates will have stabilised somewhat, meaning I'll be able to get a stable interest rate on a mortgage."" The Bank of England ""left it far too late"" to raise interests rates in order to curb inflation, an expert who specialises in monetary policy has told BBC News. Patrick Reid, from the University of Cambridge, draws a comparison between the bank's current interest rate of 1.75% to the US Federal Reserve's decision last month to raise rates by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. He says if the BoE had decided to raise interest rates more and earlier then ""maybe we wouldn't have got into this stagflationary environment"". Stagflation is the term used to describe the damaging combination of a stagnating economy and high inflation. Andrew Bailey can blame energy and Russia, but he really needs to look inward at when he should have acted, which in my opinion should have been a lot sooner.  Economists have warned that the Bank of England could be forced to increase rates a
further half point as early as next month, bringing the tariff to 2.25%. 
James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said: âThe fact that the Bank
reiterated its willingness to act âforcefullyâ to curb inflation, we think
thereâs a strong possibility of another 50 basis point hike in September,
particularly if thatâs what both the Fed [in the US] and European Central
Bank end up doing too.â He added that the fact the Bank is increasing the pace of rate hikes, while also
forecasting a recession, demonstrates how worried it is that worker shortages
and supply issues could keep inflation high, even as the economy weakens. ""The Bank will want to see signs
that skill shortages are easing and that wage pressures are showing signs of
abating"" before stemming rate hikes, he suggested. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said ""all options"" are on the table for next month, although he stressed that policy is ""not on a pre-set path"". An economist has warned the decision to increase rates will not help with the cost of living crisis and could even ""exacerbate the risk of recession"". Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, tells BBC News that ""people who have already been squeezed will be hit"" by the Bank of England's decision. She also notes that millions of people are already ""having to borrow to get by"" as inflation drives prices higher. The Governor of the Bank of England has been speaking to the BBC, explaining the decision to raise interest rates. Andrew Bailey said that interest rates needed to rise in order to
control rising inflation, and despite his own predictions of a lengthy recession
starting later this year. Mr Bailey said that Russiaâs invasion was the cause
for the big increases in energy prices and that the Bank now predicted domestic
energy bills on average to rise up to Â£3,500 this October. He said that the Bankâs concern âis to ensure that this very big shock thatâs going
to hit inflation, thatâs going to hit people this winter doesnât then get
embedded in the system.â The Bank also revised its inflation forecast â it now says
inflation will hit 13%, its highest level for 42 years. Mr Bailey said âIâm
afraid if that does become embedded, the problem gets worse. ""We will have high
inflation for longer and the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates
even higher than we otherwise would do.â  The Bank of England has warned inflation could rise above 13% later this year. This is why the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has overwhelmingly voted to raise interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75% - the biggest rise in 27 years. Although it's a big jump, interest rates are still currently at historically low levels. The Bank of England is predicting that the UK will fall into recession at the end of this year. But why does this matter? For most people, economic growth is good. It usually means there are more jobs, and companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also gives the government more money in taxes. So it can cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. How could a recession affect you? Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to get promotions, or a pay rise. Graduates and school leavers could find a first job harder to get. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many UK homeowners who kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. Mortgage interest payments for many fell considerably, leaving them with more spending money. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. Read more here. Simon ReadPersonal Finance Reporter Santander is one of the first big banks to publish its revised interest rates and, as usual, savers won't benefit from the full 0.5% increase. The bank will raise rates across some of its saver accounts and in-credit current accounts by 0.25%. For example its Junior ISA rate will increase from 1% to 1.25% from 2 September. Its current accounts that pay interest on credit balances will increase from 0.75% to 1% on 11 August. There's one exception where the full 0.5% rate will be applied: the Help to Buy ISA will increase from 0.75% to 1.25% from 2 September. Tracker and variable mortgage rates will climb 0.5% from 1 September. I'd expect other high street banks to introduce similar changes at similar times. The chief economist of a poverty charity has called today's recession forecast ""frightening"". Rebecca McDonald, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, told the BBC the news was worrying for many people, adding the situation was ""incredibly dire"". ""We know that by May this year over seven million low-income households had already had to go without an essential, so that means skipping a meal, skipping a shower, not being able to heat their home or heat their meal."" McDonald added a million people also had to go into extra debt to afford an essential meal. Today's news is a ""call to action"" for whoever is the next prime minister - and for the existing chancellor, she says. The Bank of England expects the economy to shrink in the final three months of this year and keep shrinking until the end of 2023, after it raised interest rates from 1.25% to 1.75%. This would make it the longest downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank blamed the slump largely on rising gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warning a typical energy bill will hit Â£3,500 in October. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey avoided getting drawn into commenting on Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss's plans for immediate tax cuts. Speaking at his earlier news conference he said it's ""not for the Bank of England to get involved"" in the Conservative Party leadership election. Mr Bailey said he looks forward ""to working with whoever the next prime minister is"" but also saids at this stage he would not comment ""on what might or might not happen"". Responding to the Bank of England's interest rate decision, Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has said she would enact an emergency Budget should she become the next prime minister. She says this would ""kickstart"" her plan to get the economy growing and ""offer immediate help to people struggling with their bills"". The foreign secretary says her plan is partly based on enacting ""supply side reforms"" - an economic theory that argues growing the supply of goods to a country leads to economic growth and often takes the form of lowering taxes, lowering borrowing rates (which the Bank of England has just raised), as well as deregulating industries. She denies her proposed tax cuts would be ""inflationary"", an attack levelled at her by her rival and former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. You cannot tax your way to growth. Business as usual will not do. Instead, we need a new approach on the economy, we need to challenge the failing economic orthodoxy and we need to deliver the necessary reform to tackle inflation and achieve sustainable growth.""  Rishi Sunak has said ""getting inflation under control as quickly as possible"" is one of the ""most urgent challenges"" the UK faces. Following the move by the Bank of England, the former chancellor and Tory leadership hopeful says it is ""imperative that any future government grips inflation, not exacerbates it"". He adds he would ""prioritise gripping inflation, growing the economy and then cutting taxes"" if he becomes the next prime minister Increasing borrowing will put upward pressure on interest rates, which will mean increased payments on people's mortgages. It will also make high inflation and high prices last for longer, making everyone poorer.""  If you're just joining us or want to catch up on what's been going on, here's what you need to know about the interest rates rise: Louise Parker and her husband have been saving to move home in Brighton since 2020, but they're having a major rethink. ""We've had to substantially reconsider the amount of money we can borrow, says Louise. They'd been hoping to move to a bigger house so they could start a family. But now they can only afford smaller houses, Louise says it's ""making us wonder whether we should bother moving at all"". ""Our options are either to stay put where we are or move to something about Â£200,000 cheaper than we had hoped."" And now they have the added question of how long to fix their rate if they move. ""We don't want to be stung after two years if rates have gone up even more, or have to downsize because we can no longer afford the repayments. ""It's just such an adjustment to have to think about interest rates. It's a new hurdle in the mix."" Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has responded to the Bank of England's announcement by saying he is ""confident"" the  UK can overcome the ""global challenges"" of rising inflation and recession predictions. Acknowledging that the forecasts will be ""concerning for many people"", Mr Zahawi says addressing the cost of living is a ""top priority"" for the government. He says the government has announced Â£37bn in support to help people with rising bills and prices, including ""direct payments of Â£1,200 to the most vulnerable families and a Â£400 discount on energy bills for everyone"". We are also taking important steps to get inflation under control through strong, independent monetary policy, responsible tax and spending decisions, and reforms to boost our productivity and growth.  The economy recovered strongly from the pandemic, with the fastest growth in the G7 last year, and Iâm confident that the action we are taking means we can also overcome these global challenges.

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

"Antonio Guterres says governments should embrace a special tax on energy company profits UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for oil and gas companies to face special taxes. His comments come as surging energy prices sparked by the war in Ukraine push industry profits to new highs. Mr Guterres said it was ""immoral"" for firms to be profiting from the crisis. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February has worsened a global shortage of oil and gas, disrupting access to oil and gas from Russia - a major supplier - and driving prices higher. While households are grappling with higher energy bills, companies are reaping the benefits. BP recently reported its largest profit in 14 years, whileShell's profits in the April-to-June period hit a record. Together, four of the biggest energy firms - Exxon, Chevron, Shell and TotalEnergies - earned nearly $51bn in the most recent quarter - almost double what they made in the same period last year. How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise ""This grotesque greed is punishing the poorest and most vulnerable people, while destroying our only common home,"" Mr Guterres said. ""I urge all governments to tax these excessive profits, and use the funds to support the most vulnerable people through these difficult times."" Last month, the UK approved a 25% 'windfall tax' on energy firms, a one-off levy the government says will raise some Â£25bn to help offset household energy bills, which have spiked. Some other countries, such as Italy, have imposed similar measures. But French lawmakers recently rejected such a move, and there is little political momentum in the US, despite a windfall tax proposal from some members of Congress. Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president for oil and gas lobby group the American Petroleum Institute, said calls for a windfall tax were misguided. ""Policymakers should be focused on increasing energy supply and reducing costs for Americans. Imposing new taxes on our industry will do the exact opposite and only discourage investment at a time when it's needed most,"" he said. Mr Guterres warned that high energy prices would have wide ranging consequences, as households and governments around the world buckle under the pressure. ""Many developing countries - drowning in debt, without access to finance, and struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic - could go over the brink,"" he said. ""We are already seeing the warning signs of a wave of economic, social and political upheaval that would leave no country untouched.""

"Claire York launched an online appeal to help replace her parents' melted chocolate A community has come together to help the owners of a corner shop whose entire stock of chocolate melted. Ellis Stores in Scunthorpe lost about Â£1,000 worth of goods after its air conditioning failed to cope during the recent heatwave. An online appeal by Claire York, the daughter of the shop's owners Stephen and Linda Ellis, has raised more than Â£450 to replace the lost sweets. Ms York said her parents were ""so, so grateful"" for the donations. ""My mum has just cried,"" she said. ""For the whole week she just cried every time anybody's given any money, anybody's done anything."" The shop lost about Â£1,000 worth of chocolate during the heatwave The couple have run the independent shop on Cottage Beck Road for more than 24 years. Ms York said that due to excesses and the rise in insurance premiums it was not worth making a claim. ""My mum was literally ready to pack in, shut the door and just leave it all, bless her,"" she said. ""They've had a really tough couple of years with price rises and everything else, so this was like the tip of the iceberg really."" One regular customer said the couple ""do a great job with the community and the shop"". ""Everybody knows them,"" he said. ""I think it's great that they've put some money forward to help them when they lost the chocolate."" Chocolate expert Jenny Culver, course manager at Bettys cookery school in Harrogate, said: ""Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature variations. ""From a scientific point of view, the crystals which make it perform as it does get confused about what state they are in and it becomes unstable."" Ms Culver said premium chocolate was more stable than our supermarket favourites due to its higher cocoa butter content. However, she said all chocolate needed to be stored at room temperature, away from direct heat sources and sunlight. Not doing so risked reducing its shelf life, she added. So, can you reset or freeze a melted chocolate bar? ""It just wouldn't be the same"", Ms Culver said. ""Much of the aroma and taste would be lost. In a really bad state it can be crumbly,"" she added. What can you do with your chocolate in an emergency situation? ""Sit in the corner and suck it out of the packet, or if it happens in the hot weather, add cream to make a lovely chocolate sauce to go over ice cream, or a thicker version to dunk biscuits in,"" Ms Culver said.

"Sunak and Truss spoke at the All Nations Centre in Cardiff Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have attacked Mark Drakeford and his Welsh Labour government at a Tory leadership hustings. Frontrunner Ms Truss accused the first minister of being a ""low energy version"" of Jeremy Corbyn who was ""ashamed of our history"". Meanwhile Mr Sunak said he would be an ""activist prime minister"" who would call out ""failures of devolution"". The pair answered questions from party members in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales that he did not have time to watch the event and had ""only seen reports of it"". But, interviewed by Newyddion S4C, he said: ""Of course, the two contestants were welcome to make one of their rare visits to Wales and there's nothing that I could say about either of them that they haven't already said about each other."" In his opening speech, the former chancellor attacked plans for more Senedd members in Cardiff Bay, saying money should be spent on cost of living issues instead. He said a Welsh governmentfreeze on road building projects, which ministers say is necessary to reduce carbon emissions, would cause ""enormous economic self harm"". Rishi Sunak said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister Mr Sunak attacked Welsh Labour's record, saying that ""in spite of receiving 20% more funding, here in Wales waiting lists are the worse in the United Kingdom"". He indicated he was opposed to more devolution for the Senedd and said he would be an ""activist prime minister when it comes to Wales"". He said: ""We need to be more prepared to call out the failures of the devolved government here, because this path of onward devolution has not worked in actually delivering better health care and education"". Mr Sunak added: ""If the UK government is sending billions of pounds over to Wales, and it's being squandered, it's not being spent properly, and children are not being taught properly in schools and people are waiting unacceptably long for health care treatment, we need to call that out and we need to make sure we improve it."" Liz Truss said Mark Drakeford was ""ashamed of our history"" In her speech, Ms Truss said: ""The fact is that there are too many people in this country who are ashamed of our history, who talk our country down, who say the best days are behind us. They are completely wrong. ""I'm afraid one of them is Mark Drakeford."" ""Whether it's stopping the M4 relief road, whether it's whacking a tax on our tourist industry, I will crack down on his negativity about Wales, and about the United Kingdom."" Sajid Javid endorses Liz Truss for Tory leadership When will we know who the new PM is? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss promised to change the Treasury's funding formula to get investment ""into places that have been left behind"". ""We need to help level up our country,"" she said, ""and you know that there are parts of Wales where it's very difficult to get a mobile phone signal, it's very difficult to get broadband. ""It's difficult to get on a train that goes anywhere very fast - and in particular, north Wales has been left behind."" She said she would build the M4 Relief Road. The project was ditched by the Welsh government, which has responsibility for motorways in Wales,in 2019. A small group of climate change protesters greeted arriving Conservatives at the All Nations Centre ahead of the event. If your question was whether Rishi Sunak will devolve more powers to the Welsh Parliament as prime minister, it seems clear he will not. He told Tory members - often assumed to be more devo-sceptic than some of their elected members in Cardiff Bay - that the answer to problems in Wales was ""not more devolution"", and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete - but he said he would be an ""activist"" prime minister - the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was where she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS - which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival.
