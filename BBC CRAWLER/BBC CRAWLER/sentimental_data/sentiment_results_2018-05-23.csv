"A man has been arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts, the Metropolitan Police has said. The 19-year-old was arrested in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on Wednesday at 18:57 BST. An address in the town is being searched, and the man is being questioned at a south London police station. Police say the activity is connected to the arrest of an 18-year-old man by armed police in north London on Friday. The 18-year-old man remains in custody, and a 20-year-old woman was also arrested in south London for failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn is on his first trip to NI since becoming Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC that if he is prime minister the UK government would take a neutral position in any border poll campaign. He said he was not asking for or advocating a border poll, but would ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented ""to the letter"". Mr Corbyn is on his first trip to NI since becoming Labour leader. He also used his speech at Queen's University in Belfast to argue that Brexit must not lead to a hard border. The leader of the opposition told his audience he was not asking for a border poll, but in an interview with the BBC he was asked how a Corbyn government would handle such a campaign if it happened on his watch. ""It's within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement that such a poll could be held if there was a willingness to do so, at that point you don't stand in its way, but it is within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and I think the UK government should be neutral in that respect,"" he replied. David Cameron campaigned for the union in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum David Cameron's Conservative government campaigned for Scotland to remain in the UK ahead of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, but Mr Corbyn said he would not take that approach. ""I think there has to be a decision within terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we're dealing with conjectures here, we're quite a long way off from any of this. ""We would be ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is carried out to the letter."" Much of his speech at Queen's University focused on Brexit, arguing that it must not be allowed to damage the fragile political settlement in Northern Ireland. He also said there should not be a border in the Irish Sea. ""Let me be clear, Labour will not support any Brexit deal that includes the return of a hard border to this island,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""We are also clear there must be no effective border created in the Irish Sea either. ""That is why Labour has put forward a plan that would go a long way to solving this issue, a plan for which I believe there is a majority in Westminster."" TheUK and EU have agreed that there will be no hard border, but are at odds on how to achieve that. A major sticking point is what arrangement will be put in place if the border cannot be solved in an overall deal. The two sides accept the need for a 'backstop', but differ on how it should work. Mr Corbyn suggested that Labour's proposal for a new comprehensive EU-UK customs union has the potential to prevent communities in Northern Ireland being divided. The Labour leader also argued that maintaining an open border is not just about avoiding paperwork or tariffs. It also has symbolic significance, he said. ""An open border is a symbol of peace, two communities living and working together after years of conflict, communities who no longer feel that their traditions are under threat,"" Mr Corbyn said. Mr Corbyn also said a solution must be found to end the deadlock at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, whenpower-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. He called for the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIC) to be revived in order to help make progress. ""The British and Irish governments met many times during the last impasse - it seems to me a sensible way forward,"" he told the BBC. ""We must step up to find a creative solution in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement that avoids a return to direct Westminster rule,"" Mr Corbyn commented. What is the BIIC? Conveningthe  BIIC is favoured by nationalists, but opposed by the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) who regard it as a ""talking shop"". During Mr Corbyn's two-day visit to Northern Ireland, he will also meet business leaders in Belfast and Londonderry to discuss their concerns around Brexit. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Politics Reporter The welcome Jeremy Corbyn received at Queen's University was almost as warm as the weather. His speech was interrupted by rounds of applause from the audience several times, notably when he paid tribute to Mo Mowlam - the late Northern Ireland secretary - for her role in the Northern Ireland peace process. The speech did not make reference to a border poll, but afterwards Mr Corbyn was asked if he would support such a move if elected prime minister, by an A-Level student sitting her politics exam this afternoon. Mr Corbyn wished the student good luck and said if that was the desire of the majority of people, then it would happen under the terms set out in the Good Friday Agreement, but that he was not asking or advocating for it. His trip so far has not been without criticism as the DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell accused Mr Corbyn of snubbing a request to meet with IRA victims. Labour said it hadn't received enough notice, but that the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary of State Tony Lloyd has taken up the invite on behalf of his party leader. Jeremy Corbyn arrives at Queen's University Earlier this week, the Labour Party in Northern Ireland said it was disappointed thatMr Corbyn had not made plans to meet themduring his visit. A Labour source said the party was in communication with Labour NI and would ""be in touch to arrange a future meeting"". People in Northern Ireland have been allowed to join Labour since 2003, and they have had their own constituency branch since 2008. Whether they can contest elections is currently subject to an internal review, which is understood to be in its final stages, but any decision to change the current policy would need to be taken by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC).

"This video can not be played Ravens and Jaguars defied President Trump at Wembley after his comments NFL teams will be fined if players kneel for the US national anthem under a new policy. The American football league said players who do not stand for the Star-Spangled Banner can stay in the locker room until it has been performed. The NFL also vowed to ""impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem"".â Players said the protests were against police brutality of African Americans. ""It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,"" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a statement accompanyingWednesday's new policy,external. ""This is not and was never the case. This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem."" Decoding the NFL protests Kaepernick: From one man to a movement What must Americans do during the anthem? NFL players were previously required to be on the field for the anthem, but there was no firm directive to stand during the song. The policy includes the provision that clubs can develop their own rules - so long as they abide by the league's directive - to handle players who do not wish to stand. It does not state how much clubs will be fined should their athletes protest on the field, but gives them the option to impose penalties on any player who breaks the new rules. The statement comes a day after NFL teams pledged $90m (Â£67m) towards social justice initiatives, under an agreement reached with all 32 teams in the league. This video can not be played Osi Umenyiora says Donald Trump is the one 'disrespecting the US flag' The debate over the kneeling protests began in 2016, when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem. Similar demonstrations spread across the league, where most players are African American. The protests began with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (c) Some kneeled, as Mr Kaepernick had done, while others linked arms to show solidarity for the movement. President Donald Trump was highly critical of the protests, calling them ""disgraceful"" and unpatriotic. He also urged the players to be fired. US Vice-President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game because players from Mr Kaepernick's team knelt during the anthem. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Donald Trump started a staring contest with the NFL, and the NFL just blinked. What began as a few unscripted presidential comments at an Alabama campaign rally escalated into a public relations nightmare for America's most popular sports league, which saw its patriotism questioned from the White House bully pulpit. Within a matter of weeks the NFL's popularity plummeted among conservatives and its financial bottom line was threatened - stark proof that Mr Trump can drive the opinions of his supporters even when his target is a national juggernaut that has spent years branding itself as a shared American cultural experience. Now protesting athletes, who always insisted they were kneeling to draw attention to the abused and ignored victims in American society, will have to save their demonstrations for the solitude of the pre-game locker room. On the field, expressed love of anthem and flag will be mandatory. Mr Trump holding a customised Patriots jersey he was presented with earlier this year TheNFL Players Association (NFLPA) issued a statement,externalfollowing the policy announcement saying they were not consulted. ""NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about,"" the statement reads. ""The vote by NFL club CEOs today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the NFL's Management Council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our League."" The NFLPA also said it will be reviewing the policy and will challenge aspects that are inconsistent with the agreement in place between the league and the union. Jed York, owner of the San Francisco 49ers team, abstained from voting on the new policy. ""I think there are a lot of reasons, and I'm not going to get into all of those reasons,"" Mr York told reporters,according to ESPN,external. ""But I think the gist of it is really that we want to make sure that everything that we're doing is to promote progress. And I think we've done a good piece of that so far."" New York Jets CEO and chairman Christopher Johnson said he prefers that players stand for the national anthem but will not make them pay any fines. Mr Johnsontold Newsday,external: ""I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players"". He said the Jets would pay any fines associated with kneeling during the anthem and he would work with players on social justice issues. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for a ratings slide in the NFL. Last year the league saw a nearly 10% drop in viewership, according to Nielsen data. In 2016, there was an 8% decline. Though some fans appeared to tune out over the national anthem protests, other factors have also been cited. Some analysts blame the 2017 decline on the proliferation of games added through the expansion of Thursday Night Football. The 2016 presidential election siphoned viewers while the league's domestic abuse scandal also played a role, according to a JD Power and Associates survey. League viewership figures were also declining even before the ""take a knee"" protests as more viewers dumped cable subscriptions. But NFL games are still among the biggest television attractions. In 2017, NFL games accounted for 37 of the 50 most-watched programmes of the year, according to Nielsen.

"This video can not be played Woman taped to chair raises complaint A woman who complained of a racist and misogynistic culture in a Scottish government department claims she was taped to a chair and gagged by two male colleagues as a warning to keep quiet. DeeAnn Fitzpatrick said the restraint took place amid years of bullying and harassment at Marine Scotland's Scrabster office. The fisheries officer has taken her case to an employment tribunal. BBC Scotland has obtained a photo of the restraint incident. It was taken by one of the men allegedly responsible. Ms Fitzpatrick, a Canadian national, said it happened in 2010 as a result of her blowing the whistle on a threatening and misogynistic culture at Marine Scotland's office in Scrabster, on the far north Caithness coast. In evidence to her ongoing tribunal, she said that one of the men involved, fisheries officer Reid Anderson, told her: ""This is what you get when you speak out against the boys."" The BBC understands Reid Anderson remains employed at Marine Scotland The Scottish government is responsible for Marine Scotland, which is the watchdog for the fisheries and aquaculture industries in Scotland. It said that it ""does not comment on internal staffing matters"". Rhoda Grant, a Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands, has been supporting 49-year-old Ms Fitzpatrick since 2010, when a concerned colleague of the fisheries officer alerted the politician to the alleged treatment. Seeing the photo for the first time, Ms Grant told the BBC: ""It's horrific. I'm kind of speechless."" The MSP said she had been told it had happened but seeing the photo seemed to make it ""10 times worse"". Ms Grant said: ""She's been subject to a long period of harassment, horrendous behaviour towards her. ""In some of my dealings with DeeAnn it's very clear that there is a culture in that office that people can get away with what they say and what they do. ""It seems to me that it's out of control."" Ms Grant said the behaviour had been ""unacceptable"" eight years ago but the recent#Me Too movement, highlighting abuse against women, had made people see there should be a zero tolerance approach. The BBC has seen emails showing Ms Fitzpatrick tried to raise the alleged attack with one of her managers soon after it happened, but it appears to have not been taken seriously. The manager said he would have ""a word"" with the men involved - Reid Anderson and Jody Paske. He added: ""I am sure they meant no harm and that was the boys just being boys."" DeeAnn works as a fisheries officer checking the operation of the industry Mr Anderson, who the BBC understands remains employed by Marine Scotland and has recently been promoted, did not respond to the allegations, although civil servants are usually unable to comment without government approval. Mr Paske, who no longer works at Marine Scotland, told the BBC that the allegations were ""lies"". He said: ""These are false allegations. I can't remember the event you mention, but if it did happen, it would have been office banter. Just a craic. Certainly nothing to do with abuse."" We asked the Scottish government to waive thecivil service code,externalin order to allow Ms Fitzpatrick to speak about her experiences but permission was not given. A spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish government has clear standards of behaviour which apply to all staff. ""Any concerns raised by staff are taken seriously and investigated fully."" Marine Scotland's office in Scrabster In evidence to an employment tribunal against the Scottish government, Ms Fitzpatrick claimed that over a period of almost 10 years she had been subjected to behaviour including: being mocked about having a miscarriage being told certain staff at Marine Scotland didn't want ""a woman, especially a foreign woman"" extreme racist language threatening behaviour towards female staff, who were sometimes referred to as prostitutes The employment tribunal is unable to consider the restraint incident as it occurred more than three years before the case was brought. BBC Scotland has also seen emails from the Scottish government's HR department threatening disciplinary action against Ms Fitzpatrick while she was at her father's deathbed in Canada. The correspondence shows that in November 2016, Ms Fitzpatrick was told her father had suddenly become ill, and had days to live. She told her line manager this by text message, and that she was on her way to the airport to catch an emergency flight. DeeAnn claims she has been subjected to threatening behaviour The letter from the government's HR department, sent to Ms Fitzpatrick by email, acknowledged her father's illness and that she had indeed informed her line manager. But it said: ""You are required to contact me as soon as you receive this letter to explain the reason(s) for your absence. Failure to do so may lead to disciplinary action."" Ms Fitzpatrick's sister-in-law Sherry Fitzpatrick told the BBC that the photograph of the restraint incident needs to be shown. She said: ""We were horrified. We were sickened. We worry about what this has done to her. Ms Fitzpatrick's sister-in-law said the Canadian national's home had been in Scotland for 25 years. ""She's not giving up and now her family is behind her, and we're not giving up until someone is made accountable for their actions,"" she said. Since her father's death in November 2016, Ms Fitzpatrick has been signed off from work. It is unclear whether her alleged attackers ever faced disciplinary action but Ms Fitzpatrick herself faces a disciplinary hearing from her employers at the end of May. Scrabster Harbour is an important port for the fishing industry Her internal disciplinary cites charges of being ""overzealous"" in her job and being rude to clients. Ms Fitzpatrick has told supporters she believes it has been designed to get rid of her. Highlands and Islands MSP Ms Grant said: ""They [Ms Fitzpatrick's employers] just won't listen. So their way of resolving it is actually getting the woman out of the workplace, getting the woman out of the man's job."" She called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham to ""get a grip of it"" and not allow women to be treated in this ""totally unacceptable"" way. A Scottish government spokeswoman said Ms Cunningham would not be made available for interview. She added that in addition to the ongoing employment tribunal there were also ""internal procedures"" under way, and it would be ""wrong to pre-empt the outcome"". The spokeswoman said these processes provided the ""proper avenues"" for Ms Fitzpatrick to contribute her position.

"This video can not be played Michael Rotondo: ""They said you need to get a job"" A New York couple have won their legal battle to evict their 30-year-old son from home after he refused to leave. During a hearing at the state's highest court in Syracuse, a judge praised Michael Rotondo's legal research, but ordered him to leave the house anyway. Justice Donald Greenwood told the son his bid to remain in his parents' home another six months was ""outrageous"". But Mr Rotondo, who legally represented himself, said it was the eviction notice that was outrageous. ""I don't see why they can't just, you know, wait a little bit for me to leave the house,"" Mr Rotondo argued, as his parents looked on, sitting with their lawyer. He said six months was ""a reasonable amount of time for someone who has been depending on persons for support"". Christina and Mark Rotondo were in court The smiling judge urged him to speak to his parents, and to voluntarily leave the house, but Mr Rotondo refused. ""I want you out of that household,"" Judge Greenwood told him, according to ABC News. In a court filing last week, Christina and Mark Rotondo described issuing several orders for their son to move out, starting on 2 February 2018. ""There are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you,"" they wrote in one note, dated 18 February. ""Get one - you have to work!"" Mr Rotondo says his parents told him he could stay with them eight years ago after he lost his job They also gave him $1,100 (Â£819) to leave, according to one letter, which suggested he sell some of his belongings including a broken-down Volkswagen Passat. ""I was originally hoping to give it back,"" he later told CBS outside the family home. Sex and dating when you live with your parents Eviction threat over crying baby Why Utah now has first 'free-range' parenting law Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' ""I had to spend it and I'm not sorry about it,"" he added, telling other local media that it went towards ""expenses"". In court he acknowledged he has never contributed to household chores. After Tuesday's hearing, Mr Rotondo summoned news cameras into a hallway for an impromptu press conference. He told reporters he would appeal against the ruling, and that he had planned to move out of the home in Camillius, New York within three months anyway. The home near Syracuse, New York that is at the centre of the family dispute He said that his relationship with his parents has grown very strained, with the three of them never speaking or interacting inside the home. ""After a while it just kind of beats itself down to where there's nothing left,"" he said. When asked how he can manage to avoid them, and whether he lives in a basement, he replied that he lives in a bedroom but did not want to provide more detail. Mr Rotondo said that his parents said he could stay with them eight years ago after he lost his job. He added that he has a job, but refused to answer questions about it, telling reporters that ""my business is my business"". Mr Rotondo also complained the judge had not properly read his case. He left court, presumably heading back to his parents' home.

"This video can not be played Meet the women who travelled #HomeToVote on Friday Irish voters from around the world returned to cast their ballots in Friday's referendum on whether or not to repeal the country's Eighth Amendment. That clause in the Irish constitution in effect outlaws abortion by giving equal rights to the unborn. The #HomeToVote hashtag has trended on Twitter for most of the weekend, as men and women shared their journeys home. From car shares, to offers of beds for the night, the movement was propelled by social media. A similar movement also took off ahead of the 2015 vote that legalised same-sex marriage. People on both sides of the argument travelled back to vote, but the movement was spearheaded by the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign - a pro-choice group that tried to mobilise an estimated 40,000 eligible emigrants. The Eighth Amendment came into being after a 1983 referendum, so no-one under the age of 54 has voted on this before. For many, the vote was touted as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have their say on women's reproductive rights. This video can not be played A warm welcome for people travelling #HometoVote in Dublin Thousands of Irish women travel every year for abortion procedures in Britain. For women who made the reverse trip to vote Yes to repeal the Eighth, the journey held a lot of symbolism. ""I think of it every time I've travelled to and from the UK; it's always on my mind,"" 21-year-old student BlÃ¡ithÃ­n Carroll said before boarding her plane back. BlÃ¡ithÃ­n Carroll says the vote is a chance for Ireland to ""really progress"" as a modern country Karen Fahy, 26, and Maria Mcentee, 24. travelled back from London to vote against the change. They argue that young women opposed to abortion have been stigmatised for their views in the run-up to the referendum and believe many others like them have kept their opinions quiet. What are Ireland's abortion laws? Long read: Ireland's time of reckoning Meet the people on both sides of debate ""A lot of people don't want to get involved in the polarising debates online,"" Maria said. ""But you can kind of infer who is voting no, because they'll be the people who don't have repeal stickers on their picture or post things about repeal."" The 24-year-old said she had always been ""a bit indifferent"" to the abortion issue until she saw a campaign video showing a procedure. Karen Fahy (left) and Maria Mcentee (right) are a part of London-Irish United for Life Currently living in the UK where abortion is legal (except in Northern Ireland), Karen said she had concerns about the proposal presenting abortion as ""the first and only choice"" for women with unplanned pregnancies. ""I don't want to see that coming to Ireland, and I think we can do a lot better,"" she said. ""We should be investing and providing support for women in crisis pregnancies."" ""In those very difficult situations when there's a very severe disability, we should provide more child benefit and support women in education."" Abortion is only currently allowed in Ireland when the woman's life is at risk, and not in cases of rape, incest or foetal-fatal abnormality (FFA). Clara Kumagi, a keen repealer, has taken time off work in Tokyo to travel back thousands of miles to cast her vote. She was already on her way back there by Friday afternoon. ""I want to live in a country where I feel safe, where I know that I have the autonomy to make decisions about my own body,"" the 29-year-old said. Clara says she always knew she wanted to return #HomeToVote to repeal, after being ineligible for the 2015 equal marriage ballot ""For me, the act of travelling was something that I felt was important to do. How many kilometres do Irish women travel every year? For me 10,000km felt like the least I could do."" Her student brother also travelled travelling back from Stockholm to vote. Irish men living as far away as Buenos Aires and Africa have posted online about their journeys home. Pro-repeal men have shared their support for the movement using the #MenForYes hashtag. Rural v urban: Ireland's abortion divide? Mother-of-three Amy Fitzgerald, 38, took three flights to return to Ireland from Prince Edward Island in Canada. Amy's flights were a birthday present bought by husband Padraig, whom she describes as her ""favourite feminist"" ""There's always people who will need an abortion,"" she said, reacting to accusations that the proposed new law could lead to abortion ""on demand"" as a back-up to contraception. The government's proposed abortion bill would allow unrestricted terminations up to 12 weeks, with allowances made afterward on health grounds. ""No-one wants one until you actually need one. No little girl dreams of having one,"" Amy said. Irish actress Lauryn Canny, 19, who travelled back from LA to vote, said that that concern over abortion access loomed over her teenage years. She recalls being ""constantly terrified"" of the risks of having sex while growing up. ""I remember one of my friends said: Well if I got pregnant, I would just commit suicide. I couldn't tell my Mam,"" she says. Lauryn (second left) pictured with her sisters and mother, said every vote would count ""I have two baby sisters now, and they're six and seven, and I just really hope that when they are growing up they feel safer and feel like they're growing up in a more compassionate Ireland that will care for them if they're in crisis."" Lauryn was able to afford flights after her grandmother organised a ""whip-round"" to raise money. Student Sarah Gillespie, 21, travelled back from the US to vote - but for the other side. She felt so strongly about the issue that she cut short her time studying abroad in Pennsylvania to return to Ireland to canvas for a No vote. Physics student Sarah rearranged her flights home to canvas against the repeal She describes herself as a feminist, but believes the rights of the unborn should be considered too. Having previously voted for marriage equality, she wants people to recognise that the issues are different, and that No voters were not simply voting according to strict religious beliefs. ""I would never judge or get angry at a woman who went abroad, I just wish there was better support here,"" Sarah said. She hoped that, whatever the result, people respected the outcome. Unlike in other countries, most eligible voters outside Ireland had to physically travel back to cast their ballot. Only those who have lived away for less than 18 months were legally entitled to take part in the referendum. Because of that rule, Oxford University lecturer Jennifer Cassidy was ineligible to vote - but campaigned for repeal. Those ineligible used the #BeMyYes hashtag to encourage support for Yes. The 31-year-old helped support the motion, alongside a number of Irish students ""I understand it to an extent - Ireland has a huge global community and policing that would be difficult,"" she said. ""But it seems illogical and counter-intuitive to the Irish narrative, which is one of emigrating for a while and then coming home."" Oxford University was one of several UK institutions whose student unions offered to help subsidise travel. Under the current system, people are not routinely removed from Ireland's electoral register, so polling cards were being sent to the family homes of emigrants who were no longer eligible. It was feared that if the result was close, people may have complained about the #HomeToVote movement and whether everyone was actually legal to vote.

"On Friday 25 May, people in the Republic of Ireland voted on whether they want to make changes to the country's strict abortion laws, upheld in the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution. So where does the law currently stand? Since 2013, terminations have been allowed in Ireland but only when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2016, the Irish Department of Health said there were 25 legal abortions carried out in Ireland. In the same year, 3,265 women travelled from Ireland to the UK for a termination. After independence, Ireland retained many UK laws, one of which was the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which criminalised abortion. However, in the early 1980s, following legal cases in other jurisdictions allowing the introduction of less restrictive abortion laws, some people became concerned that something similar could happen in Ireland. This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum In 1983, after a referendum, an eighth amendment was added to the country's constitution known as Article 40.3.3. In it, the state acknowledged ""the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"". After a further referendum in 1992, two other changes were made to the constitution in relation to women seeking to access terminations. The Thirteenth Amendment said women were free to travel to other countries to access abortion services. The Fourteenth Amendment stated that the constitution would not prevent people accessing information relating to ""services lawfully available in another state"". In 2013, the law was changed when the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) voted to allow abortions under limited circumstances. TheProtection of Life During Pregnancy Actallowed terminations to be carried out where there is a threat to the life of the mother. They would also be allowed where there is medical consensus that the expectant mother will take her own life over her pregnancy. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up advise the Irish government on constitutional change,voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitutionwhich strictly limits the availability of abortion. So on 25 May, 2018, the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper read: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies. In March, Health Minister Simon Harris outlined what would be in thegovernment legislation,externalif the people voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment. If passed, women could access a termination within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.

"Mr Trump - seen through a phone - speaks from the Oval Office at the White House US President Donald Trump may not ""block"" Twitter users from viewing his online profile due to their political beliefs, a judge in New York has ruled. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan said that blocking access to his @realDonaldTrump account would be a violation of the right to free speech. The lawsuit against Mr Trump and other White House officials stems from his decision to bar several online critics. The White House has yet to comment on the judge's ruling. The case was brought by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven Twitter users who had been blocked by Mr Trump for criticising him or mocking him online. Mr Trump's Twitter account has steadily grown since taking over the US presidency Judge suggests Trump mute Twitter critics Trump's year on Twitter Trump, Twitter and his 'filter bubble' Twitter is paralysed by Trump's tweeting On Wednesday the judge agreed with their argument that the social media platform qualifies as a ""designated public forum"" granted to all US citizens. ""This case requires us to consider whether a public official may, consistent with the First Amendment, 'block' a person from his Twitter account in response to the political views that person has expressed, and whether the analysis differs because that public official is the President of the United States,"" the judge said in her opinion. ""The answer to both questions is no."" The judge rejected argument by Mr Trump's lawyers that the ""First Amendment does not apply in this case and that the President's personal First Amendment interests supersede those of plaintiffs"". Mr Trump has over 52 million followers on Twitter, his preferred social media platform which he joined in March 2009. He often eschews the official US presidential Twitter account, @POTUS, as well as his own White House press office, to make official announcements. One of the people that Mr Trump blocked, Holly O'Reilly, who uses the account @AynRandPaulRyan, was blocked last May after posting a GIF of Mr Trump meeting with Pope Francis. The photo, which some said showed the Pope glaring at Mr Trump, was captioned: ""This is pretty much how the whole world sees you."" Shortly after being blocked, she told Time Magazine that ""it's like FDR took my radio away"", referring to Franklin Delano Roosevelt - the World War Two-era president who spoke directly to Americans with his so-called fireside chats. Earlier in the trial, Judge Buchwald suggested the president, who was not in court, could simply mute the accounts he does not want to see. People on Twitter are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. But if Mr Trump muted an account, he would not see that user's tweets but the user could still see and respond to his. It's unclear if Mr Trump will now unblock his critics, but the judge hinted the president could face legal action if he did not comply with the ruling. She wrote that ""because all government officials are presumed to follow the law once the judiciary has said what the law is, we must assume that the President [and his social media director] will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional"". Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco When it comes to Twitter, the First Amendment grants the American people the right to speak about the President - but it doesn't force him to listen. While the court has ruled the blocking is unconstitutional, it said the ability to mute a person was not - and so the safe space nurtured by the president and his social media team will remain mostly intact. As I type this, he follows just 46 people, mostly family and Fox News presenters. For many of those he blocked, it's become a badge of honour - a #blockedbytrump topic sprung up as a way of celebrating being shut out by The Donald. But Trump's tweets are a major means by which the president communicates with his people. However history looks back at what is happening within his administration today, tweets will form a crucial part of that record. And while some have argued that anyone blocked by Trump can see his tweets by just logging out, that doesn't necessarily give the whole picture. One tweet sent on Wednesday does not appear in the feed for logged-out users, for example, as it is a ""reply"". Blocking also prevents people from replying to or quoting what was said. The bigger impact here, however, is that this ruling applies to all public officials in the US. And so it won't just be Mr Trump thumbing through and unblocking those who he deems unsavoury.

"A stag was photographed with rope and buoy tangled in its antlers Images have been released showing red deer stags on a Scottish island with marine pollution tangled in their antlers. Two of the animals on the Isle of Rum died after becoming snarled up together in discarded fishing rope. Another of the deer was photographed with rope and an orange buoy in its antlers. The images have been published by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which manages Rum National Nature Reserve. The photographs were taken a year ago, but only released now following rising concerns about marine pollution. Scotland signs up to global 'ghost gear' pledge Two of the deer died after becoming snarled up in rope Lesley Watt, reserve manager on Rum for SNH, said: ""Marine litter is a huge international problem. But small actions can make a big difference, and everyone has a part to play. ""Along with many organisations, SNH recently joined the campaign to bin plastic straws; and we're cutting down on disposable plastics by providing our staff with re-useable travel cups. ""If you use your own bag for life when shopping, or take litter home after a day at the beach, you could help save an animal's life."" The island's population of red deer have been the subject of scientific research since the 1950s. Researchers study the animals to better understand their behaviour and the effects of climate change on deer. Marine pollution on Rum Dr Richard Dixon, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the photographs of the red deer were a ""strong Scottish symbol of a wasteful attitude"" to the world's resources. He said: ""We are used to some of the images of seabirds and some marine mammals and turtles being affected by plastic waste, but this is very much closer to home. ""These are big mammals being affected by stuff that people have just discarded in the marine environment."" Concerns about the level of pollution in the sea off Scotland, and along its coast are increasingly being raised. This week, a group of volunteers gathered more than 600kgs of rubbish from the shore at Red Point, Gairloch, in Wester Ross. Last summer, scientists said some of the world's deepest living sea creatures had been found to have eaten microscopic pieces of plastic waste. Researchers at the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) in Obansampled starfish and snails from the Rockall Trough off the Western Isles. Tiny pieces of plastic were found in 48% of the sample animals that live more than 2,000m (6,561.8ft) down. Gannet chick with plastic in its nest Also last year, researchers saidmost of the seabirds examined for a study into the effects of marine plastic pollution had swallowed plastic. Researchers, including scientists from North Highland College UHI's Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, investigated 34 species. They found 74% of them had ingested plastic.

"Paul Manafort resigned as chair of President Trump's election campaign after two months When Paul Manafort joined Donald Trump's presidential election campaign in March 2016, the 68-year-old political operative was a relatively minor player in Washington. The former political consultant had worked on Republican presidential campaigns as far back as Gerald Ford's in 1976, and for clients around the world. It was hoped his 40 years of political experience would help temper some of the chaos and controversy surrounding Mr Trump. He advocated a more disciplined, conventional campaign, calling for scripted speeches and teleprompters over Mr Trump's unpredictable, off-the-cuff, approach. Mr Manafort was soon promoted to chair the campaign and oversaw the period during which Mr Trump clinched the Republican nomination. However, he ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle. He was convictedon charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. In March 2019 he was sentenced on these charges - and two others of conspiracy to defraud the United States and witness tampering - to a total of seven-and-a-half years in prison. But he was pardoned by Mr Trump in his last few weeks in office. Russia: The controversy Trump can't shake How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Putin 'sought to help' Trump From Brioni suits to jail garb: Manafort was held at the Alexandria Detention Center in Virginia Born in New Britain, Connecticut, on 1 April 1949, Paul Manafort took law at Georgetown University. Other Republicans he worked for include the late President Ronald Reagan, former President George HW Bush and Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election. Before he became involved in the former Soviet Union he worked for such figures as the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, the late leader of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) Mobutu Sese Seko and the late Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. But on the Trump trail, it was his more recent work in Ukraine that raised questions. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? His tenure at the helm ended in August 2016 when he resigned after reports about his consultancy work for Ukraine's deposed pro-Russian former President, Viktor Yanukovych, when he was in office. The New York Times reported,externalthat the Ukrainian government had uncovered ledgers pledging more than $12m (Â£9.2m) in cash payments for his work as an adviser to Mr Yanukovych. He vehemently dismissed the allegations and denied any wrongdoing. ""The suggestion that I accepted cash payments is unfounded, silly, and nonsensical,"" he told NBC News. Any political payments directed to him he said ""were for my entire political team: campaign staff, polling and research, election integrity and television advertising"". The Trump campaign did not give a reason for his departure, issuing only a standard statement wishing him well. After that, the controversy around Mr Manafort's ties to Russia continued to grow. It has also been alleged that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political goals in other parts of the former USSR. Mr Manafort denied the allegation. Mr Manafort was an adviser to Viktor Yanukovych (left) but denies working for Vladimir Putin (right) In June 2017, he retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the US justice department in relation to his consulting work between 2012-14 for Mr Yanukovych's political party in Ukraine. He confirmed in a declaration that his firm, DMP International, had received more than $17m from the Party of the Regions. Then, in July, President Trump's son admitted to having met a Russian lawyer before the election who promised to reveal damaging material on Hillary Clinton. Manafort was reportedly at that meeting. The following month, Mr Manafort's spokesman confirmed the FBI had conducted a pre-dawn raid on his Virginia home, seizing files and other material. It was later reported that Mr Manafort had been wiretapped by the FBI due to concerns about his links with Moscow. The surveillance, granted under a court warrant, is said to have occurred both before and after the election. The FBI was leading one of several investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Of 18 charges against him, Mr Manafort was found guilty of eight in August 2018. Manafort's lawyers speak to reporters briefly after his conviction He filed a false tax return every year from 2010 to 2014, did not report a foreign bank account as required by law in 2012, and committed two instances of bank fraud related to two separate bank loans. However, the jury at his trial in Virginia failed to reach a verdict on 10 other charges and the judge declared a mistrial on those. The indictments are not connected with allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the US election in 2016. But he later agreed to co-operate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into that matter, in a plea deal that had potential ramifications for the White House. A judge later found that Mr Manafort had breached the deal by contacting witnesses to ask them to lie, and ordered him held in pre-trial detention. In March 2019 he was sentenced to 47 months in prison by Judge TS Ellis who told him he was surprised that Mr Manafort did not ""express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct"". Several days later he received another 43-month sentence. However, the December 2020 pardon spared him from serving most of his jail time. He had been under home confinement after being released from federal prison in May over fears of coronavirus.

"The FBI has raided the office, home and hotel room of Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's long-time personal lawyer, business adviser and fixer-of-uncomfortable-problems. Now Mr Cohen himself has become the uncomfortable problem, with no easy fix in sight. There's basically no precedent for this sort of action in modern US presidential politics. And Mr Trump's response on Monday afternoon - an unprompted, extended tirade that used the word ""disgrace"" or ""disgraceful"" nine times - hints that the president is concernedâ¦ and angry. Here are a few reasons why the Cohen raid is a significant development in the ongoing presidential investigations - and a growing headache for the White House. Fifty-one-year-old New Yorker Michael Cohen has a law degree, but his past duties for Mr Trump were not typical attorney obligations. While he did provide counsel, he also was one of the Trump Organization's lead negotiators on foreign business dealings, the man who would send threatening legal letters to Trump critics and - at least in the Stormy Daniels episode - someone who would arrange to keep potentially embarrassing information about Mr Trump under wraps. ""They say I'm Mr Trump's pitbull, that I'm his right-hand man,"" Mr Cohen said in 2011. ""What I am is a loyal employee. I like the man a lot."" In other words, Mr Cohen - although he severed his ties with the Trump business organisation in 2017 - has been deeply embedded in the Trump world for roughly a decade. If he is under legal scrutiny, it could open a vast window into the inner workings of the president's business empire. His real estate dealings in Russia had already attracted the attention of special counsel Robert Mueller's team, and he was featured prominently in the now-notorious Christopher Steele dossier. Even if the search leads nowhere, federal agents scrutinising a presidential lawyer's business is still a remarkable development. At the moment, however, there's no telling what law enforcement's efforts on Monday could turn up. The issue isn't just what happened - federal investigators reportedly collecting documents and related information about Mr Cohen's tax records, business dealings and six-figure payment to secure the silence of Daniels, an adult film star who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. It's also who is doing the investigating. According to media reports, the search was the result of information originally discovered by Mueller's investigation, but his office wasn't involved in the search. Instead, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein instructed the Mueller team to refer the matter to the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, which requested and executed the warrant. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' Geoffrey Berman has served as the acting US attorney for the Southern District for more than a year, after Mr Trump fired his predecessor, Preet Bharara. He's a long-time Republican donor, including to Mr Trump's presidential campaign, and has reportedly recused himself from the investigation. Because this is being handled by his office and not the special counsel, however, any move Mr Trump makes against Mr Mueller will have no impact on this inquiry, which appears to be focused on whether the payment to Daniels - and perhaps other women who have alleged romantic involvement with Mr Trump - violated tax, banking or campaign finance laws. Mr Cohen says he made a $130,000 payment to Daniels in October 2016 out of his own funds in exchange for her silence. If that turns out not to be the case, or if the payment is considered to be the equivalent of campaign contribution, it could run afoul of federal disclosure rules. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards faced criminal prosecution in 2011 for undisclosed campaign payments he made to a former mistress. In other words, this is not an academic consideration. The FBI-conducted raid of Mr Cohen's property isn't a garden-variety search, either. Because Mr Cohen is the president's personal attorney, federal investigators had to comply withextra safeguards,externalto avoid infringing on a client's right to confidential legal counsel. Top-level Justice Department officials had to approve of the move, and extra personnel were involved in the process to ensure that ""privileged"" communications between Mr Cohen and his clients, including Mr Trump, were not disclosed to the investigatory team. The sensitivity of the search was probably on the president's mind on Tuesday morningwhen he tweeted,external, ""Attorney-client privilege is dead!"" This video can not be played Schumer to Trump: Attorney raid not an attack on US The lawyer protections aren't iron-clad, however. There are exceptions to the rules, such as in cases where the lawyer is discussing topics outside the realm of agreed legal representation or the parties are involved in committing or concealing criminal activity. If investigators conclude there is reason to believe that Mr Cohen's payment to Daniels violated banking, tax or campaign finance laws - and is able to convince a judge to concur - then material related to that act, even if it includes otherwise protected communications, could be admissible in court. During a meeting with his military advisers on Monday the president embarked on extended remarks about what he viewed as the impropriety of the Cohen search. He called his lawyer a ""good man"" and claimed that law enforcement ""broke into"" his office.Mr Cohen told CNN,externalthat FBI agents ""were extremely professional, courteous and respectful"". Mr Trump reiterated that the investigations - including, presumably, the one involving Mr Cohen - were a ""witch hunt"". He again questioned the impartiality of those investigating him, asserted that there was no evidence of ""collusion"" between his campaign and Russia, and said Democrats should be the focus of scrutiny. He called the investigation an ""attack on our country"" and ""on what we all stand for"" and entertained the possibility of firing Mr Mueller, as ""many people"" are saying he should do. ""So we'll see what happens,"" the president said. This video can not be played Trump: FBI raid of my lawyer's office is ""a whole new level of unfairness"" The most significant development out of the Cohen raid, then, is what it could set in motion. The president relied on many of his worn phrases - ""many people are saying"" and ""we'll see"" - that have, in the past, hinted at future action. He has reportedly considered firing Mr Mueller in the past. Would the special counsel's role in all this be enough to push the president over the top? Mr Trump again took swipes at his own attorney general and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - himself a past target of presidential ire - who approved the New York office's raid. Could their positions be in jeopardy? In a Russia investigation that has moved by increments over the past few months, the Cohen search represents a stunning development. There's a new front in the political and legal warfare, and a new series of exposures for the president and those closest to him. Even if the president decides to act, however, the scope of the inquiry - and the potential damage that could result - just became much more challenging to contain.

"Berlinah Wallace threw sulphuric acid at her former partner, Mark van Dongen A woman who threw sulphuric acid at her former partner, which led to him ending his life, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years. Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015. At Bristol Crown Court, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Wallace it was ""an act of pure evil"". She was cleared of murdering her former partner but found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent. ""Your intention was to burn, disfigure and disable Mark van Dongen so that he would not be attractive to any other woman,"" the judge said. Avon and Somerset Police said it believed it to be the first life sentence for an acid attack in the UK. The terrible price paid for rejecting Berlinah Wallace Mr van Dongen, 29, was left paralysed from the neck down and lost an ear, eye and his left leg following the attack, and ended his own life in a Belgian hospital in January 2017. This video can not be played Mark van Dongen had acid thrown on him while he was asleep in bed The judge told Wallace she had ""chosen the moment"" for the attack when Mr van Dongen was wearing only boxer shorts and asleep in bed at her flat in Westbury Park. ""Vulnerable, almost naked, he awoke but had no real opportunity to avoid the focus of your acid attack, namely his face and then his body,"" she said. ""Immediately before you threw the acid you said to Mark, 'If I can't have you, no-one can'."" The bed where Mark van Dongen was lying when Wallace threw the acid at him Wallace had bought the acid to attack her former partner, a Dutch engineer, because he had left her for another woman, the court heard. She threw a glass of it over Mr van Dongen on the night of 22 September 2015 after he had returned to her flat in Ladysmith Road to reiterate that their turbulent relationship was over, but decided to stay the night. Screaming in agony, he staggered out on to the street where he was found by alarmed neighbours who dialled 999. Ex-girlfriend cleared of acid murder Accused in 'prostitution secret' threat Acid victim 'told accused to kill herself Wallace ""told lie after lie"" after the ""horrific attack"", the judge said. ""When interviewed by the police you sought to place the blame upon Mark van Dongen, falsely alleging that he had poured the acid into the glass on your bedside table intending that you should drink it. ""It was an account which you gave in September 2015 and maintained throughout this trial."" Kees van Dongen said the sentence was ""really too little"" Speaking via a translator the victim's father, Kees van Dongen, said: ""I'm very pleased she'll be locked up for a minimum of 12 years but really it's too little, because we as a family have been sentenced to life."" He said he supported the judge's findings that Wallace's intentions had been ""malicious and callous"". ""I never knew that she was like this. It turns out she really pulled the wool over our eyes from day one.""

"This video can not be played Hamid Ali Jafari says he prays for death so that he can join his father Ali in heaven A man whose father died in Grenfell Tower has told the inquiry into the fire he prays for death so he can join him in heaven. Hamid Ali Jafari was moved to tears as he recalled searching for 82-year-old Ali Yawar Jafari after the blaze. He added it sometimes felt his father's soul was present in his own son. Ali Yawar Jafari, who lived on 11th floor with his wife, was described as a ""real hero"" for alerting neighbours to the blaze as it spread. Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 3 Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Sitting alongside his mother and two sisters, Hamid said: ""I think the happiest moment he had was when my son was born, because he was attached to him a lot. ""Both of them were connected to each other."" He added: ""When I am holding him I feel I am holding my dad because I can still smell my dad on my son."" Ali Yawar Jafari was described as a ""real hero"" for his actions on the night His voice breaking, Hamid told the inquiry: ""I have never dreamed or thought of going to heaven but now I fight every day, every second, because I want to join my dad. ""And I pray every day - and even I request my friends to pray for me - that I die soon to meet my father."" Mr Jafari moved to the UK in 2003 from Afghanistan, where he worked as a jeweller. He died while trying to escape from Grenfell Tower after becoming separated from his wife and daughter. Referring to the days after the fire, Hamid recalled walking around the tower ""to share my feelings with my father"" but also the ""hopelessness"". Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens What happened at the tower block? In a video tribute, Mr Jafari was described by his family as a ""kind person and a kind husband"". They recalled his love for travel and animals, and how he once freed a pigeon whose legs were trapped in twine. His daughter Maria said they were unable to show more happy photos to the inquiry because their memories had been lost in the fire on 14 June last year, which killed 72 people. Anthony Disson - known as Tony - who lived on the 22nd floor, was also remembered. In a video tribute featuring his wife Cordelia and their sons Harry, Alfie and Charlie, he was described as a ""good dad, a brilliant husband and a wonderful granddad"". Anthony Disson with his granddaughter Talleulah Mr Disson, 65, was said to have been ""besotted with"" his granddaughter Talleulah. She used to call him ""dan-dad"". Even now, she still talks about her ""dan-dad"", Cordelia said. Mr Disson was involved in the boxing gym at the bottom of the tower, where his sons trained. ""He loved his flat and he loved that he was still in the same area that he had grown up in,"" Mr Disson's son from a previous relationship, Lee, said in a statement. He also recalled searching for his father everywhere and putting his name down as ""missing"". ""My heart was sinking but I prayed Dad had got out, or wasn't at home that night,"" he said. Marie Jackson, BBC News On the third morning of tributes from families, the chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick has been a quiet presence. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? Sitting upright, light-framed glasses perched on his nose, he holds a pen in one hand and rests the other on top, listening intently from a makeshift desk set up on the stage. As tearful relatives conclude tributes to their loved ones, sometimes in sorrow, sometimes with laughter, Sir Martin joins in the applause and nods reassuringly. ""I feel you get to know the man through your tributes, "" he told the family of Anthony Disson. ""Very powerful,"" he remarked as Hamid, son of Ali Yawar Jafari, shared how he could barely look his mother in the eye since the tragedy. To the young Aiasha Mohamed, who read her mother's long and deeply-moving tribute to her sister Rania Ibrahim on camera, he said it had been profoundly moving. ""It must have taken a lot of effort to make it,"" he told her. Zainab Deen, 32, and her two-year-old son Jeremiah, were found at each other's side on the 14th floor. In a statement read by barrister Michael Mansfield QC, her father said they could not find a reason ""why such a handsome and cheerful boy was taken from us at the age of two"". Zainab came to Britain from Sierra Leone as a child. Her father said: ""Zainab had it all. She was beautiful, smart, warm, caring and a confident and outgoing young woman.  Her untimely death has left us heartbroken."" They also remembered ""beautiful grandson"" Jeremiah, saying: ""We will focus on how happy he made us when he was in our lives."" At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said the government must take the ""strongest possible action"" to prevent another Grenfell tower tragedy. This video can not be played May: We'll take ""strongest possible action"" to stop another Grenfell Tower tragedy She said the government is ""minded to go further"" than recommendations inDame Judith Hackitt's report,externalinto building regulations by banning combustible materials in cladding on high-rise buildings. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in response that ""justice had not yet been done"" as some of the building's residents are still in temporary accommodation. Gary Maunders was remembered as a devoted family man with a great personality. The 57-year-old painter and decorator was from the North Kensington area although he did not live at Grenfell Tower and had been visiting a friend on the 19th floor on the night of the fire. Ana Pumar, the mother of his two youngest children, said: ""Sadly for us, future milestones will be reached without having their father present, and future memories will not involve their father which is heart-breaking for us."" His nieces, Chanel and Kenita Spence, grew up with Mr Maunders in their family home. In a video featuring photographs from his life and the music of his favourite singer Marvin Gaye, they said he was more like a big brother than an uncle and ""the pain of losing him is indescribable"". They said he loved football and making people laugh - an old-fashioned soul with values and respect for all. The Manchester United fan was a talented footballer in his youth and once had the chance of becoming professional for Arsenal, they added. Marjorie Vital, 68, and her son Ernie, 50, lived on the 19th floor. Ms Vital's surviving son did not wish to speak or be present at the inquiry, but instead created a short film that was shown. He said his mother was a full-time seamstress, who would make clothes for herself so she could afford to buy clothes for her sons. His brother was a great dancer who loved Earth Wind and Fire. The pair were found in a top-floor flat of the building. Over footage showing the charred wreckage of a former flat inside the tower, he said he had imagined his brother carrying his mother to the top floor when no other escape route was possible. He said: ""We now have the evidence that their bodies were fused together in the intensity of the fire... It symbolised to me, their level of closeness that they had."" Ms Vital's sister, Paula Bellot, said in a statement they had lost touch in the months before the fire but never thought they would not have the opportunity to patch things up. She said her sister had come to London from Dominica as a teenager and lived with their parents in North Kensington before moving to Grenfell Tower, where she was ""very proud"" of her home. The day's proceedings opened with more commemorations to Rania Ibrahim, 30, and her daughters Fathia, four, and Hania, three, who lived on the 23rd floor of the building. A tribute from Rania's older sister Sayeeda, was read in a video to the inquiry. Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fathia, known as Fou-Fou, and Hania, lived on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower ""I am so grateful and proud to have her as my sister,"" she said. ""I raised her to be a strong, brave woman. She lived her life to the fullest."" Mrs Ibrahim said her sister came to the UK in 2009 from Egypt to look after her when she fell ill, and would be at the forefront of the fight for justice, had she survived the fire.

"Giuseppe Conte has faced allegations of inflating his CV Italy's President Sergio Mattarella has accepted a political novice as prime minister, paving the way for two populist parties to form a government. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League chose law professor Giuseppe Conte in a bid to end 11 weeks of political deadlock. The 53-year-old has faced claims that he embellished his CV, which he denies. Concerns remain over the two parties, which reject years of EU austerity and want to renegotiate Italy's debt. Speaking after emerging from talks with the president, Mr Conte said: ""Outside of this palace there's a country that rightfully awaits a new government and answers. What is about to be born is the government of change."" He added that he would be the ""defender of all Italians on the international and European stage"". Italy has been without a government since elections on 4 March, because no political group could form a majority. Italy populists: What you should know Katya Adler, Europe editor: Should Europe be scared of Italy's populists? Two populist party leaders, Luigi di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the League, finally agreed a coalition deal after days of talks and later nominated Mr Conte as their candidate to be prime minister. The coalition deal promises tax cuts, a guaranteed basic income for the poor and deportations of 500,000 migrants - policies that are likely to put the eurozone's third biggest economy on a collision course with Brussels. Mr Conte will now form a list of ministers to be approved by the president before a new government can be sworn in. The cabinet will then face a vote of confidence in parliament. Populists poised to govern: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (L) and League's Matteo Salvini Fifty-three-year-old Mr Conte, a professor of private law in Florence and Rome, is not an elected MP and until now has been completely unknown in politics. Since his nomination, he has been accused of inflating his academic resume in an effort to boost his international profile. On a CV dating back to 2013, he said he had ""perfected his legal studies"" at New York University, but a spokeswoman for the institution said there was no record of him having studied there. The resume also said he had carried out ""scientific research"" at Cambridge University's Girton College in 2001 - a spokeswoman for the university said it could not confirm or deny his claim citing data protection laws. Mr Conte also said he had worked on his legal studies at the International Kultur Institut in Vienna, Austria. The school - which was misspelt on the CV - is in fact a language school and does not appear to offer legal courses. The Five Star Movement defended its nominee on Tuesday, saying that Mr Conte had never claimed to have earned degrees abroad, but ""went abroad to study, to deepen his knowledge, to perfect his English legal language skills"". It added: ""The defamatory campaign is so explicit and crude that it will only strengthen us."" Read more about the CV controversy The Five Star Movement and The League named Mr Conte for the role of prime minister on Monday. Instead of immediately accepting the nomination, Mr Mattarella took some time to decide, as concerns rose in Italy over Mr Conte's lack of experience and questions over his CV. He has also faced controversy over unpaid taxes and fines of over â¬50,000 (Â£44,000, $51,000). With the president's green light it is now up for the parliament to decide on the coalition. The two parties have sufficient votes in the Chamber of Deputies, but only a small majority in the upper house, the Senate. Italy was ravaged by the 2008 financial crisis that left the economy some 6% smaller and three million more people in poverty. The policies promised by the parties are estimated to cost at least â¬100bn ($117bn; Â£88bn), experts say, for a country with the biggest public debt in the EU after Greece. Other proposals include: Poor families will get a â¬780 basic monthly income, provided recipients actively seek work Two ""flat tax"" rates set at 15% and 20%, and families would receive a â¬3,000 annual tax deduction based on household income Scrapping sales and excise tax increases next year, worth â¬12.5bn Neither Five Star nor The League are fans of the single currency, the euro. League leader Matteo Salvini said not long ago that the euro was ""a mistake"" for Italy's economy, while Five Star had wanted a referendum on Italy's future membership. But they have dropped their initial ambition of exit from the euro and now talk of trying to reform it from within.

"Chief Constable Hopkins (r) attended a number of memorial events on Tuesday A BBC documentary about the Manchester Arena attack was ""wholly inaccurate"" and ""entirely inappropriate"", a chief constable has said. Manchester: The Night of the Bombaired on BBC Two on the first anniversary of the bombing, which saw 22 people die and hundreds injured. Greater Manchester Police's Ian Hopkins said it had been ""entirely misleading"" in its depiction of police actions. The BBC said the programme had been ""responsible, accurate and thoughtful"". The documentary, which was made by Amos Productions for the corporation, was broadcast at 21:00 BST, hours aftera memorial service had taken place to remember those who died. Twenty-two people were killed when a homemade device was detonated outside an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May 2017. Mr Hopkins said he was ""saddened"" by the impact the programme had on families and survivors. The content - which included graphic descriptions of what happened, the injuries that people suffered and mobile phone footage captured in the aftermath - had left him ""most deeply concerned about the impact on families"", he said. ""I fail to see any public interest in footage of such an explicit nature being aired with disregard to the feelings of those who matter most."" One of the programme's final shots stated GMP declined to be involved The Crown Prosecution Service and the coroner had also ""expressed serious reservations"", he said, and British Transport Police ""withdrew support"" after realising the ""potential enormity of the impact"". He also said the documentary had, ""at least by inference, wrongly suggested that officers and staff were held back on the night of the attack."" ""This is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on police officers who, as the actual footage showed, acted bravely in response to this horrific attack."" The force did not contribute to the documentary, but did ask to see footage to ""assess legal implications"" and ""inform and support families"", but were ""not permitted to... at any point before broadcast"". ""As the lead police force, for the response and the criminal investigation, GMP has significant constraints on what we can discuss publicly,"" he said. ""After a face-to-face meeting, we respectfully explained in detail the legal constraints we worked under and highlighted to the production company their own responsibilities."" The programme featured interviews with some of those caught up in the attack He said as a result, a reference in the programme to GMP declining to take part was ""wholly misleading and focused only on creating journalistic drama"". He added that the programme ""appears to breach""the BBC's editorial guidelines. A BBC spokeswoman said Amos Productions had ""worked constructively and appropriately with Victim Support, and the sensitivities of all those involved in this tragic event were subject to careful consideration throughout the production process"". ""This was a responsible, accurate and thoughtful documentary, which was an important piece of public service broadcasting."" ""At no point did the documentary suggest GMP officers and staff were held back"", she said, and it had ""focussed on the events of the evening and how they unfolded, not any ongoing investigations"". She added that the programme adheres to the BBC's guidelines.

"A stag was photographed with rope and buoy tangled in its antlers Images have been released showing red deer stags on a Scottish island with marine pollution tangled in their antlers. Two of the animals on the Isle of Rum died after becoming snarled up together in discarded fishing rope. Another of the deer was photographed with rope and an orange buoy in its antlers. The images have been published by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which manages Rum National Nature Reserve. The photographs were taken a year ago, but only released now following rising concerns about marine pollution. Scotland signs up to global 'ghost gear' pledge Two of the deer died after becoming snarled up in rope Lesley Watt, reserve manager on Rum for SNH, said: ""Marine litter is a huge international problem. But small actions can make a big difference, and everyone has a part to play. ""Along with many organisations, SNH recently joined the campaign to bin plastic straws; and we're cutting down on disposable plastics by providing our staff with re-useable travel cups. ""If you use your own bag for life when shopping, or take litter home after a day at the beach, you could help save an animal's life."" The island's population of red deer have been the subject of scientific research since the 1950s. Researchers study the animals to better understand their behaviour and the effects of climate change on deer. Marine pollution on Rum Dr Richard Dixon, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the photographs of the red deer were a ""strong Scottish symbol of a wasteful attitude"" to the world's resources. He said: ""We are used to some of the images of seabirds and some marine mammals and turtles being affected by plastic waste, but this is very much closer to home. ""These are big mammals being affected by stuff that people have just discarded in the marine environment."" Concerns about the level of pollution in the sea off Scotland, and along its coast are increasingly being raised. This week, a group of volunteers gathered more than 600kgs of rubbish from the shore at Red Point, Gairloch, in Wester Ross. Last summer, scientists said some of the world's deepest living sea creatures had been found to have eaten microscopic pieces of plastic waste. Researchers at the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) in Obansampled starfish and snails from the Rockall Trough off the Western Isles. Tiny pieces of plastic were found in 48% of the sample animals that live more than 2,000m (6,561.8ft) down. Gannet chick with plastic in its nest Also last year, researchers saidmost of the seabirds examined for a study into the effects of marine plastic pollution had swallowed plastic. Researchers, including scientists from North Highland College UHI's Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, investigated 34 species. They found 74% of them had ingested plastic. The research involved seabird colonies in northern Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Greenland, Svalbard, the Faroes and Iceland.

"Mr Trump - seen through a phone - speaks from the Oval Office at the White House US President Donald Trump may not ""block"" Twitter users from viewing his online profile due to their political beliefs, a judge in New York has ruled. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan said that blocking access to his @realDonaldTrump account would be a violation of the right to free speech. The lawsuit against Mr Trump and other White House officials stems from his decision to bar several online critics. The White House has yet to comment on the judge's ruling. The case was brought by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven Twitter users who had been blocked by Mr Trump for criticising him or mocking him online. Mr Trump's Twitter account has steadily grown since taking over the US presidency Judge suggests Trump mute Twitter critics Trump's year on Twitter Trump, Twitter and his 'filter bubble' Twitter is paralysed by Trump's tweeting On Wednesday the judge agreed with their argument that the social media platform qualifies as a ""designated public forum"" granted to all US citizens. ""This case requires us to consider whether a public official may, consistent with the First Amendment, 'block' a person from his Twitter account in response to the political views that person has expressed, and whether the analysis differs because that public official is the President of the United States,"" the judge said in her opinion. ""The answer to both questions is no."" The judge rejected argument by Mr Trump's lawyers that the ""First Amendment does not apply in this case and that the President's personal First Amendment interests supersede those of plaintiffs"". Mr Trump has over 52 million followers on Twitter, his preferred social media platform which he joined in March 2009. He often eschews the official US presidential Twitter account, @POTUS, as well as his own White House press office, to make official announcements. One of the people that Mr Trump blocked, Holly O'Reilly, who uses the account @AynRandPaulRyan, was blocked last May after posting a GIF of Mr Trump meeting with Pope Francis. The photo, which some said showed the Pope glaring at Mr Trump, was captioned: ""This is pretty much how the whole world sees you."" Shortly after being blocked, she told Time Magazine that ""it's like FDR took my radio away"", referring to Franklin Delano Roosevelt - the World War Two-era president who spoke directly to Americans with his so-called fireside chats. Earlier in the trial, Judge Buchwald suggested the president, who was not in court, could simply mute the accounts he does not want to see. People on Twitter are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. But if Mr Trump muted an account, he would not see that user's tweets but the user could still see and respond to his. It's unclear if Mr Trump will now unblock his critics, but the judge hinted the president could face legal action if he did not comply with the ruling. She wrote that ""because all government officials are presumed to follow the law once the judiciary has said what the law is, we must assume that the President [and his social media director] will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional"". Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco When it comes to Twitter, the First Amendment grants the American people the right to speak about the President - but it doesn't force him to listen. While the court has ruled the blocking is unconstitutional, it said the ability to mute a person was not - and so the safe space nurtured by the president and his social media team will remain mostly intact. As I type this, he follows just 46 people, mostly family and Fox News presenters. For many of those he blocked, it's become a badge of honour - a #blockedbytrump topic sprung up as a way of celebrating being shut out by The Donald. But Trump's tweets are a major means by which the president communicates with his people. However history looks back at what is happening within his administration today, tweets will form a crucial part of that record. And while some have argued that anyone blocked by Trump can see his tweets by just logging out, that doesn't necessarily give the whole picture. One tweet sent on Wednesday does not appear in the feed for logged-out users, for example, as it is a ""reply"". Blocking also prevents people from replying to or quoting what was said. The bigger impact here, however, is that this ruling applies to all public officials in the US. And so it won't just be Mr Trump thumbing through and unblocking those who he deems unsavoury.

"The affected staff member reportedly worked at the US consulate in Guangzhou The US state department has urged its staff in China to alert them to any abnormal hearing or vision issues after one employee reported mystery symptoms. The person experienced ""subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure"",external, a statement said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the incident was ""medically similar"" to suspected sonic attacks on diplomatic staff in Cuba. China said it was investigating ""in a very responsible manner"". China-US relations have been strained recently, amid fears of a trade war. The state department said it was taking the incident ""very seriously"", but the US has not accused China of being behind it. What is a covert sonic weapon? In a separate move, the US has rescinded its invitation to China to participate in the forthcoming Rim of the Pacific naval exercise, which brings together the military forces of more than 20 countries. Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Logan said China had been ""disinvited"" because its ""continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region"". He said there was strong evidence China had deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers around the contested Spratly Islands. Embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee said the employee had suffered a ""variety of physical symptoms"" between late 2017 and April 2018 while working at the US consulate in the city of Guangzhou. The employee was sent back to the US, and on 18 May the embassy learnt that they had been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), Ms Lee added. ""We do not currently know what caused the reported symptoms and we are not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community,"" the US diplomatic statement said. ""The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event,"" it said. The statement continues with a warning: ""While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source. Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present."" In a news conference with Mr Pompeo in Washington, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing would protect the lawful rights and interest of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. But he warned against the case being ""magnified, complicated or even politicised"". Parallels have been drawn with the suspected sonic attacks in Havana. Mr Pompeo told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee: ""The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba."" He added that medical teams were on their way to Guangzhou to investigate. ""We are working to figure out what took place, both in Havana and in now in China as well,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""We've asked the Chinese for their assistance in doing that and they have committed to honouring their commitments under the Vienna convention to keep American foreign service officers safe."" He added there was nothing so far to link the China incident directly to Cuba. ""We cannot at this time connect it with what happened in Havana but we are investigating all possibilities,"" a US embassy official in Beijing told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity. Infrasound - below 20Hz at frequencies too low for humans to hear if very loud can cause vertigo, vomiting or uncontrollable defecation would need huge racks of speakers to be effective Ultrasound - above 20,000Hz easier to target possible to direct sound through walls risk of affecting people other than those targeted, including person carrying out attack In November 2016, US diplomats based in Cuba started to complain of odd ailments, including dizziness, nausea and hearing problems. More than 20 members of staff in Havana were harmed in the ""health attacks"", according to the state department. At least two Canadians were also affected. The US has held Cuba responsible, either for allowing the suspected attacks to happen or for carrying them out itself. Cuba has denied any involvement, and described the reports as a ""political manipulation"" aimed at damaging bilateral relations. What is a covert sonic weapon?

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid said he joined his brother on patrol, and witnessed teenagers racially abusing him Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need and says he will make funding for frontline staff a priority. In his first speech to the Police Federation, the home secretary, insisted ""I'm listening and I get it"". Mr Javid also backed calls for spit hoods - mesh guards placed over suspects' heads - across all forces in England and Wales. Labour said it was ""nothing beyond platitudes"" and that action was needed. Mr Javid, whose brother is a chief superintendent in the West Midlands, acknowledged the pressure on forces due to a rise in violent crime and the changing terror threat. He then promised a shift in priorities in a bid to better protect police officers in the next Home Office spending review. Mr Javid said it was ""ridiculous"" the hoods were available to some police forces but not all, committing to do ""everything in my [his] power"" to change this. Spit hoods or guards are designed to stop suspects biting or spitting at police Asked whether the recent rise in violent crime had been the result of falling police numbers, he denied it being down to a ""single driver"" but admitted that without enough resources there would ""clearly"" be an impact. He then pointed out that a decade ago violent crime had risen even though there was no pressure on resources. Previous home secretaries have come under fire for cutting police budgets, but during his speech, Mr Javid said Â£1bn more was already being invested in policing compared to three years ago. Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Policing facing a 'perfect storm' New rules to protect police chase drivers He leant his support to stop and search powers, saying: ""Some of you don't feel comfortable using it - and that's not how it should be. ""I have confidence in your professional judgment. So let me be clear - I support the use of stop and search. ""You have to do your job and that means protecting everyone."" Shadow Policing Minister Louise Haigh rejected Mr Javid's claim he ""gets it"" saying the phrase demonstrates ""denial"" over the effects cuts have had. ""He claims he wants police to have the resources they need, but offers nothing beyond platitudes and the same inadequate funding settlement,"" she said. ""The time for talk has come and gone. The only way Sajid Javid can deliver a 'fresh start' is by putting an end to the Tories' dangerous cuts to our police."" Mr Javid became home secretary in April, afterAmber Rudd resigned her position amid the Windrush revelations. The federation, which represents rank and file officers across England and Wales, has previously shown home secretaries a frosty reception. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Everything was different about this home secretary's speech to the federation. Sajid Javid was applauded onto the stage, and off it. Federation members in the auditorium laughed at his jokes. And, there appeared to be genuine appreciation for his supportive comments about the police service. Unlike Theresa May, and to some extent Amber Rudd, the new home secretary didn't quibble about the crime figures, acknowledging that serious violence was on the rise. He accepted forces were over-stretched. And he came close, the closest any government minister has come, to admitting that, in the phrase favoured by the federation, ""cuts have consequences"". Later, in a short briefing with reporters, Mr Javid said his comments about resources were directed at future needs. But there's no doubt that this 48-year-old brother of a police officer intended his speech to signal a break from the past, and in its tone and substance he managed to achieve it. As of September there were 121,929 officers across the 43 forces, a fall of nearly 20,000 people compared to 10 years ago. Police cuts have come under scrutiny afterfigures have shown an increase in knife and gun crime. In London, 52 people were killed in the first 100 days of 2018,which raised serious concerns about a rise in violent crime. Mr Javid insisted that he is ""absolutely determined"" to end the violence that is ""terminating young lives far too soon"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Scaremongering does nobody any good"" Referring to his brother, Mr Javid added: ""He's been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty. ""I've seen the impact the job has on family life. And, as you would expect from a brother, he doesn't shield me from the truth."" He concluded: ""For those of you who stand in the front line, be in no doubt that I will be standing with you."" Mr Javid said he wanted to ""reset the relationship between government and the police"". He made much of his relationship with his brother, to emphasise a new level of understanding in the Home Office. This video can not be played Sajid Javid's childhood 'gang' story drew laughs from delegates He told delegates: ""You might be thinking 'you're not one of us', as no home secretary has ever served as a police officer"". But, he said, he was the first home secretary with a police officer in his immediate family. After the speech the federation's chair, Calum Macleod, welcomed the change in pace from the home secretary but added ""words are one thing, delivery is something else"".

"Giuseppe Conte has faced allegations of inflating his CV Italy's President Sergio Mattarella has accepted a political novice as prime minister, paving the way for two populist parties to form a government. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League chose law professor Giuseppe Conte in a bid to end 11 weeks of political deadlock. The 53-year-old has faced claims that he embellished his CV, which he denies. Concerns remain over the two parties, which reject years of EU austerity and want to renegotiate Italy's debt. Speaking after emerging from talks with the president, Mr Conte said: ""Outside of this palace there's a country that rightfully awaits a new government and answers. What is about to be born is the government of change."" He added that he would be the ""defender of all Italians on the international and European stage"". Italy has been without a government since elections on 4 March, because no political group could form a majority. Italy populists: What you should know Katya Adler, Europe editor: Should Europe be scared of Italy's populists? Two populist party leaders, Luigi di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the League, finally agreed a coalition deal after days of talks and later nominated Mr Conte as their candidate to be prime minister. The coalition deal promises tax cuts, a guaranteed basic income for the poor and deportations of 500,000 migrants - policies that are likely to put the eurozone's third biggest economy on a collision course with Brussels. Mr Conte will now form a list of ministers to be approved by the president before a new government can be sworn in. The cabinet will then face a vote of confidence in parliament. Populists poised to govern: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (L) and League's Matteo Salvini Fifty-three-year-old Mr Conte, a professor of private law in Florence and Rome, is not an elected MP and until now has been completely unknown in politics. Since his nomination, he has been accused of inflating his academic resume in an effort to boost his international profile. On a CV dating back to 2013, he said he had ""perfected his legal studies"" at New York University, but a spokeswoman for the institution said there was no record of him having studied there. The resume also said he had carried out ""scientific research"" at Cambridge University's Girton College in 2001 - a spokeswoman for the university said it could not confirm or deny his claim citing data protection laws. Mr Conte also said he had worked on his legal studies at the International Kultur Institut in Vienna, Austria. The school - which was misspelt on the CV - is in fact a language school and does not appear to offer legal courses. The Five Star Movement defended its nominee on Tuesday, saying that Mr Conte had never claimed to have earned degrees abroad, but ""went abroad to study, to deepen his knowledge, to perfect his English legal language skills"". It added: ""The defamatory campaign is so explicit and crude that it will only strengthen us."" Read more about the CV controversy The Five Star Movement and The League named Mr Conte for the role of prime minister on Monday. Instead of immediately accepting the nomination, Mr Mattarella took some time to decide, as concerns rose in Italy over Mr Conte's lack of experience and questions over his CV. He has also faced controversy over unpaid taxes and fines of over â¬50,000 (Â£44,000, $51,000). With the president's green light it is now up for the parliament to decide on the coalition. The two parties have sufficient votes in the Chamber of Deputies, but only a small majority in the upper house, the Senate. Italy was ravaged by the 2008 financial crisis that left the economy some 6% smaller and three million more people in poverty. The policies promised by the parties are estimated to cost at least â¬100bn ($117bn; Â£88bn), experts say, for a country with the biggest public debt in the EU after Greece. Other proposals include: Poor families will get a â¬780 basic monthly income, provided recipients actively seek work Two ""flat tax"" rates set at 15% and 20%, and families would receive a â¬3,000 annual tax deduction based on household income Scrapping sales and excise tax increases next year, worth â¬12.5bn Neither Five Star nor The League are fans of the single currency, the euro. League leader Matteo Salvini said not long ago that the euro was ""a mistake"" for Italy's economy, while Five Star had wanted a referendum on Italy's future membership. But they have dropped their initial ambition of exit from the euro and now talk of trying to reform it from within.

"Sony's new CEO John Kodera has announced the PlayStation 4 era could be near an end. Speaking at a company conference, he said the console, released in 2013, was in the ""final phase"" of its life cycle. Don't expect the PS4 to stop production any time soon - but this could be a hint that a new, more powerful console is on the way. Despite being hugely popular, there are signs of PS4 sales slowing down. The announcement has hit some gamers hard. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More than 76 million PS4's have been sold since it was released - but last year, sales were down from 20 million units to 19 million. But while console sales are down - people are buying more games. That's one of the reasons Sony is thinking of releasing more games exclusively for PlayStation, including Last of Us: Part II and Spider-Man. And for those holding out for a clue about a PS5 release date, there was this from Mr Kodera. ""We will use the next three years to prepare the next step, to crouch down so that we can jump higher in the future.""

"This video can not be played ""My life has been turned upside down"" - Yulia Skripal's video statement in full The daughter of an ex-Russian spy poisoned in Salisbury has said she is ""lucky to be alive"" after the attack. Yulia Skripal and her father, Sergei, were exposed to nerve agent Novichok in the city on 4 March. In her first filmed public statement since the attack, Ms Skripal told Reuters that her life had been ""turned upside down"" but she hoped to return to Russia in the future. Her father was discharged from hospital earlier this month. Ms Skripal spent six weeks in Salisbury District Hospital, and was discharged after doctors there said she had responded ""exceptionally well"" to treatment. Speaking to the news agency, she said she was continuing ""to progress with treatment"" and her focus remains on her recovery. ""After 20 days in a coma, I woke to the news that we may have been poisoned. I still find it difficult to come to terms with the fact that both of us were attacked in a such a way."" Ms Skripal thanked the Russian embassy for its offer of assistance. But she said she and her father were ""not ready to take it"". What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? She also paid tribute to those who had treated her since the attack, describing them as ""wonderful and kind"". ""We are so lucky to have both survived this attempted assassination. ""I don't want to describe the details, but the clinical treatment was invasive, painful and depressing. ""Our recovery has been slow and extremely painful."" In the video, a scar on Ms Skripal's neck can be seen which is understood to be from a tracheotomy - a procedure to help patients breathe. Ms Skripal added she would be taking ""one day at a time"" and that she hoped to care for her father until he is fully recovered. Read the letter in full She has asked for her and Mr Skripal's privacy to be respected. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia had continuously tried to contact Ms Skripal ""to get information direct from the source"". ""We want Yulia Skripal to know that there was not a single day when the Russian foreign ministry and the Russian  embassy in London did not try to arrange contact with her, with the chief aim of checking that she is not being held by force, that no one else is being passed off as her,"" she added. Before the statement, the pair had been moved to secure locations but it is not clear if they were together. Ms Skripal, 33, and 66-year-old Mr Skripal were found slumped on a bench following the poisoning. Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was one of the first on the scene, was also admitted to hospital for treatment and was the first to be discharged. The UK responded to the attack, which it blames Russia for, by announcing a number of sanctions including the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. Russia denies any involvement and in turn ordered British diplomats to leave Moscow. Its embassy in the UK has expressed concerns over the legitimacy of the statement, believing it was written ""by a native English speaker"". In a statement, it said: ""The UK is obliged to give us the opportunity to speak to Yulia directly in order to make sure that she is not held against her own will and is not speaking under pressure."" Meanwhile, work to decontaminate the Wiltshire city is still under way with the highest concentration of the Novichok found at the Skripals' front door.

"This video can not be played Michael Rotondo: ""They said you need to get a job"" A New York couple have won their legal battle to evict their 30-year-old son from home after he refused to leave. During a hearing at the state's highest court in Syracuse, a judge praised Michael Rotondo's legal research, but ordered him to leave the house anyway. Justice Donald Greenwood told the son his bid to remain in his parents' home another six months was ""outrageous"". But Mr Rotondo, who legally represented himself, said it was the eviction notice that was outrageous. ""I don't see why they can't just, you know, wait a little bit for me to leave the house,"" Mr Rotondo argued, as his parents looked on, sitting with their lawyer. He said six months was ""a reasonable amount of time for someone who has been depending on persons for support"". Christina and Mark Rotondo were in court The smiling judge urged him to speak to his parents, and to voluntarily leave the house, but Mr Rotondo refused. ""I want you out of that household,"" Judge Greenwood told him, according to ABC News. In a court filing last week, Christina and Mark Rotondo described issuing several orders for their son to move out, starting on 2 February 2018. ""There are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you,"" they wrote in one note, dated 18 February. ""Get one - you have to work!"" Mr Rotondo says his parents told him he could stay with them eight years ago after he lost his job They also gave him $1,100 (Â£819) to leave, according to one letter, which suggested he sell some of his belongings including a broken-down Volkswagen Passat. ""I was originally hoping to give it back,"" he later told CBS outside the family home. Sex and dating when you live with your parents Eviction threat over crying baby Why Utah now has first 'free-range' parenting law Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' ""I had to spend it and I'm not sorry about it,"" he added, telling other local media that it went towards ""expenses"". In court he acknowledged he has never contributed to household chores. After Tuesday's hearing, Mr Rotondo summoned news cameras into a hallway for an impromptu press conference. He told reporters he would appeal against the ruling, and that he had planned to move out of the home in Camillius, New York within three months anyway. The home near Syracuse, New York that is at the centre of the family dispute He said that his relationship with his parents has grown very strained, with the three of them never speaking or interacting inside the home. ""After a while it just kind of beats itself down to where there's nothing left,"" he said. When asked how he can manage to avoid them, and whether he lives in a basement, he replied that he lives in a bedroom but did not want to provide more detail. Mr Rotondo said that his parents said he could stay with them eight years ago after he lost his job. He added that he has a job, but refused to answer questions about it, telling reporters that ""my business is my business"". Mr Rotondo also complained the judge had not properly read his case. He left court, presumably heading back to his parents' home.

"The mother, who cannot be identified, was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. The woman from Birmingham, who is in her 40s, duped the then 17-year-old into going to Pakistan in September 2016 to wed the man. The girl became pregnant by him when she was 13 and he was 29, which her mother saw as a ""marriage contract"". The case is the first successful prosecution of its type. Sentencing the mother at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said the victim had been ""sold for her passport"". Neither the mother nor daughter can be identified for legal reasons. Midlands Live: Man stabbed during 'row over crash'; Train driver 'three seconds from being hit by other train' Jurors had heard the daughter, now aged 19, was fooled into travelling to Pakistan on the promise of getting an iPhone for her 18th birthday. When the plan to marry her to the relative 16 years her senior was revealed, the girl protested. In response her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. ""It takes no imagination to understand the terror she must have felt"", the judge said. ""You had cruelly deceived her. She was frightened, alone, held against her will, being forced into a marriage she dreaded. ""You must have known that was her state of mind. Yet for your own purposes, you drove the marriage through."" Prosecutor Deborah Gould read a victim statement to the court in which the girl said she was proud of herself for coming forward and wanted other young women who found themselves in similar situations to ask for help. The court heard how the wedding was the defendant's idea. The victim's father, who is divorced from her mother, eventually found out and told social services and police. The mother wasfound guilty on Tuesdayof two counts of forced marriage and a count of perjury after she lied to the High Court about the incident. This sentence sends a strong message to potential perpetrators that forcing a person to get married is illegal and punishable by a lengthy term in custody. As the first case of its kind, campaigners hope those who are silently suffering will be encouraged to seek help and speak out about the trauma and psychological damage caused by the coercive measures enforced by their relatives. The irony is those who claim to love them the most are the ones who are destroying their lives through manipulation and deception. @sima_kotecha,external The man the victim went on to marry first had sex with her when she was 13 after the ""marriage contract"" was made. She was then forced to have an abortion upon her return to the UK. The court was told this amounted to ""significant trauma"" which ""fundamentally affected"" her. The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare. In June 2015, a man was jailed at Merthyr Crown Court for offences includingforcing a woman into marrying him, while there is at least one other live case in the courts.

"Mark van Dongen had told his father Kees that he was scared of Berlinah Wallace Warning: this story contains vivid descriptions of dreadful injuries. Berlinah Wallace has been convicted over an acid attack on her former partner, Mark van Dongen, that left him so badly disfigured he chose to end his life. BBC News examines the extraordinary price he paid for rejecting her. When Dr Nic White first saw Mark van Dongen in the street in the early hours of 23 September 2015, in only his underwear, she thought he'd played a prank by covering his face in mud. She said: ""I was woken by the sound of somebody shouting: 'Help me, somebody help me, please.' ""I looked out of the window and there was a guy standing there in his boxer shorts and he looked a really odd colour from his head down to his shoulders. ""My doorbell rang a few times and I knew there was something desperate going on, and it was him. ""He looked like he was covered in a clay sort of mud, which I later realised was his skin melting."" Wallace was cleared of murder and manslaughter but convicted of applying a corrosive fluid The night before, 28-year-old Mr van Dongen had arrived at Wallace's flat, in the affluent Westbury Park area of Bristol, to reiterate that their five-year relationship was over - and to say he was moving in with his new girlfriend, 46-year-old Violet Farquharson. It followed multiple break-ups between Mr van Dongen and Wallace, and mixed signals from him about whether they had a future together. Ex-girlfriend cleared of acid murder Accused in 'prostitution secret' threat Acid victim 'told accused to kill herself In the weeks preceding the acid attack, the engineer had reported Wallace, now 48, to the police for harassment and blackmail, saying she had made 14 silent phone calls to Miss Farquharson and kept threatening to kill herself. He had also told his father he was scared of Wallace, who had once poured boiling water on him, while friends at work said they had seen scratches he said had been inflicted by Wallace during a jealous rage. So perhaps it was surprising he decided to stay the night at her flat - it was a choice he would bitterly regret. Another of Wallace's neighbours, Thomas Sweet, left his flat armed with a golf club as he feared violence and wanted to be able to defend himself. He said: ""I heard what sounded like foxes fighting. ""It sounded like someone in a lot of pain, shouting: 'Help me.'"" Eleanor Elcocks was also woken by the screaming. She said: ""He was shouting and screaming and saying: 'Help me, I'm going to die.'"" Each day Nic White would see the marks Mr van Dongen left on her doorbell, as the acid seared into the metal while it simultaneously melted his skin The neighbours phoned 999 and walked Mr van Dongen to a shower at a building around the corner on Ladysmith Road - unwittingly taking him back towards Wallace's flat. Mr Sweet said: ""He became distressed and was saying: 'She lives there, she lives there.' ""We reassured him we were taking him to a different flat."" Mr Sweet said under the bathroom light it was clear Mr van Dongen had dreadful injuries. ""I told him the police were on their way. ""He said: 'They need to be here, she needs to pay.'"" Mr van Dongen and Wallace, who were both HIV positive, had met on a dating site for people with the virus Paramedic Dean Carter said he arrived at the scene to find Mr van Dongen with chemical burns to his face, abdomen, chest and thighs. ""Mr van Dongen kept repeating: 'I can't see'. At one point he asked me if he still had eyelids,"" Mr Carter said. He said Mr van Dongen was frothing at the mouth with what looked like ""grey-coloured paint"". PC Thomas Green, one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene, described how Mr van Dongen's eyes had turned grey, adding that ""the irises had essentially dissolved"". He travelled in the ambulance with Mr van Dongen, who was ""screaming in pain"" as he was administered gas and air and pointing at a tattoo on his stomach that said ""Berlinah"". ""He said: 'Berlinah Wallace - she needs to go to prison for this.'"" Mr van Dongen worked as an engineer in the construction industry PC Green said Mr van Dongen asked for officers to check on Miss Farquharson's welfare. ""He made reference to him being concerned that Berlinah was going to go to her house,"" PC Green said. When police arrived at Wallace's flat to arrest her, they found the fashion student sitting on her sofa. PC Mathew Griffin asked her what the substance she had thrown was. ""She said it was acid and then indicated to a glass on the floor and said she had been distressing some fabric,"" the officer said. Mr van Dongen had been taken to a decontamination room in Southmead Hospital in Bristol where, according to Dr Rachel Oaten, he let out a blood-curdling scream on seeing his reflection. ""He said: 'Kill me now. If my face is going to be left looking like this I don't want to live.'"" Wallace's trial heard how she had researched the effects of sulphuric acid It took 10 days for police to trace his family in Belgium and so during this time he was alone in intensive care. When his brother Bartje van Dongen finally arrived at the hospital, he didn't recognise Mark. Mr van Dongen spent two months in intensive care before being moved to Southmead's burns unit. During that time he suffered intense pain, recurrent septic chest infections, night terrors and post-traumatic stress disorder. Bartje van Dongen has described his father as ""broken"" Bartje van Dongen said: ""The continuous itching of his scars drove him out of his mind. ""On the arm all the muscle was gone, his bone was slowly being eaten away by the acid. ""My dad sat by his bed 22 hours a day scratching him and moving his arms to try to take the pain away."" Each weekend Kees van Dongen would make the 800-mile road trip from Belgium to be by his son's bedside, sleeping in his van in the hospital car park, sometimes in freezing temperatures. Eventually his marriage to Mark's and Bartje's stepmother broke down under the strain and he is now bankrupt. Bartje is fundraising to help his father rebuild his life. Wallace said she believed she was throwing a glass of water Bartje van Dongen said what Wallace did had ruined several lives. ""Once my dad was a very big man; now he is broken,"" he said. It was a friend of the family who eventually helped to pay for Mark to be transferred to hospital in Overpelt, Belgium, so his father could be with him each day. Once in Belgium, Mark applied for euthanasia, and, after a month, three doctors ruled that his ""unbearable physical and psychological suffering"" meant he was eligible. On 2 January 2017, a catheter was inserted into his heart to allow the drugs that would stop his suffering to be administered. He was 29 years old.

"Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's once fiercely loyal lawyer, has struck a plea deal with prosecutors investigating possible campaign finance violations and tax fraud. Who is he anyway? When an FBI team raided Cohen's office in New York on 9 April, they arrived at a workspace fit for the silver screen. It's 30-odd floors up at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in a corner - but not very spacious - office at the Squire Patton Boggs law firm. Cohen's office is decked out with paraphernalia from his time at the Trump Organization and on Trump's presidential campaign, as well as from superhero movies - Thor's hammer, Captain America's shield. Also hard to miss - a nearly full-length impressionist-style painting of Cohen himself at the press secretary's podium in the White House briefing room. Cohen has remained in Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, during ups and downs at the Trump Organization and on the campaign. But as Cohen has been named a subject of a federal investigation in New York, his relations with Donald Trump have deteriorated. Cohen, 51, had prided himself in going above and beyond the line of duty as the president's personal lawyer. He considered himself Trump's protector. He'll do anything for him,telling Vanity Fair last September,externalhe'd ""take a bullet"" for the president. The day before the FBI raid, Cohentweeted,externala month-old story about him with a Joyce Maynard quote: ""A person who deserves my loyalty receives it"" followed by his own pledge: ""I will always protect our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA"". Cohen is the son of an immigrant who escaped a Nazi concentration camp in Poland. He grew up in Long Island, right outside of New York City, before attending American University in Washington and Cooley Law School in western Michigan. Trump defended Cohen in an unrelated meeting after the FBI raided his office and hotel Back in New York, Cohen worked at a law firm, married an Ukrainian immigrant, ran a successful taxi business and made a failed run for New York City Council, all before entering Trump's orbit. Cohen was introduced to Donald Trump by his son, Donald Jr, in 2006. Cohen's family had purchased a number of properties in the Trump World Tower near the United Nations, and Cohen had become the treasurer of the building's board. He had grown up idolising Trump, reading The Art of the Deal multiple times. So when Trump offered him a job after he had advised on a few legal matters, Cohen was shocked. Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal The porn star scandal Trump can't shake Fox host unmasked as Trump lawyer client He took the job, becoming executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization in 2007. From then on, he was practically part of the family - close with Trump's adult children, regularly dining with them and their spouses. He was also an early fan of the idea of President Trump. In 2011, he helped launch a website, Should Trump Run?, to gauge public opinion. He was on board when Trump announced his candidacy in 2015. Cohen's been described as the president's ""pit bull"" and extension of Trump himself. He speaks with a thick Long Island accent and avoids alcohol much like his boss. Cohen is high energy, speaks assertively and has an affinity for Hermes belts and eccentric jackets. Cohen is not press shy. He prides himself on taking everyone's calls. When a CNN published a story about his role in covering up Donald Trump's alleged affair,externalwith adult film actress Stormy Daniels, he texted it to me. ""How do you feel about being called fixer?"" I asked him. ""Not insulted,"" he replied. Cohen chats with friends ahead of a hearing on the FBI raid But he's also visibly affected by what's written about him. In late 2017 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, Cohen was heard complaining about a recent story written about him. He called it ""fake news,"" saying the only news anyone should believe about him is what comes out of his own mouth. Well before the FBI raid, Cohen was named as a key figure in the alleged Russian effort to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favour. The ""Steele Dossier"" - a report by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by research firm Fusion GPS to investigate Trump - specifically points to a trip Cohen allegedly made to Prague in late summer of 2016 to meet Kremlin representatives. Cohen has repeatedly denied the report or having ever been to the Czech Republic.He recently tweeted another denial,externalin light of a new report claiming Mueller has proofbacking up that element of the dossier,external. But it began to unravel for Cohen when the news broke of a hush money payment he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels - who claims she had an affair with Trump before he was president. Since Special Counsel Robert Mueller began his investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia, Trump had been advised by his other lawyers to keep his distance from Cohen. However - perhaps in a signal of loyalty - Trump had dinner with Cohen the night before Daniels' interview aired on CBS' 60 Minutes. The raid on Cohen's office and hotel in search of files related to the Daniels payment and other matters, however, was a surprise. Cohen was working out of the offices of a major New York law firm ""No-one saw this coming,"" a source familiar with Cohen's thinking on the matter said. Out of all the possible persons of interest to Mueller, Cohen has been closest to the president the longest - save the members of Trump's immediate family. He knows the most. And his legal troubles in New York come from a ""referral"" from the special counsel's office. The southern district of New York - where Cohen's case is being handled - is known for being aggressive. As the federal prosecutors reportedly considered charges against him, his loyalty to Mr Trump seemed to soften - he told ABC News that his top concern was his family. In the immediate aftermath of the FBI raid, Trump came to his friend's defence - both on Twitter, complaining of a witch hunt, and in person, calling Cohen a ""good man"". But his tone soon changed when Cohen's lawyer released audio of a conversation he had with Mr Trump about the Stormy payment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were also reports that Mr Cohen claimed Mr Trump knew in advance of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in 2016 where Russians met members of the campaign with the promise of offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current lawyer, said Mr Cohen had ""lied all his life"". It means that while Trump could theoretically offer a presidential pardon to his former lawyer -as he recently did for Bush-era White House aide Scooter Libby- that now seems a remote possibility.

"Kees van Dongen said looking after his son and the trial had left him financially ""wiped out"" The father of Mark van Dongen, who took his own life a year after his girlfriend poured acid over him, said he is now a ""broken man"". Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at the Dutch engineer in Bristol in 2015 as he slept. In a victim impact statement, Kees van Dongen said he wanted to make sure she got ""the sentence she deserves"". Wallace was found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent and will be sentenced on Wednesday. She was cleared of murder and manslaughter. Fifteen months after the attack, Mark van Dongen, 29, ended his life by euthanasia in a Belgian hospital. He was paralysed from the neck down and had lost a leg, ear and eye. Mark van Dongen and Berlinah Wallace met five years before the attack Kees van Dongen read the statement read to the court on Tuesday as part of submissions to Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ahead of sentencing Wallace. He told how his son had begged him to let him take his own life. ""He said 'dad, I'm tired of fighting, I've suffered so much pain and I can't take any more. Please let me go'."" Speaking about how the experience had affected him, he added: ""I feel like a broken man, completely drained, and the old Kees no longer exists. Mark and I lost our battle. ""In the past, nothing would faze me, but now I have lead in my shoes.""

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid said he joined his brother on patrol, and witnessed teenagers racially abusing him Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need and says he will make funding for frontline staff a priority. In his first speech to the Police Federation, the home secretary, insisted ""I'm listening and I get it"". Mr Javid also backed calls for spit hoods - mesh guards placed over suspects' heads - across all forces in England and Wales. Labour said it was ""nothing beyond platitudes"" and that action was needed. Mr Javid, whose brother is a chief superintendent in the West Midlands, acknowledged the pressure on forces due to a rise in violent crime and the changing terror threat. He then promised a shift in priorities in a bid to better protect police officers in the next Home Office spending review. Mr Javid said it was ""ridiculous"" the hoods were available to some police forces but not all, committing to do ""everything in my [his] power"" to change this. Spit hoods or guards are designed to stop suspects biting or spitting at police Asked whether the recent rise in violent crime had been the result of falling police numbers, he denied it being down to a ""single driver"" but admitted that without enough resources there would ""clearly"" be an impact. He then pointed out that a decade ago violent crime had risen even though there was no pressure on resources. Previous home secretaries have come under fire for cutting police budgets, but during his speech, Mr Javid said Â£1bn more was already being invested in policing compared to three years ago. Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Policing facing a 'perfect storm' New rules to protect police chase drivers He leant his support to stop and search powers, saying: ""Some of you don't feel comfortable using it - and that's not how it should be. ""I have confidence in your professional judgment. So let me be clear - I support the use of stop and search. ""You have to do your job and that means protecting everyone."" Shadow Policing Minister Louise Haigh rejected Mr Javid's claim he ""gets it"" saying the phrase demonstrates ""denial"" over the effects cuts have had. ""He claims he wants police to have the resources they need, but offers nothing beyond platitudes and the same inadequate funding settlement,"" she said. ""The time for talk has come and gone. The only way Sajid Javid can deliver a 'fresh start' is by putting an end to the Tories' dangerous cuts to our police."" Mr Javid became home secretary in April, afterAmber Rudd resigned her position amid the Windrush revelations. The federation, which represents rank and file officers across England and Wales, has previously shown home secretaries a frosty reception. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Everything was different about this home secretary's speech to the federation. Sajid Javid was applauded onto the stage, and off it. Federation members in the auditorium laughed at his jokes. And, there appeared to be genuine appreciation for his supportive comments about the police service. Unlike Theresa May, and to some extent Amber Rudd, the new home secretary didn't quibble about the crime figures, acknowledging that serious violence was on the rise. He accepted forces were over-stretched. And he came close, the closest any government minister has come, to admitting that, in the phrase favoured by the federation, ""cuts have consequences"". Later, in a short briefing with reporters, Mr Javid said his comments about resources were directed at future needs. But there's no doubt that this 48-year-old brother of a police officer intended his speech to signal a break from the past, and in its tone and substance he managed to achieve it. As of September there were 121,929 officers across the 43 forces, a fall of nearly 20,000 people compared to 10 years ago. Police cuts have come under scrutiny afterfigures have shown an increase in knife and gun crime. In London, 52 people were killed in the first 100 days of 2018,which raised serious concerns about a rise in violent crime. Mr Javid insisted that he is ""absolutely determined"" to end the violence that is ""terminating young lives far too soon"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Scaremongering does nobody any good"" Referring to his brother, Mr Javid added: ""He's been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty. ""I've seen the impact the job has on family life. And, as you would expect from a brother, he doesn't shield me from the truth."" He concluded: ""For those of you who stand in the front line, be in no doubt that I will be standing with you."" Mr Javid said he wanted to ""reset the relationship between government and the police"". He made much of his relationship with his brother, to emphasise a new level of understanding in the Home Office. This video can not be played Sajid Javid's childhood 'gang' story drew laughs from delegates He told delegates: ""You might be thinking 'you're not one of us', as no home secretary has ever served as a police officer"". But, he said, he was the first home secretary with a police officer in his immediate family. After the speech the federation's chair, Calum Macleod, welcomed the change in pace from the home secretary but added ""words are one thing, delivery is something else"". ""We have to be able to hold him to account, we have to work with the Home Office and with the government to ensure positive changes for our membership and for the public are achieved, and that needs to start today.""

"The mother, who cannot be identified, was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. The woman from Birmingham, who is in her 40s, duped the then 17-year-old into going to Pakistan in September 2016 to wed the man. The girl became pregnant by him when she was 13 and he was 29, which her mother saw as a ""marriage contract"". The case is the first successful prosecution of its type. Sentencing the mother at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said the victim had been ""sold for her passport"". Neither the mother nor daughter can be identified for legal reasons. Midlands Live: Man stabbed during 'row over crash'; Train driver 'three seconds from being hit by other train' Jurors had heard the daughter, now aged 19, was fooled into travelling to Pakistan on the promise of getting an iPhone for her 18th birthday. When the plan to marry her to the relative 16 years her senior was revealed, the girl protested. In response her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. ""It takes no imagination to understand the terror she must have felt"", the judge said. ""You had cruelly deceived her. She was frightened, alone, held against her will, being forced into a marriage she dreaded. ""You must have known that was her state of mind. Yet for your own purposes, you drove the marriage through."" Prosecutor Deborah Gould read a victim statement to the court in which the girl said she was proud of herself for coming forward and wanted other young women who found themselves in similar situations to ask for help. The court heard how the wedding was the defendant's idea. The victim's father, who is divorced from her mother, eventually found out and told social services and police. The mother wasfound guilty on Tuesdayof two counts of forced marriage and a count of perjury after she lied to the High Court about the incident. This sentence sends a strong message to potential perpetrators that forcing a person to get married is illegal and punishable by a lengthy term in custody. As the first case of its kind, campaigners hope those who are silently suffering will be encouraged to seek help and speak out about the trauma and psychological damage caused by the coercive measures enforced by their relatives. The irony is those who claim to love them the most are the ones who are destroying their lives through manipulation and deception. @sima_kotecha,external The man the victim went on to marry first had sex with her when she was 13 after the ""marriage contract"" was made. She was then forced to have an abortion upon her return to the UK. The court was told this amounted to ""significant trauma"" which ""fundamentally affected"" her. The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare. In June 2015, a man was jailed at Merthyr Crown Court for offences includingforcing a woman into marrying him, while there is at least one other live case in the courts.

"Ride-hailing firm Uber will give its European drivers access to medical cover and compensation for work-related injuries. The new protections include sick pay, parental leave and bereavement payments. Uber said it previously ""focused too much on growth and not enough on the people who made that growth possible"". ""We called drivers 'partners', but didn't always act like it,"" said Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi. The insurance and compensation package will be available to all Uber drivers and Uber Eats delivery couriers across Europe. However, unions have questioned whether the package is new. In April 2017, Uber announced illness and injury insurance cover for its drivers. Uber drivers who wanted to join the scheme were required to pay Â£2 a week. ""I'm highly suspicious - is this a revamp, is this another bite of the cherry to make themselves look caring. What's the story here?"" said Steve Garelick, regional organiser for the gig economy and transport for GMB union. James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union, told the BBC: ""This is not nearly enough. We have statutory rights under the law. What Uber has given us are cosmetic benefits that can be taken away at any time."" Uber's announcement comes before an appeal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court on 25 June, where a judge will decide whether Transport for London (TfL) should renew Uber's private hire operating licence in London. TfL withdrew Uber's operating licence in Septemberon the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". Uber has been allowed to continue operating in the city while it appealed against the decision. Uber said it will provide drivers with a range of insurance coverage and compensation resulting from accidents or injuries that occur while they are working, as well as protection for ""major life events"" that happen whether the driver is on a shift or not. Ever since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as CEO last August he has tried to project an image of a kinder gentler Uber - in marked contrast to the ""take no prisoners"" approach of his predecessor Travis Kalanick. That conciliatory style is evident in this move which Mr Khosrowshahi paints as Uber being ""a better partner"" and ""a better listener"". Drivers are not going to get the kind of benefits they would enjoy as employees but there will be a little something to help them deal with life's ups and downs. But this should all be seen in the light of the looming court hearing in late June over Uber's licence to operate in London. That is expected to hinge not on whether TfL was right to deny the firm a licence last year, but whether it has become a fit and proper business since then. Uber executives are hoping that its actions over the last six months will convince the court that the leopard has changed its spots. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: ""This decision is long overdue and we hope that it is more than simply a PR move to repair their public image. ""Uber and companies like it must put an immediate end to exploitative practices and ensure that their workers have full access to their legal rights, such as the minimum wage."" Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan welcomes ""any commitment to give drivers and couriers in London more security"" according to his spokesperson. Uber drivers have been fighting for better working conditions since 2014 Uber drivers in the UKhave been campaigning for better rights for at least three years,external. In October 2016, a tribunal ruled that twoUK-based Uber drivers should be classed as staff, not self-employed workers, and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. Uber appealed against the decision, arguing its drivers were self-employed and were under no obligation to use its booking app, but in November 2017,the Employment Tribunal upheld its original decisionthat any Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on was working for the company under a ""worker"" contract. Uber continues to appeal against the Employment Tribunal decision and the next appeal hearing will be held on 30 October. Mr Farrar said that Uber should drop its appeal and recognise trade union representation for drivers, if the ride hailing firm wants to show it really does care about driver welfare. In the US, Uber drivers continue to fight in court for the right to be classed as workers.

Mr Lammy's original remarks came asOxford University data,externalrevealed eight of its 29 colleges included in the report accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years. The university has a total of 38 colleges and permanent private halls. The university said it was ""not getting the right number of black people with the talent to apply"". Director of undergraduate admissions Dr Samina Khan told the BBC she was ""pushing hard"" on outreach activity to make sure those students felt welcome. Mr Lammy told the BBC that Oxford was ""failing badly"". Oxford college stands apart on elitism Oxford portrait 'celebrates diversity' Oxbridge even posher than we thought The proportion of Oxford students identifying as black and minority ethnic was 18% in 2017, up from 14% in 2013. However, that figure still falls below the UK university average of 25%. The most recent UK census showed 14% of the UK population identifies as black or minority ethnic. Data in the university's report showed that, of the students that achieved three 'A' grades or higher in their A-levels nationwide, 20% identified as black and minority ethnic. One college, Corpus Christi, which has around 350 students, admitted one black student resident in the UK in its 2015-2017 intakes. Balliol college, which has around 680 students, admitted two black students over the same period, despite receiving 46 applications. The number of admissions from state schools, during the same period, rose by 1%, from 57% to 58%. The report also showed a divide between the north and south of the UK. London and the South East made up 46.7% of UK applications between 2015 and 2017, (and 47.9% of students admitted) while the North East accounted for 2% (2.3% admitted). The story of Oxford University's first black student Why 14 black male Cambridge students posed for this photo Just 11% of last year's Oxford undergraduates were from disadvantaged backgrounds Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Lammy said the university had to explain why - having looked at the data - a person was twice as likely to get in if they were white, not black. Mr Lammy previously accused the university of ""social apartheid,external"", after a Freedom of Information request by him revealed 10 out of 32 Oxford colleges did not award a place to any black British pupil with A-levels in 2015. This prompted more than 100 MPs to write to Oxford and Cambridge urging the universities to recruit more students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. Reacting to the latest figures, Mr Lammy said the problem was ""self-perpetuating"". ""If you're on the 20th floor of a tower block estate and you're getting straight A's, you apply, go for a difficult interview.. you don't get in, then none of the other kids apply the following year."" ""It's very elitist, very, very white,"" student Taiwo Oyebola said. ""For me, applying for Classics, I was very aware I'd be the only black person or one of a few people of colour."" ""We have this joke in lectures, I go in and there's this group we call them the Eton row, because all the Eton boys sit there."" Joshua Tulloch of the Oxford African and Caribbean students society said his organisation was involved in targeting younger black students. ""We have a vast access infrastructure which targets students from as young as Year 9,"" he said. ""The university is supporting us in making sure that we are visible and people can see that they can succeed in Oxford."" Oxford has said it must do more to attract talent from all backgrounds. ""We want a diverse university,"" Dr Samina Khan told Radio 4. The university has agreed to a scheme which would fund the interview travel fees of applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. It said it is doubling its spring and summer schools, which work with students from under-represented backgrounds.

"The post-Brexit customs system favoured by Boris Johnson and other leading Brexiteers could cost businesses up to Â£20bn a year, officials have suggested. The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs told MPs firms would have to pay Â£32.50 for each customs declaration under the so-called ""max fac"" solution. Jon Thompson said any system may take between three and five years to bed in. No 10 said the Â£20bn figure was ""speculation"" but ""issues"" remained with both options being considered. The figure is higher than the Â£13bn UK contribution to the EU in 2016. Leading Tory Brexiteer John Redwood said he did not accept what he described as the HMRC's ""general figures"" but told the BBC that ""if it is going to cost this much it is the wrong system"". The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, which is currently expected to be followed by a 21 month transition phase before the longer term post-Brexit system kicks in. Reality Check: The government's customs options Tory MPs warned over 'botched' Brexit Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? Ministers are currently considering two options to replace the existing customs union with the EU, which involves minimal checks, and which the government is committed to leaving. Brexiteers are sceptical about what is believed to be Theresa May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", under which the UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the country. Their proposed alternative ""maximum facilitation"" proposal would rely on technology and advance verification to minimise, rather than remove, customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. During questioning by the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Thompson said that if ministers opted for the ""max fac"" solution this could cost UK and European businesses between Â£17bn and Â£20bn each year, reflecting the cost of customs declarations and complying with rules of origin requirements. At the moment, UK firms exporting to other EU countries or importing goods from the continent are not routinely required to complete goods declaration forms. Those doing business outside the EU must provide information about the type and value of goods, their destination and their tariff classification so that the right amount of VAT, duty or excise is paid. May defends customs Brexit 'backstop' Brexit customs plan has 'flaws' - Gove HMRC: No need for new border checkpoints Mr Thompson said there were about 200 million exports to the EU each year that could require customs declarations  - and a similar number of imports. Citing research by the University of Nottingham business school and by KPMG, he said the likely cost of individual declarations was between Â£20 and Â£55 - and while an average could not be authoritatively calculated, ministers had been advised a figure of Â£32.50 was plausible. Payments on either side of the border could cost Â£13bn a year in total while it was ""reasonable"" to assume any rules of origin requirements demanded by the EU could add ""several billion pounds"". ""You need to think about the highly streamlined customs arrangement costing businesses somewhere in the late teens of billions of pounds, somewhere between Â£17bn and Â£20bn,"" he said. ""And the primary driver here is the fact that there are customs declarations."" In contrast, he said the customs partnership option - which has been described as ""crazy"" by Boris Johnson and ""flawed"" by Michael Gove - would cost business a maximum of Â£3.4bn a year - depending on how much firms chose to claim back in differential tariffs. It would, he said, take between three to five years to fully implement any new system after Brexit. A ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods crossed a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. While a ""functioning border"" was possible by the end of the transition period it would not be, in his opinion, be ""fully optimal"". But he said no new customs infrastructure would be needed in Northern Ireland. Mr Thompson declined to answer when it was suggested it would be easier if the UK just remained in the customs union - a solution favoured by business but rejected by ministers. Former Conservative cabinet minister John Redwood said the starting point for any new customs system should be existing arrangements for importing goods from outside the EU. ""We have a perfectly good functioning trade system with the rest of the world at the moment,"" he said. ""It does not cost anything like these figures."" The UK, he said, already had a VAT, excise and currency border with the EU based on pre-registration and electronic declarations which, if necessary, could be extended. ""None of these happen physically at the border any more with a man or a woman in a kiosk having to work it out with the lorry waiting. ""It is all done electronically away from the border with electronic manifests and computer registration... If we have to do customs dues as well it is not a greater increase in the complexity.""

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them.

They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

To get that America and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”, his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"Ride-hailing firm Uber will give its European drivers access to medical cover and compensation for work-related injuries. The new protections include sick pay, parental leave and bereavement payments. Uber said it previously ""focused too much on growth and not enough on the people who made that growth possible"". ""We called drivers 'partners', but didn't always act like it,"" said Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi. The insurance and compensation package will be available to all Uber drivers and Uber Eats delivery couriers across Europe. However, unions have questioned whether the package is new. In April 2017, Uber announced illness and injury insurance cover for its drivers. Uber drivers who wanted to join the scheme were required to pay Â£2 a week. ""I'm highly suspicious - is this a revamp, is this another bite of the cherry to make themselves look caring. What's the story here?"" said Steve Garelick, regional organiser for the gig economy and transport for GMB union. James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union, told the BBC: ""This is not nearly enough. We have statutory rights under the law. What Uber has given us are cosmetic benefits that can be taken away at any time."" Uber's announcement comes before an appeal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court on 25 June, where a judge will decide whether Transport for London (TfL) should renew Uber's private hire operating licence in London. TfL withdrew Uber's operating licence in Septemberon the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". Uber has been allowed to continue operating in the city while it appealed against the decision. Uber said it will provide drivers with a range of insurance coverage and compensation resulting from accidents or injuries that occur while they are working, as well as protection for ""major life events"" that happen whether the driver is on a shift or not. Ever since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as CEO last August he has tried to project an image of a kinder gentler Uber - in marked contrast to the ""take no prisoners"" approach of his predecessor Travis Kalanick. That conciliatory style is evident in this move which Mr Khosrowshahi paints as Uber being ""a better partner"" and ""a better listener"". Drivers are not going to get the kind of benefits they would enjoy as employees but there will be a little something to help them deal with life's ups and downs. But this should all be seen in the light of the looming court hearing in late June over Uber's licence to operate in London. That is expected to hinge not on whether TfL was right to deny the firm a licence last year, but whether it has become a fit and proper business since then. Uber executives are hoping that its actions over the last six months will convince the court that the leopard has changed its spots. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: ""This decision is long overdue and we hope that it is more than simply a PR move to repair their public image. ""Uber and companies like it must put an immediate end to exploitative practices and ensure that their workers have full access to their legal rights, such as the minimum wage."" Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan welcomes ""any commitment to give drivers and couriers in London more security"" according to his spokesperson. Uber drivers have been fighting for better working conditions since 2014 Uber drivers in the UKhave been campaigning for better rights for at least three years,external. In October 2016, a tribunal ruled that twoUK-based Uber drivers should be classed as staff, not self-employed workers, and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. Uber appealed against the decision, arguing its drivers were self-employed and were under no obligation to use its booking app, but in November 2017,the Employment Tribunal upheld its original decisionthat any Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on was working for the company under a ""worker"" contract. Uber continues to appeal against the Employment Tribunal decision and the next appeal hearing will be held on 30 October. Mr Farrar said that Uber should drop its appeal and recognise trade union representation for drivers, if the ride hailing firm wants to show it really does care about driver welfare. In the US, Uber drivers continue to fight in court for the right to be classed as workers.

"This video can not be played M&S boss says firm too 'inward looking' Marks and Spencer has suffered a big fall in annual profits following a costly store closure plan. Annual pre-tax profits fell by almost two-thirds to Â£66.8m as sales of food, clothing and homeware all declined. On Tuesday the retailer said it plans to close 100 shops by 2022,accelerating an overhaul that it says is ""vital"" for its future. The expense of closing stores and revamping the business cost M&S Â£321m in the 12 months to March. M&S has already shut 21 stores and revealed the location of 14 further closures on Tuesday. ""This modernisation programme ... is to close some of the small stores where we can't give the full offer, and show customers in our better stores, our bigger stores the full range of what M&S does,"" chief executive Steve Rowe toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It is a catch-up programme, we have to make sure we don't stop modernising our estate and that we give our customers the stores that they deserve."" Once again, M&S has posted another set of falling sales and profits. Revitalising this 132-year-old business is costing it dear, but what's more striking is the sober message and language that accompanied the numbers. Marks had become a top heavy business, inward looking, ""too corporate"" and had lost its appeal to family-age customers.  The need for change had become more urgent. Vast sums have already been spent on a new website and a Â£200m fulfilment centre at Castle Donington under the previous boss. Eyebrows will now be raised that the new warehouse is already struggling to cope with demand and the website is too slow. M&S still has a mammoth challenge ahead to revive its fortunes. But at the end of the day, it all comes to down to having the right product, the right availability at the right price. Closing stores is one of those difficult tasks. For the clothing and home shops that remain, the company has to make sure that there is a compelling enough offer to pull shoppers in. Mr Rowe declined to say how many jobs would be lost as a result of the store closure programme. ""We're assessing this on a store-by-store basis and are committed to redeploying our colleagues wherever possible,"" he said. ""In the last round of closures, 86% were redeployed to another store and we want to have continuity."" M&S has been criticised for failing to revive its clothing range. Mr Rowe said the retailer had made its clothes ""more contemporary"" and pointed out that, for the first time in seven years, it had gained customers in womenswear. M&S to close 100 stores by 2022 How can M&S get back in fashion? M&S results: Live reaction The company also wants internet sales to account for a third of its business, but it admitted that its online performance was behind its competitors and the website was too slow. Mr Rowe said: ""Our product pages need to download quicker than they are if they are to be the best in class and our search needs to be made easier. ""We are doing those changes to the website now and are continuing to treat this as business as usual. Making the website fit for the future is largely covered in our core operating costs."" One big problem is the company's distribution centre in Castle Donington, which handles online orders. ""It is a difficult thing for us at the moment,"" Mr Rowe said. ""It has failed in its customer proposition and that's not good enough at a time when customers want more merchandise delivered quicker."" He said M&S aimed to expand the website to better compete against its rivals. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said M&S needed to quickly revamp online: ""You can boost profits with fewer stores only if you can drive online sales growth and, on that front, M&S is well behind."" Bryan Roberts, retail analyst at TCC global, said: ""In clothing we've seen green shoots of recovery, but the business still lacks any sense of identity ... M&S used to be famous as a destination for certain products, such as good quality school uniforms, but that's been lost somewhere along the way. A back-to-basics approach should help it reclaim ground lost to stores less beholden to a seasonal structure."" Last year sales of clothing and homeware slid 1.9% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the effect of new stores, while like-for-like food sales also declined by 0.3%. The results were not as bad as some analysts had feared and shares in M&S rose 4.5% in morning trading to 305p. However, the share price is still down more than a fifth over the past year.

Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner Hilda Farmer, 79, left itsomewhere near Cheltenham General Hospital on Friday, but could not remember where. It was found on Tuesday in a car park about 900m from the hospital and had been ticketed three times by wardens. Mr Elliott said it was ""marvellous"" to have the vehicle back. Ms Farmer thought she had left it on a street  ""within a mile and half"" of the hospital with ""nice houses on one side"" and ""greenery on the other"". But after it was discovered in St George's Road car park, she said she must have ""dreamt it when I realised I couldn't find the car"". ""It's been quite a five days,"" Mr Elliott added. ""I hope I can remember how to drive."" The car, which had been missing for five days, was ticketed three times by wardens He said Ms Farmer's granddaughter had located the car with help from her social media followers after the story was featured online. Several people contacted the BBC to say they had also seen it. Cheltenham Borough Council said the car had been given a number of tickets ""as any vehicle without a valid ticket would"". A spokesman said they would not immediately cancel the charges but pointed the couple to the authority's appeals process.

"The controversial image, posted on the day of the royal wedding, has been deleted A German company has apologised after posting an image of a chocolate-covered marshmallow sweet in a bridal dress on the day of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Super Dickmann's post of a Schokokuss (chocolate kiss) included the caption: ""What are you looking at? Wouldn't you also want to be Meghan today?"" Some social media users said the now-deleted image was ""racist"". A spokesperson for the company called the post ""stupid and embarrassing"". After users denounced the post on the company's Facebook page, Super Dickmann's wrote: ""A big pardon! The world of Super Dickmann's is colourful and diverse and far from racist thoughts."" The post has been deleted but images of it have circulated on social media. German broadcaster ZDF was criticised for some comments during their wedding coverage The image of the Schokokuss, a well-known German sweet, appeared inside a cathedral with the words ""a foam in white"", a reference to its creamy interior, a pun on the phrase ""a vision in white"". Spokesman Bernd Roessler said the firm had not put enough thought into the post. Links between the sweet and racism are not new as it used to have a far more offensive name in Germany and elsewhere, roughly translated as black person's kiss. German public broadcaster ZDF has also come in for criticism for its coverage of the royal wedding, with people on social media saying some of the comments during its programming were ""racist"". The controversial remarks included describing Ms Markle as ""exotic"" several times, saying that the Queen was ""turning a blind eye to Meghan"" and that thegospel singers of the Kingdom Choir""sang beautifully black"". ZDF rejected the claims,externalsaying it was appropriate to address Ms Markle's origins, newspaper Der Spiegel reports. By Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Last weekend Berlin's annual carnival of culture drummed and danced its way through crowded city streets. People dressed in the national costumes of countries like Colombia, Ghana, Albania, Japan and Senegal paraded together in the May sunshine. This is how Germany likes to present itself: multicultural and open to people of all ethnicities. But last year, after spending just a week here, a team of UN inspectors accused the country of ""institutional racism"", claiming that people of African descent experienced discrimination on a daily basis. Regular outbursts of xenophobia from the far-right AfD are well reported - usually to widespread disgust. But the party's openly racist election campaign saw them enter the Bundestag for the first time last year. And a recent investigation found that people with Arabic or Turkish surnames were likely to be rejected by landlords in favour of those with obviously German names. Perhaps Germany is no worse than many other former colonial powers in its racism - conscious or otherwise. But, given the country's past, it is surprising and, for many, a source of great shame.

"Husnain Rashid allegedly provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"" over the internet An Islamic State supporter encouraged ""lone wolf"" attackers to target Prince George and inject poison into supermarket ice creams, a court heard. Husnain Rashid, 32, of Leonard Street in Nelson, Lancashire provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"" over the internet, the prosecution alleges. He is accused of calling for the prince to be targeted at Thomas's Battersea primary school in south-west London. Mr Rashid denies six terrorism offences at Woolwich Crown Court. The jury was told that the former mosque teacher, who also used to work for a tyre business, ran a ""prolific"" online channel named the ""Lone Mujahid"". He is accused of posting a photograph of the four-year-old prince, along with his school's address, a silhouette of a jihad fighter and the message: ""Even the royal family will not be left alone."" Omar Ali Hussain travelled to Syria to fight for Islamic State but is now thought to be dead He also allegedly advised a British terrorist in Syria named Omar Ali Hussain on how to make successful attacks, including bringing down ""enemy"" aircraft with lasers. The court heard that Mr Hussain was the main person contacted by the defendant who had himself ""made preparations"" to fight for Islamic State abroad. Other alleged targets he suggested included a Halloween Parade in New York and railway stations in Australia. Mr Rashid is accused of encouraging attackers to target Prince George at his primary school Prosecutor Annabel Darlow said: ""His proposals were indiscriminate and made no distinction between adult and child, between members of fighting forces and civilians. ""His suggestions included injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school."" Ms Darlow said Mr Rashid specialised in supporting lone attackers with ""every conceivable type of attack"" including the use of bombs, chemicals and knives. He is also accused of distributing the al-Qaeda terror magazine Inspire, and allegedly wanted to travel to Syria to fight in Islamic State territories. The court heard when police raided his house he ""hurled"" a phone containing a ""treasure trove"" of evidence over a wall and into an alleyway. Mr Rashid denies three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, one of encouraging terrorism, two of dissemination of a terrorist publication, and one of failing to comply with a notice under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. The allegations span a period between October 2016 and April this year. The trial continues.

"The foreign secretary is taking commercial flights on his current tour of South America Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said he ""probably needs"" a plane to help him travel the world and promote the UK's interests. Cabinet members can use the RAF Voyager for official business but Mr Johnson said it ""never seems to be available"". Asked by reporters if he would like a ""Brexit plane"", Mr Johnson said he would - if costs were not ""exorbitant"". Mr Johnson is taking commercial flights for his current five-day tour of South America. On his outbound flight from London, Mr Johnson travelled to Spain before catching a connecting flight to Peru. The stop-over added five hours to the journey time. Boris Johnson: First visit by foreign secretary to Argentina for 25 years PM charters flight as royals use official RAF Voyager ""The taxpayers won't want us to have some luxurious new plane, but I certainly think it's striking that we don't seem to have access to such a thing at the moment,"" said the foreign secretary. He added: ""If there's a way of doing it that is not exorbitantly expensive then yes I think we probably do need something."" Mr Johnson also questioned the drab colour of the Voyager, saying: ""Also, why does it have to be grey?"" The Royal Family and cabinet members share the RAF Voyager The Voyager has been available for both cabinet members and the Royal Family since undergoing a Â£10m refit in 2016. To keep costs down, the aircraft also conducts air-to-air refuelling missions for the RAF. Mr Johnson said the plane's multiple users mean it is difficult for senior ministers to book. ""What I will say about the Voyager, I think it's great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of,"" he said. The Queen is understood to have priority use of the plane, followed by Prince Charles. The prime minister is then third in line, before other government ministers. Other jets are available - one of which Mr Johnson used to fly to Russia in November - but the foreign secretary complained those planes had not been upgraded in almost 40 years. Tony Blair had plans for a prime ministerial jet - labelled ""Blair Force One"" - but the project was abandoned as a cost-saving measure by his successor Gordon Brown. Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""There are flights available for ministers when they need them.

"Facebook is asking British users to send naked photos of themselves to the social network, to try to stop revenge porn. If you're worried an intimate photo of you could be shared by someone else, the idea is to get it blocked before it appears online. Similar technology is used to try to stop the spread of child abuse images. Facebook's been testing the systemin Australiaand is extending the trial to the UK, the USA and Canada. A spokesman told Newsbeat the idea is open to people in the UK now. Revenge Porn: What to do if you're a victim Facebook hasn't revealed any details about how the trial in Australia went - but obviously, the idea requires a huge leap of faith. Would you send sexually explicit photos of yourself to Facebook? Could you be certain the image would be handled sensitively - and crucially, not shared? If there's an image you're worried about, Facebook says you should contact its partner for the trial. In the UK, it's theRevenge Porn Helpline.,external Staff there will then get in touch with Facebook and you'll get sent a link to upload the photo. This video can not be played WATCH: My revenge porn story Facebook's Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis told Newsbeat that photos will only be seen by ""a very small group of about five specially trained reviewers"". They'll give the photo a unique digital fingerprint - something called hashing. That code will then be stored on a database. If anyone else tries to upload the same photo, the code will be recognised and it'll be blocked before it appears on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. The original photos will not be stored. Antigone Davis admits there's ""no 100% guarantee when it comes to photo-matching technologies"". That's because it's possible to manipulate images so they're different to the original. But she says they are getting better at it. This whole system only works if you actually have the image you're worried about. If, for example, your ex took a load of photos on their phone and you don't have them, this idea doesn't help.

"Transport questions starts Commons day Urgent question in M&S followed by Business statement Select committee reports back on Carillion and NI democracy Debate on motion on persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslim community Esther Webber, Richard Morris and Ryan Brown Jeremy Corbyn says he is not asking or advocating for a border poll but would ensure the GFA is implemented. What happened? House of CommonsParliament An urgent question on branch closures by Marks and Spencer had MPs from across the house stating their concern at job losses in their constituencies. M&S announced earlier this week they wouldclose 100 shops by2022. The company says the changes are ""vital"" for their future. Future business in the Commons was announced, with MPs still not receiving news of dates for further EU legislation, this caused annoyance from Labour MPs, who accused the government of leaking dates to the Sky News political editor, Faisal Islam.

The Commons returns on 4 June for Home Office questions, followed by the second reading of theIvory Bill,external. The Brexit select committee criticises the lack of agreement on trade arrangements. Ahmadiyya Muslims debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says that while MPs have focused on Pakistan, ""the UK is not immune to this scourge of religious intolerance"" and he apologises to the community. He says it is worrying that ""minorities worldwide"" are increasingly being targeted. It is not acceptable for any organisation or individual to incite violence, he states. ""All religious persecution in whatever form it manifests itself is abhorrent and deplorable,"" he adds. The government is responding to extremist influences with a ""cross-government, joined up approach"", he finishes. With that, the Commons adjourns for Whitsun week, and will return on 4 June. Andrea Leadsom says she is ""confident"" she can update MPs about the Brexit bill soon. Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes says that Ahmadis believe that they are Muslims, yet in 1974 the Pakistani government amended the constitution to declare Ahmadiyya Muslims as non-Muslim. There are concerns that there are not fair trials offered to those accused of being an Ahmadiyya Muslim under the blasphemy laws in Pakistan, she adds. Ahmadis are effectively denied the right to vote under current electoral laws in the country, she states. She says many Ahmadi Muslims have fled to Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand, and Ahmadis have been declared as ""deviant"" in Indonesia, she adds. Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Patrick Grady says the SNP ""are deeply disappointed"" that the Pakistani government ""continues to condone"" the work of those who are critical of the Ahamadi community. He says there are laws in Pakistan which are supposed to tackle ""blasphemy"" but instead are used to tackle other religions ""by name"", adding that these practices have ""gone on for decades"". In order for people to complete a Pakistani passport application, people must denounce the founder of the Ahmadi movement, he states. MPs say it is 'highly unsatisfactory' that ministers have yet to detail post-Brexit trading arrangements. Committee tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey says that in his constituency ""it has been one of the joys"" to get to know the Ahmadiyya community. He says there is a need to speak to the communities in both the UK and in Pakistan to encourage more tolerance. There is a concern that persecution of the community is becoming ""endemic and deep rooted"" in Pakistan. He finishes by saying there is consensus for the UK government to tell the Pakistani government that the current situation is ""unacceptable"". Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Justine Greening says that the establishment of the Ahmadiyya community in her constituency led to the first mosque ever built in London in 1926. The Ahmadiyya community ""got everybody together after the 7/7 bombings many years ago,"" she states. She refers to literature which is put out in areas such as Ealing which may encourage shopkeepers not to serve people of the Ahmadiyya community. This is ""totally unacceptable"" on our own doorstep, she says. Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of CommonsParliament Siobhain McDonagh takes the House on a ""global tour"" of the persecution of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, focusing on Pakistan and then turning to the hate ""overspill"" into the UK. The Labour MP says revealing oneself as Ahmadi can make one a ""magnet"" for persecution. Ms McDonagh says that the world's largest Ahmadiyya community exists in Pakistan and that perpetrators of persecution are given ""free rein"" there. In the country the sect is not legally allowed to call itself Muslim. The MP says persecution in Pakistan is faced ""from cradle to grave"". She says that they have effectively been denied the right to vote in the country for 40 years. Ms McDonagh gives example of persecution in the UK including the murder of an Ahmadi Muslim in the UK which was ""celebrated"" by some on social media. She also speaks about problems on student campuses. She ends her speech by telling the house that the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community are a ""vital part"" of her constituency. Competition and state aid debate House of LordsParliament Lib Dem Lord German responds to Baroness Noakes' earlier criticism of the subcommittees, saying their ""primary purpose is to scrutinise"". Brexit is the ""one show in town and it's perfectly appropriate to do that scrutiny"", he adds. He says on the report under discussion that the UK has a robust competition framework and ""continuing that robust regime is very important"". Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of CommonsParliament Ahmadi Muslims in Cardiff took to the streets to pick up litter on New Year's Day this year. Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh has tabled a debate on the persecution of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The Ahmadi follow the teaching of the Koran but they do not believe that Mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind. For this reason it is regarded by orthodox Muslims as heretical. The Anhmadiyya community takes its name from its founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was born in 1835 and was regarded by his followers as the messiah and a prophet. Last year,the BBC reportedclaims of discrimination against Ahmadi Muslims in Cardiff. Members of the sect said they had been shunned by other Muslims in the city with one member claiming to have lost his job. Northern Ireland Committee Report Debate House of CommonsParliament Dr Andrew Murrison introduces his committee's report Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland. The chair of the Northern Ireland Committee recommends that the Northern Ireland Secretary restarts devolution talks and says there is a ""sense of drift"" where important decisions are not being made. The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in January 2017 when the deputy first minister resigned. Northern Ireland has had neither an Executive nor a functioning
Assembly at Stormont for well over a year. The report concludes that ""that little would be achieved by holding
yet another election"". The committee identifies a number of ""wide reaching"" decisions that need to be taken immediately, a list that is ""growing every day"". Dr Murrison identifies problems such as a lack of a Northern Ireland Policing Board meaning that senior police appointments cannot take place. Committee tweets Allow Twitter content?

Carillion Statement House of CommonsParliament The Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, tells MPs that the taxpayer and the the public ""deserve"" to know what happen to Carillion. She says the committee identified ""clear and compelling problems"" with the business in the months before its collapse. The chair says there is ""great secrecy"" around government contracts and that they are ""skewed"" to the contractor rather than service user. Ms Hillier warns that ""secrecy leads to a cosy relationship"". The committee found in November 2017 that a provisional black rating of Carillion was recommended but following representation from the company the cabinet did not confirm the designation. Carillion collapsed less than two months later. She tells the government, there may be information the committee may put into the public domain at later date.

She continues: ""I question whether we should be working in this way - is it reasonable and proportionate?"" She also says the fact that ministers have ""dealt with [the number of reports on Brexit] in good heart is a tribute to them"". Carillion Statement House of CommonsParliament The Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier is making a statement on Carillion. The select committee published itsreport,external: Government risk assessments relating to Carillion yesterday. The report includes a number of risk assessments relating to Carillion. Papers show that it was not until after Carillion issued a profit warning on 10 July 2017, that the government downgraded the company to a red rating. Previously it had been rated amber for a number of months due to its performance against contracts with the defence and justice ministries. Carillion collapsed in January under a debt of Â£1.5bn. It employed 43,000 people, around 20,000 of them in the UK, thousands of whom lost their job. The construction company held numerous public contracts, such as the maintenance of schools and prisons, all of which had to be brought under government control, at a cost to the taxpayer.

"Researchers are to visit Loch Ness next month DNA sampling is to be used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness. Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. He said a ""biological explanation"" might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. The team will collect tiny fragments of skin and scales for two weeks in June. Film's lost Nessie monster prop found in Loch Ness Fallen branches 'could explain Loch Ness Monster sightings' Prof Gemmell, from the University of Otago in Dunedin, said: ""I don't believe in the idea of a monster, but I'm open to the idea that there are things yet to be discovered and not fully understood. ""Maybe there's a biological explanation for some of the stories."" The University of the Highlands and Islands' UHI Rivers and Lochs Institute in Inverness is assisting in the project. After the research team's trip to Loch Ness, the samples will be sent to laboratories in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark and France to be analysed against a genetic database. Prof Gemmell said: ""There's absolutely no doubt that we will find new stuff. And that's very exciting. ""While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness - the UK's largest freshwater body."" The scientist said the team expected to find sequences of DNA from plants, fish and other organisms. He said it would be possible to identify these plants and animals by comparing the sequences of their DNA against sequences held on a large, international database. Prof Gemmell added: ""There is this idea that an ancient Jurassic Age reptile might be in Loch Ness. ""If we find any reptilian DNA sequences in Loch Ness, that would be surprising and would be very, very interesting."" Monster Inc: A brief history of the Nessie phenomenon A knitted Nessie made for the Inverness Loch Ness International Knitting Festival The Loch Ness Monster is one of Scotland's oldest and most enduring myths. It inspires books, TV shows and films, and sustains a major tourism industry around its home. The story of the monster can be traced back 1,500 years when Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Later, in the 1930s, The Inverness Courier reported the first modern sighting of Nessie. In 1933, the newspaper's Fort Augustus correspondent, Alec Campbell, reported a sighting by Aldie Mackay of what she believed to be Nessie. Mr Campbell's report described a whale-like creature and the loch's water ""cascading and churning"". The editor at the time, Evan Barron, suggested the beast be described as a ""monster"", kick starting the modern myth of the Loch Ness Monster. Over the years various efforts have tried and failed to find the beast. In tourism terms, there are two exhibitions dedicated to the monster and there is not a tourist shop in the Highlands, and even more widely across Scotland, where a cuddly toy of Nessie cannot be found. In 2016, the inaugural Inverness Loch Ness International Knitting Festival exhibited knitted Nessie's made from all parts of the world. In popular culture, the Loch Ness Monster has reared its head many times, including in 1975's four-part Doctor Who - Terror of the Zygons, the 1980s cartoon The Family-Ness as well as The Simpsons and 1996's Loch Ness starring Ted Danson. In 2014, it was reported that for the first time in almost 90 years no ""confirmed sightings"" had been made of the Loch Ness Monster. Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said no-one had come forward in 18 months to say they had seen the monster. But last year,sightings hit a record high.

He is the latest high-profile policing figure to question current drugs policy following Durham Chief Constable Mike Barton. Sgt Kempton's comments, made at a Police Federation conference debate on the causes of gang and knife crime, came as officers were told they should be focusing more on recreational drug users. Sheldon Thomas, a former offender who now runs Gangsline, said tackling street gangs failed to address the ""middle classes"" who were spending thousands of pounds on class A drugs, such as cocaine. Sgt Kempton agreed, saying street gangs sold drugs to ""middle class"" professionals because it was more lucrative. ""If I could only stop one group I'd stop the middle class dealers,"" he said. But the officer said an independent royal commission was needed to investigate the evidence for an entirely fresh approach. ""I don't know much but I know prohibition doesn't work,"" he said. ""I don't know what the answer is but we've got a century or more in this country to demonstrate that prohibition isn't working yet."" Sgt Kempton, who has spent 10 years investigating and tackling drugs, said the Portugal system was ""really interesting"". ""Across the board you see far less drug use and that's had a knock-on effect to some crime types, particularly acquisitive crime,"" he said. Speaking to the BBC later, he said: ""We need a properly informed and robust debate where we're confident to express what we're trying to achieve."" He said his views did not represent official Police Federation policy, saying that officers would continue to enforce the law. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Drug misuse can devastate lives, ruin families and damage communities. This government's approach remains clear - we must prevent drug use in our communities and support people through treatment and recovery. ""Last year we released a comprehensive drugs strategy, setting out a balanced approach which brings together police, health, community and global partners to tackle the illicit drug trade, protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover and turn their lives around.""

"Police in Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where a 17-year old girl was shot dead in a drive-by attack Claim:London has overtaken New York for murders for the first time in modern history after a surge in knife crime across the capital. Verdict:A selective use of statistics from the start of 2018 appears to bear this out - but the reality is that New York still appears to be more violent than London. Criminologists and police chiefs love studying the differences and similarities in violence between big cities because the huge amounts of data can give clues as to what works best to keep people safe. There has been no end of comparisons down the decades of London and New York because, on the face of things, the cities are broadly comparable. They're both cosmopolitan ""world cities"" with broadly similar populations of more than 8 million people. They also have big gaps between rich and poor inhabitants. But there has always been one significant difference: the crime rate. So this weekend'sreport,externalin the Sunday Times, which could be interpreted as suggesting that London was now more dangerous than New York, needs some unpicking. And, as you may have come to expect from BBC Reality Check, the truth is a little more complex. New York police have opened 50 murder files so far this year - this compares with 48 in London According to the newspaper, London overtook New York's ""murder rate"" in February ""as the capital endured a dramatic surge in knife crime"". That is true. The New York Police Department dealt with 11 homicides in February - while London's Metropolitan Police opened investigations into 15 deaths. And in March, there were 22 killings in London and one fewer on the other side of the Atlantic. But that grim month-by-month tally is not quite the whole story. The one thing that's always true about statistics is that there will be blips - sudden rises or falls in the data. These two high months for London could ultimately turn out to be outliers. We don't yet know. But older data shows why we should be cautious. In January, for example, the Met investigated eight murders in London. The NYPD looked into 18 killings. And that means that while Scotland Yard has opened 48 homicide inquiries so far this year, New York has in fact opened 50 murder files. Looking at 2017, the homicide rate per 100,000 population stood at 1.2 in London and 3.4 in New York. While the difference between the two cities has definitely narrowed - the trend is far from fixed. And even older figures are also quite revealing. In 2007, New York witnessed 496 homicides. That was three times more than in London. Last year, the American city suffered 292 killings and London 130. The rate of killings so far this year in London is higher than it was during the same period last year. The fatalities include five shootings and 31 stabbings. Nine of those killed were teenagers and crimes involving knives and sharp instruments across England and Wales are at their highest level since 2011. Why the rate is going up in London, so far this year, is unclear. There's a push for police to stop and search more suspects for weapons after a big fall in the use of the power since 2010. But New York police have also reduced their use of similar powers over the same period - and their murder rate has fallen. New York is definitely a much safer place than in 1990 when there were 2,262 murders. But it's not remotely clear yet that London is becoming more murderous than its American cousin.

"That stalwart of the high street, Marks and Spencer, has announced that100 stores will close by 2022. Falling sales - and the shift to online shopping - has made it harder to justify keeping them all open. So what can M&S do to avoid further closures and entice more people back into its stores? We asked shoppers, a retail analyst and a fashion blogger for their advice. Bayley Freer mainly goes into M&S for food ""What do I like [about M&S]? That's a tricky one,"" says Bayley Freer. She went in to look for shoes because she thinks M&S does ""sometimes have stuff that can be quite cool from a design perspective"". Alas, nothing caught her eye. Bayley often shops at M&S for food - but not often for fashion. ""I've found the odd piece which I've liked, but generally I'm more disappointed than I am happy with the clothes in there."" Sometimes it's the fabric quality, sometimes the colours are ""off-kilter"", and sometimes they've ""put odd detailing on"" when they should have stuck to a more simple design. Bayley also thinks the presentation of the shoes needs changing:""It's a little bit off-putting to go in and see racks and racks and racks of shoes - it's a bit warehousey. I feel as though I'm just buying something that's just part of a batch, a big batch."" Jeremy Schwartz has worked at Coca Cola, News International, L'Oreal and Sainsbury's. Until late last year he was chief executive of the Body Shop - another brand that has struggled but has now returned to growth. So what would he recommend for M&S? ""Big, heritage brands just look dated, slow and lack an image of innovation,"" he says. Management needs to overcome its fear of the bold and make some big changes, Jeremy adds. ""Transform the huge M&S clothing floors into dramatically discreet, character-full, personality-rich 'independent stores' to create an emporium of discovery."" Customers are looking for both authenticity and modernity, unbelievable value but also luxury, he says. Choose one particular product category and really go to town, Jeremy suggests, creating a ""palace of couture"" - but also offer value basics, such as ""50p underwear that you can't help telling your friends about"". ""The alternative is slow, or even accelerating decline,"" he warns. M&S does have an extremely loyal customer base, but even they are calling for changes, says Kate Hardcastle, founder of retail consultancy Insight with Passion. She says for years customers have been telling the retailer to re-engineer the basics such as underwear, T-shirts and suits. The success of Alexa Chung's suede skirt didn't last Kate also thinks they could learn from the success of the Â£10 meal deal and their beauty advent calendar, which stood for ""luxury at an affordable price"". Why not offer more promotions in homeware and fashion? And as for fashion? ""They were so tone-deaf with their customers that their tie-ups with celebrities like Alexa Chung have been off-key,"" she says. Alexa Chung's suede skirt was a big hit at the time, but Kate doesn't think the campaign worked in the long run. ""M&S is for the masses - but they need to streamline the range. Customers will still rave about a certain product - like black tights for winter, their thermal collection or men's chinos and they should have worked their 'magic' in these areas."" Stephanie Roper was a graduate manager for M&S after leaving university 15 years ago. But its intolerance of creativity prompted her to leave after 12 months to join H&M. She still doesn't think M&S is getting it right: ""A few years ago waterfall cardigans were really fashionable - those are cardigans with a wave of fabric down the front. They're very good to conceal a tummy. M&S did it to death - in denim, satin, linen."" ""John Lewis, Topshop, Debenhams, all offer personal styling, providing one to one advice on putting outfits together. M&S is missing a trick if they don't start implementing that right now,"" she says. Stephanie suggests M&S could offer a classic collection including the perfect jeans, white shirt, cashmere jumper and trench coat in a  limited range of classic colours - and add a piece every season from the archive. Lingerie should be M&S's forte, but using ""stick-thin"" supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to advertise underwear could be putting off the average shopper, she thinks. ""I'd do a tie-in with a plus-size blogger to show them M&S think if you're size 16 you're totally normal [to say] we'll find you the right bra and pants and celebrate your figure."" Pamela, Janet and Alexis make a point of coming to M&S when visiting from the US Janet, Pamela and Alexis from the US go to M&S every time they visit the UK. There doesn't seem to be anything they'd change about the brand. ""Any time we come, we always come to Marks and Spencer, every time we visit,"" says Janet. ""It's got a variety of things - the foodstuff, the clothing line, everything is alright,"" says Pamela. Alexis agrees: ""The quality of the clothing is good, the quality of the food is good, and the prices are right. Janet adds: ""We're thinking of getting our dinner here. They have a nice food area, and it's all packaged nicely."" The only change they want is expansion. ""Bring it to America.,"" says Alexis. ""I'll be there for the grand opening.""

"This video can not be played M&S boss says firm too 'inward looking' Marks and Spencer has suffered a big fall in annual profits following a costly store closure plan. Annual pre-tax profits fell by almost two-thirds to Â£66.8m as sales of food, clothing and homeware all declined. On Tuesday the retailer said it plans to close 100 shops by 2022,accelerating an overhaul that it says is ""vital"" for its future. The expense of closing stores and revamping the business cost M&S Â£321m in the 12 months to March. M&S has already shut 21 stores and revealed the location of 14 further closures on Tuesday. ""This modernisation programme ... is to close some of the small stores where we can't give the full offer, and show customers in our better stores, our bigger stores the full range of what M&S does,"" chief executive Steve Rowe toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It is a catch-up programme, we have to make sure we don't stop modernising our estate and that we give our customers the stores that they deserve."" Once again, M&S has posted another set of falling sales and profits. Revitalising this 132-year-old business is costing it dear, but what's more striking is the sober message and language that accompanied the numbers. Marks had become a top heavy business, inward looking, ""too corporate"" and had lost its appeal to family-age customers.  The need for change had become more urgent. Vast sums have already been spent on a new website and a Â£200m fulfilment centre at Castle Donington under the previous boss. Eyebrows will now be raised that the new warehouse is already struggling to cope with demand and the website is too slow. M&S still has a mammoth challenge ahead to revive its fortunes. But at the end of the day, it all comes to down to having the right product, the right availability at the right price. Closing stores is one of those difficult tasks. For the clothing and home shops that remain, the company has to make sure that there is a compelling enough offer to pull shoppers in. Mr Rowe declined to say how many jobs would be lost as a result of the store closure programme. ""We're assessing this on a store-by-store basis and are committed to redeploying our colleagues wherever possible,"" he said. ""In the last round of closures, 86% were redeployed to another store and we want to have continuity."" M&S has been criticised for failing to revive its clothing range. Mr Rowe said the retailer had made its clothes ""more contemporary"" and pointed out that, for the first time in seven years, it had gained customers in womenswear. M&S to close 100 stores by 2022 How can M&S get back in fashion? M&S results: Live reaction The company also wants internet sales to account for a third of its business, but it admitted that its online performance was behind its competitors and the website was too slow. Mr Rowe said: ""Our product pages need to download quicker than they are if they are to be the best in class and our search needs to be made easier. ""We are doing those changes to the website now and are continuing to treat this as business as usual. Making the website fit for the future is largely covered in our core operating costs."" One big problem is the company's distribution centre in Castle Donington, which handles online orders. ""It is a difficult thing for us at the moment,"" Mr Rowe said. ""It has failed in its customer proposition and that's not good enough at a time when customers want more merchandise delivered quicker."" He said M&S aimed to expand the website to better compete against its rivals. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said M&S needed to quickly revamp online: ""You can boost profits with fewer stores only if you can drive online sales growth and, on that front, M&S is well behind."" Bryan Roberts, retail analyst at TCC global, said: ""In clothing we've seen green shoots of recovery, but the business still lacks any sense of identity ... M&S used to be famous as a destination for certain products, such as good quality school uniforms, but that's been lost somewhere along the way. A back-to-basics approach should help it reclaim ground lost to stores less beholden to a seasonal structure."" Last year sales of clothing and homeware slid 1.9% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the effect of new stores, while like-for-like food sales also declined by 0.3%. The results were not as bad as some analysts had feared and shares in M&S rose 4.5% in morning trading to 305p. However, the share price is still down more than a fifth over the past year.

"The mother, who cannot be identified, was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. The woman from Birmingham, who is in her 40s, duped the then 17-year-old into going to Pakistan in September 2016 to wed the man. The girl became pregnant by him when she was 13 and he was 29, which her mother saw as a ""marriage contract"". The case is the first successful prosecution of its type. Sentencing the mother at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said the victim had been ""sold for her passport"". Neither the mother nor daughter can be identified for legal reasons. Midlands Live: Man stabbed during 'row over crash'; Train driver 'three seconds from being hit by other train' Jurors had heard the daughter, now aged 19, was fooled into travelling to Pakistan on the promise of getting an iPhone for her 18th birthday. When the plan to marry her to the relative 16 years her senior was revealed, the girl protested. In response her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. ""It takes no imagination to understand the terror she must have felt"", the judge said. ""You had cruelly deceived her. She was frightened, alone, held against her will, being forced into a marriage she dreaded. ""You must have known that was her state of mind. Yet for your own purposes, you drove the marriage through."" Prosecutor Deborah Gould read a victim statement to the court in which the girl said she was proud of herself for coming forward and wanted other young women who found themselves in similar situations to ask for help. The court heard how the wedding was the defendant's idea. The victim's father, who is divorced from her mother, eventually found out and told social services and police. The mother wasfound guilty on Tuesdayof two counts of forced marriage and a count of perjury after she lied to the High Court about the incident. This sentence sends a strong message to potential perpetrators that forcing a person to get married is illegal and punishable by a lengthy term in custody. As the first case of its kind, campaigners hope those who are silently suffering will be encouraged to seek help and speak out about the trauma and psychological damage caused by the coercive measures enforced by their relatives. The irony is those who claim to love them the most are the ones who are destroying their lives through manipulation and deception. @sima_kotecha,external The man the victim went on to marry first had sex with her when she was 13 after the ""marriage contract"" was made. She was then forced to have an abortion upon her return to the UK. The court was told this amounted to ""significant trauma"" which ""fundamentally affected"" her. The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare. In June 2015, a man was jailed at Merthyr Crown Court for offences includingforcing a woman into marrying him, while there is at least one other live case in the courts.

"Ladybower reservoir in Derbyshire supplies water for drinking and hydro electricity England is facing water supply shortages by 2050 unless rapid action is taken to curb water use and wastage, the Environment Agency has warned. Its new report says enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people is lost through leakage every day. Population growth and the impact of climate change are expected to add to supply pressures. The agency wants people to have a personal water target and has urged them to use water more wisely at home. The study,the first major report on water resources in England,external, says that population growth and climate change are the biggest pressures on a system that is already struggling. In 2016, some 9,500 billion litres of freshwater were taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and underground sources, with 55% of this used by public water companies, and 27% going to the electricity supply industry. But in addition to the 3 billion litres a day that are wasted through leakage, there is a considerable price being paid in terms of the sustainability of these supplies. Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortages How an iceberg could ease Cape Town's water crisis The 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water According to the Environment Agency, extraction of groundwater - the water beneath the earth's surface - is not at a sustainable level for 28% of groundwater bodies and up to 18% of surface waters. A year earlier in 2016, unsustainable extraction meant that at least 6% and possibly up to 15% of river water bodies did not achieve ""a good ecological status or potential"". The majority of chalk streams also failed to meet that standard, with over extraction of water being responsible in a quarter of the streams that were tested. ""We need to change our attitudes to water use,"" said Emma Howard Boyd, the Environment Agency chair woman. ""It is the most fundamental thing needed to ensure a healthy environment, but we are taking too much of it and have to work together to manage this precious resource."" Addressing the questions of how to reduce the amount of water that is being used, Michael Roberts, from Water UK, said water companies were tackling the question head-on. ""It's actually everyone's issue,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""In the home we have to do our bit and as companies we have to do our bit - but the good news is that domestic consumption has been coming down for the last decade, and in terms of leakage, we are leaking a third less than we did 30 years ago, but there is a heck of a lot more to do."" On average, people use 140 litres every day in England. The Environment Agency says it will work with government and industry to establish a personal consumption target and come up with cost-effective measures to meet it. The government has already suggested that an individual's water use be reduced, in its25-year plan,,externalpublished earlier this year. The water industry says that three quarters of water used in the home goes towards washing ourselves, our clothes and how we flush the toilet. Greater awareness could help cut that amount significantly. ""We'd love to see a really ambitious target of per capita consumption per day,"" Nicci Russell from Waterwise, who campaign for water efficiency, told the BBC. ""It's around about 140 litres per day and we'd like to see it at 100 or less, we think that's perfectly do-able over the next 20-25 years."" But Environment Minister George Eustice has told BBC Radio 5 live that the proposed Environment Agency household water guidelines are ""not a cap"" and that ""nobody need worry that we're shutting off the taps"". ""It's more a target really to encourage individual households to think about their water, to encourage the use of, for instance, flushing systems on toilets that are more economical in the way they use water, and basically get the types of innovation that we need within households over a period of time, so that we are using water more carefully."" The big questions for the future, according to the Environment Agency, are the impacts of climate change and population growth. Rising temperatures will affect the timing and amount of rainfall that flows into rivers and replenishes groundwater supplies. Although average summer rainfall is not predicted to change, more rainfall is likely to occur in large downpours in the future, increasing the chances of droughts and floods happening at the same time. The report warns that reduced summer rain and increased evaporation might damage wetland areas. Increased areas of stagnant water during droughts coupled with increased temperatures could see the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus. Water leaks in England waste three billion litres per day The population of England is predicted to increase to 58.5 million by 2026 - the report says that much of this increase is likely to take place in areas where water supplies are already stressed. If no action is taken to reduce use and increase supply of water, ""most areas will not meet demand by the 2050s"" if both emissions and population growth are high. Even low population growth and modest climate change ""suggest significant water supply deficits by the 2050s, particularly in the South East"". The National Infrastructure Commission has already suggested that moving water from north to south should be considered as part of future development. ""Today's report reflects our own findings, that the country faces the real risk of drought and that we need to take urgent action now to address it - by reducing demand, as well as by increasing supply, said Sir John Armitt, who chairs the commission. ""Our recommendations include the need for a new National Water Network, to help move supplies from areas with water surpluses to those in greatest need. ""But there must be a concerted effort by industry to encourage consumers to use water more efficiently - and with a fifth of our mains water lost to leakages, they must also take steps to halve the amount lost this way by 2050."" Investment in nuclear power and renewable energy will likely lead to much lower rates of abstraction and consumption by 2050, the study says. However, if future energy scenarios involve carbon capture and storage (CCS), this would require much higher freshwater abstraction and consumption levels, as the technology needs extra water to function, and would also increase the amount of cooling water needed at conventional power plants to which CCS equipment is attached.

"The chances of an interest rate rise this year have receded after Consumer Price Inflation fell to 2.4% in April - its lowest level since March 2017. The fall from 2.5% in March was partly due to the timing of Easter, which meant a seasonal rise in air fares was not included in April this year. The pound fell about half a cent against the dollar after the figures were released before rising to $1.3368. Analysts now question the prospect of any rate rises this year. ""Inflation falling for the third month in a row further dents any hopes of a late-summer rate rise from the Bank of England,"" said Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. Neil Jones at Mizuho Bank said: ""It is starting to appear the weaker CPI is more structural and not just because of the bad weather. Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh and may indeed put the Bank on hold throughout the summer and beyond."" However, Nikesh Sawjani, UK economist at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, disagreed. ""The impact of recent increases in oil prices and previously announced hikes in utility tariffs should ensure that inflation proves more 'sticky' than it has done so far this year,"" he said. ""Against such a backdrop, and with the economy expected to recover in the second quarter, we expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates at its meeting in August."" Inflation is easing but for how long? Wage squeeze worst in modern history, says TUC Carney: Brexit uncertainty could delay interest rate rise Rate rise doubts as property demand falls, says RICS Mike Hardie of the Office for National Statistics said the fall in inflation was partially offset by the rise infuel prices, which are now at their highest levelfor three-and-a-half years. The average price of petrol has risen to 127.22p a litre and diesel to 129.96p following a rapid rise in the cost of oil. The figures did show the effect of the new sugar tax on soft drinks and juices. Inflation keeps on coming in lower than expected. If you strip out volatile items such as food and fuel, then so-called ""core inflation"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney's preferred measure, is only 2.1% - barely above the 2% target. From being 90% sure a couple of months ago that a second interest rate rise would have happened by now, the markets now think it's unlikely before November. Why raise rates even then? The thinking now is - inflationary pressures may have abated for now, but the Bank has to look two years ahead. At the last count (first three months of the year), the average pay rise was 2.9% and it may go higher. The pound has weakened against the dollar recently and if higher oil prices, priced in dollars, are here to stay, they are likely to push up the cost of imported goods. The Bank isn't at all sure the threat from above-target inflation has gone for good. In April, the pound climbed as high as $1.4325 on expectations that UK interest rates would soon be moving higher. However, since then, weaker economic data has reversed that thinking and the pound has fallen almost 7% from that April high. Inflation on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure rose to 3.4%, from 3.3% in March.

"The mother, who cannot be identified, was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. The woman from Birmingham, who is in her 40s, duped the then 17-year-old into going to Pakistan in September 2016 to wed the man. The girl became pregnant by him when she was 13 and he was 29, which her mother saw as a ""marriage contract"". The case is the first successful prosecution of its type. Sentencing the mother at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said the victim had been ""sold for her passport"". Neither the mother nor daughter can be identified for legal reasons. Midlands Live: Man stabbed during 'row over crash'; Train driver 'three seconds from being hit by other train' Jurors had heard the daughter, now aged 19, was fooled into travelling to Pakistan on the promise of getting an iPhone for her 18th birthday. When the plan to marry her to the relative 16 years her senior was revealed, the girl protested. In response her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. ""It takes no imagination to understand the terror she must have felt"", the judge said. ""You had cruelly deceived her. She was frightened, alone, held against her will, being forced into a marriage she dreaded. ""You must have known that was her state of mind. Yet for your own purposes, you drove the marriage through."" Prosecutor Deborah Gould read a victim statement to the court in which the girl said she was proud of herself for coming forward and wanted other young women who found themselves in similar situations to ask for help. The court heard how the wedding was the defendant's idea. The victim's father, who is divorced from her mother, eventually found out and told social services and police. The mother wasfound guilty on Tuesdayof two counts of forced marriage and a count of perjury after she lied to the High Court about the incident. This sentence sends a strong message to potential perpetrators that forcing a person to get married is illegal and punishable by a lengthy term in custody. As the first case of its kind, campaigners hope those who are silently suffering will be encouraged to seek help and speak out about the trauma and psychological damage caused by the coercive measures enforced by their relatives. The irony is those who claim to love them the most are the ones who are destroying their lives through manipulation and deception. @sima_kotecha,external The man the victim went on to marry first had sex with her when she was 13 after the ""marriage contract"" was made. She was then forced to have an abortion upon her return to the UK. The court was told this amounted to ""significant trauma"" which ""fundamentally affected"" her. The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare. In June 2015, a man was jailed at Merthyr Crown Court for offences includingforcing a woman into marrying him, while there is at least one other live case in the courts.

"Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Charlie, collapsed from deadly parvovirus days after being bought by a family in Feltham A gang of fraudsters who made millions of pounds selling sick and dying puppies to unsuspecting members of the public has been sentenced. The group of six is estimated to have made about Â£2.5m selling more than 5,000 dogs from houses in west London. Some gang members were jailed at Isleworth Crown Court on Tuesday. A vet, who helped sales by providing certificates which suggested the puppies were healthy and bred locally, was spared jail. Daniel Doherty, who was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud, was given a 12-month suspended sentence. He plans to appeal against his conviction. Many of the dogs found by the RSPCA had to be put down RSPCA inspector Kirsty Withnall, who uncovered the gang with help from the Metropolitan Police, said Yorkshire terriers, cavapoos and labradoodles were advertised online and sold for up to Â£650 each. She said many of the dogs recovered had since died or had to be put to sleep due to severe health problems. ""This was a complicated and multi-faceted, high-volume conspiracy whereby the gang has misrepresented commercial, puppy-farmed dogs imported from abroad as family-bred pets to con members of the public out of money,"" she added. The puppies were illegally imported from Ireland before being taken to the defendants' homes where they were kept in plastic sheds, outbuildings and garages. Dogs were kept in sheds and outbuildings at the defendants' homes One family in Feltham said they had to put their new puppy down days after bringing it home. Vets discovered that Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Charlie, had parvovirus in February 2016. Charlier's owner, known only as Claire, said: ""Her legs gave way and she had no energy so I took her to the surgery. By the time I got her there she was half lifeless. ""It was heartbreaking.""

"Ladybower reservoir in Derbyshire supplies water for drinking and hydro electricity England is facing water supply shortages by 2050 unless rapid action is taken to curb water use and wastage, the Environment Agency has warned. Its new report says enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people is lost through leakage every day. Population growth and the impact of climate change are expected to add to supply pressures. The agency wants people to have a personal water target and has urged them to use water more wisely at home. The study,the first major report on water resources in England,external, says that population growth and climate change are the biggest pressures on a system that is already struggling. In 2016, some 9,500 billion litres of freshwater were taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and underground sources, with 55% of this used by public water companies, and 27% going to the electricity supply industry. But in addition to the 3 billion litres a day that are wasted through leakage, there is a considerable price being paid in terms of the sustainability of these supplies. Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortages How an iceberg could ease Cape Town's water crisis The 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water According to the Environment Agency, extraction of groundwater - the water beneath the earth's surface - is not at a sustainable level for 28% of groundwater bodies and up to 18% of surface waters. A year earlier in 2016, unsustainable extraction meant that at least 6% and possibly up to 15% of river water bodies did not achieve ""a good ecological status or potential"". The majority of chalk streams also failed to meet that standard, with over extraction of water being responsible in a quarter of the streams that were tested. ""We need to change our attitudes to water use,"" said Emma Howard Boyd, the Environment Agency chair woman. ""It is the most fundamental thing needed to ensure a healthy environment, but we are taking too much of it and have to work together to manage this precious resource."" Addressing the questions of how to reduce the amount of water that is being used, Michael Roberts, from Water UK, said water companies were tackling the question head-on. ""It's actually everyone's issue,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""In the home we have to do our bit and as companies we have to do our bit - but the good news is that domestic consumption has been coming down for the last decade, and in terms of leakage, we are leaking a third less than we did 30 years ago, but there is a heck of a lot more to do."" On average, people use 140 litres every day in England. The Environment Agency says it will work with government and industry to establish a personal consumption target and come up with cost-effective measures to meet it. The government has already suggested that an individual's water use be reduced, in its25-year plan,,externalpublished earlier this year. The water industry says that three quarters of water used in the home goes towards washing ourselves, our clothes and how we flush the toilet. Greater awareness could help cut that amount significantly. ""We'd love to see a really ambitious target of per capita consumption per day,"" Nicci Russell from Waterwise, who campaign for water efficiency, told the BBC. ""It's around about 140 litres per day and we'd like to see it at 100 or less, we think that's perfectly do-able over the next 20-25 years."" But Environment Minister George Eustice has told BBC Radio 5 live that the proposed Environment Agency household water guidelines are ""not a cap"" and that ""nobody need worry that we're shutting off the taps"". ""It's more a target really to encourage individual households to think about their water, to encourage the use of, for instance, flushing systems on toilets that are more economical in the way they use water, and basically get the types of innovation that we need within households over a period of time, so that we are using water more carefully."" The big questions for the future, according to the Environment Agency, are the impacts of climate change and population growth. Rising temperatures will affect the timing and amount of rainfall that flows into rivers and replenishes groundwater supplies. Although average summer rainfall is not predicted to change, more rainfall is likely to occur in large downpours in the future, increasing the chances of droughts and floods happening at the same time. The report warns that reduced summer rain and increased evaporation might damage wetland areas. Increased areas of stagnant water during droughts coupled with increased temperatures could see the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus. Water leaks in England waste three billion litres per day The population of England is predicted to increase to 58.5 million by 2026 - the report says that much of this increase is likely to take place in areas where water supplies are already stressed.

"Wrapped in the Pakistani flag, Sabika Sheikh's coffin was taken to the funeral service The funeral of a Pakistani student killed in last week's Texas school shooting has taken place in Karachi. Sabika Sheikh, who was 17, was among the eight students and two teachers killed in the attack in Santa Fe. Her body was flown back to Pakistan on Wednesday. Senior politicians were among hundreds at the funeral. The gunman, identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is being held on charges of murder and aggravated assault. Sabika Sheikh had been due to return home to Pakistan in just a few weeks' time, ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid. Instead a coffin containing her body was flown back to Karachi airport in the early hours of the morning. She had been studying in Texas for the last year as part of a US government programme to improve understanding between America and Muslim countries. Her family said she had hoped to one day work as a diplomat. Her father told the BBC he wanted his daughter's death to be a catalyst for change to America's gun laws. Santa Fe High School shooting as it happened What we know about Texas shooting suspect America's gun culture in 10 charts ""Sabika's death should not be in vain,"" Abdul Aziz Sheikh told the BBC.

Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings The Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes: President Trump moved to ban so-called bump stocks, used in last year's Las Vegas shooting Congress is considering the Stop School Violence Act to provide increased security such as metal detectors in schools Mr Trump has endorsed arming teachers- a long-held position of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Gun control advocates have criticised what they see as minor changes amidcontinued support for the NRA from leading politicians. The worst shooting at a place of education in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in 2007, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured.

"Philip Roth was presented with the National Humanities Medal by then President Barack Obama in 2011 One of the great American authors, Philip Roth, has died aged 85. The Pulitzer, National Book Award and Man Booker International Prize-winning novelist's work drew its inspiration from Jewish family life, sex and American ideals. His works included American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and Portnoy's Complaint. The New York Times reported that a close friend of Roth's said he had died of congestive heart failure. Roth first found success with his short story collection, Goodbye Columbus, published in 1959. A decade later his sexually explicit novel Portnoy's Complaint catapulted him to notoriety, making him a celebrity in the US. Author who scandalised middle America Philip Roth in his own words In later life, he wrote a number of highly regarded historical novels, including his 1997 work American Pastoral, for which he won his Pulitzer. He wrote prolifically over the course of his career, publishing more than 30 books before ending his fiction career in 2009. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons When Roth won the 2011 Man Booker International, chairman of the judges Rick Gekoski said: ""His career is remarkable in that he starts at such a high level, and keeps getting better. ""In his 50s and 60s, when most novelists are in decline, he wrote a string of novels of the highest, enduring quality."" He also recognised thatRoth's win divided the Man Booker International panel, and had caused one judge to quit in protest. ""I can recall few of his novels that don't provoke an occasional but overwhelming desire to shout 'Will you shut up!' at a character or his author,"" he said. By James Naughtie, BBC books editor His heritage was extremely important, and in some ways he wrestled with it all his life. The question of identity, which is the question which, in the melting pot of America, is always going to be the one that a serious writer has to grapple with. Where do you come from? What do you do? What kind of kid are you growing up in New York? That was the obsession that took him right through his writing. But in the end, you've just got to remember that here was a man who could write beautiful prose. That's what carried him through. His death puts an end to a whole era of American literature. In 2014, Roth told the BBC he would make no more public appearances: ""I can guarantee you that this is my last appearance ever on television... absolutely [my] last appearance on any stage anywhere."" Speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, his biographer Blake Bailey spoke of how much Roth enjoyed writing about the Jewish neighbourhood where he grew up, in Newark, New Jersey.

""It is ironic that he got this reputation as a self-hating Jew,"" he said. ""Philip despised anti-Semitism in all its forms and he himself loved Jews, he loved growing up in a Jewish neighbourhood. He didn't have much time for the religious side of it, but everything else was just great."" Screenwriter David Simon - creator of The Wire - said Roth was ""the great American novelist of our post-war world"". He is reportedly working on a television adaptation ofThe Plot Against America, a Roth novel that imagined right-wing aviator Charles Lindbergh becoming presidentinstead of Franklin D Roosevelt.

You read on the back of many, many books 'hilarious' and they never are, but Roth's actually are. Roth's can make you laugh, and I think that is a real achievement of his. ""He had two prose styles. [One which was] very turbo-charged, very fast and overflowing with images and jokes, and then he had a more stately way of doing it in things like the Zuckerman novels, where he sees himself more self-consciously as a novelist.""

Roth's death comes a week after that of another US literary heavyweight, Tom Wolfe, the author of The Bonfire of the Vanities who died at 88. (And why some don't) ""To be in his 60s making work that is so strong, so full of revelations about love and emotional pain, that's the way to live your artistic life,"" singer Bruce Springsteen once said of his fellow New Jersey native. ""Which reader of intelligence and curiosity does not relish Roth's long, muscular sentences, which brim with felt life?"" writes the Spectator magazine after his death. But his style, and his protagonists, rubbed some up the wrong way. ""Roth is an extremist. He loves to shock, to go beyond the limits of acceptability. That's why he's so funny. But it's also why he's not to everyone's taste,"" wrote author William Skidelsky in the Guardian in 2011. He made the comments after the resignation of publisher Carmen Callil from the Booker judging panel after he was picked as winner. She conceded that he was a clever and comic writer, but she protested the accolade going to ""yet another North American"". Roth has been accused of misogyny, particularly in his graphic sex scenes. However,the Atlantic magazine advised caution on revisiting his works,external: ""Any idea that might occur to us about the author has already occurred to him, only more intelligently.""

"Researchers are to visit Loch Ness next month DNA sampling is to be used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness. Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. He said a ""biological explanation"" might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. The team will collect tiny fragments of skin and scales for two weeks in June. Film's lost Nessie monster prop found in Loch Ness Fallen branches 'could explain Loch Ness Monster sightings' Prof Gemmell, from the University of Otago in Dunedin, said: ""I don't believe in the idea of a monster, but I'm open to the idea that there are things yet to be discovered and not fully understood. ""Maybe there's a biological explanation for some of the stories."" The University of the Highlands and Islands' UHI Rivers and Lochs Institute in Inverness is assisting in the project. After the research team's trip to Loch Ness, the samples will be sent to laboratories in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark and France to be analysed against a genetic database. Prof Gemmell said: ""There's absolutely no doubt that we will find new stuff. And that's very exciting. ""While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness - the UK's largest freshwater body."" The scientist said the team expected to find sequences of DNA from plants, fish and other organisms. He said it would be possible to identify these plants and animals by comparing the sequences of their DNA against sequences held on a large, international database. Prof Gemmell added: ""There is this idea that an ancient Jurassic Age reptile might be in Loch Ness. ""If we find any reptilian DNA sequences in Loch Ness, that would be surprising and would be very, very interesting."" Monster Inc: A brief history of the Nessie phenomenon A knitted Nessie made for the Inverness Loch Ness International Knitting Festival The Loch Ness Monster is one of Scotland's oldest and most enduring myths. It inspires books, TV shows and films, and sustains a major tourism industry around its home. The story of the monster can be traced back 1,500 years when Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Later, in the 1930s, The Inverness Courier reported the first modern sighting of Nessie. In 1933, the newspaper's Fort Augustus correspondent, Alec Campbell, reported a sighting by Aldie Mackay of what she believed to be Nessie. Mr Campbell's report described a whale-like creature and the loch's water ""cascading and churning"". The editor at the time, Evan Barron, suggested the beast be described as a ""monster"", kick starting the modern myth of the Loch Ness Monster. Over the years various efforts have tried and failed to find the beast. In tourism terms, there are two exhibitions dedicated to the monster and there is not a tourist shop in the Highlands, and even more widely across Scotland, where a cuddly toy of Nessie cannot be found. In 2016, the inaugural Inverness Loch Ness International Knitting Festival exhibited knitted Nessie's made from all parts of the world. In popular culture, the Loch Ness Monster has reared its head many times, including in 1975's four-part Doctor Who - Terror of the Zygons, the 1980s cartoon The Family-Ness as well as The Simpsons and 1996's Loch Ness starring Ted Danson. In 2014, it was reported that for the first time in almost 90 years no ""confirmed sightings"" had been made of the Loch Ness Monster. Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said no-one had come forward in 18 months to say they had seen the monster. But last year,sightings hit a record high.

"Fleabag, Happy Valley and Ordeal By Innocence are among the few TV shows to be written by women The number of female writers working for film and television in the UK has not improved in the last 10 years, a new report suggests. Across the whole industry, just one in six screenwriters is a woman. Only one in 10 feature films is written chiefly by a woman, the figure dropping even lower for those with a budget greater than Â£10m - to just one in 14. The Writers' Guild of Great Britain, which commissioned the report, is calling for change in the industry. Screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes, behind ITV mini-series Dark Angel and the forthcoming Vanity Fair, said the research made for ""shocking reading"", calling for ""an honest and open debate about why this inequality still afflicts our industry"". TV drama 'too male' say women writers Women savage portrayal by male authors ITV's forthcoming Vanity Fair stars Olivia Cooke and Tom Bateman The report from the trade union, which represents professional writers, looked at the period from 2005 to 2016. It showed the situation had not improved over that time, with little increase in the number of female writers. In 2006, 21% of UK feature films had at least one female writer credited among the writing team. In 2016, the figure stood at 22%. The picture is a little better in television with 28% of all UK TV episodes being predominantly written by women, but this figure halves for women writing for prime-time television. Fleabag is among just one in 10 comedy programmes to be written by a woman Female representation in comedy and light entertainment appeared particularly low with just 11% and 9% respectively being predominantly female-written, according to the report. It comes after a group of76 TV drama writers signed an open letter of protest to UK broadcasters earlier this year when ITV revealed that its drama slate for 2018 had only one female writer out of nine. Of more than 200 working writers polled, the new report indicates that only one in 20 agreed that ""the way writers are hired, and scripts are commissioned, is fair and free from discrimination"" - and the majority of respondents suggested that they had seen evidence of discrimination over the course of their careers. The low numbers of female writers working in top dramas comes despite some of the most popular recent TV shows being written by women including Happy Valley (Sally Wainwright), Ordeal by Innocence (Sarah Phelps) and Girlfriends (Kay Mellor). The report also looked at the budgets of feature films compared to UK and international box office takings and found films written by women have higher revenues - both domestically and globally - than those written predominantly by men. The Kingsman series is written by Jane Goldman WGGB president Olivia Hetreed called on commissioners and public funders to work harder to give equal opportunities to women writers. Hetreed, who is also a Bafta-nominated writer for her adaptation of Girl with a Pearl Earring, said: ""I have been asked about the dearth of female screenwriters in this country ever since my first feature film put me into that endangered species bracket. ""I and others were reassuring: 'It's just a matter of time. It's getting better. It will work itself out'. But more than a decade later, this new research shows that the number of women writing films has flat-lined at abjectly low levels."" As well as a presenter, Sandi Toksvig is also a writer - with more than 20 books to her name Writer and presenter Sandi Toksvig is also among those to give her support to the campaign, saying: ""There is no shortage of talented women writers in the UK, and therefore no excuse that so few of them are getting commissions in film and TV."" Screenwriter Kay Mellor said: ""It's criminal that I can count on one hand how many women signature writers there are on TV right now. Sometimes it takes a collective to say - 'this is not fair' and it's not. It's time things changed."" The BBC said there would be more female writers in the new series of Doctor Who The BBC has previouslycome under criticism for five of the most recent series of Doctor Who being entirely written by men,external. In response, BBC One's head of drama Piers Wenger said ""a number"" of the scripts for Chris Chibnall's forthcoming debut series of Doctor Who had been written by women. He also added that ""women have written more than 40% of the drama"" he had ordered since taking up his post at the BBC a year ago. ITV's head of drama Polly Hill said: ""As we look to offer audiences the greatest range of drama, we will always support and commission female writers and take representation on and off-screen seriously.""

"Berlinah Wallace threw sulphuric acid at her former partner, Mark van Dongen A woman who threw sulphuric acid at her former partner, which led to him ending his life, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years. Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015. At Bristol Crown Court, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Wallace it was ""an act of pure evil"". She was cleared of murdering her former partner but found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent. ""Your intention was to burn, disfigure and disable Mark van Dongen so that he would not be attractive to any other woman,"" the judge said. Avon and Somerset Police said it believed it to be the first life sentence for an acid attack in the UK. The terrible price paid for rejecting Berlinah Wallace Mr van Dongen, 29, was left paralysed from the neck down and lost an ear, eye and his left leg following the attack, and ended his own life in a Belgian hospital in January 2017. This video can not be played Mark van Dongen had acid thrown on him while he was asleep in bed The judge told Wallace she had ""chosen the moment"" for the attack when Mr van Dongen was wearing only boxer shorts and asleep in bed at her flat in Westbury Park. ""Vulnerable, almost naked, he awoke but had no real opportunity to avoid the focus of your acid attack, namely his face and then his body,"" she said. ""Immediately before you threw the acid you said to Mark, 'If I can't have you, no-one can'."" The bed where Mark van Dongen was lying when Wallace threw the acid at him Wallace had bought the acid to attack her former partner, a Dutch engineer, because he had left her for another woman, the court heard. She threw a glass of it over Mr van Dongen on the night of 22 September 2015 after he had returned to her flat in Ladysmith Road to reiterate that their turbulent relationship was over, but decided to stay the night. Screaming in agony, he staggered out on to the street where he was found by alarmed neighbours who dialled 999. Ex-girlfriend cleared of acid murder Accused in 'prostitution secret' threat Acid victim 'told accused to kill herself Wallace ""told lie after lie"" after the ""horrific attack"", the judge said. ""When interviewed by the police you sought to place the blame upon Mark van Dongen, falsely alleging that he had poured the acid into the glass on your bedside table intending that you should drink it. ""It was an account which you gave in September 2015 and maintained throughout this trial."" Kees van Dongen said the sentence was ""really too little"" Speaking via a translator the victim's father, Kees van Dongen, said: ""I'm very pleased she'll be locked up for a minimum of 12 years but really it's too little, because we as a family have been sentenced to life."" He said he supported the judge's findings that Wallace's intentions had been ""malicious and callous"". ""I never knew that she was like this.

"Lauryn Hill's iconic debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, turns 20 this year, and to celebrate, the singer is heading out on tour. Five dates have been scheduled in the UK and Ireland in November and December, in London, Manchester Glasgow, Birmingham and Dublin. She will also be taking on a US tour, with a 20-date run across many major cities. The singer will perform the multi Grammy-winning record in its entirety at each of the shows. After chart success with the Fugees, Hill went solo and released Miseducation - her only studio record. The seminal album has gone three times platinum in the UK since its 1998 release, selling more than 19 million copies worldwide. At the 1999 Grammys, the record won five awards including album of the year. Hill brought together the sounds of reggae, rap and hip hop infused with a soulful sweetness mixed with authentic lyrics. Hill picking up her five Grammys for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill Speaking to BBC News, broadcaster Trevor Nelson says the importance of Lauryn Hill's album should not be underestimated. ""She is by far the single most important female artist of my time. She was the second coming,"" he says, going on to name her record as his all-time favourite album by a female artist. ""She was as powerful a singer, as say Mary J [Blige] - not perfect like Whitney [Houston], but really emotive - and then, for me, she was the finest female rapper of her generation as well."" The Radio 1Xtra DJ says the content of the lyrics was as key to the success as the musicality. ""It was really pure. She went against the grain and it brought credibility. People were looking at R&B records as very ghetto fabulous. At the time it was all about shiny videos, with girls in bikinis - but the substance was lacking. ""Lauryn Hill brought substance to the game at a major level. There were a lot of artists who had substance that didn't get heard but she just had it all - she had the whole package."" Lauryn Hill UK & Ireland tour dates Glasgow's SSE Hydro - 23 November Manchester Arena - 26 November Birmingham Arena - 27 November Dublin 3Arena - 30 November London O2 Arena - 3 December DJ and Hits Radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford agrees calling the content ""articulate and intellectual"". ""She is an incredible rapper by anyone's standards - I can't think of another female rapper doing things like that at that time. ""She talked about her family, about women respecting themselves and being honest about feelings. She was real. ""She had this emotional maturity beyond her years - every song you could connect to. And she did it all to these Afro beats and was proud of her heritage. ""She was proud to be black, she didn't straighten her hair - which was a big deal. She was an original black beauty."" Part of Hill's unprecedented success was that she broke through to white audiences as a rapper and hip-hop artist, Crawford adds. John Legend got a big break from Hill when he was asked to play piano on Miseducation ""Lauryn Hill managed to connect to a mass global audience and manage to be socially conscious at the same time. ""She was telling young people not to be promiscuous and to have confidence. She touches on race and youth and gender."" Nelson says she was a lyricist second to none: ""You feel you have to listen to the words,"" he says, admitting he usually prefers a song's hook or bassline. ""Even if you're not a lyrical type of person. It forces you. I listened to every lyric on her album."" Unsurprisingly, Hill is still cited as one of the key influences on many of today's most successful artists. Beyonce said listening to Lauryn Hill was a key thing that inspired her music. In aninterview with Entertainment Weekly,external, the Lemonade singer said: ""There's definitely something beyond Lauryn Hill that's in her voice and her mind when she writes songs. She's gifted and blessed."" Adele said in 2011 that her ""favourite album ever"" was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, and recalls stealing the record from her mum's collection and ""analys[ing] the record for about a month at the age of eight"". ""[I] was constantly wondering when I would be that passionate about something, to write a record about it - even though I didn't know I was going to make a record when I was older.""

""I love her... she's brilliant,"" the Hello singer added. Lauryn Hill is also credited with helping launch the career of megastar John Legend, whose major recording debut was playing piano on Everything is Everything, from the Miseducation album. Legend says,externalhe was a student when Hill heard him play piano and ""liked what she heard"". She subsequently asked him to play keys on the hit track. The Ordinary People singer says it was ""pretty cool"" going back to school having been a part of the LP because ""it was the soundtrack to everyone's year"". In aninterview with Rolling Stone,external, Hill herself said: ""[I wanted to] write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul."" She added she had been trying to make an LP with a ""raw"" edge to it, and had deliberately avoided using computers to compress and ""smoothe"" out the sound. ""I wanna hear that thickness of sound,"" she said. ""You can't get that from a computer, because a computer's too perfect. But that human element, that's what makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I love that."" But now Hill is influencing a new generation of stars. Through pure chance, both Cardi B and Drake have sampled Ex Factor on their latest releases. Cardi B's Be Careful more subtly plays on some of the lyrics from Hill's heartbreak anthem than Drake's Nice for What, which contains the sped-up hook from the record throughout his song. Cardi B performing at Coachella TheNew Yorker says,external: ""Cardi B transforms Hill's ecstatic loneliness into a warning: ""Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully"", while Drake uses it to ""assert his emotional acumen"". Nelson says the sampling by Cardi B and Drake is to be expected since, according to him, every artist who's followed Lauryn Hill has been influenced by her. ""They've all been influenced by her. All of them. You can put Whitney [Houston], Mariah [Carey], Mary [J Blige], Amy [Winehouse] in there. None of this is anything without Lauryn Hill."" ""Look at the immediate influence of Whitney doing My Love is Your Love, (which was written and produced by Hill's Fugees bandmate Wyclef Jean). You can't tell me Amy didn't like Lauryn Hill - it's not possible. Wyclef Jean ruled out of Haiti election Cardi B knocks Taylor Swift off US top spot making history ""Two of our greatest female singers ever, Adele and Amy Winehouse, have undoubtedly been influenced by Lauryn Hill."" The founder of the MOBO Awards, Kanya King told the BBC that the ""ground-breaking nature"" of the album is why it remains ""impactful"" today. King said: ""Miseducation lifted boundaries for female artists. Recorded while she was heavily pregnant, her debut album busted through the industry's glass ceiling; rejecting society's notion that a female artist must choose between starting a family and having a successful career."" Lauryn Hill performing at the 2005 MOBO awards She recalls Hill's performance at the 2005 MOBOs: ""I personally got to witness the dedication and effort she put into preparing for her performance of Doo Wop (That Thing). When we confirmed that she was going to be on the bill, the level of excitement from both fans and the industry is hard to forget."" Crawford says she enjoys hearing Lauryn Hill tracks sampled by other artists: ""I'll always think of the original, which is no bad thing."" ""They're paying homage to her, paying their respect, and it's great to hear the song in a different way."" Will she ever release a follow-up to Miseducation? ""Maybe not,"" says King. ""But her one and only album continues to resonate with audiences 20 years on from its initial release."" Nelson also doesn't think we'll see the like from Hill again. ""20 years on and no-one's made an album to touch it."" ""The music business is all about timing,"" he adds. ""We needed her at that time and we got her at that time."" ""Some artists have 20 albums and don't have one truly great record. She's given us one album and that's all we needed."" A version of this article first appeared on 19 April 2018.

Mr Lammy's original remarks came asOxford University data,externalrevealed eight of its 29 colleges included in the report accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years. The university has a total of 38 colleges and permanent private halls. The university said it was ""not getting the right number of black people with the talent to apply"". Director of undergraduate admissions Dr Samina Khan told the BBC she was ""pushing hard"" on outreach activity to make sure those students felt welcome. Mr Lammy told the BBC that Oxford was ""failing badly"". Oxford college stands apart on elitism Oxford portrait 'celebrates diversity' Oxbridge even posher than we thought The proportion of Oxford students identifying as black and minority ethnic was 18% in 2017, up from 14% in 2013. However, that figure still falls below the UK university average of 25%. The most recent UK census showed 14% of the UK population identifies as black or minority ethnic. Data in the university's report showed that, of the students that achieved three 'A' grades or higher in their A-levels nationwide, 20% identified as black and minority ethnic. One college, Corpus Christi, which has around 350 students, admitted one black student resident in the UK in its 2015-2017 intakes. Balliol college, which has around 680 students, admitted two black students over the same period, despite receiving 46 applications. The number of admissions from state schools, during the same period, rose by 1%, from 57% to 58%. The report also showed a divide between the north and south of the UK. London and the South East made up 46.7% of UK applications between 2015 and 2017, (and 47.9% of students admitted) while the North East accounted for 2% (2.3% admitted). The story of Oxford University's first black student Why 14 black male Cambridge students posed for this photo Just 11% of last year's Oxford undergraduates were from disadvantaged backgrounds Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Lammy said the university had to explain why - having looked at the data - a person was twice as likely to get in if they were white, not black. Mr Lammy previously accused the university of ""social apartheid,external"", after a Freedom of Information request by him revealed 10 out of 32 Oxford colleges did not award a place to any black British pupil with A-levels in 2015. This prompted more than 100 MPs to write to Oxford and Cambridge urging the universities to recruit more students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds. Reacting to the latest figures, Mr Lammy said the problem was ""self-perpetuating"". ""If you're on the 20th floor of a tower block estate and you're getting straight A's, you apply, go for a difficult interview.. you don't get in, then none of the other kids apply the following year."" ""It's very elitist, very, very white,"" student Taiwo Oyebola said. ""For me, applying for Classics, I was very aware I'd be the only black person or one of a few people of colour."" ""We have this joke in lectures, I go in and there's this group we call them the Eton row, because all the Eton boys sit there."" Joshua Tulloch of the Oxford African and Caribbean students society said his organisation was involved in targeting younger black students. ""We have a vast access infrastructure which targets students from as young as Year 9,"" he said. ""The university is supporting us in making sure that we are visible and people can see that they can succeed in Oxford."" Oxford has said it must do more to attract talent from all backgrounds. ""We want a diverse university,"" Dr Samina Khan told Radio 4. The university has agreed to a scheme which would fund the interview travel fees of applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. It said it is doubling its spring and summer schools, which work with students from under-represented backgrounds.

"KeolisAmey already run the Docklands Light Railway in London A Â£5bn contract to run Wales' rail service for the next 15 years has been awarded to two European firms, who will run it jointly. France's Keolis and Spanish-owned Amey's bid triumphed over a rival offer from Hong Kong's MTR commuter railways. It will also drive forward the south Wales Metro in Cardiff and the valleys. The operators said while the changes would not happen overnight Wales' railway ""would be unrecognisable"" in five years time. KeolisAmey already runs Greater Manchester Metrolink and London's Docklands Light Railway, among others. This video can not be played How the new rail franchise will affect passengers in Wales But full details of its plans for Wales will not be revealed until next month. This is to allow for the potential challenge to the process by the other bidder. New rail deal 'complex but exciting' Trade unions lament new Welsh rail deal What will the South Wales Metro look like? Â£180m Metro hub for Cardiff planned What's wrong with Wales' railway? An official announcement was made on Wednesday after a bidding process which started with four companies. Arriva Trains Wales (ATW), which has run the Wales and Borders franchise since 2003,pulled out of the running in December. Keolis is France's largest private sector public transport operator - but its major shareholder is state-owned railway SNCF. Amey was a one-time UK company bought by the Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial, which is the key shareholder and manager of Heathrow airport. KeolisAmey is expected to have included other forms of transport - including so-called ""active"" travel like cycling - in its overall proposals. This video can not be played Arriva Trains Wales passengers started a Facebook group to call for improvements to their commute. There is Â£5bn earmarked over the next 15 years for the Metro, to improve public transport across the south Wales region and includes taking over control from Network Rail and upgrading the Valleys lines. Their vision for meeting this challenge - when it is eventually unveiled - will be of particular interest to business and commuters alike. But they have already promised ""transformative solutions"" for all in Wales and future generations. The new franchise will come into effect from 14 October but all 2,200 ATW staff will be able to transfer and terms and conditions will be protected. ATW's managing director Tom Joyner said it had been a ""privilege"" to operate the services. He said they would work to ensure as smooth a transition as possible. Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent Complaints about overcrowding, particularly on the Valleys lines, and the decades old rolling stock have dogged ATW. While its performance has been criticised, it has been making a decent profit while being heavily subsidised. In fairness to ATW, the contract awarded to it by the UK government assumed there would be no growth in passengers over a 15-year period when in fact the numbers doubled. That stretched services. The Welsh Government has been an ATW critic at times but reaching the point where Cardiff rather than London would make the decisions over who would run rail services in Wales has not been straightforward. This video can not be played What improvements do rail users want to see? There were a number of disputes between both governments, including over funding, before the power to award this franchise was devolved. The bidding process has been expensive for all the companies involved. This is a major investment and after the last 15 years it is clear how strongly people care about rail services. There is certain to be a lot of attention in future on KeolisAmey, the Welsh Government and TfW, the arms length company set up to oversee it, to ensure the promises made are delivered. This video can not be played Rail passengers Jade and Kelly say what they want to see improved from Pontypridd to Cardiff. Transport for Wales (TfW) - which is advising the Welsh Government on the contract - saidthe new franchise holder would be held to account on issues like punctuality, cleanliness and service quality or they would not get paid. But there will be challenges ahead in terms of rising passenger numbers, which have nearly doubled in the last 15 years. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ""Throughout the procurement process we have prioritised investment in the quality of trains, stations and services for the Wales and Borders Rail Service and South Wales Metro. ""We are grateful to all those who have participated in the procurement process."" He said no further comment would be made until the end of the 10-day standstill period. Arriva Trains Wales' current rail network map Andy Milner, Amey's chief executive, said: ""While the proposed changes won't happen overnight, the railway will be unrecognisable in five years thanks to the vision of the Welsh Government."" He added they would focus on working with TfW to transform the existing infrastructure and introduce new trains to ""significantly improve the passenger experience"" as well as creating hundreds of new jobs and apprenticeships. Alistair Gordon, chief executive of Keolis UK, said it would be a transformative new rail service. Both politicians and the rail operator alike will hope the system will be the most attractive option for travellers. TfW will regulate fares and they will not be expected to rise more than inflation. But new trains might take at least a couple of years to appear. Councillor Andrew Morgan, chair of the Cardiff Capital Region cabinet, said: ""This is a fantastic opportunity to create and deliver a transport infrastructure which supports the aims of the City Deal."" He said it was ""absolutely critical"" that a transport service was created which could accommodate and connect passengers in the region ""safely, quickly, and in comfort.""

"US president Donald Trump may extend his visit to the UK in July in order to play golf in Scotland. The property magnate-turned politician owns two golf courses in Scotland, and one in Ireland. He was due to arrive in the UK after attending a NATO summit on 11-12 July, and the main focus of the trip will be talks with Theresa May on 13 July. It will not be a state visit but Mr Trump is expected to meet the Queen. Downing Street previously referred to Mr Trump's July trip as a ""working visit"", after he previously cancelled a trip amid claims he would face mass protests. A formal programme for the visit has not been agreed by either country, though it has been speculated that Mr Trump may choose to meet the prime minister at her country residence, Chequers in Buckinghamshire. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel speculated in Aprilthat Mr Trump may meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. Clinton takes swing at golf-loving Trump Trump's 17-day holiday causes a stir As Trump plays golf, trouble brews It is thought Mr Trump may choose to avoid meetings in London, where he could be confronted by protestors. President Trump's companies operates golf courses in Turnberry and Aberdeenshire in Scotland, and one in Doonbeg in the Republic of Ireland. Details of a stay in Scotland have not been confirmed, but one option under consideration is for him to play a round of golf with a well-known professional player. While on the campaign trail, Mr Trump previously criticised former US president Barack Obama for the time he spent playing golf. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid said he joined his brother on patrol, and witnessed teenagers racially abusing him Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need and says he will make funding for frontline staff a priority. In his first speech to the Police Federation, the home secretary, insisted ""I'm listening and I get it"". Mr Javid also backed calls for spit hoods - mesh guards placed over suspects' heads - across all forces in England and Wales. Labour said it was ""nothing beyond platitudes"" and that action was needed. Mr Javid, whose brother is a chief superintendent in the West Midlands, acknowledged the pressure on forces due to a rise in violent crime and the changing terror threat. He then promised a shift in priorities in a bid to better protect police officers in the next Home Office spending review. Mr Javid said it was ""ridiculous"" the hoods were available to some police forces but not all, committing to do ""everything in my [his] power"" to change this. Spit hoods or guards are designed to stop suspects biting or spitting at police Asked whether the recent rise in violent crime had been the result of falling police numbers, he denied it being down to a ""single driver"" but admitted that without enough resources there would ""clearly"" be an impact. He then pointed out that a decade ago violent crime had risen even though there was no pressure on resources. Previous home secretaries have come under fire for cutting police budgets, but during his speech, Mr Javid said Â£1bn more was already being invested in policing compared to three years ago. Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Policing facing a 'perfect storm' New rules to protect police chase drivers He leant his support to stop and search powers, saying: ""Some of you don't feel comfortable using it - and that's not how it should be. ""I have confidence in your professional judgment. So let me be clear - I support the use of stop and search. ""You have to do your job and that means protecting everyone."" Shadow Policing Minister Louise Haigh rejected Mr Javid's claim he ""gets it"" saying the phrase demonstrates ""denial"" over the effects cuts have had. ""He claims he wants police to have the resources they need, but offers nothing beyond platitudes and the same inadequate funding settlement,"" she said. ""The time for talk has come and gone. The only way Sajid Javid can deliver a 'fresh start' is by putting an end to the Tories' dangerous cuts to our police."" Mr Javid became home secretary in April, afterAmber Rudd resigned her position amid the Windrush revelations. The federation, which represents rank and file officers across England and Wales, has previously shown home secretaries a frosty reception. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Everything was different about this home secretary's speech to the federation. Sajid Javid was applauded onto the stage, and off it. Federation members in the auditorium laughed at his jokes. And, there appeared to be genuine appreciation for his supportive comments about the police service. Unlike Theresa May, and to some extent Amber Rudd, the new home secretary didn't quibble about the crime figures, acknowledging that serious violence was on the rise. He accepted forces were over-stretched. And he came close, the closest any government minister has come, to admitting that, in the phrase favoured by the federation, ""cuts have consequences"". Later, in a short briefing with reporters, Mr Javid said his comments about resources were directed at future needs. But there's no doubt that this 48-year-old brother of a police officer intended his speech to signal a break from the past, and in its tone and substance he managed to achieve it. As of September there were 121,929 officers across the 43 forces, a fall of nearly 20,000 people compared to 10 years ago. Police cuts have come under scrutiny afterfigures have shown an increase in knife and gun crime. In London, 52 people were killed in the first 100 days of 2018,which raised serious concerns about a rise in violent crime. Mr Javid insisted that he is ""absolutely determined"" to end the violence that is ""terminating young lives far too soon"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Scaremongering does nobody any good"" Referring to his brother, Mr Javid added: ""He's been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty. ""I've seen the impact the job has on family life. And, as you would expect from a brother, he doesn't shield me from the truth."" He concluded: ""For those of you who stand in the front line, be in no doubt that I will be standing with you."" Mr Javid said he wanted to ""reset the relationship between government and the police"". He made much of his relationship with his brother, to emphasise a new level of understanding in the Home Office. This video can not be played Sajid Javid's childhood 'gang' story drew laughs from delegates He told delegates: ""You might be thinking 'you're not one of us', as no home secretary has ever served as a police officer"". But, he said, he was the first home secretary with a police officer in his immediate family. After the speech the federation's chair, Calum Macleod, welcomed the change in pace from the home secretary but added ""words are one thing, delivery is something else"". ""We have to be able to hold him to account, we have to work with the Home Office and with the government to ensure positive changes for our membership and for the public are achieved, and that needs to start today.""

"This video can not be played Trump says Kim Jong-un's attitude changed after his second visit to China US President Donald Trump has said there is a ""very substantial chance"" a historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un next month may not happen. He said the North must meet conditions for the summit to go ahead though if it did not, it might happen ""later"". Mr Trump was speaking as he received South Korea's President Moon Jae-in at the White House. The North has said it may cancel the summit if the US insists on it giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally. Mr Trump did not say what conditions the US had set for the summit but, asked by a reporter about the North's arsenal, he said ""denuclearisation must take place"". Trump-Kim 'peace talks' coin criticised North Korea crisis in 300 words The 12 June summit is due to take place in Singapore. It follows a historic meeting between the two Korean leaders in April. Meanwhile, North Korea has agreed to let in journalists from the South to watch the dismantling of its nuclear test site. The group, who had earlier been denied visas, will join a team of international media who are in the country to visit Punggye-ri over the next few days. The demolition of the site has been billed as a goodwill gesture but may be delayed by bad weather. Mr Trump told reporters: ""We'll see what happens. ""There are certain conditions that we want and I think we'll get those conditions and if we don't we don't have the meeting. ""You go into deals that are 100% certain - it doesn't happen. You go into deals that have no chance and it happens and, sometimes, happens easily."" He also said Kim Jong-un's attitude had changed after his second visit to China, earlier this month. Shaking hands at the (fake) DMZ Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site Later in the day, during a news conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo adopted a more positive position, saying the US was still working towards the 12 June date. He commended China for offering ""historic assistance"" in putting pressure on North Korea. Analysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington The optimistic build-up to the summit gave way to a reality check that was bound to happen sooner or later. With Kim Jong-un tapping the brakes and refusing to accept ""unilateral demands"" to disarm, President Trump also took a step back. He set his own conditions, although he didn't say what they were. He did stress that it would be worth it for the North Korean leader to risk denuclearisation, throwing the ball back into Mr Kim's court. The build-up to the summit has been shaped by an unusual degree of public showmanship by both leaders, a diplomatic version of their hostile exchanges last year. But while the threats and insults worked at the rhetorical level, this is about substantive issues where the detail matters. President Moon Jae-in also has his spin. He really wants to seize this opportunity for South Korea's sake and continues to be determined in his optimism, leaving some here wondering whether he's been overstating Kim Jong-un's willingness to deal. North Korea cancelled high-level talks with South Korea, saying the South's joint military exercises with the US - which it had previously said it would tolerate - were a ""provocation"". This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Pyongyang then accused US national security adviser John Bolton of making ""reckless statements"" for hissuggestion that the North could follow a ""Libya model"" of denuclearisation. That was a reference to Libya's former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003 and was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Mr Trump later denied the US would follow the ""Libyan model"" if an agreement was reached with North Korea. ""That model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. It would be historic as no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Mr Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for direct talks after more than a year of heated rhetoric and with global concern that hostilities might escalate into military confrontation. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr Trump was asking aides and advisers whether the meeting should go ahead. North Korea conducted several nuclear tests over the past few years and developed long-distance missiles which, it says, can carry nuclear bombs as far as the US mainland. Many observers had argued before Mr Trump met Mr Moon that there was too much at stake for Washington and Pyongyang not to proceed with the Singapore summit. However, Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. A group of Western, Russian and Chinese journalists have been invited by the North to its remote Punggye-ri nuclear test site ahead of its demolition. They were flown into the North Korean port city of Wonsan but their onward journey was postponed by bad weather, Tom Cheshire from the UK's Sky News tweets. Allow Twitter content?

"Ms Abrams spoke at the 2016 Democratic convention, where Hillary Clinton was nominated A former Georgia lawmaker and author has taken a major step towards becoming the first ever African-American female governor of a US state. Stacey Abrams won the Democratic Party primary on Tuesday, telling voters that trying to ""convert"" Republicans into Democrats had previously failed. A Democrat has not held the red state's governor's mansion since 2003. Ms Abrams, 44, will face a Republican candidate in the high-stakes mid-term contest in November. Lt Gov Casey Cagle won the Republican primary on Tuesday, and will face Georgia's secretary of state Brian Kemp in a run-off on 24 July to decide her eventual opponent. If elected in the deeply conservative state, Ms Abrams would become the first woman and the first person from an ethnic minority to lead the southern state. Lupe Valdez is Texas' first openly gay Latina nominee for governor A number of women battled for and won their Democratic Party mid-term bids in Kentucky, Arkansas and Texas, highlighting the strength of female candidates in the wake of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. In Texas, Democratic candidate and former Dallas County Sherriff Lupe Valdez became the first openly gay Latina nominee for governor in the state's history. Also among the winners was political newcomer Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot, who won a Kentucky primary for a seat in the US Congress. Allow Twitter content?

""It's more, this time, this climate, right now,"" Ms McGrath told CNN before her win against Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. ""It's very clear that people are looking for more women."" The US currently has six female governors. Ms Abrams prevailed over Stacey Evans, a 40-year-old state representative, with three-quarters of the vote. Ms Abrams was raised in Gulfport, Mississippi, with her five siblings. She moved to Atlanta as a teenager with her parents, a college librarian and shipyard worker who both attended Emory University to study divinity and become United Methodist ministers. It was in Georgia where she made her mark with a number of historic achievements. She became the first African American female valedictorian of her high school before earning her undergraduate degree from Spelman College. She also received a master's degree from the University of Texas and a law degree from Yale University. Ms Abrams was first elected to the Georgia state House of Representatives in 2006, and would later become the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly as well as the first African American to lead the state's House of Representatives. She has been considered a rising star among her party's progressive wing, taking centre stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She gave a rousing speech on economic inequality, drawing on her own experience, and strongly backing presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Ms Abrams has won major endorsements from Democrats including Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris Ms Abrams won the support of Mrs Clinton, who recorded a robocall - an automated telephone call with a recorded message - for the former state House minority leader ahead of Tuesday's election. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and California Senator Kamala Harris - who are all viewed as possible 2020 presidential contenders - also threw their support behind Ms Abrams. National organisations including Planned Parenthood, MoveOn and EMILY's List have also endorsed Ms Abrams. Aside from her political work, Ms Abrams has written eight romantic suspense novels under the pen name Selena Montgomery. She wrote her first book, Rules of Engagement, during her third year at Yale Law School,externaland had originally envisioned it as a spy thriller, she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2013.

Ms Abrams has come under scrutiny for lending her campaign $50,000 (Â£37,000) while she owed $50,000 in back taxes, financial disclosures showed. She penned a piece in Fortune magazine addressing her financial struggles,external, explaining how her more than $170,000 in student loan and credit card debt and IRS tax payments should not disqualify her as a candidate for Georgia's governor.

"KeolisAmey already run the Docklands Light Railway in London A Â£5bn contract to run Wales' rail service for the next 15 years has been awarded to two European firms, who will run it jointly. France's Keolis and Spanish-owned Amey's bid triumphed over a rival offer from Hong Kong's MTR commuter railways. It will also drive forward the south Wales Metro in Cardiff and the valleys. The operators said while the changes would not happen overnight Wales' railway ""would be unrecognisable"" in five years time. KeolisAmey already runs Greater Manchester Metrolink and London's Docklands Light Railway, among others. This video can not be played How the new rail franchise will affect passengers in Wales But full details of its plans for Wales will not be revealed until next month. This is to allow for the potential challenge to the process by the other bidder. New rail deal 'complex but exciting' Trade unions lament new Welsh rail deal What will the South Wales Metro look like? Â£180m Metro hub for Cardiff planned What's wrong with Wales' railway? An official announcement was made on Wednesday after a bidding process which started with four companies. Arriva Trains Wales (ATW), which has run the Wales and Borders franchise since 2003,pulled out of the running in December. Keolis is France's largest private sector public transport operator - but its major shareholder is state-owned railway SNCF. Amey was a one-time UK company bought by the Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial, which is the key shareholder and manager of Heathrow airport. KeolisAmey is expected to have included other forms of transport - including so-called ""active"" travel like cycling - in its overall proposals. This video can not be played Arriva Trains Wales passengers started a Facebook group to call for improvements to their commute. There is Â£5bn earmarked over the next 15 years for the Metro, to improve public transport across the south Wales region and includes taking over control from Network Rail and upgrading the Valleys lines. Their vision for meeting this challenge - when it is eventually unveiled - will be of particular interest to business and commuters alike. But they have already promised ""transformative solutions"" for all in Wales and future generations. The new franchise will come into effect from 14 October but all 2,200 ATW staff will be able to transfer and terms and conditions will be protected. ATW's managing director Tom Joyner said it had been a ""privilege"" to operate the services. He said they would work to ensure as smooth a transition as possible. Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent Complaints about overcrowding, particularly on the Valleys lines, and the decades old rolling stock have dogged ATW. While its performance has been criticised, it has been making a decent profit while being heavily subsidised. In fairness to ATW, the contract awarded to it by the UK government assumed there would be no growth in passengers over a 15-year period when in fact the numbers doubled. That stretched services. The Welsh Government has been an ATW critic at times but reaching the point where Cardiff rather than London would make the decisions over who would run rail services in Wales has not been straightforward. This video can not be played What improvements do rail users want to see? There were a number of disputes between both governments, including over funding, before the power to award this franchise was devolved. The bidding process has been expensive for all the companies involved. This is a major investment and after the last 15 years it is clear how strongly people care about rail services. There is certain to be a lot of attention in future on KeolisAmey, the Welsh Government and TfW, the arms length company set up to oversee it, to ensure the promises made are delivered. This video can not be played Rail passengers Jade and Kelly say what they want to see improved from Pontypridd to Cardiff. Transport for Wales (TfW) - which is advising the Welsh Government on the contract - saidthe new franchise holder would be held to account on issues like punctuality, cleanliness and service quality or they would not get paid. But there will be challenges ahead in terms of rising passenger numbers, which have nearly doubled in the last 15 years. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ""Throughout the procurement process we have prioritised investment in the quality of trains, stations and services for the Wales and Borders Rail Service and South Wales Metro. ""We are grateful to all those who have participated in the procurement process."" He said no further comment would be made until the end of the 10-day standstill period. Arriva Trains Wales' current rail network map Andy Milner, Amey's chief executive, said: ""While the proposed changes won't happen overnight, the railway will be unrecognisable in five years thanks to the vision of the Welsh Government."" He added they would focus on working with TfW to transform the existing infrastructure and introduce new trains to ""significantly improve the passenger experience"" as well as creating hundreds of new jobs and apprenticeships. Alistair Gordon, chief executive of Keolis UK, said it would be a transformative new rail service. Both politicians and the rail operator alike will hope the system will be the most attractive option for travellers. TfW will regulate fares and they will not be expected to rise more than inflation. But new trains might take at least a couple of years to appear. Councillor Andrew Morgan, chair of the Cardiff Capital Region cabinet, said: ""This is a fantastic opportunity to create and deliver a transport infrastructure which supports the aims of the City Deal."" He said it was ""absolutely critical"" that a transport service was created which could accommodate and connect passengers in the region ""safely, quickly, and in comfort.""

"Gavin Grimm filed a lawsuit after his high school prevented him from using the men's bathroom A US judge has ruled that federal law protects a transgender student's right to use the bathroom corresponding to his gender identity. In the latest legal twist to a long-running case, a Virginia court rejected Gloucester County school board's bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Gavin Grimm, a student who has since graduated. Mr Grimm sued after his school barred him from using the men's bathroom. He said he felt an ""incredible sense of relief"" after the ruling. ""After fighting this policy since I was 15 years old, I finally have a court decision saying that what the Gloucester County School Board did to me was wrong and it was against the law,"" he said. Mr Grimm's case has been the most prominent in the debate over which bathroom transgender people should be permitted to use, a debate that has come to the forefront of LGBT rights over the past few years. Why toilets matter to trans rights How one woman's 'bathroom bill' campaign went viral This decision does not completely end his case, but the judge on Tuesday ordered the school board to arrange a settlement conference within 30 days. ""The district court's ruling vindicates what Gavin has been saying from the beginning,"" said Joshua Block, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. US district judgeArenda Wright Allen's ruling,externalsaid the school's argument was ""resoundingly unpersuasive"", and she refused to throw out Mr Grimm's claim as the school had requested. Mr Grimm sued Gloucester High School in July 2015, saying its policy of making him use a separate unisex bathroom violated the following: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bars discrimination in education on the basis of sex Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which rules no state can deny ""equal protection of its laws"" to any of its people. The school had initially allowed him to use the men's bathroom after he explained he had transitioned to male. But several adults complained about the the move, and the school's principal said he would from then on have to use newly installed single-person bathrooms. Many places in the US now have gender-neutral bathrooms The lawsuit made its way up to the US Supreme Court after a series of cases in Virginia. The country's highest court agreed to take the suit after an appeals court ruled in favour of Mr Grimm following a directive from then-President Barack Obama, saying federal law protects transgender bathroom rights. Butthe US Supreme Court reversed its decisionafter President Donald Trump rescinded his predecessor's guidelines.

"The chances of an interest rate rise this year have receded after Consumer Price Inflation fell to 2.4% in April - its lowest level since March 2017. The fall from 2.5% in March was partly due to the timing of Easter, which meant a seasonal rise in air fares was not included in April this year. The pound fell about half a cent against the dollar after the figures were released before rising to $1.3368. Analysts now question the prospect of any rate rises this year. ""Inflation falling for the third month in a row further dents any hopes of a late-summer rate rise from the Bank of England,"" said Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. Neil Jones at Mizuho Bank said: ""It is starting to appear the weaker CPI is more structural and not just because of the bad weather. Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh and may indeed put the Bank on hold throughout the summer and beyond."" However, Nikesh Sawjani, UK economist at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, disagreed. ""The impact of recent increases in oil prices and previously announced hikes in utility tariffs should ensure that inflation proves more 'sticky' than it has done so far this year,"" he said. ""Against such a backdrop, and with the economy expected to recover in the second quarter, we expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates at its meeting in August."" Inflation is easing but for how long? Wage squeeze worst in modern history, says TUC Carney: Brexit uncertainty could delay interest rate rise Rate rise doubts as property demand falls, says RICS Mike Hardie of the Office for National Statistics said the fall in inflation was partially offset by the rise infuel prices, which are now at their highest levelfor three-and-a-half years. The average price of petrol has risen to 127.22p a litre and diesel to 129.96p following a rapid rise in the cost of oil. The figures did show the effect of the new sugar tax on soft drinks and juices. Inflation keeps on coming in lower than expected. If you strip out volatile items such as food and fuel, then so-called ""core inflation"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney's preferred measure, is only 2.1% - barely above the 2% target. From being 90% sure a couple of months ago that a second interest rate rise would have happened by now, the markets now think it's unlikely before November. Why raise rates even then? The thinking now is - inflationary pressures may have abated for now, but the Bank has to look two years ahead. At the last count (first three months of the year), the average pay rise was 2.9% and it may go higher. The pound has weakened against the dollar recently and if higher oil prices, priced in dollars, are here to stay, they are likely to push up the cost of imported goods. The Bank isn't at all sure the threat from above-target inflation has gone for good. In April, the pound climbed as high as $1.4325 on expectations that UK interest rates would soon be moving higher. However, since then, weaker economic data has reversed that thinking and the pound has fallen almost 7% from that April high. Inflation on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure rose to 3.4%, from 3.3% in March.

"There have been 67 murders in the capital in 2018 The UK ""is fast becoming the biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe"", the security minister has said. Ben Wallace said the ""high-margin, high-supply drug"" was ""fuelling"" an increase in violence on the streets. Technology had enabled young dealers to evade detection and order drugs direct from ""serious"" gangs, he told MPs. The minister said he was ""not deaf"" to Labour claims that police cuts had increased the pressure on officers trying to deal with the problem. Labour MP David Lammy warned of more killings in London if the authorities did not take urgent action, adding that ministers must ask themselves ""do black lives matter?"" The Tottenham MP has previously linked the spike in London's murder rate, with 67 killings so far this year, to the cocaine trade. He warned MPs the murder rate could rise to 100 by the autumn and he could not help thinking that more attention would have been paid if this level of violent crime was happening in a ""leafy shire"". Mayor urges 'targeted' stop and search 'McMafia gangs' fuel London violence - MP The children forced to sell drugs His comments came as MPs debated the government's serious violence strategy. The minister said the ubiquity of smart phones and growth of encryption had, increasingly, cut out the ""middle men"" when it came to international drug-dealing. ""Young people have the ability to order drugs, and gangs have the ability to have delivered to their door large packets of drugs from Albanian or Serbian drug gangs, or indeed from local drug gangs,"" he said. ""That has put a real power into a system where at the same time the UK is fast becoming the biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe, so there is a high demand by the consumer."" Labour's David Lammy said young people were picking up knives for their own protection Cocaine was, he said, no longer ""the preserve of the yuppie or the rich"" and its increasing use in rural communities such as his Lancashire constituency was causing turf wars between different criminal gangs as they sought to enforce their so-called ""county lines"". ""It is a high-margin, high-supply drug at the moment, and that is fuelling that increased violence. ""With those serious organised criminals...they don't just put a 15-year-old in a house or they 'cuckoo' the house; they provide a weapon to enforce the drug line. ""And sometimes, if the 15-year-old is not a willing participant, they will ruthlessly enforce that county line with violence, and they will kill those people and they'll kill the local drug dealers if they get in their way."" Promising that new measures to crack down on the possession of knives and a consultation on extending stop and search powers would be brought before Parliament within weeks, Mr Wallace warned the UK could not ""arrest our way"" out of some of challenges it faced. ""I wish I had more money,"" he said. ""I didn't come in here to cut things. There is sometimes a suggestion that we had a choice and we chose not to spend money."" David Lammy, said demand for drugs was ""driving violence"" and young people living on estates were picking up knives not because they were gang members but because they feared for their lives. ""They are hiding them in bushes on the way to school and they're finding them on Saturdays and Sundays because they're scared,"" he said. The Tottenham MP suggested there was a racial dimension to how the issue was being treated, questioning whether the authorities would be talking about awareness-raising exercises and funding for at-risk children if ""50 or 60 white middle-class young people were killed in Surrey or Kent in the space of five months"". ""This debate must also quite properly, as it has already done, land on the issue of whether in fact black lives matter in this country. ""If we don't solve this problem by the autumn we will be over 100 - you heard it here first - young people, more than New York, dead in this country. ""Do black lives matter or not? That is the question for the minister."" His colleague Lyn Brown said for the past year her East Ham community had been ""haunted"" by violence as she read out the names of the nine young people killed since the start of 2017.

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them.

They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

To get that America and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”, his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader. Kim Jong-un has achieved his goal. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will.""

"Philip Roth was presented with the National Humanities Medal by then President Barack Obama in 2011 One of the great American authors, Philip Roth, has died aged 85. The Pulitzer, National Book Award and Man Booker International Prize-winning novelist's work drew its inspiration from Jewish family life, sex and American ideals. His works included American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and Portnoy's Complaint. The New York Times reported that a close friend of Roth's said he had died of congestive heart failure. Roth first found success with his short story collection, Goodbye Columbus, published in 1959. A decade later his sexually explicit novel Portnoy's Complaint catapulted him to notoriety, making him a celebrity in the US. Author who scandalised middle America Philip Roth in his own words In later life, he wrote a number of highly regarded historical novels, including his 1997 work American Pastoral, for which he won his Pulitzer. He wrote prolifically over the course of his career, publishing more than 30 books before ending his fiction career in 2009. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons When Roth won the 2011 Man Booker International, chairman of the judges Rick Gekoski said: ""His career is remarkable in that he starts at such a high level, and keeps getting better. ""In his 50s and 60s, when most novelists are in decline, he wrote a string of novels of the highest, enduring quality."" He also recognised thatRoth's win divided the Man Booker International panel, and had caused one judge to quit in protest. ""I can recall few of his novels that don't provoke an occasional but overwhelming desire to shout 'Will you shut up!' at a character or his author,"" he said. By James Naughtie, BBC books editor His heritage was extremely important, and in some ways he wrestled with it all his life. The question of identity, which is the question which, in the melting pot of America, is always going to be the one that a serious writer has to grapple with. Where do you come from? What do you do? What kind of kid are you growing up in New York? That was the obsession that took him right through his writing. But in the end, you've just got to remember that here was a man who could write beautiful prose. That's what carried him through. His death puts an end to a whole era of American literature. In 2014, Roth told the BBC he would make no more public appearances: ""I can guarantee you that this is my last appearance ever on television... absolutely [my] last appearance on any stage anywhere."" Speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, his biographer Blake Bailey spoke of how much Roth enjoyed writing about the Jewish neighbourhood where he grew up, in Newark, New Jersey.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Philip Roth began his career as an enfant terrible, whose fourth novel, Portnoy's Complaint, scandalised middle America. Decades later, he was the grand old man of American letters and many - perhaps including Roth himself - could not understand why he had not been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Roth wrote more than 30 novels about sex, death, art and politics, human weakness and imperfections and the experience of being Jewish in America. His work often drew on his own life and frequently featured alter egos who bore a remarkable similarity to their creator (and sometimes shared his name). Roth's admirers considered him the greatest American novelist of the late 20th century, whose sparse but sensitive prose style they likened to Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner. His later novels in particular offered a fictional history of modern America that was sympathetic but unsparing in its attack on moral complacency and empty consumerism. Philip Roth was born in 1933 in Newark, New Jersey, where many of his books were set. His parents were middle class first-generation Jewish immigrants from Europe. He studied for a masters degree in English literature at the University of Chicago and began writing short stories. Revisiting his roots in Newark, New Jersey Roth's first book appeared in 1959. Goodbye Columbus was a collection of five stories and the title novella, a satirical tale of a nice middle-class Jewish boy's struggle to be assimilated into mainstream American society. In a pattern that was to be repeated several times during Roth's career, it caused outrage in some quarters. He was denounced for the unflattering portraits of some of the Jewish characters and accused of being a ""self-hating Jew"". Others praised his wit and the liveliness with which he brought his world alive. The book won an award from the Jewish Book Council. That controversy was as nothing to the storm that swirled around Portnoy's Complaint in 1969, a monologue supposedly delivered to his psychoanalyst by a ""lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor"". It was funny, explicit and for the time shockingly frank. There were attempts to ban the book in Australia and some US states, but it became a best-seller. Roth later said the book had ""put the id back into Yid"". Though Roth himself objected to being labelled a Jewish writer - ""If I am anything, I am an American writer,"" he protested - the Jewish experience was central to many of his later books. Several featured Nathan Zuckerman, first encountered in The Ghost Writer (1979) as a young man who apparently believes he has found Anne Frank (it seems she survived the Holocaust and was living in America). Zuckerman appeared in 10 books in all, including two often numbered among Roth's best. In American Pastoral (1997) Zuckerman narrates the tale of a former high school classmate, Swede Levov, whose teenage daughter rebels against her middle class background to become a terrorist in late 1960s America. In The Human Stain (2000), Zuckerman tells the story of Coleman Silk, a college professor who is pilloried for a chance remark interpreted as racist, and who turns out himself to be a light-skinned African-American who has ""passed"" for white throughout his adult life. Another alter ego, David Kepesh, appeared for the first time in a 1972 novel called The Breast, in which he awakes to find himself transformed into a giant breast. A character called ""Philip Roth"" appears in other books including The Plot Against America (2004), a counter-factual story set in the New Jersey of Roth's childhood in which the aviator and alleged Nazi sympathiser Charles Lindbergh, becomes US president and begins a programme of forced assimilation of American Jewry modelled on Nazi Germany. Several of his novels dealt with politics. Our Gang, published in 1971 straight after Portnoy's Complaint, is a political satire written almost entirely in dialogue with occasional stage directions. In The Prague Orgy (1985) Zuckerman encounters the fragmented relationship between politics, sexuality and censorship in communist Czechoslovakia and in Operation Shylock (1993) ""Philip Roth"" travels to Israel to cover the trial of a former concentration camp guard, John Demjanjuk. Philip Roth with former US President Barack Obama, who presented him with the National Humanities Medal in 2011 I Married a Communist (1998) was set in the McCarthyite communist-hunting era of the 1950s and was reputedly prompted by Roth's failed marriage to the English actor Claire Bloom. She had persuaded him for a time to live in London, a city where he felt out of place. Another admired novel, Sabbath's Theater (1995), featured as its protagonist an ageing sex-obsessed puppeteer and helped fuel complaints by Roth's detractors that he could be vain, grumpy, narcissistic and misogynistic. His defenders argue that these apparently objectionable attributes are those of his fictional characters rather than of the author himself. In response to the claims of misogyny, they point out that his male characters are often depicted as weak, helpless and prey to the perversity of sexual desire. As well as being a prolific writer, Roth was an academic, teaching creative writing at the Universities of Iowa and Princeton and later comparative literature at the University of Pennsylvania, until he retired in 1991. He knew when to quit as a writer, too.  In 2009 he gave up writing fiction and in 2014 he told the BBC he would make no more public appearances: ""I can guarantee you that this is my last appearance ever on television... absolutely [my] last appearance on any stage anywhere."" He had long since retired to rural Connecticut, where he re-read all his books back as far as Portnoy's Complaint, pronouncing himself broadly satisfied. ""I did the best I could with what I had,"" he told one interviewer, quoting the champion heavyweight boxer Joe Louis, adding that working at writing nearly every day for 50 years ""turns out to be an extremely taxing job and hardly the pleasantest of human activities"".

I've had some experiences in the military that I thought would prepare me for dealing with this and I knew there was going to be some violence towards these animals but what I saw was shocking. To these people, killing animals is a sport - the more brutal, the better. The BBC team was able infiltrate the gangs using social media. They had discovered that convicted badger baiter Christian Latcham from the Rhondda Valleys, south Wales, was active in online groups for legal hunting with dogs. He then put them in touch with another man - Tomas Young, 25, from the Gwent Valleys - who invited us out on what turned out to be illegal hunting trips. This video can not be played BBC Wales Investigates went undercover to expose badger-baiting gangs The gangs are mostly working-class guys in their twenties. They use social media like Snapchat to organise digs and share pictures. These people are very suspicious and guarded. There were a number of occasions where I was questioned quite heavily about my background. They asked if I was an undercover police officer or if I was wearing recording equipment and I had to use my skills to try and persuade them that that wasn't the case. Secret badger baiting network exposed Animal cruelty jail sentences increased I didn't feel afraid as such but I got the feeling that if I'd have been found out, it might have turned nasty. I feared they might have used the dogs to intimidate me. I went with them three times to try to capture evidence. The first time Tomas invited me ""lamping"" - hunting at night with high-powered torches - in the Forest of Dean. I didn't know at the time that this would be illegal hunting. But on the way there, they started talking about the types of animals we were going to see - deer, boar, possibly some foxes and maybe even some badgers if they were out. They said there would be ""loads of guys"" out hunting that night and that they knew of gangs that came from as far away as Newcastle to go lamping in the Forest. Tomas and another man - Ryan Harrison - had three dogs with them - one which was big, quite aggressive-looking, with a pit bull sort of setting and two lurcher-type dogs. We went into a field and Ryan shone the lamp at some deer - I could see about six to eight pairs of eyes in the dark. The dogs immediately started chasing them down and the two men were getting really, really excited. One deer ran straight into a fence and got trapped. One of the lurchers had it by the back legs and was trying to drag it back through the fence. There was an awful noise, the sound of the deer screaming, trying to get away. At this point, Ryan jumped on it, and started to struggle with it but the deer kicked him in the face and at that point he let go. The deer ran off and managed to escape from the dogs but without doubt it was injured and was in awful pain. Hidden camera footage shows a deer being attacked by the one of the hunters' dogs Ryan had been injured - he had damage to his mouth where the deer had kicked him and his hands were also hurt but to him it was all part of the sport and the injuries were badges of honour. The night was about to get even worse. We drove to another area, where we spotted some wild boar. Very, very quickly, the two guys and their dogs were out of the vehicle and ran off chasing the boar. I chased after them and when I caught up with them, the scene in front of me was horrific. One lurcher was on the back end of the boar and the bull cross dog had latched onto its snout. There were horrendous screams. Ryan was trying to drag the boar down and the animal was really strong, kicking out, fighting for its life. Tomas then pulled out a large knife and started stabbing the boar. Tomas Young from the Gwent Valleys It died in front of me. It seemed to make the men quite frenzied. Tomas even filmed himself stabbing the boar on his phone and played it back in the car afterwards. I'd never seen anything like it before; somebody hunting down and killing a wild animal like that, just to see how tough and violent their dogs could be. It's a badge of pride to have an injured dog which carries on fighting. The boar's carcass was hidden in undergrowth and Tomas told me that ""one of the boys"" would pick it up later. I also went out with Tomas and some other men on a couple of badger digs, which is where they send a terrier into a badger sett wearing a transmitter collar so they locate it in the sett from above ground. Once they hear that it's found a badger, they will dig down into the sett so the other dogs can pull it out and fight it to the death. The first time, they didn't get anything, despite them digging for around eight hours. Tomas got frustrated with his dog because although it seemed to have found a badger, it hadn't latched onto it and let it get away. He was getting quite a lot of ribbing from the other guys in the group, saying his dog wasn't tough enough. That's what really gets to these guys, if their dog isn't aggressive enough and doesn't immediately go down and attack the badger - they think that's a reflection of them as a handler. What they want is to see the dog come back out with injuries on it because that's a sign of a tough dog. They then photograph these dogs - with their injuries - and share the photos with other illegal hunters with a view to breeding them. On the way home, Tomas told me he was disappointed with his dog's performance. Then he told me he'd shot dogs before when they hadn't worked in the way he'd wanted them to. The litters of prized working dogs can go for quite a bit of money - a few hundred pounds a pup. The second time, I went with Tomas and Ryan up towards the Forest of Dean area again, and quite quickly they found a sett. You could hear some growling from the dog that was underground so they started digging down and they could see the black and white fur of the badger. They thought this was an adult so sent one of the bigger lurcher dogs into the ground to pull it out. Two dogs eventually dragged it out but it was a cub. It had no chance and within seconds it was torn apart. Ryan took it off the dogs and threw it on the side. They weren't happy it was a cub because they don't put up much of a fight and the whole aim of this exercise for the badger baiters is for their dogs to have some credible combat; a proper fight with an adult badger who could do some damage to the dogs. They were going to leave this cub, but I saw it was still alive, it was still breathing and I had to tell them to put it out of its misery. Hidden camera footage of the gang illegally digging for badgers in west Wales I thought I was going to blow my cover then because that could have been something that alerted them that I wasn't 100% the way there were, as much as I was trying to act like I was. It was difficult to see how these men treat their dogs; some of them were kicked or dragged and there was a lot of abuse thrown at them. You could see the dogs cowering at times, it appeared they were afraid of their owners. It's very common to have the bottom part of a dog's jaw being damaged or ripped away in a fight with a badger. But when dogs come out of the setts on the digs I filmed they would turn them around and push them straight back in to carry on looking for the badger. Generally badger baiters don't take them to vets with their injuries because that would be recorded and reported so they stitch up their wounds themselves. They are valuable dogs for hunting and breeding so they're a commodity to them and they'll protect the commodity but they don't have any concern about the feelings of the animal. And they're quite happy to dispose of them once they're no longer a useful commodity. Tomas told me he had shot dogs before which hadn't performed properly on hunts. My lasting feeling after being undercover with these people is that what they are doing is just horrific. It was far, far worse than what I expected to see. They don't care if the animals they kill suffer; they're just killing them for sport. Exposed: The Secret World of Badger Baiterson BBC One Wales at 22:35 and on BBCiPlayer.

"The coin featuring the leaders' faces received a bashing on social media A commemorative coin issued by the White House ahead of the planned summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been widely criticised. The coin describes the summit as ""peace talks"" and depicts a square-jawed Mr Trump sternly facing his North Korean counterpart. Many on social media pointed out that the meeting may not even take place. The White House said issuing such a coin was ""common practice"". Regional expert Prof Robert E Kelly, of Busan University in South Korea, took to Twitter to describe the coin as ""gross"". ""Whose personality cult exactly is this summit legitimising?

"This video can not be played Thousands attended the event in Manchester's Albert Square Over 3,500 singers have come together to lead a chorus of amateur voices in a mass sing-along to remember the Manchester Arena attack victims. Twenty-two people died and hundreds injured when a bomb was detonated outside a concert on 22 May 2017. Manchester Together in Albert Square featured songs by Elbow and Oasis. It followsa memorial service at Manchester Cathedral, which saw Prince William join political leaders and the families of the victims to remember. This video can not be played Who were the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena attack? Some of those who have gathered have a connection to what happened on the night, while others have come to show their support. Gina and Casey Hankey, from Stoke, said they were at the arena. ""We did the arena visits, so this is another step. The atmosphere has been good so far, but it's still a bit sad."" Rachel and Mia, from Bolton, said they had come ""to show we won't be beaten and show you carry on and remember those who died"". Julie, from Eccles, who came with her son Louis, said they wanted ""to pay our respects as it just touched everybody"". 'This is the place' -At the scene: Kaleigh Watterson, BBC News Last year, a vigil was held in Albert Square with thousands gathering to honour those who lost their lives and to show solidarity in the face of hatred. This year, thousands gathered again on the same spot in an atmosphere that was much more upbeat. Tony Walsh's poem This Is The Place, which left many in tears a year ago was this time set to a dance beat, with the crowd clapping along, cheering and giving it a rapturous round of applause. Tonight is emotional, there is no doubt about that, but it also feels like a celebration of Manchester's spirit, which guided the city in those dark days last May. Ahead of the singing, the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend David Walker, led those assembled in a minute's silence. He also told the crowd that the 22 candles lit in tribute to the victims at Manchester Cathedral had been made from the remnants of the hundreds left around the city in the aftermath of the attack. The crowd also heard from some of those singing, including two members of the A City United Choir, a one-off coming together of the signing groups attached to the city's Premier League football teams. Nine-year-old Molly said she was taking part because it was ""a good thing to do for all the people who can't be here"", while Matty, 14, said the unity in singing ""is what Manchester's all about"". Thousands crammed into Albert Square for the two-hour event The sing-along saw performances from 10 singing groups, including the Manchester Survivors Choir, who sang a tearful version of Andra Day's Rise Up to rapturous applause, and the Parrs Wood High School Harmony Group. The former is made up of people who were caught up the attack last year, while the latter saw their post-attack tribute - a version of Ariana Grande's My Everything - go viral and earn them the chance to perform with the star at the One Love Manchester concert. Many at the sing-along were wearing the bee emblem, a symbol of Manchester's defiance That concert was held two weeks after the homemade device was detonated outside Grande's concert. Daren Buckley, who is in Manchester Survivors' Choir, said he had found comfort in singing, but thathis recovery was far from complete. ""It's strange because I never used to have fear over anything. I have flashbacks,"" he said. ""I must've died 200 times in my nightmares."" The two-hour event saw the choirs sing versions of many popular songs, including Labi Siffre's Something Inside So Strong, Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, Emile Sande's Wonder, Clean Bandit's Symphony and Coldplay's Fix You. This video can not be played Bells rang out at St Ann's Church, Manchester Town Hall and St Mary's Roman Catholic Church It also saw poet Tony Walsh call for the crowd to join him in making a ""minute's noise for the 22"" and ""in solidarity with everyone that was injured, mentally and physically [and] for those who were first on the scene"". It concluded with a mass sing-along of five songs - Oasis' Don't Look Back In Anger, Elbow's One Day Like This, Grande's One Last Time, Take That's Never Forget and The Beatles' All You Need Is Love. The Oasis song, which was introduced via a video message by Noel Gallagher, became an anthem of defiance in the aftermath of the attack and wassung by a crowd in Manchester's St Ann's Squarefollowing a minute's silence on 25 May 2017. People have been writing tributes to those who died on St Ann's Square's paving stones As happened a year ago, many people have once again left flowers in St Ann's Square From 21:30 BST, song lyrics chosen by members of the public will be projected onto its pavements and buildings.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid said he joined his brother on patrol, and witnessed teenagers racially abusing him Sajid Javid has promised to ensure police officers have the resources they need and says he will make funding for frontline staff a priority. In his first speech to the Police Federation, the home secretary, insisted ""I'm listening and I get it"". Mr Javid also backed calls for spit hoods - mesh guards placed over suspects' heads - across all forces in England and Wales. Labour said it was ""nothing beyond platitudes"" and that action was needed. Mr Javid, whose brother is a chief superintendent in the West Midlands, acknowledged the pressure on forces due to a rise in violent crime and the changing terror threat. He then promised a shift in priorities in a bid to better protect police officers in the next Home Office spending review. Mr Javid said it was ""ridiculous"" the hoods were available to some police forces but not all, committing to do ""everything in my [his] power"" to change this. Spit hoods or guards are designed to stop suspects biting or spitting at police Asked whether the recent rise in violent crime had been the result of falling police numbers, he denied it being down to a ""single driver"" but admitted that without enough resources there would ""clearly"" be an impact. He then pointed out that a decade ago violent crime had risen even though there was no pressure on resources. Previous home secretaries have come under fire for cutting police budgets, but during his speech, Mr Javid said Â£1bn more was already being invested in policing compared to three years ago. Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Policing facing a 'perfect storm' New rules to protect police chase drivers He leant his support to stop and search powers, saying: ""Some of you don't feel comfortable using it - and that's not how it should be. ""I have confidence in your professional judgment. So let me be clear - I support the use of stop and search. ""You have to do your job and that means protecting everyone."" Shadow Policing Minister Louise Haigh rejected Mr Javid's claim he ""gets it"" saying the phrase demonstrates ""denial"" over the effects cuts have had. ""He claims he wants police to have the resources they need, but offers nothing beyond platitudes and the same inadequate funding settlement,"" she said. ""The time for talk has come and gone. The only way Sajid Javid can deliver a 'fresh start' is by putting an end to the Tories' dangerous cuts to our police."" Mr Javid became home secretary in April, afterAmber Rudd resigned her position amid the Windrush revelations. The federation, which represents rank and file officers across England and Wales, has previously shown home secretaries a frosty reception. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Everything was different about this home secretary's speech to the federation. Sajid Javid was applauded onto the stage, and off it. Federation members in the auditorium laughed at his jokes. And, there appeared to be genuine appreciation for his supportive comments about the police service. Unlike Theresa May, and to some extent Amber Rudd, the new home secretary didn't quibble about the crime figures, acknowledging that serious violence was on the rise. He accepted forces were over-stretched. And he came close, the closest any government minister has come, to admitting that, in the phrase favoured by the federation, ""cuts have consequences"". Later, in a short briefing with reporters, Mr Javid said his comments about resources were directed at future needs. But there's no doubt that this 48-year-old brother of a police officer intended his speech to signal a break from the past, and in its tone and substance he managed to achieve it. As of September there were 121,929 officers across the 43 forces, a fall of nearly 20,000 people compared to 10 years ago. Police cuts have come under scrutiny afterfigures have shown an increase in knife and gun crime. In London, 52 people were killed in the first 100 days of 2018,which raised serious concerns about a rise in violent crime. Mr Javid insisted that he is ""absolutely determined"" to end the violence that is ""terminating young lives far too soon"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Scaremongering does nobody any good"" Referring to his brother, Mr Javid added: ""He's been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty. ""I've seen the impact the job has on family life. And, as you would expect from a brother, he doesn't shield me from the truth."" He concluded: ""For those of you who stand in the front line, be in no doubt that I will be standing with you."" Mr Javid said he wanted to ""reset the relationship between government and the police"". He made much of his relationship with his brother, to emphasise a new level of understanding in the Home Office. This video can not be played Sajid Javid's childhood 'gang' story drew laughs from delegates He told delegates: ""You might be thinking 'you're not one of us', as no home secretary has ever served as a police officer"". But, he said, he was the first home secretary with a police officer in his immediate family. After the speech the federation's chair, Calum Macleod, welcomed the change in pace from the home secretary but added ""words are one thing, delivery is something else"". ""We have to be able to hold him to account, we have to work with the Home Office and with the government to ensure positive changes for our membership and for the public are achieved, and that needs to start today.""

"Philip Wilson was found guilty of concealing child sexual abuse A Catholic archbishop in Australia convicted of concealing child sexual abuse will step down from his position. Philip Wilson, the archbishop of Adelaide, South Australia, was found guiltyof covering up the crimes of a paedophile priest by a court on Tuesday. He is the most senior Catholic in the world to be convicted of the offence. Wilson said he would step aside from his duties on Friday. ""It is appropriate that, in the light of some of his Honour's findings, I stand aside from my duties as Archbishop,"" he said in a statement released on Wednesday. ""If at any point in time it becomes necessary or appropriate for me to take more formal steps, including by resigning as Archbishop, then I will do so."" He did not indicate whether he would appeal the Newcastle Local Court's conviction, for which he faces a maximum two year sentence. Sex abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know On Tuesday, the court ruled that Wilson had known about a paedophile priest's abuse of altar boys in the 1970s and failed to report the crimes to police. A magistrate found that Wilson, who was told about the abuse from young victims, dismissed their stories because of his desire to protect the Church's reputation. Child sexual abuse survivors in Australia have praised the verdict as a milestone in confirming the church's legal accountability for such crimes.

"North Korea has said it will start dismantling its nuclear test site this week, in a ceremony to be attended by foreign journalists. But what would it take for the country to truly ""denuclearise""? In the mountainous north-east of North Korea lies Pyongyang's nuclear test facility - the Punggye-ri complex. It has been used for six nuclear tests since 2006, but North Korea says""technical measures"" to dismantle it will be carried outbetween 23 and 25 May. North Korea has said it is committed to denuclearisation, but has threatened to pull out of forthcoming talks with US President Donald Trump, ina disagreement over how that might happen. At first glance, Pyongyang's pledge to close the test site appears to be a welcome first step. But it could indicate that it believes its nuclear programme has made sufficient progress and full testing is no longer needed. North Korea's nuclear weapons programme also goes far beyond the existence of one site. ThePunggye-ri nuclear facility is the dedicated test site for North Korea's nuclear weapons, with a system of tunnels dug below nearby Mount Mantap. It has been suggested the site has partially collapsed already. A satellite image of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea Pyongyang says inviting foreign observers - South Korean and international journalists - tosee the tunnels being collapsed and observation facilities removedwill show its work in a ""transparent manner"". But it is not clear that experts have been invited as well - a measure that is necessary for the process to be properly assessed. Inviting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) would allow confirmation that the test site is no longer capable of conducting nuclear tests. The organisation, a UN-backed monitoring group that aims to ban nuclear tests worldwide, maintains a network of sensors to ensure that none is being conducted. Its experts would be able to give a technical judgement about the completeness of the test site destruction. Trump says Kim Jong-un won't be deposed North Korea crisis in 300 words Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme Kim Jong-un's warning shot to the US Analysts will be looking for the collapse of the available test tunnels at Punggye-ri and removal of monitoring facilities. After the ceremony, satellite imagery will be used by governments and independent experts to monitor for activity, new buildings and equipment, which might indicate that North Korea plans to resume testing. Satellite imagery may not help if North Korea clandestinely opens a new nuclear test site. It has many other mountains that could be used. But if that were the case, it would be unable to hide any new underground tests, as the resulting seismic tremors would be detected. Closing the site would only be a first step towards full denuclearisation. It also has a range of facilities that allows it to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium - the fissile materials needed for a nuclear weapon. Among these are several uranium mines, as well as centrifuges, nuclear reactors and reprocessing facilities at its main nuclear facility - theYongbyon nuclear complex. In addition, it has the means of delivery for weapons - an intercontinental ballistic missile programme. However, earlier this year a thaw in relations on the Korean peninsula sawNorth Korea announce it was halting all missile and nuclear testing. Pyongyang's commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's long-standing demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament (CVID). However, even stopping short of this, there are precedents that could help reduce instability. In 1994,the Agreed Framework saw North Korea halt its nuclear programme, in return for heavy fuel oil and two light-water nuclear reactors. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - which oversees the use of nuclear technology - successfully carried out inspections to verify that North Korea was not diverting nuclear material for weapons production. Inspections at the Yongbyon nuclear complex were a prominent part of the Agreed Framework and a cooling tower for a nuclear reactor used to produce plutonium was destroyed. However, this was not irreversible and in 2002, following the collapse of the agreement, Pyongyang announced it was reactivating Yongbyon. An admission that it had produced nuclear weapons for ""self defence"" followed in 2005. Any future denuclearisation agreement would require an extraordinary amount of access for inspectors. Destruction of the Punggye-ri test site may take a matter of weeks, but verifying the dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons infrastructure would take years. There are many ways in which the process could go awry. More stories like this: Why Ebola keeps coming back Why has Saudi Arabia suddenly decided cinema is OK? Five ways China's past has shaped its present Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament requires continuing monitoring of any remaining nuclear facilities. Inspectors would need to be able to access declared facilities and they would need to monitor for clandestine sites. Even then, there is little that can be done to undo the substantial expertise - both technical and scientific - that North Korea has acquired over the past decades. The physical infrastructure doesn't need to survive for the underlying knowledge to remain. Without continuous intrusive monitoring by international inspectors, North Korea could restart its nuclear weapons programme within a matter of years.

"Manchester is marking the first anniversary of the arena bombing. The survivors of the atrocity, in which 22 people died, explain how they have coped and how they are approaching the milestone. Daren Buckley helped treat and comfort the wounded and dying ForDaren Buckley, life changed forever when 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated his home-made device. The 50-year-old had been about to leave the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena when the blast almost knocked him and his son off their feet. The pair had been standing only nine metres (30ft) from the bomber, and Mr Buckley struggles to describe the ""complete chaos"" of the moments that followed, which were filled with screams and confusion. Yet the father of four's first instinct was not to flee, but to run to help the wounded - ripping up piles of souvenir Ariana Grande T-shirts to be used as bandages. He said: ""We saw a big puff of smoke and a flash. It knocked us back. We thought the building was about to collapse. I couldn't hear anything - it was like water was in my ears. ""I took my son to a safe place with another chap and said to him to stay there, that I had to go and help. ""That's when the screaming started. The scenes in the foyer I can't describe. It was like a nightmare. I thought someone was going to tap me on my shoulder and say it was a dream."" Thousands attended a vigil in Manchester's Albert Square following the bombing Mr Buckley, who has basic first aid training, joined a handful of arena staff who initially tended to the injured and dying. He continued: ""I looked around on the floor. Some people were moving, some weren't. I was talking to people who seemed alright, just trying to reassure them. It was just an instinct, which is human."" The emergency services soon arrived, before armed police declared the area a crime scene, and Mr Buckley and his son were moved away. A year later, the married pub cellar man remains traumatised. Manchester remembers arena bomb victims Arena bomb 'injured more than 800' Attack 'could have been stopped' Mr Buckley, from Swinton, has only recently felt able to return to Manchester city centre, but he plans to go to the service at the city's cathedral. He said he'd found comfort in joining the Manchester Survivors Choir, which will be performing at Tuesday'ssing-along event in Albert Square, but that his recovery was far from complete. ""If I hear sirens I'm thinking 'do I have to go and help someone else?' - I feel like I'm still in adrenaline mode,"" he said. ""It's strange because I never used to have fear over anything. I have flashbacks. ""I must've died 200 times in my nightmares."" Lyndsay Turner and her son Ciaran Danson say it has been a struggle to get help WhenLyndsay Turnerbought her two children tickets to the concert she wanted to make sure it was a special evening and hired a limo. She had originally planned to go with them but was awaiting surgery so gave the ticket to her sister-in-law, who attended with Lyndsay's mother. However, she kept in touch with her family throughout the night, and was on the phone to her sonCiaran Danson, now 14, when the explosion happened. ""I heard the bang and I said 'Ciaran, what's that?' and I could hear panic in his voice and then the phone went dead."" It wasn't until 45 minutes later that her mother was able to ring. ""The fact that I bought the tickets, I put them in danger, it'll always live with me,"" she said. Ciaran still hopes to follow in his hero's footsteps and become a singer one day Both children were left with severe post-traumatic stress. Tegan, now 12, spent some time in hospital and Ciaran is still struggling. He has flashbacks, has been unable to sleep and experiences ""very scary"" hallucinations of the attacker, he said. ""It was just a blur at first but now he's as real as you or me."" Ms Turner, from Blackpool, says ""a part of her children died that night"" and Ciaran also says he has changed. The teenager said: ""Before that I was very bubbly and happy, I was always singing and acting and now I feel depressed, I just don't want to go out of the house."" He said he had struggled to get mental health support and felt ""forgotten"". ""I had counselling for six weeks. It helped a bit, but not much and then after that I got left. ""I've just been waiting for referral after referral with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. I've only just been seen now. "" Armed police stand guard near ambulances on the night of the bombing One of the hardest things for Ciaran has been bullying, which has resulted in him being taken out of school by his social worker. He will be attending a non-mainstream school over the next few months. Ms Turner said children have made ""flippant"" and ""disgusting"" comments, highlighting one incident in particular. ""An Asian child had started at the school and some pupils thought it would be funny to say 'she's here to blow you up',"" she said. ""It's disgusting the society we live in where children are thinking like that."" Ciaran is set to start counselling this week and is hoping it will help him. He also wants to be able to go back to the arena as he hopes to follow in his idol's footsteps and become a singer. Ms Turner believes finding help has been harder because the family don't live in Manchester. ""There are a lot of people affected all over the UK, probably outside of the UK. It shouldn't just be centred around Manchester; you have to cater for everybody. ""I can't even see him smile. All I want to do is see him smile again."" Dr Alistair Rennie coordinated the response to the bombing at two hospitals Emergency medicine consultantAlistair Rennieco-ordinated the response to the attack at Manchester Royal Infirmary and the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. After declaring a major incident, he worked for 24 hours without sleep, managing surgeons, liaising with the police and ambulance service. Dr Rennie, who describes his role as ""managing the shop floor"", said he was left deeply saddened by the deaths of three of the victims at the two hospitals. He said: ""We all train for this, and you can imagine having a bad bus crash or a train crash to deal with. On this occasion, what was even more emotive was that this had been planned. ""That was an emotional issue to deal with. You are treating people who have been targeted."" Dozens of staff answered the call to come into the hospitals, with some getting to work despite fearing for the safety of friends or loved ones at the arena. Dr Rennie said they were faced with what were effectively ""warzone"" injuries and, across Greater Manchester, 23 operating theatres worked through the night. With thoughts now turning to Tuesday's anniversary, Dr Rennie said it had remained ""very difficult"" for some staff to come to terms with the bombing. ""We are all human. Some have been quite badly affected, particularly some of those who dealt with children,"" he said. Twenty-two people were killed in the blast on 22 May Returning home to his young children, Dr Rennie said he was left ""fully aware"" of the loss and grief families had suffered. ""It was one of those moments of thinking 'my God, what are other people going through?'"" The hospitals will observe a minute's silence on Tuesday. At the children's hospital, this will be broken by singing from the Manchester Survivors Choir - something Dr Rennie fears could ""tip me into a crying, bubbling wreck"". However, he said the pressures of work would mean there won't be much time to spend in reflection. ""Life is very short,"" he said. ""We've got to live the best life we can for everyone."" Mark Robinson was photographed as he was helped from the area Mark Robinsontravelled to the concert from Leeds with his partner Eli and her two daughters. He was standing with Eli in the foyer about seven metres (23ft) away from Abedi at the time of the blast, and suffered shrapnel wounds and a perforated eardrum. ""The actual explosion, your brain cannot process fast enough what's gone on. You think you're in a dream, you're certainly not trained for what you see,"" he said. ""How can I describe the last year? It's like being at the edge of a pond with ripples keep coming towards you. The flashbacks that you have. ""I feel guilt for taking Eli and her girls there. Why was it that concert?"" Although he has recovered from his physical injuries, he said he was still affected by what happened that night. ""It doesn't stop overnight because your wounds heal,"" he explained, mentioning the regular blood tests to check for HIV and hepatitis he continues to undergo. However, he credits going back to work as something that has helped him. Manchester's St Ann's Square became a focal point for tributes following the attack ""My colleagues, the company I work for, they were absolutely fantastic and it's so humbling,"" he said. ""Life is so precious and it can be taken away in an instant. ""Walking the dog, listening to birdsong, rain on your face. Simple things that you appreciate. ""I am so so grateful that I have got my legs and arms and I was able to go back to work and carry on."" Mr Robinson and his partner will be attending the service at Manchester Cathedral. He said he was glad Prince William and Theresa May would be in attendance as it ""shows it's not forgotten in higher circles"". ""It's important to go and hopefully see the people who helped you. And to remember those who didn't make it."" Janet Sherret says her most important job is to get her daughter's sparkle back Janet Sherrettravelled to the gig with her daughterKaela, then aged 12. Mrs Sherret, from Fife, has since joined an online support group for survivors of the bombing. ""Living in Scotland, we felt kind of left out of it because obviously there was the Manchester Resilience Hub support group,"" she said. The past year has been ""like a recovery from everything"", Mrs Sherret says, and the emotional impact will ""remain there forever"". ""It puts a different slant on anywhere you go where there's a big crowd because you're on high alert. ""This is why it's the loss of innocence for my daughter. She never used to think like that and was her carefree self."" Manchester was awash with tributes following the attack Mrs Sherret has been left with separation anxiety when her daughter is not with her. ""I thought I was having to protect her with my life,"" she said. ""It's not something you come across every day."" She, too, has experienced feelings of guilt. ""You have this guilt that you took your child to something that you thought would be safe, as well as a survivor's guilt."" The mother and daughter plan to mark the anniversary with a simple ""girlie day"". ""I'm going to keep her off school and we'll sit and watch films.

"Inspectors said the trust was ""inadequate"" in 2015 London Ambulance Service (LAS) has been taken out of special measures after two-and-a-half years, following a recommendation by the health watchdog. Inspectors at the Care Quality Commission (CQC)rated LAS ""inadequate"" in November 2015. But aCQC report published on Wednesday,externalsaid LAS was ""good"" overall and is ""outstanding"" for patient care. It said ""innovative changes"", such as treating some patients over the phone, helped boost the rating. The watchdog commended staff members' responses to the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as the London Bridge and Westminster terror attacks. London attack: The heroes who rushed to help Prof Ted Baker, chief inspector of hospitals in England, said: ""The improvements the leadership and staff of London Ambulance Service have made are especially commendable - and especially necessary - given the major incidents the Trust has responded to over the past year."" Dr Kathy McLean, fromNHS Improvement,external, confirmed it has taken LAS out of special measures after seeing the report. She said the Trust's ""strong leadership team"" had helped to produce ""a service that Londoners deserve"". This video can not be played Andy Beasley is part of the team that first responded to the London Bridge attack Garrett Emmerson, who became chief executive of LAS in May 2017, said he was ""delighted"" by the report but recognised there was still more work to be done.

"Mr Zuckerberg stayed beyond the allotted 75 minutes but did not answer all questions put to him Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has apologised to EU lawmakers for the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and for allowing fake news to proliferate on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg apologised for Facebook's tools being used ""for harm"". But his testimony did not please all MEPs at the meeting, some of whom felt he had dodged their questions. One leading UK politician later said the session at the European Parliament had been a ""missed opportunity"". ""Unfortunately the format of questioning allowed Mr Zuckerberg to cherry-pick his responses and not respond to each individual point,"" said Damian Collins, chair of the UK Parliament's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee. The format was very different from that of Mr Zuckerberg's testimony to US lawmakers in April. Mr Zuckerberg met European Parliament President Antonio Tajani before the Q&A session While the US politicians took turns to cross-examine the Facebook chief in a series of back-and-forth exchanges, the leaders of the European Parliament's various political groups each asked several questions apiece. The tech chief had to wait until they were all delivered before responding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Zuckerberg spent 22 minutes going through the huge number of questions put to him during the session and was able to pick and choose which to give answers to. Several of the politicians expressed frustration at this, and one accused Mr Zuckerberg of having ""asked for this format for a reason"". A spokesman for Facebook later contacted the BBC to say it had not chosen the structure. This was subsequently confirmed by the parliament's president, Antonio Tajani. In a follow-up press conference, Mr Tajani added that the MEPs had been aware Mr Zuckerberg's time was limited yet had decided to use up much of the allotted period speaking themselves. He also drew attention to the fact that the chief executive had agreed to provide follow-up written answers. Mr Zuckerberg did not address questions about whether Facebook was a monopoly and how it plans to use data from its WhatsApp division. Nor did he directly answer questions about shadow profiles or whether non-Facebook users' data should be collected. Guy Verhofstadt had threatened not to attend when the event was set to be restricted from public view Several of the MEPs had also voiced scepticism about the business. Guy Verhofstadt MEP had asked Mr Zuckerberg if he wanted to be remembered as ""the genius who created a digital monster"", which the Facebook boss did not answer. British MEP and leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage expressed his view that Facebook was not a politically neutral platform, asking whether the social network ""wilfully discriminated"" against right-of-centre commentators. Mr Zuckerberg did respond to this point, saying Facebook had ""never made a decision about what content was allowed on the basis of political orientation"". Tackling other questions, he also said he expected to find other apps that had misused customer data and pointed out that an internal investigation into thousands of third-party developers to see if there similar cases to the Cambridge Analytica scandal would take ""many months"". So far, he said, Facebook had suspended more than 200 apps. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal U-turn over Facebook chief's EU meeting Who's policing Facebook? The European Parliament has been left wanting more. The format of the meeting meant that rather than tackle specific concerns - particularly about the tracking of non-Facebook users - Mr Zuckerberg was able to group the questions into broad areas. That meant he could give broad answers. Reading any blog from the company published in the past three months would give you much the same information as we heard today. This clearly angered several MEPs, who expressed frustration over what they saw as insufficient responses to their concerns. Then again, how detailed can you be when you have been given less than half an hour to answer huge, almost existential, questions? Facebook is under close examination, but maybe so too should be the way politicians question these incredibly powerful figures. If you're following along, here's a scorecard for Mr Zuckerberg's ""tough"" committee appearances: Congress achieved little, Europe even less. The meeting between Mr Zuckerberg and the European Parliament's political group leaders had originally been planned to be held in private. But that sparked a wave of criticism resulting it being livestreamed via the web. One popular topic among the MEPs was an imminent shake-up of data privacy rules. Nigel Farage challenged Facebook's claims to impartiality Facebook recently transferred 1.5 billion of its international users from the jurisdiction of its European headquarters, in Ireland, to that of its US headquarters, with some speculating this was to avoid costly legal action resulting from breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The sweeping changes to data laws will give consumers much more control over how their personal details are used. Several of the MEPs challenged Mr Zuckerberg over whether he was truly committed to obeying the regulation. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? He responded that he expected Facebook would be fully compliant with the law by the time it came into force on Friday. He added that the app had already presented European members with the revised settings required and ""a large percentage"" of the users had already reviewed them. UK MPs are keen to pose their own questions to Mr Zuckerberg about the Cambridge Analytica scandal but the Facebook founder has so far declined to make a trip to the UK. Who's policing Facebook?

"Ladybower reservoir in Derbyshire supplies water for drinking and hydro electricity England is facing water supply shortages by 2050 unless rapid action is taken to curb water use and wastage, the Environment Agency has warned. Its new report says enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people is lost through leakage every day. Population growth and the impact of climate change are expected to add to supply pressures. The agency wants people to have a personal water target and has urged them to use water more wisely at home. The study,the first major report on water resources in England,external, says that population growth and climate change are the biggest pressures on a system that is already struggling. In 2016, some 9,500 billion litres of freshwater were taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and underground sources, with 55% of this used by public water companies, and 27% going to the electricity supply industry. But in addition to the 3 billion litres a day that are wasted through leakage, there is a considerable price being paid in terms of the sustainability of these supplies. Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortages How an iceberg could ease Cape Town's water crisis The 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water According to the Environment Agency, extraction of groundwater - the water beneath the earth's surface - is not at a sustainable level for 28% of groundwater bodies and up to 18% of surface waters. A year earlier in 2016, unsustainable extraction meant that at least 6% and possibly up to 15% of river water bodies did not achieve ""a good ecological status or potential"". The majority of chalk streams also failed to meet that standard, with over extraction of water being responsible in a quarter of the streams that were tested. ""We need to change our attitudes to water use,"" said Emma Howard Boyd, the Environment Agency chair woman. ""It is the most fundamental thing needed to ensure a healthy environment, but we are taking too much of it and have to work together to manage this precious resource."" Addressing the questions of how to reduce the amount of water that is being used, Michael Roberts, from Water UK, said water companies were tackling the question head-on. ""It's actually everyone's issue,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""In the home we have to do our bit and as companies we have to do our bit - but the good news is that domestic consumption has been coming down for the last decade, and in terms of leakage, we are leaking a third less than we did 30 years ago, but there is a heck of a lot more to do."" On average, people use 140 litres every day in England. The Environment Agency says it will work with government and industry to establish a personal consumption target and come up with cost-effective measures to meet it. The government has already suggested that an individual's water use be reduced, in its25-year plan,,externalpublished earlier this year. The water industry says that three quarters of water used in the home goes towards washing ourselves, our clothes and how we flush the toilet. Greater awareness could help cut that amount significantly. ""We'd love to see a really ambitious target of per capita consumption per day,"" Nicci Russell from Waterwise, who campaign for water efficiency, told the BBC. ""It's around about 140 litres per day and we'd like to see it at 100 or less, we think that's perfectly do-able over the next 20-25 years."" But Environment Minister George Eustice has told BBC Radio 5 live that the proposed Environment Agency household water guidelines are ""not a cap"" and that ""nobody need worry that we're shutting off the taps"". ""It's more a target really to encourage individual households to think about their water, to encourage the use of, for instance, flushing systems on toilets that are more economical in the way they use water, and basically get the types of innovation that we need within households over a period of time, so that we are using water more carefully."" The big questions for the future, according to the Environment Agency, are the impacts of climate change and population growth. Rising temperatures will affect the timing and amount of rainfall that flows into rivers and replenishes groundwater supplies. Although average summer rainfall is not predicted to change, more rainfall is likely to occur in large downpours in the future, increasing the chances of droughts and floods happening at the same time. The report warns that reduced summer rain and increased evaporation might damage wetland areas. Increased areas of stagnant water during droughts coupled with increased temperatures could see the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus. Water leaks in England waste three billion litres per day The population of England is predicted to increase to 58.5 million by 2026 - the report says that much of this increase is likely to take place in areas where water supplies are already stressed. If no action is taken to reduce use and increase supply of water, ""most areas will not meet demand by the 2050s"" if both emissions and population growth are high. Even low population growth and modest climate change ""suggest significant water supply deficits by the 2050s, particularly in the South East"". The National Infrastructure Commission has already suggested that moving water from north to south should be considered as part of future development. ""Today's report reflects our own findings, that the country faces the real risk of drought and that we need to take urgent action now to address it - by reducing demand, as well as by increasing supply, said Sir John Armitt, who chairs the commission. ""Our recommendations include the need for a new National Water Network, to help move supplies from areas with water surpluses to those in greatest need. ""But there must be a concerted effort by industry to encourage consumers to use water more efficiently - and with a fifth of our mains water lost to leakages, they must also take steps to halve the amount lost this way by 2050."" Investment in nuclear power and renewable energy will likely lead to much lower rates of abstraction and consumption by 2050, the study says. However, if future energy scenarios involve carbon capture and storage (CCS), this would require much higher freshwater abstraction and consumption levels, as the technology needs extra water to function, and would also increase the amount of cooling water needed at conventional power plants to which CCS equipment is attached.

"A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage A mother who forced her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age has been convicted in the first successful prosecution in England. The woman duped the then 17-year-old into travelling to Pakistan to wed the man, who was 16 years her senior. Years before the ceremony, the girl was entered into a ""marriage contract"" with the man and became pregnant aged 13. A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found the mother guilty of two counts of forced marriage. Midlands Live: Murder arrest after fatal shooting; Lucky escape as lorry rolls on to car in bridge crash The court heard the girl had an abortion upon her return to the UK, with her GP reporting his concerns to social services. Prosecutors said her mother ""made all the right noises"" to suggest her daughter and the man were just ""two teenagers who had sneakily had sex"" after she was referred. As she approached her 18th birthday, the girl was tricked into travelling to Pakistan again under the pretence of a family holiday. Once there, the court was told, the girl, then aged 18, sobbed as her mother forced her to sign marriage papers in September 2016. Giving evidence during the trial, she recalled crying as her mother led her by the arm to meet her husband-to-be. ""I didn't want to get married to him,"" she said. When the daughter protested against the marriage, jurors heard, her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. Manchester attack: Remembering the victims Fireworks factory owner guilty of fire deaths Voter ID: Hundreds turned away from voting The girl ""has been let down badly by her mother, whose love and attention she craves,"" prosecutor Deborah Gould said. The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked shocked as she was convicted of forced marriage and of deceiving the victim to go to Pakistan in order to enter into a false marriage. She was also convicted of perjury, after she lied about the incident in the High Court. The mother was cleared of a fourth charge of perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced on Wednesday. It is the first time a forced marriage case of this kind has been successfully prosecuted in an English court. Prosecutions for forced marriage, which became an offence in 2014, are rare. In 2015, a man was jailed for offences including forced marriageat Merthyr Crown Court in Wales, and there is currently at least one live case on-going. Supt Sally Holmes from West Midlands Police said up to 300 calls a month about forced marriage and honour-based abuse are reported by Karma Nirvana, an organisation supporting victims of honour related abuse, ""but a lot of victims will not want to report these matters to police"". ""It's their parents of family members who might be responsible for that abuse and they [victims] should feel absolutely no guilt in coming forward,"" she said. Elaine Radway, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said forced marriage is a breach of human rights, and applauded the ""brave testimony"" of the victim.

"This video can not be played There was amusement as Prince Harry's speech was interrupted by a bee The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have attended a Buckingham Palace garden party for their first royal engagement as a married couple. The duchess wore a dress by Goat and a hat by Irish milliner Philip Treacy to the party, which was part of the Prince of Wales' 70th birthday celebrations. She and the Duchess of Cornwall started laughing when Prince Harry's speech was interrupted by a bee. Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36,were marriedat Windsor Castle on Saturday. The two duchesses and many guests broke into laughter when a bee distracted Prince Harry during his speech Prince Harry took to the podium to ask the crowd to show their thanks for Prince Charles' ""incredible work"" for nearly 50 years The garden party, which is being held six months ahead of Prince Charles' actual 70th birthday in November, celebrated the future king's charity work, patronages and military affiliations. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined by more than 6,000 people from charities he supports. And to markthe one year anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing,emergency service workers who were on the scene on the night of the attack also attended. As a member of the Royal Family, Meghan now has an official profile on the Royal Family website The couple's honeymoon did not take place immediately after the wedding In his speech, Prince Harry opened with a moment of remembrance for the Manchester attack victims before fondly paying tribute to his father's ""infectious"" energy and enthusiasm for his charity work. ""It has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a difference,"" he said. He added: ""Pa, while I know that you've asked that today not be about you, you must forgive me if I don't listen to you - much like when I was younger - and instead, I ask everyone here to say a huge thank you to you, for your incredible work over nearly 50 years."" During the speech, Meghan and the Duchess of Cornwall started giggling when a bee flew close to Prince Harry and he said: ""That bee really got me."" The prince praised his father's ""remarkable"" passion and dedication for the charities he supports The Duke and Duchess of Sussex mingled with guests following Prince Harry's speech The Duchess of Sussex's dusky pink dress is from British fashion brand Goat - also a favourite of her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. London-based milliner Philip Treacy - who made Meghan's saucer-shaped hat - is also popular among the royal family. Prince Harry wore a morning suit and a silk top hat. More than 110,000 people flocked to Windsor to watch the Duke and Duchess of Sussex marry Prince Charles will celebrate his actual 70th birthday in November Among the guests at the party were soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Irish Regiment of Canada, who flew over especially for the party. Second Lieutenant Reid Killen said: ""It felt like talking to my youngest son, the Duke reminds me very much of him. He's always joking around and Harry has the same sense of humour."" Meanwhile Jyoti Bahia, 25, a project manager who attended the party with four of his colleagues, said: ""There are no words to describe the feeling of meeting Harry and Meghan after their wedding."" Royal wedding in pictures Wedding guests sell gift bags online Royal profiles give up little-known nuggets On Monday,the newly-married royal couple released three official photographs- including of bridesmaids and close family - taken on their wedding day. The couple have not yet celebrated their honeymoon and details of the location and date have not been revealed. Meghan's mother Doria Ragland was the only member of her family to attend the wedding The Duke and Duchess,who left Windsor on Sunday,also thanked everyone who took part in the celebrations, watched by an average of 11 million viewers on BBC or ITV at any one time. More than 110,000 people also filled the streets of the town. Following a lunchtime reception, the celebrations continued with a black-tie dinner and a fireworks display at Frogmore House, near Windsor Castle.

"SpaceX rocket: Climbing above California before heading south towards Antarctica A joint US-German mission has gone into orbit to weigh the water on Earth. The Grace satellites,externalare replacing a pair of highly successful spacecraft that stopped working last year. Like their predecessors, the new duo will circle the globe and sense tiny variations in the pull of gravity that result from movements in mass. These could be a signal of the land swelling after prolonged rains, or of ice draining from the poles as they melt in a warming climate. The satellites were launched on Tuesday aboard a SpaceX rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force base in California. It will take a number of weeks to prepare and test the spacecraft before they can start gathering data. Space lasers to track Earth's ice Europe plans Sentinels expansion The satellites were assembled in Europe by Airbus The first Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace), which ran from 2002 to 2017, was widely regarded as transformative in the type of information it was able to gather, and maintaining the capability is now seen as a top priority for the American space agency (Nasa). The follow-on mission again draws heavily on expertise from Europe, in particular from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). Europe's biggest space company, Airbus, assembled the satellites at its factory in Friedrichshafen. The Grace duo will obtain their data by executing a carefully calibrated pursuit in orbit. As the lead spacecraft lurches and drags through the Earth's uneven gravity field, the second satellite will follow 220km behind, measuring changes in their separation to the nearest micron (a thousandth of a millimetre). ""That is about a tenth of the width of a human hair over the distance between Los Angeles and San Diego,"" Prof Frank Flechtner, the Grace-FO project manager at GFZ, told BBC News. What the Grace concept is brilliant at sensing is the big changes that occur in the hydrological cycle. Grace data can show whether agriculture is using groundwater in a sustainable way These could, for example, be major movements of water from the ocean to the land during precipitation events. ""There was a period in 2011 when sea-level rise slowed down and went in the other direction very briefly,"" explained Nasa project project scientist Dr Frank Webb. ""From the Grace data we could see there were heavy rain seasons in Australia and South America, and that equivalent of mass was going into storage on land. Eventually, it was released back to the oceans and sea-level rise continued."" The ice sheets are losing about 400 gigatonnes to the oceans every year One of the great contributions from the first Grace mission was to confirm the scale of change at the poles - to essentially weigh the ice sheets year on year. Satellites carrying altimeters can do this by measuring the change in shape of Antarctica and Greenland - but Grace provided completely independent insight through its gravity assessments. Antarctica was seen to be losing some 120 billion tonnes of ice a year; for Greenland, the figure was 280 billion tonnes. ""Mass loss from the ice sheets is an increasing contribution to total sea-level rise and, even though the poles are remote, this mass loss will have large impacts all around the world,"" said Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""With the launch of Grace-FO, we can now continue to detect changes in the ice mass, to determine the extent to which ice is being lost, and find out if there has been any acceleration,"" she told BBC News. The previous Grace pair used a microwave-ranging instrument to measure their separation. The new satellites carry the same technology, but have now a laser system incorporated as well. It should give a roughly 10 times improvement in precision. And although this is unlikely to deliver an equivalent jump in the resolution of the gravity field, scientists are still hopeful they can get significant gains in performance. The new pair will use both microwave and laser-ranging to measure their separation The total cost for Grace-FO is on the order of $520m (â¬440m; Â£390m). The mission should work for at least five years. As to what follows the follow-on, there is already talk about trying to widen involvement to include more EU member states. This could eventually see a future Grace-like gravity mission pulled into the European Commission's Sentinel Earth-observation programme. The same has already happened with the US-French Jason series, which has been measuring sea-surface height since 1992. Future Jasons will be known as the Sentinel-6 mission- a status that has helped secure long-term funding. ""I think it's important we get an operational mission,"" commented Prof Flechtner. ""The 'e' in Grace stands for 'experiment', but the data is now being used for services, such as flood monitoring. My strong opinion is that it could be a Sentinel."" To be clear, however, the EC does not have a gravity option amongthe possibilities it is currently scoping for Sentinel expansion.

"Smith says wearing a headscarf makes her feel empowered Jada Pinkett Smith has opened up about her struggle with hair loss in the latest episode of her Facebook chat show, Red Table Talk. ""I've been getting a lot of questions about why I've been wearing this turban,"" said the US actress, 46. ""Well, I've been having issues with hair loss. And it was terrifying when it first started."" Doctors have not identified a cause but Smith believes it may be stress-related. TheGirls Tripstar says she first suspected she had the hair loss disease after ""handfuls of hair"" came loose in the shower. ""I was just like 'Oh my god am I going bald?' It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking with fear,"" she explained. ""That's why I cut my hair and continue to cut it."" Her comments feature in the third episode of her Facebook mini-series, co-hosted by her mother Adrienne Canfield Norris, and teenage daughter Willow Smith. Other topics discussed have included coping with loss, motherhood and body image - with Willow previously disclosing sheself-harmed as a childfollowing the release of her debut single Whip My Hair in 2010. Jada's daughter Willow had a hit single in 2010 with Whip My Hair Smith admitted she finds her hair loss ""difficult to talk about"" as taking care of it used to be a ""beautiful ritual"". However, she said, the fate of her body lies in a ""higher power"" and that accepting it has helped her find perspective to deal with the emotional impact of alopecia. ""People are out here with cancer, with sick childrenâ¦ I watch the higher power take things every day,"" she said, adding her hair loss pales by comparison. ""When I looked at it from that perspective it did settle me."" As a result of the physical changes, Smith begun wearing scarves on her head, which she said act as an empowering fashion choice. ""When my hair is wrapped, I feel like a queen,"" she said. Read more: Why is there stigma around male baldness?

"The car was parked in ""a really nice, quiet street"" somewhere in Cheltenham An elderly couple who forgot where they parked their car are offering a reward for it to be found. Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner Hilda Farmer, 79, parked ""within a mile and a half"" of Cheltenham General Hospital on Friday, but cannot remember where. Family and friends have spent four days searching for the Ford Fiesta with no success. The couple, from Gloucester, have offered Â£100 to anyone who locates the car. Mr Elliott said it was on a street with ""really nice houses on one side and some kind of greenery on the other"". Ms Farmer dropped her partner off for a hospital appointment and drove off to find somewhere to park. ""I don't know Cheltenham very well at all. I was born in Gloucester,"" she said. The vehicle was left ""within a mile and half"" of Cheltenham General Hospital ""I'm frightened of Cheltenham. I [normally] always go on the bus."" Mr Elliott said his partner parked the silver Ford Fiesta - registration EJ12 VSP -  in ""a really nice, quiet street"" at about 14:30 BST on Friday.

""On the other side there was greenery - maybe a park or a field. ""Ours was the only car parked on that side of the road, alongside the greenery."" It took Ms Farmer about 30 minutes to walk from the car, so it was probably ""within a mile and half"" of the hospital, Mr Elliott said. Police had told him they were ""fairly confident"" the vehicle will still be where it was left, he added.
