"Vettel had the better of Hamilton in final practice but the Mercedes driver made it count in qualifying Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won a tight fight with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to take pole position for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton beat Vettel by 0.186 seconds for his second pole in two races, while the German edged the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas by 0.001secs. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen made it the same top four on the grid as at the season-opening race in Australia. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth but 1.355secs off the pace. The Australian's team-mate Max Verstappen was 19th after an engine problem. Sunday's race is live on the BBC Sport website and radio 5 live at 07:00 BST Make your Chinese Grand Prix race predictions here China has underlined the impression created at the Australian Grand Prix that Mercedes and Ferrari are incredibly closely matched at the start of a season where huge regulation change has produced faster and more demanding cars. And as in Melbourne, it was Briton Hamilton who made the difference, pulling out the stops when it mattered in the final qualifying session as it appeared Ferrari might have the edge. Now that's entertainment: Mercedes and Ferrari were trading times all through qualifying Vettel was fastest in final practice and in the first part of qualifying, and Raikkonen of Finland topped the second session. But 32-year-old Hamilton produced the first lap under one minute 32 seconds all weekend at the start of the top 10 shootout, beating Vettel by 0.184secs despite a slide at Turn 11. Hamilton and Vettel both lowered their times by a little over 0.2secs on their final runs and the Mercedes man kept the advantage. It was Hamilton's sixth pole in a row - dating back to last year's US Grand Prix - and his sixth in China, where his record of four wins is better than any other driver. However, he will surely know he has his work cut out to beat Ferrari in the race after Vettel's impressive victory in Australia two weeks ago. That's an amazing six pole positions at the Chinese Grand Prix now for Hamilton, here taking his first in 2007. Source: Forix The race could well be wet, with overnight rain predicted and cooler temperatures than qualifying, which was dry and bright. Governing body the FIA has taken steps to ensure the cars can run after farcical scenes on Friday, whenpractice was badly disruptedbecause the medical helicopter could not operate. A wet race would be a complete unknown for the drivers - not only did they get hardly any running on Friday but they have not driven these new cars in the wet before this weekend, and Pirelli has designed new wet tyres for this season after complaints the previous ones were not effective enough. Latest BBC forecast for Shanghai The smog and rain that disrupted practice was absent for qualifying but wet weather is predicted for race day The first session of qualifying ended with a heavy crash for Sauber driver Antonio Giovinazzi. The Italian lost control coming out of the last corner in the closing minutes of the session, dashing the hopes of Force India's Esteban Ocon, Haas' Romain Grosjean and Renault's Jolyon Palmer of improving and getting into the second session. Giovinazzi, ironically, qualified 15th - fast enough to get into Q2, but was unable to take part because of the damage to his car. He was on a lap that was on target to beat team-mate Marcus Ericsson, but even so ended up less than 0.1secs behind the Swede. After qualifying Englishman Palmer and Grosjean of Switzerland were each handed five-place grid penalties by race stewards for not slowing sufficiently under the waved yellows for the crash. Palmer's team-mate Nico Hulkenberg was an impressive seventh, and just 0.5secs behind the Red Bull, which uses the same engine, underlining the progress Renault have made over the winter. The German was just pipped for sixth by Williams' Brazilian driver Felipe Massa. Sauber's Antonio Giovinazzi bins it at the end of lap Swift exit: The Italian - sitting in for regular driver Pascal Wehrlein - was able to walk away uninjured ""The Ferrari looked so fast and we knew it was going to be close, and we knew we had to pull out all the stops and I managed to do a very, very perfect lap,"" Hamilton said. ""It started off not as good as the first lap, maybe because of tyre temperature, but it got better and better. It felt strong. ""Coming into the last corner knowing I was up a couple of tenths is always nervous because you want to gain some - but you don't want to lose everything you've gained. ""It's exciting for me because we're really fighting with the guys and that is what racing is all about. It pushes you to raise the bar every time you go out, which I love."" Vettel said: ""It was a nice session. I enjoyed it a lot. I was very happy with the lap I had. Last corner I lost a little bit, maybe chickened on to the brakes a bit too soon - but we just had enough margin to make it on to the front row.""

"This video can not be played Rose lights up back nine to share lead Masters third-round leaderboard -6Rose (Eng), Garcia (Spa);-5Fowler (US);-4Spieth (US), Moore (US), Hoffman (US);-3Scott (Aus);-2Schwartzel (SA);-1Westwood (Eng), Pieters (Bel) Selected others: LevelCasey (Eng), McIlroy (NI), Rahm (Spa);+1Couples (US);+2Mickelson (US);+3Day (Aus);+6Fitzpatrick (Eng);+8Fisher (Eng);+9Sullivan (Eng) England's Justin Rose jumped into a share of the lead with Spain's Sergio Garcia as the battle for the Masters intensified on day three at Augusta. Rose, 36, sunk five birdies in the last seven holes in his five-under-par 67 to join Garcia, who hit 70, on six under. Rickie Fowler finished a shot back, while Jordan Spieth carded a 68 to move level with fellow Americans Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore on four under. Lee Westwood (68) moved to one under while Rory McIlroy (71) is level par. Rose is one of four previous major winners in the top 10 going into Sunday's final round, which will be live and uninterrupted on BBC Two from 18:30 BST. Garcia, Fowler and England's Westwood are all hoping to finally land one of golf's four most prestigious tournaments. How the drama unfolded on day three of the Masters Final-round tee-times How to follow the Masters on the BBC Olympic champion Rose, 36, has not claimed a major since his maiden triumph at the 2013 US Open, but lifted himself into contention for a first Masters title with a stunning finish on Saturday. The Englishman, who has four previous top-10 finishes at the Augusta National, was level par for the round after 11, only to blitz the final seven holes. He rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt at the 17th, then a 10-footer at the last, to join Hoffman in the lead. Garcia, playing alongside the 40-year-old Californian, birdied the 15th to briefly make it a three-way tie at the top. But Hoffman, one of four to share the overnight lead after the second round, slipped behind Rose and Garcia after finding water on the par-three 16th and ending with a double bogey. ""The key for me was staying patient early in my round. For me the test was around six when I made bogey, I stayed with it and played well on the back nine. Everything clicked into gear,"" said Rose. ""Patience is the key on Sunday. This is a golf course where you have to pick your moments. That will be the game plan."" Two-time major winner Spieth is hoping to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters. And the 23-year-old Texan, who has finished second, first and tied second in his three Augusta appearances, put himself in the frame again with a nerveless third-round display. After an opening-round 75 which featured a quadruple-bogey nine on the 15th, Spieth was 10 shots adrift of leader Hoffman. No previous Masters winner has trailed by more than seven shots after 18 holes. Spieth, who recovered with a three-under 69 on Friday, started his third round with five pars, but three birdies in four holes before the turn catapulted him into contention. Further birdies at 13 and 15 moved him into outright second, only for a bogey on 16 - his first in 30 holes - to drop him back into a share for fourth. Jordan Spieth dropped four shots in one hole on Friday but has let slip just three shots in 39 holes since ""We wanted to shoot four under and thought if we did the lead would move to six or seven and I'd creep on it,"" said the 2015 champion, who is bidding to become the youngest two-time Masters winner. ""Moments present themselves on Sunday here - it is about being patient. ""I know better than anyone what can happen on a Sunday."" World number eight Fowler putted solidly on his way to a hard-fought one-under-par 71, while Moore responded to the grief of losing his grandmother earlier this week with six birdies in a three-under 69. Like Garcia, Worksop's Westwood has long been considered one of Europe's finest players, only to have an excellent career somewhat tarnished by the absence of a major title. And the 43-year-old, who was third after an opening-round 70, appeared to have scuppered his chances of ending that long wait following a five-over 77 on Friday. However, he is back with an outside chance after converting six birdies in a four-under-par 68. ""Obviously I would like to be deep in the red, but one under is pretty good,"" said Westwood, who finished tied second with Spieth last year. ""I've got half a chance if I can get a roll going on the front nine."" This video can not be played McIlroy needs 'round of my life' for title World number two McIlroy's hopes of becoming only the sixth man to win all four majors look slim. The Northern Irishman, 27, made a strong start with birdies on the second and third, only to be set back by three-putts on the fifth and seventh which cost him a bogey and double bogey. Further birdies on the eighth and 12th provided hope, but he could not add any more to close the gap on the leaders. ""I had some chances on the back nine that I could have converted,"" said the four-time major winner. ""I think I probably could have shot a 67 or 68, but I had just a few too many wasted opportunities. ""I'm going to need my best score around here, 65, to have a chance.""

"Vettel had the better of Hamilton in final practice but the Mercedes driver made it count in qualifying Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won a tight fight with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to take pole position for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton beat Vettel by 0.186 seconds for his second pole in two races, while the German edged the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas by 0.001secs. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen made it the same top four on the grid as at the season-opening race in Australia. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth but 1.355secs off the pace. The Australian's team-mate Max Verstappen was 19th after an engine problem. Sunday's race is live on the BBC Sport website and radio 5 live at 07:00 BST Make your Chinese Grand Prix race predictions here China has underlined the impression created at the Australian Grand Prix that Mercedes and Ferrari are incredibly closely matched at the start of a season where huge regulation change has produced faster and more demanding cars. And as in Melbourne, it was Briton Hamilton who made the difference, pulling out the stops when it mattered in the final qualifying session as it appeared Ferrari might have the edge. Now that's entertainment: Mercedes and Ferrari were trading times all through qualifying Vettel was fastest in final practice and in the first part of qualifying, and Raikkonen of Finland topped the second session. But 32-year-old Hamilton produced the first lap under one minute 32 seconds all weekend at the start of the top 10 shootout, beating Vettel by 0.184secs despite a slide at Turn 11. Hamilton and Vettel both lowered their times by a little over 0.2secs on their final runs and the Mercedes man kept the advantage. It was Hamilton's sixth pole in a row - dating back to last year's US Grand Prix - and his sixth in China, where his record of four wins is better than any other driver. However, he will surely know he has his work cut out to beat Ferrari in the race after Vettel's impressive victory in Australia two weeks ago. That's an amazing six pole positions at the Chinese Grand Prix now for Hamilton, here taking his first in 2007.

The Italian lost control coming out of the last corner in the closing minutes of the session, dashing the hopes of Force India's Esteban Ocon, Haas' Romain Grosjean and Renault's Jolyon Palmer of improving and getting into the second session. Giovinazzi, ironically, qualified 15th - fast enough to get into Q2, but was unable to take part because of the damage to his car. He was on a lap that was on target to beat team-mate Marcus Ericsson, but even so ended up less than 0.1secs behind the Swede. After qualifying Englishman Palmer and Grosjean of Switzerland were each handed five-place grid penalties by race stewards for not slowing sufficiently under the waved yellows for the crash. Palmer's team-mate Nico Hulkenberg was an impressive seventh, and just 0.5secs behind the Red Bull, which uses the same engine, underlining the progress Renault have made over the winter. The German was just pipped for sixth by Williams' Brazilian driver Felipe Massa. Sauber's Antonio Giovinazzi bins it at the end of lap Swift exit: The Italian - sitting in for regular driver Pascal Wehrlein - was able to walk away uninjured ""The Ferrari looked so fast and we knew it was going to be close, and we knew we had to pull out all the stops and I managed to do a very, very perfect lap,"" Hamilton said. ""It started off not as good as the first lap, maybe because of tyre temperature, but it got better and better. It felt strong. ""Coming into the last corner knowing I was up a couple of tenths is always nervous because you want to gain some - but you don't want to lose everything you've gained. ""It's exciting for me because we're really fighting with the guys and that is what racing is all about. It pushes you to raise the bar every time you go out, which I love."" Vettel said: ""It was a nice session. I enjoyed it a lot. I was very happy with the lap I had. Last corner I lost a little bit, maybe chickened on to the brakes a bit too soon - but we just had enough margin to make it on to the front row.""

"Police have warned owners of short-term holiday lets that their properties are increasingly being used for prostitution. Colin (not his real name) contacted the BBC when he discovered the flat he rents out on Airbnb had been turned into a pop-up brothel. Here he tells his story, while below Charlotte - a sex worker who rents short-term lets in a different part of the country - explains why she goes ""on tour"". Colin:I feel like I've been conned. I feel like I've been deceived and forced into doing something that I wouldn't ordinarily have done. I lived here for six years, then I moved away, so I'm letting it out. You could get four people in here, so [Â£85 per night] is pretty good compared to a hotel rate. They made a booking through the Airbnb website. They messaged and said that they wanted to pay cash, which I was a little bit suspicious of, and I refused that. It's not only against the rules, but also if anything goes wrong then it's a booking that's outside of the website and not covered by any of the guarantees. You might as well just get someone in off the street. So when they checked in I was a little bit suspicious, but I thought little else of it. They texted [on the day they were due to leave] and said, ""We've had a heavy night, can we leave a couple of hours later?"" And a name was on there. It was quite an unusual name, so I just thought: ""Well, let's have a look and Google this."" Colin contacted BBC Radio 4'siPMprogramme to talk about his experiences Listen to him and Charlotteon the BBC iPlayer When you put that name into Google plus the lead guest's name, there was a picture of the two together, and that's when I found a story about them acting as high-profile escorts. Looking at both their ads, some of the rates were about Â£1,300 a night. So if they were fully booked for the two nights that's Â£2,600 each - Â£5,200 in total. The feeling was a bit like when I had to rush home from work a couple of years ago because I thought I'd left a tea towel on the hob. It felt like the place was burning down. So I came into the flat. It smelled of wine and perfume. I found used condom wrappers under the bed, I found the bin was overflowing with tissues and condoms. And basically what I had to do was pick all that up with my hands. There were probably about seven or eight wine bottles as well - they'd got through a fair bit of Prosecco and a fair bit of Pinot Grigio. It might seem a strange thing to say, but one of the things that really surprises me is that if they want to carry on doing this, how easy would it have been for them to clear up their own tracks? Quite easy. And then they might even have ended up with a repeat booking. So it actually surprised me that they were that bad at cleaning up after themselves. I called the police and I told them everything. I gave them all the information possible, because what I was worried about was basically ensuring I hadn't broken the law as well by renting the place out to them. The police took down all the information. They took my contact details, I got a crime reference number. Then I heard nothing further. I did inquire again about it and follow it up. They basically said, ""Well, you may well not hear from us again but we have taken it down as intelligence."" As far as I know I won't hear anything back from the police at all. I feel a bit let down. It's not just that I feel bad for myself but I feel bad for other people as well who might be renting out in good faith then, unwittingly, potentially committing a crime. I want to sell [the flat] now, I just want rid of it, to be honest. I really, really liked living here. I love the place but unfortunately it's not worth it at all. Airbnb commented: ""We have zero tolerance for this type of behaviour and are urgently investigating this case. Over 160 million people have travelled on Airbnb and bad experiences are extremely rare."" Charlotte:Going on tour, I either rent holiday apartments or I use hotels. I do two or three days here and there. I always come back to Devon once a month. I've built up a nice client base in Kent and I'm just starting to branch out in West London. There's all sorts of apps that you can use. They're really easy to access. At the end of the day, if you're renting an apartment or short term-let - holiday apartments, anything like that - providing you're leaving that property in the condition you found it in, I don't see what the problem is. Charlotte tours the south of England to sell sex When I was living in Exeter I had my own apartment to work from. I was able to have my own routine, to vet clients. I had a screen on the buzzing system so I could see who I was buzzing in. I was able to ensure my own safety. But when I dida documentary with Rupert Everett in 2014,externalmy next-door neighbour saw it, made a complaint against me and I was evicted from my family home. The start-up costs of being able to get your own property to work from are massive. You've got your month's rent and then a month's rent in advance, the security deposit - sometimes it's not financially viable. It is legal to sell and buy sex in all of the UK except for Northern Ireland, where it is illegal to pay for sex However, many activities related to sex work are criminalised, including soliciting sex and keeping a brothel If more than one person is available in a premises for paid sex, then that is a brothel - however, if a sex worker works alone, they are not keeping a brothel So short-term lets and hotels are probably the only other answer but the downfall with that is that you've not got that safety element of being able to understand the local area. You don't know who any of the dangerous clientele could be because you've not already got that experience there. I would never go on tour on my own to a new place that I've never been to before. No way. Because there is no safety agency or union out there that I can tell where I am or what I'm doing. So if I was going to try a new area then of course I will want another worker there with me. But the unfortunate thing is, that is breaking the law - two sex workers working together. And until we decriminalise sex work, sex workers will never be safe by not being able to work in pairs.

"A visualisation of the satellites and other debris around earth Millions of pieces of human-made trash are now orbiting the Earth. Some are tiny, others are large enough to be seen with a telescope, but all pose a risk to space craft and satellites. And according to experts the threat is growing as space becomes more and more crowded. Some 23,000 pieces of space junk are large enough to be tracked by the US Space Surveillance Network. But most objects are under 10cm (4in) in diameter and can't be monitored. Even something the size of a paper clip can cause catastrophic damage. This video can not be played Watch space debris grow from 1950s to now ""At the moment we're not tracking stuff that small,"" says Brian Weeden of the Secure World Foundation, a Washington based organisation dedicated to the sustainable use of space. ""And that's important because something as small as a centimetre can cause problems if it runs into a satellite."" Collisions are rare, but half of all near-misses today are caused by debris from just two incidents. In 2007, China destroyed one of its own satellites with a ballistic missile. In 2009 an American commercial communications satellite collided with a defunct Russian weather satellite. As recently as 2015, the debris from that collision forced the crew of the International Space Station to evacuate to the Soyuz capsule. No-one was harmed, but the debris will likely remain in the Earth's orbit for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Scientists are experimenting with ways to clean up space. So far, there is no space vacuum cleaner. And debris have a nasty habit of creating more debris that get exponentially smaller and harder to spot. More than 7,000 satellites have been put into space but only 1,500 are currently functioning. And within the next decade the number could increase to 18,000 with the planned launch of mega-constellations - large groups of satellites aimed at improving global internet coverage. ""That's going to amplify the problems we have with tracking objects, predicting close approaches and preventing collisions,"" says Weeden. ""The problem is going to become much, much harder in the next several years."" Everything travels at the same speed relative to its altitude in space. That's not a problem if everything moves in the same direction, says Weeden, but objects often follow different orbits and can cross paths - a situation known as a conjunction. ""Think of it like all the cars on a highway are doing a hundred miles an hour. If the car next to you is doing that speed you don't really notice it. But if the car coming at you is doing that speed - you'll collide at 200 miles an hour."" An impact crater in a window of the International Space Station from debris Lauri Newman is NASA's traffic cop at Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland. She is responsible for using military data to decide whether the space agency's unmanned craft such as satellites need to be moved to prevent a collision with debris. ""Satellites can protect themselves from things that are smaller than a centimetre by putting up extra shielding,"" she says. ""But the things between one and 10cm - if you can't track it there's nothing you can do."" Satellite technology is essential to almost every modern convenience - from communications to GPS navigation and downloading movies on demand. It's also vital to national security. ""It affects everything,"" says Lt Col Jeremy Raley a program manager at Darpa, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. ""So I need to be able to see everything (in space) all the time and know what it is when I see it."" That's why Darpa is leading military efforts to find better ways of tracking space debris. In October last year it delivered a massive 90-ton telescope to the US Air Force at White Sands, New Mexico. The Space Surveillance Telescope is designed to penetrate Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) which is becoming increasingly important. Communications and television satellites in GEO can remain in a fixed position above the Earth, offering uninterrupted service. ""The telescope is a big deal because it can see more objects and smaller objects. And rather than having to take time to look at an object and then look at something else, it can keep track of things on a more persistent basis,"" says Lt Col Raley. The Space Surveillance Telescope But that level of scrutiny costs money and also raises the question of whether the US should share its data to improve space safety overall. That was one of the issues discussed at a recent symposium in Washington organised by the Universities Space Research Association and the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. Experts discussed who should manage space, who should be responsible for debris and whether there should be an agreed set of international guidelines for the sustainable use of space. ""There's a classic public policy, economic question here,"" says Weeden. ""It's like pollution. It might not be worth it for you to pick up your garbage and avoid polluting the river, but there are costs to society if you don't. How do you get people to be responsible when the costs may not be borne by them?"" No single nation or entity is responsible for space although in 1959 the UN set up a Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). ""There are currently 85 countries that are members of this committee and they range from space powers such as the US, Russia and China to countries like Costa Rica that don't even have a satellite in orbit but are an end user of satellite functions,"" says Weeden. ""Getting all of those countries to agree on this stuff is a really difficult challenge."" But with more nations and commercial organisations operating in Earth's orbit and many looking beyond, such issues are becoming increasingly urgent. Do nothing is no longer an option.

"Cows are considered sacred by the country's majority Hindu population An Indian Muslim died of his injuries after a group of men transporting cattle were attacked by members of a suspected cow protection vigilante group. BBC Hindi's Nitin Srivastava travelled to the victim's village in the northern Indian state of Haryana. Villagers jostle to get a glimpse of the injured young boy who has just returned from the hospital. Azmat, who only uses one name, is lying on a cot inside a small courtyard. He has a fractured rib, multiple clots in the left eye and several lacerations on his arms and stomach. But by all accounts, he is lucky to be alive. Azmat, along with four others, was attacked by suspected cow protection vigilantes as they were transporting cattle they had purchased from Jaipur in the northern state of Rajasthan back to their dairy farm in neighbouring Haryana. ""Despite having legal documents we were pulled out on the streets, beaten by sticks and the crowd was shouting for us to be burned alive. If the police had not come and rescued us, all of us would have been dead,"" he told BBC Hindi. Azmat has multiple clots in the left eye and several lacerations on his arms and stomach The cow is considered sacred by India's Hindu majority, and killing cows is illegal in many states. Last month, the state of Gujarat passed a law making the slaughter of cows punishable with life imprisonment. In 2015 a Muslim man was beaten to death in Uttar Pradesh afterreports that he had beefin his fridge. Since then, there have been regular reports of cow protection vigilante groups attacking people transporting cattle across the country. India probes 'cow vigilante killing' Why the humble cow is India's most polarising animal A night patrol with India's cow protection vigilantes In this case, the men say that the cows they had bought were not for slaughter, and were for dairy purposes instead. All five men were rushed to a nearby hospital, but one man, Pehlu Khan, did not survive. He succumbed to his injuries three days later in hospital. At his home, we met his family who had just returned from his funeral. ""As buffalos on sale in Jaipur were beyond our budget my father advised us to buy five cows and four calves. Ramadan is near and he thought this would enhance milk production as it is our only source of income. Who knew he had made the biggest mistake of his life,"" a sobbing Irshad Khan, Pehlu Khan's 20-year old son, said. He was also helping transport the animals when the attack took place. ""Who will return our father to us? I couldn't meet him after the attack and could only see his dead body. My mother and grandmother haven't eaten for the last four days. Who will compensate for their loss?"" he asked angrily. Many states have banned the slaughter of cows and bulls So-called cow vigilante groups routinely check vehicles to stop cow smuggling Police have arrested three men on the basis of a mobile phone recording of the incident that has gone viral on Indian social media. ""No one will be spared and we are in process of identifying the attackers,"" Ramesh Chand, a senior police official, told BBC Hindi. However, they have also registered a case against the survivors of the attack for ""illegally transporting cows"". ""We had all the documents and there was nothing to hide. Police can verify the sale from the government facility,"" said Irshad Khan. Vigilante groups who portray themselves as protectors of cows have been active in several states. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year criticised the vigilantes, saying such people made him ""angry"". But this has not stopped attacks against cattle traders. Meanwhile almost 80 miles (128km) from the village, where the men were attacked, not many were willing to speak about what happened. Some said they were ""unaware"" of the incident, while others said they wanted ""the police to investigate"". But amid considerable tension in the area after the deadly attack, some fear more incidents cannot be ruled out.

"The TV show stars Chinese heart-throb Lu Yi (second from left) A dashing detective bursts into a secret villa and uncovers huge stacks of cash stuffed in fridges, closets and beds. Meanwhile, the villa's owner - a government official - crawls on the floor and begs for his life. This is the dramatic opening scene in China's latest hit TV show, In the Name of the People, which made its high-profile debut last month. The series, about China's anti-corruption campaign, has gripped millions of viewers across the country. Some have compared it to the American political drama House of Cards, which has a huge Chinese following. In The Name of the People chronicles the internal power struggle of the Chinese Communist Party in the fictional city of Jingzhou, featuring stories about Chinese politics that are often talked about but never seen on mainstream television. In the show, local government leaders try to sabotage a top justice's arrest order; laid-off workers hold violent protests against a corrupt deal between the government and a corporation; and fake police drive bulldozers into forced eviction sites. Viewers have been lapping it up. ""This TV drama feels so real. It really cheers people up,"" one viewer wrote on social media network Weibo. ""I shed tears after watching this drama. This is the tumour of corruption that has been harming the people,"" said another Weibo commenter. The show, which features a sprawling cast, chronicles the power struggle in a fictional Chinese city government What makes In The Name of the People remarkable is not just how frankly it depicts the ugly side of Chinese politics, but that it also has the blessing of the country's powerful top prosecutors' office. More than a decade ago, anti-corruption dramas suddenly disappeared from Chinese primetime television. Authorities in 2004 had decided to restrict the production of such dramas as too many were of poor quality. But when Chinese President Xi Jinping took power in 2012 and launched a sweeping campaign against graft, anti-corruption got back in vogue. Chinese state media has extensively covered crackdowns on corrupt officials, and TV networks haverolled out documentariesshowing officials confessing on camera and sobbing with remorse - even China's anti-corruption agencydid a showabout corruption within its ranks. In The Name of The People is thus the latest piece of propaganda aimed at portraying the government's victory in its anti-corruption campaign. At least it does a decent job in entertaining viewers, building suspense and intrigue. In one episode an investigator gets hit by a truck just as he is about to brief Beijing on key evidence, while in another the deputy mayor flees the country with the help of a mysterious government mole. Hou Liangping The tall and handsome chief investigator and hero of the show. He is played by Chinese heartthrob Lu Yi, whom netizens have criticised for his awkward acting, particularly in scenes with his screen wife. ""Are they a model couple or a fake couple?"" complained one Weibo commenter. Qi Tongwei The crafty and calculating public security chief and villain of the show, played by veteran actor Xu Yajun. He appears decent but turns out to be a sycophant, always thinking about his next move to advance his political career. Li Dakang The blunt party chief obsessed with GDP growth and rising political star who likes to chastise his subordinates. Actor Wu Gang rose to fame with this role - viewers now regularly make online memes featuring his character. The show's screenwriter, Zhou Meisen, is a seasoned writer of anti-corruption fiction and no stranger to censorship by the Chinese government. He declined to speak to the BBC, saying he ""received instruction not to speak to any foreign media"". But in interviews with Chinese media, he expressed surprise that officials approved all 55 episodes of his show - the review team reportedly even called the series ""earth-shattering"". ""For a long time, many people thought that if we kept our eyes closed, there wouldn't be any corruption,"" Mr Zhou said. ""Many government officials in charge of culture have become security hawks blocking the public from seeing artistic works on anti-corruption."" He said he aimed to show that corrupt officials were not all ""monsters"" and were real people - but at the end of the day, the good people always win. He made sure that Hou Liangping - the hero of In The Name Of the People - did not come from a privileged background with a lot of political connections, so that the character would be more ""idealised"". ""We all badly need heroes, upright law-enforcing heroes like Hou Liangping.""

"Watson said winning the prize was ""very meaningful"" Emma Watson has won the MTV Movie and TV award for best big-screen actor - the first gender-neutral prize the ceremony has given out. In her acceptance speech, the actress saidwinning the prizefor her role in Beauty and the Beast was ""very meaningful"". ""To me, it indicates that acting is about the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, and that doesn't need to be separated into two different categories."" MTVannounced the changeto the categories earlier this year after Billions star Asia Kate Dillon raised the issue with the Emmys. When organisers asked the female-born star how they wanted to be considered, it proved a struggle because the performer identifies as gender non-binary. What to go for - best actor or best actress? Asia Kate Dillon plays Taylor, a non-binary gender character in Billions The dilemma opened up a dialogue with Emmy organisers after Dillon wrote a letter to the Academy. The star asked: ""I'd like to know if in your eyes 'actor' and 'actress' denote anatomy or identity and why it is necessary to denote either in the first place?"" The Emmys explained that ""anyone can submit under either category for any reason. The Academy supports anyone's choice to do that, and the Academy is not going to do any sort of check"",Dillon told Variety,external. ""I found them to be 100% supportive,"" Dillon says of the Academy. ""I really couldn't have been happier."" The performer chose to enter the best supporting actor category in the end, explaining ""actor"" is generally regarded as a non-gendered word. But is it time to drop the gender tag altogether? While most of the big hitters including the Oscars and Baftas still have best actor and best actress categories, there are some organisations that are pushing the envelope. The National Television Awards (NTAs) first changed its best actor and actress categories to simply best drama performance and best serial drama performance back in 2008. Are gender specific categories becoming outdated? Viola Davis and Jon Hamm are previous Emmy acting recipients And bar two years when they reverted back to best male and best female in 2012 and 2013, it's been the same ever since. Usually the serial and drama vote has been split between a male and female winner, but this year Sarah Lancashire won best drama performance for her role in Happy Valley and Lacey Turner won best serial drama performance for EastEnders. ""It felt right for the National Television Awards to make the change,"" says Kim Turberville, executive producer and founder of the NTAs. ""A great performance is great regardless of gender and we think that dropping the male/female division has made the drama performance category more exciting. ""It may surprise viewers one year if all four short-listed nominees voted for by the public happen to be female or male, but if that is the case it will be because of their brilliant performances and will be an interesting outcome in itself."" It was a female double win for Lacey Turner and Sarah Lancashire in the gender neutral categories at the National Television Awards In the music world, while the Brit Awards offer the more traditional best male and best female prizes for both British and international artists, across the pond at the Grammys, no such thing exists. Although the Grammys feature a huge 80-plus list of categories, including everything from best Latin rock album to best new age record, there is no sign of any male or female awards. The big awards are considered to be album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. So it's not just an issue of gender identity - it's about having no distinction between female and male talent. Put simply, which performance is the best overall? But there could be other implications for awards organisers if they changed their rules. Having only one overall best actor category - if you agree with Dillon that the word actor is a non-gendered word - could give the winner more kudos in the acting community having beaten both male and female competition. On the other hand, with just one category, fewer performers may get short-listed and worthy nominees may miss out. For example, the Oscars currently have five nominees in each best actor and best actress categories. They may well increase the number of nominees if there was to be only one best performance award, but that's not a given. It could also potentially mean fewer actresses are nominated overall. If, in any given year, there are more male performances nominated but only one category for them to be recognised in, they could effectively take the places of what would've been female nominees. Colman and Laurie were both recognised at the Golden Globes for The Night Manager Perhaps one way to solve this would be to be more genre specific in each category - so rather than best actress or best actor, how about best drama performance or best comedy performance? Of course the Golden Globes already do this, although they still split the awards down gender lines. Olivia Colman and Hugh Laurie were both beneficiaries of this system earlier in the year, when they won best performances by an actor and an actress in a supporting role in a series, mini-series or TV movie in The Night Manager. And you could argue that having more gender split categories might boost the profiles of women film-makers, who historically struggle to gain recognition in areas such as directing, which is gender neutral. There have only ever been four female nominees for the best director Oscar and only one winner - Kathryn Bigelow for Hurt Locker in 2010. Foster's film Money Monster starred George Clooney and Julia Roberts Who might have made a best female director nominee at this year's Oscars? Perhaps Andrea Arnold (American Honey), Mira Nair (Queen of Katwe) or Jodie Foster (Money Monster)? Dillon's hope is that the Emmys conversation opens the debate further, saying: ""I can only speak to the world in which I wish to live. ""I think this is a really good place to start a larger conversation about the categories themselves, and what changes are possible and what may or may not be coming. ""I'm excited to see what other people think, and what they want to say once they become aware of this."" And who knows - could a change happen at the Baftas? We've asked them if they can see a rule change on the horizon, but they have yet to respond. A version of this story was originally published on 7 April 2017.

"Kathy Beaumont and her partner Chris decided fertility apps weren't for them When Kathy Beaumont started trying for a baby two years ago, she turned to the many fertility apps on the market to discover when would be the best time of the month to conceive. She took her temperature every day and logged it in an app called Fertility Friend, but soon found herself succumbing to a fertility-obsessed frenzy. ""I constantly analysed the analytics section of the app to see how my month looked and whether there was a temperature spike that indicated I was ovulating,"" says Kathy, 32, a freelance travel copywriter. ""I based when we actively tried for a baby solely on when the app and ovulation kits told me I was ovulating."" But after six months of ""trying"", Kathy still hadn't fallen pregnant. ""Some months I think we must have missed the window of opportunity entirely,"" she explains, ""either because I'd built up to it so much that the pressure made me too stressed to conceive, or because the app wasn't accurate."" She decided to quit using the apps ""for the sake of my sanity"" and became pregnant the following month. ""They definitely serve a purpose,"" she concedes, ""but they aren't the be-all and end-all."" But for some women, they are. Sara Flyckt says she tried the Natural Cycles app after the pill turned her into ""a nasty person"" Londoner Sara Flyckt, 35, started using an app called Natural Cycles four years ago after hearing about it in a Swedish podcast. It analyses the body's temperature to determine whether or not the user is fertile and needs to use contraception. ""I was on the pill before and the hormones made me into quite a nasty person, so when I heard about this natural option it felt like a no-brainer to try it,"" says Swedish-born Ms Flyckt. And, after initially using it as a contraceptive, last year she used it to plan a pregnancy. ""It certainly helped me find my fertile days. It's very easy to use, and it's especially helpful as both my partner and I worked full time within hospitality and sometimes we wouldn't see each other for a few days. ""With this app you know when to try and make time to see each other."" Swedish start-up Natural Cycles' app recently won medical approval as a contraceptive. Natural Cycles founders Elina Berglund and Raoul Schweitzl Technology targeted at women - or femtech as it's been coined - covers everything from birth control and period tracker apps to sex toys and breast pumps. And the market has been booming in recent years. ""We're seeing really significant growth in funding to femtech start-ups,"" says Zoe Leavitt, tech analyst at CB Insights. ""The number of deals shot up from 20 in 2014, to 40 in 2015, and in 2016 deals and dollars set a record high, with $540.5m (Â£433m) across 52 deals. ""Overall, we've tracked $1.26bn in investment since 2009 across 173 deals."" But there are concerns that some women might become enslaved to such apps. Lea von Bidder is co-founder of Ava, a firm that has developed a wearable bracelet and app for tracking a woman's fertile window in real time. ""When it comes to fertility tracking, the current options require women to make it almost a part-time job to track their fertility,"" she says. Clue co-founder Ida Tin says her app has attracted more than five million users ""They have to pee on sticks multiple times per day, wake up early to take their temperature at exactly the same time each morning, or examine their cervical mucus every time they go to the bathroom. ""By creating a bracelet that is only worn at night and does away with all this work, we firmly believe we are helping women to be less stressed and neurotic about fertility tracking."" Many of the apps in this space aren't just targeted at those trying for a baby. Ida Tin, co-founder of Berlin-based start-up Clue, describes the firm's menstrual cycle tracker as being ""empowering for women"". She adds: ""For some, it's the first time they've really been able to get insight into their bodies. People use these apps because they want to understand their body better. ""The app is helpful whether you're trying for a baby or want to know when your next period is."" Many women seem to agree - Clue has about five million active users globally. The Natural Cycles fertility app has been shown to be as effective as some other contraceptives But the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) advises users to treat fertility apps with a degree of caution. ""There are probably many examples of new tech companies and technologies in the fertility space that bring the promise of benefits to patients and users, but they must be properly assessed before they are used in a healthcare setting,"" says Alexia Tonnel, director of evidence resources at Nice. ""Where possible, users should look for an independent review of the claimed benefits."" Some sexual health charities, organisations and experts have alsoexpressed concerns over the efficacy of such apps. But for millions of women worldwide, they have proved essential as a contraceptive, an aid to pregnancy, and as a way of understanding more about their monthly cycles. Clearblue's Fertility Monitor relies on daily urine samples Gemma Moore turned to ClearBlue when she was trying for her second child. ""I used the ClearBlue Fertility Monitor to measure my hormone levels and find out the four days I was most likely to conceive. ""By knowing what was going on with my hormones and realising I ovulate far later than the average woman, I was able to pinpoint when I was most likely to conceive."" In the second month she got pregnant and gave birth to her son, Oscar, last September. As for the future, it's expected that the femtech sector will continue to thrive. ""We are not only seeing successful innovation in women's health, but also in areas such as personal hygiene, baby care and breast pumps,"" says Lea von Bidder from Ava. ""This is critical as most of those companies are just catching up with the technological and innovative changes we are already used to in all other aspects of our lives.""

"Ken McGoogan thinks Scotland should become Canada's 11th province As Scotland pushes for a second referendum on independence, one man is asking the previously unthinkable - if you're going to quit the UK, why not join Canada? Canadian writer Ken McGoogan says the unorthodox alliance makes sense. ""I think it would be terrific for both Scotland and Canada,"" he says. McGoogan first laid out his proposal in an opinion piece published inCanadian newspaper the Globe and Mail,external, where he argued that advancements in telecommunication technology and transatlantic travel have rendered pesky things like geographical boundaries ""irrelevant"". Besides, he points out, Scotland is closer to Newfoundland than Hawaii is to California. Last week, the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of asking the UK government to allow a legally-binding referendum on independence. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the vote should wait until after Brexit. It's not clear what Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon makes of the idea Mr McGoogan says he sympathises with the angst that many Scots are feeling over Britain's decision to leave the EU. ""The Scots aren't happy right now, and I don't think they're being treated especially well."" Mr McGoogan says that if Scotland were to join Canada, it would enjoy a lot more independence and hold a lot more power than it currently does with Great Britain. Scotland would be Canada's third largest province, with 5.3 million people, which would give it significant political sway. Add to that the millions of Canadians who, like Mr McGoogan, have Scottish ancestry, and you'd have a national-ethnic bloc about 10m strong, he reasons. More importantly, Canadian provinces are in charge of more aspects of governance than Scotland has been afforded as part of the UK. Canadian provinces are in charge of their own courts, health-care, systems and educational institutions. Some provinces also have their own immigration programmes, a fact that has already piqued the interest of a number of British and Scottish MPs. MPs call for immigration devolution Voting on independence, Quebec-style Brexit ""would never happen in Canada,"" Mr McGoogan argues, without the permission of all the provinces. But the arrangement wouldn't only benefit Scotland, he argues. By making Scotland Canada's 11th province, Canada would gain a foothold in Europe. Far from abandoning any future Scottish bid for the EU, Mr McGoogan argues that Scotland could apply to join with Canada. Mr McGoogan's ideas may shock some, and would certainly require years of back-and-forth negotiations with both Scotland and the UK, he readily admits. ""This is a flight of fancy,"" he said. ""In an ideal world, this might work really well."" As the author of How the Scots Invented Canada and Celtic Lightning, Mr McGoogan has made a career of understanding the historic ties that bind Scotland and Canada. Scotland had a ""major, major hand"" in creating the political culture in Canada, he says, as well as its educational and banking institutions. More than half of Canada's prime ministers have claimed Scottish heritage, as did many other prominent figures such as Simon Fraser and James McGill. ""The Scots have left their fingerprints all over this country,"" he says. Is Europe softening its stance on Scottish independence? Is Canada really the Promised Land?

" Monday 3rd April 2017 Friday 31 March saw the Ballet Final ofBBC Young Dancer 2017onBBC Four, and while we might not think of ballet as being a controversial dance form, it's caused its fair share of scandals - not least when Vaslav Nijinsky's choreography combined withIgor Stravinsky's score to cause anear-riotat the premiere of The Rite of Spring in Paris, 1913. The truth is that there's barely been a moment in history when a new dance hasn't appalled parents, dramatically widened the generation gap and shocked newspaper editors. Here are seven crazes that caused a genuine fuss, beginning with... Bear dancing to The Pussycat Dolls: Planet Earth II Trailer - BBC One 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info The Oxford English Dictionary defines twerk as a ""dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance."" As an example of how the word is used, it suggests: ""Just wait till they catch their daughters twerking to this song."" Well, quite! The word itself is thought to come from New Orleans bounce music culture (its use in songs has been traced back to 1993), and became a well-known dance in hop hop videos towards the end of the 2000s. AfterMiley Cyrustwerked withRobin Thickeat the 2013 MTV VMA Awards, it went viral, causing outrage and not just because of the sexual nature of the dance. She was accused, including bythe Guardian, of cultural appropriation. There was a near-frenzy of interest in what twerking was. As the Guardianalso reported, the search term ""what is twerking?"" shot to the top of one of Google's annual Zeitgeist lists in 2013, and researchers managed totrace the word's origins back to 1820. And thenPlanet Earth IIfilmmakers found out that bears have been twerking away - sort of - in the woods, possibly for centuries. Another consequence of twerkgate was that it caused much discussion about other dance scandals of yore, particularly the controversy surrounding the Charleston, a 1920s jazz age dance named after the city in South Carolina where it originated. In a BBC News article titled,What do twerking and the Charleston have in common?, choreographer Jreena Green says, ""Twerking [is] nothing new, it's from the Charleston,"" and likened the freewheeling moves of 'flappers' - female hipsters of the time, essentially - to those of twerkers today. And it wasn't just in the US that the Charleston became a sensation. It made it to our shores in 1925, and as historian Lucy Worsley says, ""It took the dance floor by storm. It allowed women to break free from a man's embrace and dance on their own."" [LISTEN] BBC Radio 3 - The Listening Service: Whatever Happened to the Watlz? It's fascinating that the Charleston could cause outrage byseparatingthe sexes on the dancefloor, because nearly every dance craze that caused contention before the jazz age did so by bringing young folk close enough together to terrify older members of society. In the above episode ofRadio 3'sThe Listening Service, presenter Tom Service explains how the waltz caused a scandal in the early 19th century because of ""the shameless physical closeness of the dancing couples"". And it had been preceded by even more racy renaissance-era dances likethe volta, which Service suggests would ""make any of today's waltzers blush since it required the swain - the bloke - to physically lift his lady into the air and then turn her about. The technique involved lifting her up with one of his hands on her busk... and turning her using the torsion of his thigh between her buttocks"". Do the volta today, in other words, and you'd likely be thrown out of every nightclub in the land. Dances that followed it, like the minuet, were tamer and easier, as indeed the waltz is - with one main difference. As dance historian Darren Royston explains: ""It was two people face-to-face. Earlier court dances, such as the minuet, were really done with dancers side-by-side... It was a 'turning' dance, and this is where the scandal of the waltz is made - not necessarily because you can face your partner, but because no one else can really see what's going on."" [WATCH] BBC Archive - Doing the twist in the 1960s You can't mention a turning dance without remembering the twist, the worldwide dance craze spawned fromChubby Checker's 1960 cover of theHank Ballard and The Midnighterssong The Twist. A year later a spin-off film, Twist Around the Clock, was released starring TV host Clay Cole, who sings the title track in the above clip of cool kids doing the dance. The twist is all in the hips, and that's what made it controversial. It was considered sexually provocative, vulgar and, asBBC iWonderreported in 2014, ""Medical concerns were raised. An orthopaedic surgeon reported a rise in knee injuries and the Society of New Jersey Chiropractors said it could cause 'strains in the lumbar and sacroiliac areas'."" Other famous 60s dances like jerk, the pony, the mashed potato and the funky chicken were all inspired by the twist. Like the Charleston, the twist is performed without a partner but in a group, and the same applies to moshing - a combination of punk pogo dancing, heavy metal headbanging and slamdancing. And, as all rock fans know, although moshing seems to be an incitement to chaos, mosh pits are usually organised affairs with sets of rules to ensure people don't get hurt. Moshing endures, but it became a fad in the early-80s punk scene in the US before spreading to other forms of rock and also into raves. And although moshing is regarded by many as harmless fun, on occasion it can be overtly violent and dangerous. To protect their fans, Washington DC punk bandFugazitook a stand against moshing at their gigs in the 1980s and a small number of people have died as a consequence of being crushed or fighting in mosh pits, including at twoSmashing Pumpkins' shows (in 1996 and 2007) and at aKorn performance in 2006. BBC News - Viewpoint: Mosh pits and lessons for life BBC Radio 4 - Rave: The Beat Goes On For those who didn't want to rock in the 1980s and 1990s, there was raving - not necessarily a specific dance style, although all ravers (andBob the Builderfans) will remember Big Fish, Little Fish, Cardboard Box, but a movement that caused a scandal largely because of its close association with illegal drugs and trespassing. The above documentary is about Spiral Tribe, the free-party sound system that was established in 1990 by a group of young people who thought they'd found an entire new way of living, powered by music, dancing, love, and, yes, drugs. No dance fad in the UK managed to get caught up in politics more than rave and, asthe Guardianreported in 2010, one rave in particular - the Castlemorton Common festival in 1992 - ""set in train the moral panic that led to the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act"". Dancing was forced back indoors again, discotheque-style; superclubs like Cream in Liverpool and Fabric in London emerged; and the rave sound, acid house, splintered into an incalculable number of new styles. [WATCH] BBC Archive - Lambada We'll finish with the lambada, a Brazilian dance that can be traced back to the 1930s when it caused almost as much outrage as the tango had 50 years earlier. The issue, asBBC iWonderreported, was how close it brought dancers together, ""with hips pressed together as they performed a series of spinning steps"". Allegedly, the Brazilian president of the time, Getulio Varga, was horrified by the dance's ""immorality"" and banned it, but the lambada got its revenge when it became a craze again in 1989 after French-Brazilian pop groupKaomahad a hit with a song named after it.
