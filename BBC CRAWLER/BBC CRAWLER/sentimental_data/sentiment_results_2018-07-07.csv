"The boys have been trapped for nearly two weeks On Friday morning, the army of volunteers at the mouth of the Tham Luang cave in Thailand had the worst news so far - a former Thai navy diver, Saman Gunan, had died. He had been delivering air tanks to the 12 young boys and their football coach trapped underground. The joy and elation that came after the group were found alive earlier this week has faded away. Now the mood at the rescue site is sombre, with diving volunteers saying they are saddened by Gunan's death. For the local community, and those who watched the boys grow up, the plight of the group has been deeply upsetting. ""You never imagine someone you know could get trapped in a cave,"" says shopkeeper Patcharee Khumngen. One of the boys used to buy snacks from Patcharee Khumngen One of the boys, known as most Thai children are by a nickname - his was Note - rode a bike to her shop to buy snacks when he was eight years old. ""He's a good boy, very friendly, and always liked to joke around,"" she told the BBC. Hope grows for daring rescue What are the rescue options? How will the boys cope underground? ""Now that he's in his teens he looks quite handsome,"" she added, with the fondness of an auntie. ""I've known his parents since he was a little boy."" The story has hit the community particularly hard because the cave is just 4km (2.5 miles) away from the local neighbourhood, Maesai, where some of the boys went to school. It's a spot popular with day trips and visited by local children. When the news first emerged two weeks ago that the local boys - all members of the same football team, the Wild Boars - and their coach were lost in the vast cave, the village rallied together, donating food and money. Patcharee prepared sticky rice and deep fried pork - two popular local dishes. In Thai culture, this is a common way of showing care for someone. Nearby, at Ban Pa Muat School, teacher Bunjob Chai-arm was also worried. Teacher Bunjob Chai-arm worries about the youngest of the boys He taught one of the boys, nicknamed Mark, back when he was in primary school. He was a ""cheerful, energetic and friendly"" student, and they had stayed in touch as he began secondary school, he told the BBC. Mark loves playing volleyball and, along with another one of the boys, is a member of a local team that came second in a tournament featuring teams from across northern Thailand. Bunjob said he was particularly worried about Mark, ""one of the youngest in the cave"". At school, once they learned that their classmate was missing, students asked Bunjob to turn on the TV so they could follow the news - as they are not allowed to use phones in class. ""For a whole week, some students were in class while others were following the news on TV,"" he says. Meanwhile, the school came together, donating money to help the parents of the missing boys with rent and living expenses, as many had stopped work to wait at the cave and follow news of their sons. The plight of the boys appears to have united the community. Koywilai Promwijit said she couldn't sleep after hearing the boys had been found alive ""Every house here has been talking about the news of the boys,"" says Koywilai Promwijit, who works in a local salon. ""The village has donated hundreds of packages of food."" She and her sister helped prepare fried pork, chicken, sticky rice and chilli paste, eating less during some of their own meals so they could help. Koywilai's face lights up when she recalls the moment she learned the boys were still alive late last Sunday. ""I was about to go to bed when I heard the news - and then I couldn't sleep."" Video shows Thai cave boys in good health The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search The site of the rescue operations in Tham Luang Forest Park, near the entrance of the cave, is buzzing with activity. The first thing you see as you get near is a steady stream of water. The efforts to save the boys have been described as a ""race against the water"" - and engineers have been working around the clock, pumping out millions of gallons of water from the cave. Pumping water out of the cave is a race against time Hundreds of volunteers and journalists have been drawn to the small rural district in Chiang Rai province. Given the huge numbers of people crowded into a small country park area, it is surprising how well organised and orderly the public areas are. The site is divided into several zones - restricted areas are where the Thai Navy Seals, other military personnel and civilian rescuers are based. The public areas include first-aid tents with medics and mental health first aiders, registration points for volunteers, a media zone, and several food stalls where workers from the Thai royal kitchen have been preparing food for volunteers. The relatives of the boys are also in the public areas - but their tents are guarded to ensure their privacy. There is a friendly mood among the volunteers - and a keen sense from everyone that they would like to help however they can. At one point, some volunteers offered massages to those at the site. Others distributed bottles of water and ice lollies to journalists. Volunteers are preparing food for everyone There is even a system to keep the toilets clean. Everyone is required to step into a basin of water, to wash the mud off their boots, before entering. Varee Srichai, a farmer in Chiang Mai, was one of the volunteers washing down the area. Varee Srichai wants to stay and help however she can She takes pride in her role in the rescue operations, and told me: ""I plan to stay here until the boys are rescued."" There are countless stories like hers. Sam Chareanphol, a village police assistant from Maesai district, headed to the cave on the second day after the boys went missing, and has been shuttling volunteers, journalists and rescuers up and down the hill on his motorcycle. Sam Chareanphol has been driving volunteers to and from the cave Saran Churat, a local public servant, said he decided to volunteer because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"". He added: ""As you can see, everyone is ready to gather here and give a hand."" Rafael (left) and his son help as divers and translator Rafael Aloush and his son Shlomi travelled up from Udon Thani province. Rafael, who is Israeli, has been cave diving before and went into Tham Luang cave 25 years ago, although he did not travel as deep as the boys. ""I've seen the mothers of the kids on TV and it just breaks my heart. I have to do something about it,"" he said. Saran Churat says he considers the trapped boys his brothers He is volunteering as a diver and translator, while Shlomi, who is studying business management in Bangkok, also hopes to help with translating. The early days of the rescue operations were particularly chaotic, as teams struggled to find the right equipment and divers with cave-diving experience. Local Max Yuttapong Kumsamut drove to the site overnight when he saw the difficulties rescuers were facing. Max was able to help with his mining experience He'd seen photos of the operation, and could tell that the water pump was too small for the rescue operations. ""I have experience in mining and underground water... so I wanted to help however I could,"" he told the BBC. ""At the time when the incident happened, no-one really had any idea what to do. ""Everything had happened so quickly [and] this had never happened in Thailand before. Officials did whatever they could, they brought together equipment, even though it's not the right equipment - small water pumps, long pipes, short pipes, agricultural piping, knives, shovels - with limited time and planning."" Because of his experience in installing pumps, Max helped examine the set-up inside the cave, radioing a team outside with what parts and fittings needed to be ordered. He has stayed on at the site to help with translation work and transporting goods. Further up the hill leading to the cave, there are Navy Seals and other rescue divers - and a regular stream of soldiers carrying supplies to and from the cave. A rescue base has been set up far inside. The boys are safe for now, perched on a tall ledge in the cave, surrounded by water. Video footage from earlier this week shows the boys looking thin and tired, but in good spirits. Many of them were wearing football shirts. But rescuers still need to find a way to bring them out. The route is a long and windy path with narrow openings that is fully submerged in water in places. It's an extremely difficult operation. The cave is dark, and the boys are several kilometres deep inside. They don't know how to swim - and some parts of the cave are too narrow to wear scuba tanks. It's a perilous journey, as diver Gunan's death illustrates only too well. He fell unconscious as he was making the difficult five-hour journeyback after taking air tanks into the cave. He was reportedly 38, and fit and well. He was an avid runner and cyclist - and was once a member of Thailand's national triathlon team. He was popular within the trail-running community in Thailand. PO Saman Gunan lost consciousness during the return part of the dive Thai Seal commander Rear Adm Arpakorn Yookongkaew has vowed that ""we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". Officials say their priority is now to get a pipe carrying oxygen into the boys' cave, as the air quality is deteriorating. Rescuers have also been trying to set up cables leading to the cave - including a communications line so they can speak to their parents, and a line providing more air. Efforts to get cables into the cave have so far failed But the cave is long, with too many twists and turns - and they have been unable to connect the cables to them so far. While rescue efforts have been helped by mostly dry weather for the past few days, water levels could rise again once the monsoon rains start. This video can not be played Families have been shown new footage of the 12 boys and their coach stuck in a cave in Thailand. Unless the water levels drop, or the boys learn to dive - a difficult task even for adults in these circumstances - they could be there for months. If and when the boys and their coach are safely rescued, they'll face an immense amount of media attention. The local area has also become famous - and Thai tourism officials have said they plan to promote the cave as a tourist attraction. For locals, the incident is primarily an important reminder about safety. After this, ""everyone will know you are not supposed to go in the cave during the rainy season"", says Koywilai. Meanwhile, Bunjob hopes that Mark will soon be able to share his experiences with the classmates waiting desperately for news. ""I wish they could come out soon,"" he says. 'I am dying to see him.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Sweden 0-2 England highlights England reached the World Cup semi-final for the first time since Italia 90 as Harry Maguire and Dele Alli struck either side of the interval to beat Sweden in Samara. Gareth Southgate's side will now face Croatia in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday after overcoming a stubborn Sweden challenge in this quarter-final, with help from a magnificent display by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. Maguire, outstanding once more, broke the deadlock on the half-hour when another England set-piece bore fruit - Leicester City's powerful defender flashing a header past Sweden keeper Robin Olsen from Ashley Young's corner. Everton keeper Pickford then snuffed out Sweden's hopes of recovery with a superb save from Marcus Berg, before England sealed their victory after 58 minutes when Alli headed in Jesse Lingard's cross at the far post. Pickford denied Viktor Claesson and then Berg one more time to secure his first World Cup clean sheet as England closed out this landmark win with something to spare. Southgate and his England players repeated the scenes from the dramatic penalty shootout win over Colombia as they celebrated in front of joyous supporters at the final whistle - one step closer to history and with expectation levels raised once more as they stand one game away from football's greatest occasion. The Three Lions are in the last four for only the third time. They went on to win their home tournament in 1966 but lost to West Germany on penalties in 1990. But the peculiar way this World Cup has shaped up means they will now play the team ranked 20th in the world for a place in the final - against either Belgium or France. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Jordan Pickford makes three excellent saves to keep England's dream alive Reaching last four an incredible feeling - Southgate 'It's quite emotional' - pundits react to England win How England's players rated v Sweden England not only reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since Italia 90, they did the job under the pressure of the occasion and the requirement to back up the victory over Colombia on penalties in the last 16 - with all of the mental toll that will have taken. It was not the perfect performance by any means. They started sluggishly and surely gave goalkeeper Pickford far too much work to do for Southgate's liking in the second half. On this day, with expectation rising and the unmistakable feeling around this sweeping Samara Stadium that the World Cup is really reaching the business end, England delivered. Southgate will, of course, want those flaws addressed - but when the World Cup reaches the knockout stage it is the result that counts and England have now won two knockout games after failing to taste victory in one for 12 years. They have fallen short on so many occasions that an England team who rises to the occasion are worthy of the highest praise. England, for all the talk, knew they had this history to contend with and it is to the credit of the calm and measured Southgate that he has not only led the team with such confidence and composure, but he has now guided one of the most inexperienced squads here in Russia to the last four. Southgate and England deserve huge credit - and now those expectation levels will rise even more. Reaction to England's quarter-final win Listen to Waddle's emotional reaction on 5 live Fans sneak their phones into weddings to watch England win This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Harry Maguire heads in the opener for England against Sweden Maguire and goalkeeper Pickford both had occasional moments of uncertainty early in this World Cup as they understandably took a little time to adjust to the unique pressures of this showpiece. Since the knockout phase began, Everton's 24-year-old keeper and Leicester's giant defender, 25, have been simply immense. Maguire may be built in the old-fashioned mould, but he is also a player with the sort of ambition and power Southgate loves in the three-man defensive system he settled on. And it was Maguire who gave England the control they needed in Samara when he met Young's corner and powered a header past Robin Olsen on the half-hour. That was the eighth set-piece England have scored from in Russia and summed up the centre-back's recent performances. As for Pickford, he just carried on from where he left off after that magnificent penalty save from Carlos Bacca in the shootout win over Colombia. England needed to beware any sort of Sweden revival at the start of the second half and it was Pickford who ensured they were not given a lifeline with a supreme one-handed saves from Berg's header and Claesson's shot. Pickford has been desperate to keep a clean sheet at this World Cup and he fully deserved to keep Sweden out with a faultless display of goalkeeping. This was the day Maguire and Pickford proved they have come of age with England. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Dele Alli header puts England 2-0 up against Sweden Alli has struggled for fitness and form in Russia but there has never been any doubt he possesses that touch of class and the goalscorer's instinct that can make the crucial difference. There was speculation Southgate might even make the conservative move of replacing Alli, who missed the games against Panama and Belgium after suffering a thigh injury against Tunisia, with his Tottenham team-mate Eric Dier - but the manager was full of praise for the player pre-match and kept faith. Southgate underlined Alli's selfless work without the ball and team ethic against Colombia and said it was now up to his England team-mates to deliver service that would allow him to do damage with trademark late runs into the penalty area. In reality, Alli still struggled to make an impact for long spells on Saturday, but the moment Southgate had been waiting for arrived just before the hour when he was on the end of Lingard's clever lofted cross to head past Olsen. England and Southgate will want this to be lift-off for a player who can offer so much. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: England players celebrate reaching the semi-finals Why not? England will now face Croatia in the semi-finals - and anything is possible at this stage of any competition. Southgate's side face a tough task in Moscow on Wednesday (19:00 BST kick-off), but there is genuine momentum behind England and every win will only increase the quiet confidence that has built up around this squad since they arrived at their base in Repino almost a month ago. The favourites will come from the other side of the draw, where Belgium meet France in the other semi-final - but this has been an unpredictable World Cup. Who says England cannot be the team to overturn the odds once more? England boss Gareth Southgate told BBC One:""We knew it was going to be such a different game from the other night, to come back having had extra-time and penalties, with the emotions of it to lift ourselves through a completely different test. ""It was always a scrappy game where we had to withstand a lot of physical pressure, but the resilience of the team and togetherness of the team was crucial. ""I can't speak highly enough of the whole squad and whole group of staff because it is so united in there. ""The level of work has been great and their commitment to each other, you don't get through with just 11 players. They are all top people and are the reason we are in the semi-final just as much as any other."" Sweden coach Janne Andersson:""I don't think anything went wrong. We faced a good opponent and we did not get to our best level. The margins were small. ""The first 30 minutes we were under control until the corner and they scored. We then created chances at the start of the second half and if we had scored it would have revived the game. ""England are absolutely good enough to win the World Cup. They are forceful and well organised. Congratulations to both the team and the coach. They are a good side, who did not give a lot of openings."" Jordan Pickford only needed to make three saves for his clean sheet - but they were all brilliant stops The eight goals England have scored from set-pieces is the most by a team at a World Cup since Portugal in 1966 (also eight). Sweden have lost three of their past four matches against England, a run which follows 12 consecutive games without defeat against them between 1979 and 2006. Six of England's last 11 goals against Sweden have been scored via headers, all from different players (Sol Campbell, Steven Gerrard, Gareth Barry, Andy Carroll, Maguire and Alli). England - who scored with both shots on target on Saturday - have found the net with 10 of their past 13 shots on target at this World Cup. England have now scored 11 goals in a World Cup for only the second time, also doing so in their victorious year of 1966. Alli is the second youngest player to score for England at the World Cup (22 years and 87 days), behind only Michael Owen (18 years and 190 days against Romania in 1998). Maguire became the first player to score their first England goal in a World Cup knockout match since Rio Ferdinand in 2002 against Denmark. Pickford made three saves in this match and became the youngest England goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup match (24 years and 122 days).

"The Thai military (pictured) and civilians have joined forces to try to save the boys Teams have a three to four-day window to save 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a cave where they have been trapped for two weeks, according to the leader of the rescue efforts. Narongsak Osottanakorn said conditions were currently ""perfect"". There is concern that monsoon rains could follow, further flooding the narrow passages. Media and all non-essential personnel were told to leave the site near the cave entrance early on Sunday. Police said the area was needed for a rescue operation, although they did not specify whether one was imminent. The boys were exploring the cave when they and their football coach became trapped by rising waters on 23 June. Rescue divers have since been able to take them food, oxygen and medical assistance, while a huge international team works on a plan to free them. ""Now and in the next three or four days, the conditions are perfect [for evacuation] in terms of the water, the weather and the boys' health,"" said Mr Narongsak, governor of the Chiang Rai province, where the caves are. ""We have to make a clear decision on what we can do."" This video can not be played Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers There was a short burst of heavy rain on Saturday night after he spoke, and it is unclear whether this will have affected the plans. Earlier in the day, the Thai Navy Seals released the letters the boys sent to their families, via rescue divers, reassuring them. In full: Thai boys' letters of love and reassurance 'You never imagine someone you know could get trapped' ""Don't worry, we are all strong,"" one child said in a note. ""Teacher, don't give us lots of homework!"" he joked. Another wrote: ""Nick loves Mum and Dad and siblings. If I can get out, Mum and Dad please bring me mookatha [Thai barbecue] to eat."" The football coach who took the boys into the cave apologised to parents, but several of them have saidthey do not blame him.,external A huge military and civilian operation is racing against the clock to bring the group out amid high risks. The danger of the situation became clear whena former Thai navy diver diedafter delivering air tanks to the group on Friday. How risky is the Thai boys rescue? 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' The boys are currently perched on a dry shelf, but rain could reduce that space to ""less than 10 sq m (108 sq ft)"", Mr Narongsak said. This video can not be played Dr Alex Rowe explains the impact of being trapped underground Officials say an oxygen line has been installed to counteract the increased carbon dioxide that comes from so many people breathing within such a small area. Bore holes have also been drilled into the rock to try to drain water out and give the boys more time. It has previously been said that they could be underground for months, either learning to dive or waiting for the water to recede or be pumped out. This video can not be played Heavy rain is not expected until late in the week in the area where the boys are trapped in a cave Earlier on Saturday, Mr Narongsak said the boys had not yet learned the diving skills to allow for their safe passage. Separately, billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has offered his assistance to the rescue operations, said he had received ""more great feedback"" from cave experts in Thailand on two possible rescue options his team have been working on. Musk said on Twitter than one potential solution involved an ""kid-sized submarine"", while another was an ""inflatable tube with airlocks"". It is not clear if either will be used in the rescue operations. The ideal scenario is for enough water to have been pumped out to allow the group to climb out. Mr Narongsak has not specified the course of action for these next few crucial days. The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search Elon Musk offers to help Thai cave rescue Aged between 11 and 16, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach.

"Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol say goodbye as the US envoy departs for Japan North Korea has accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks. It branded the US attitude at the meeting as ""extremely troubling"". The statement, by an unnamed foreign ministry official, gave a starkly different account from one provided by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just hours before. He had said progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang. It is the first time he has visited North Korea since a summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The leader's meeting ended with a promise from Mr Kim to work towards denuclearisation, but details on how this will be achieved remain thin. North Korea crisis in 300 words Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments A key aim of Mr Pompeo during his visit was to firm up North Korea's commitment to disarmament. But the North Korean statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency, said the US had gone against the spirit of the summit by putting unilateral pressure on the country to abandon its nuclear weapons. ""We had anticipated the US side would come with a constructive idea, thinking we would take something in return,"" the North Korean statement said, warning its ""resolve for denuclearisation... may falter"". ""The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that [North Korea] would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset,"" it added. At the talks, Mr Pompeo did not meet with Mr Kim, but instead with Kim Yong-chol, who is seen as his right-hand man. In his assessment Mr Pompeo gave little away, but he said they had discussed at length a timeline for disarmament, including the destruction of a missile engine testing facility. ""These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues, some places a great deal of progress, other places there's still more work to be done,"" he said. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures After the Singapore summit, which also saw the US offer ""security guarantees"" to North Korea and promise to end its military drills with South Korea, Mr Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while US intelligence officials have said there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programmes. A state department spokesperson said Mr Pompeo had been ""very firm"" in focusing on denuclearisation, as well as on security assurances and another important US demand - the return of remains of US service personnel from the Korean War. As Saturday's meeting got under way Kim Yong-chol joked that Mr Pompeo may not have slept well during his overnight stay at a guesthouse in Pyongyang. Mr Pompeo said he ""slept just fine"". On Sunday, the US secretary of state will meet the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea in Tokyo. Win-win or a Kim win? Video, 00:02:20Win-win or a Kim win?

"US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will be in the UK for two days Donald Trump's visit to the UK in the next week will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces, the Police Federation has warned. The US president will spend time in London, Windsor and Scotland during the two-day working visit. Thousands are expected to protest and police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist. The Home Office said other forces can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". Trump to visit Windsor and Chequers on UK trip Trump's Scotland visit confirmed Treasury to cover policing cost of Trump visit Forces assist one another outside their regions when dealing with major incidents and emergencies, under the so-called ""mutual aid"" agreement. Mr Trump's visit will see thousands of officers deployed from their home forces, said Simon Kempton, from the Police Federation of England and Wales. ""The fact cannot be ignored that while the officers on mutual aid are deployed elsewhere thousands more of their colleagues left behind in their home force will be expected to pick up the slack, leaving them even more stretched,"" he said. ""There was a time when we could do it all but now choices have to be made - we cannot do it all and this type of event puts a service which is already creaking at its knees under unquestionable pressure."" Protesters plan to fly a Trump baby balloon over Parliament Square in London during the visit Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, before spending the night at Winfield House in London. On Friday, the president will travel to Chequers in Buckinghamshire for bilateral talks with Theresa May. In the afternoon, he will meet the Queen in Windsor and then fly to Scotland, where the couple plan to spend the weekend. Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday and marches are also planned for Scotland, where Mr Trump owns golf courses. The Treasury has confirmed it willfund policing costsof up to Â£5m in Scotland. With officers sent in to help, local policing was being reduced to a ""reactive service"", Mr Kempton said, with additional strain due to the World Cup and the Novichok poisonings in Amesbury. ""You have to ask what would happen if we're unable to resource incidents like these,"" Mr Kempton added. ""Would we see the situation where the military were drafted in place of police officers? Green uniforms instead of the blue ones people would - and should - expect to see? It's a worrying prospect."" The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services.""

"The US still has thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan A US service member has been killed and two others injured in what appears to be an insider attack in Afghanistan, Nato says. The attack took place in southern Afghanistan on Saturday, a statement from the Nato-led Resolute Support mission said. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack, or whether they had been apprehended. However, the statement said it was ""an apparent insider attack"". Taliban 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Afghanistan's long march for peace The dead soldier has been named as Cpl Joseph Maciel. The two wounded service members are in a ""stable"" condition, Nato said. A police officer told news agency AFP the shooting happened at the airport in Tarinkot, the capital of Uruzgan province - although they were unable to confirm this detail with any Nato officials. The Taliban have also released a statement, saying an Afghan soldier opened fire on US soldiers in Uruzgan. The attack comes a year afterthree US special forces soldiers were shot deadby one of their Afghan colleagues. It was claimed by the Taliban. However, these kind of attacks - where local troops turn on international forces and often referred to as ""green on blue"" incidents - are not necessarily the work of militants infiltrating the security forces. Cultural misunderstandings and combat stress have also been named as the cause in previous attacks. The US still has an estimated 14,000 troops in the country helping support the Afghan military, despite Nato's combat mission in Afghanistan officially ended in 2014.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Sweden 0-2 England highlights World Cup semi-final: Croatia v England Venue: Luzhniki Stadium, MoscowDate: Wednesday, 11 July (19:00 BST) Coverage: Full match commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, text commentary, report and highlights on BBC Sport app and online England stand just one game away from their first World Cup final since 1966 after clearing another obstacle on the road to history by beating Sweden in the quarter-finals. Gareth Southgate's improving team handled the pressure of attempting to reach their first semi-final for 28 years and the growing hysteria at home toadvance in routine fashion in Samara. After the stress of the nerve-shredding win on penalties against Colombia, the victory over Sweden to set up a last-four meeting with Croatia almost qualified as a cruise. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, a key member of the last Three Lions team to reach the semi-finals at Italia 90, said: ""It is not really supposed to be as comfortable as this with England is it?"" Round-up of reaction to England victory If England and their fans, who stayed behind for an hour after the conclusion here and were rewarded with an appearance from Southgate and an autograph-signing session from captain Harry Kane, cannot dare to dream now, when can they? England have manoeuvred their way through Russia, killing off curses on their travels. The win against Tunisia was their first in an opening game at a major tournament since Paraguay were beaten at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. This video can not be played Harry Kane heads last-gasp England winner The last-16 victory against Colombia was not only their first knockout win since 2002 but also their first penalty shootout win at a World Cup. Grim statistics that had piled up around England like rubble have been slowly cleared away by Southgate and his players in what is turning into a landmark World Cup. The reality states that England still have the air of underdogs, and reality suggests the World Cup winners will come from the other side of the draw and the semi-final between Belgium and France - two teams containing a collection of world-class players. This World Cup, however, has not dealt in reality, as we saw when holders Germany fell at the group stage. England and their supporters have suffered enough agonies at major tournaments - indeed downright embarrassment in the last World Cup in Brazil four years ago and at Euro 2016 - to allow themselves to dream. The dream now moves to Moscow. Reaching last four 'an incredible feeling' - Southgate The unlikely lads inspiring England on their run to the World Cup last four World Cup Daily podcast: England's semi-final and a statue of 'Slabhead' Gareth Southgate has known the game's harder edge, so few will begrudge him the praise and adulation falling on his shoulders now. The 47-year-old carried the burden of missing a crucial penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final penalty shootout against Germany and also saw his first venture into management, when he was thrown into the task prematurely, end with the sack at Middlesbrough. Gareth Southgate was a player at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups but said on Saturday that he prefers the experience as manager this time around England and the Football Association are now the beneficiaries of all of those experiences, not just from his playing career but also the knowledge he picked up working under international managers such as Terry Venables. Southgate took on the job with England at their lowest ebb following Roy Hodgson's resignation after Euro 2016 and Sam Allardyce's ill-fated one-match reign. Two years later they can make history. He has brought maturity, measure and meticulous preparation to his task and has helped England's followers to feel genuine affection for him and his players. Southgate is also a product of the FA system, meaning he has worked with the likes of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Harry Kane in the Under-21 team. The manager has been rightly acknowledged as a decent, dignified frontman for England. He has even been self-effacing about the""Gareth Southgate Would"" Twitter craze, reflecting his basic decency and his sudden status as a fashion icon thanks to his trademark blue waistcoat. The real Gareth Southgate, by those who know him best Southgate, however, is much more than that. England's players respect him as a person and manager, a key starting point, but he has also added vital elements to the mix. He has brought attention to detail, from the notes on Pickford's drinks bottle at the shootout against Colombia to the relentless work on set-pieces that have been England's most potent weapon here in Russia. Southgate is also loyal and retains faith in his players. Dele Alli and Raheem Sterling have had their struggles in Russia but Southgate has stuck with them, giving strong public backing when needed. And his cool demeanour, with a steely edge underneath, has allowed England's players the freedom they required to shrug off the shackles that have weighed them down at previous tournaments. Southgate will return from this World Cup with his reputation greatly enhanced - and perhaps with even greater glory against his name. England's management and players have had a relaxed, quiet confidence ever since they landed in Russia almost a month ago. Southgate's men were accompanied by realistic expectations in which an exit at the quarter-final stage (most predictions suggested this would be against holders Germany or Brazil) would mean a return home with respectability. Those two superpowers must now watch from afar as England contest the World Cup semi-final. Slowly but surely, England have gathered belief and momentum, two priceless commodities, as they move around this vast country, to the point where they will go to Moscow on Wednesday with confidence bolstered by a professional performance that accounted for dogged Sweden. England's belief will also grow from the fact their talisman and captain Kane was on the margins against the Swedes. It could emerge as a key moment - when Kane was quiet, others stepped up. Harry Maguire, outstanding in England's last two games, was on the scoresheet, which he has threatened throughout the World Cup, while Alli's confidence will be lifted by his goal. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Harry Maguire heads in the opener for England against Sweden And there are even more ingredients that have given England a powerful mix. The defenders know they have an outstanding goalkeeper behind them in Pickford, who was magnificent in Samara. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has been an understated but outstanding contributor, as has John Stones. England also have the vital ingredients of team spirit and unity, plus a lack of ego, that help them dig deep when the going gets tough - a ""band of brothers"" mentality, as Kane called it. The heat will be on like never before in Moscow as they know they are one game from a World Cup final. England's growing belief, their increased maturity through the tournament, and the confidence they will gain from results like this will all be powerful tools in the hothouse atmosphere of Luzhniki Stadium. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: England fans celebrate across the country As growing hysteria grips their followers at home, England can retreat behind the wooden gates of their peaceful retreat on the Gulf of Finland in Repino. Nothing could be further removed from the fervour of home and the buzz of the World Cup than the mild, coastal climes and secluded base off a small tree-lined road 45 minutes from St Petersburg. It has proved to be the perfect location for England - and will be ideal as a shield from the frenzy that is beginning to whip up around Southgate and his players. England will get back to work at their neatly-appointed training base at Zelenogorsk, which could not be a greater contrast to the bustle of Moscow. There, they can work but also relax and get mind and body back in order for Wednesday. Southgate will ensure his players remain in the bubble that has served them so well as they prepare for the biggest game of their lives.

Most of the deaths have occurred in Hiroshima prefecture, which has been hit by torrential rain since Thursday. Hundreds of homes have been damaged. About 1.5 million people have been ordered to leave their homes and three million more advised to do so. Authorities say it could potentially be the worst weather disaster Japan has seen in decades. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the authorities were facing a ""race against time"" to save and evacuate people. Thousands of police, firefighters and soldiers are taking part in search-and-rescue operations. Some of the victims have been buried alive by landslides, Japan's Kyodo news agency reports.

"Demonstrators say not enough is being done to halt the practice Tens of thousands of women gathered in Seoul on Saturday calling for a crackdown on spy cam pornography, in one of the country's biggest ever female-only protests. Perpetrators film or photograph women with hidden cameras in public spaces. Although distributing pornography is illegal in South Korea, the videos and pictures are shared widely online. Organisers say women live in constant fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge. #MeToo takes hold in South Korea Korean revenge porn site owner arrested Carrying placards and banners with messages like ""My life is not your porn"", the women were mostly teenagers or in their 20s - seen as the main victims of the hidden cameras. ""Those men who film such videos! Those who upload them! Those who watch them! All of them should be punished sternly!"" they chanted. The women covered their faces with masks, hats and sunglasses as instructed by the organisers. Demonstrators said around 55,000 women took part, although police put the figure at around 20,000. All the protesters at the event were women The recent protests began after police arrested a 25-year-old woman in May for secretly photographing a male colleague who posed nude for university art students. She then shared the picture online. Demonstrators believe police only acted so swiftly because it was a female perpetrator, and pointed to instances of police closing cases with female victims because they could not find the photographers or track them online, because they posted on foreign servers. While the law mandates a maximum five-year prison term or 10 million won ($8,970; Â£6,770) fine for creating sexual images, and a maximum seven year sentence and 30 million won ($26,900; Â£20,200) fine for distributing them for profit, protesters say many receive far lighter punishments. This video can not be played The use of hidden and up-skirt cameras is a huge problem in South Korea South Korea has struggled to contain a rise in the crime in recent years. The number of hidden camera crimes rose from 1,100 in 2010 to more than 6,500 in 2017. Since 2004, the country has mandated that all smart phones should make loud shutter noises when they take a photo or video to make people aware of their use. But apps can be used to silence the noise, and perpetrators are also using miniature cameras hidden in walls, bags, shoes or toilets. President Moon Jae-in said the crime had become ""part of daily life"". Last week he reportedly told a cabinet meeting that offenders should ""suffer greater damage than the damage they inflict"", urging officials to look for stronger punishments such as notifying employers of any perpetrators on staff.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Sweden 0-2 England highlights 2018 Fifa World Cup on the BBC Host:RussiaDates:14 June - 15 July Live:Coverage across BBC TV, BBC Radio and BBC Sport website with further coverage on Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. ""It's coming home,"" was Alan Shearer's verdict after seeing England beat Sweden 2-0 to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Over on Radio 5 live, Chris Waddle - one of the heroes of that campaign - broke down in tears, saying: ""It's unbelievable. I couldn't believe I would witness this. It's quite emotional actually."" Listen to Waddle's emotional reaction England will play Croatia in the last four afterseeing off the Scandinavians with ease. Former Three Lions captain Shearer described goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's performance as ""outstanding"", while fellow BBC TV pundit Rio Ferdinand felt defender Harry Maguire, who scored England's opener, was ""immense"". This is what Shearer, Ferdinand and Germany legend Jurgen Klinsmann made of England's key men on a special night in Samara: This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Jordan Pickford makes three excellent saves to keep England's dream alive At 24, Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford is the youngest England goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup game. He dived at full-stretch to keep out Marcus Berg's header at the start of the second half with the score at 1-0, got down to his right to keep out Viktor Claesson's low shot and then acrobatically tipped over a powerful shot from Berg. Alan Shearer:""We were professional and thorough and every single player played their part, but Pickford was outstanding in goal when he had to be, when they got through our defence."" Rio Ferdinand:""The timing of his first save was vital - you are making big saves at big times in games. If you are going to be successful in a tournament, you need your goalkeeper to stand firm but what he has showed here is character and personality. ""The confidence that has come out of the shootout save he made against Colombia was so apparent within this game because he makes saves, he is berating his defenders when Sweden are taking shots, and he seems to be commanding his backline at the moment, which is a great asset to have."" Jurgen Klinsmann:""You need a goalkeeper who is in top form if you want to go far in a World Cup and Pickford is on top of his game. ""In the delicate moments he was right there. What really impressed me was his overall game and his distribution. His body language was always positive and focused too. You had the feeling he commanded his box."" Sweden v England: How you rated the players Reaction to England's quarter-final win This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Harry Maguire heads in the opener for England against Sweden Eight of England's 11 goals at this World Cup have come from set-pieces, with Leicester defender Harry Maguire breaking the deadlock against Sweden with a powerful run and header from England's first corner of the game. Alan Shearer:""It was perfect, all of it. The ball, the run, the timing and the header. It was magnificent. The keeper had no chance."" Rio Ferdinand:""Harry deserves a special mention because, in both boxes, he was immense. He is a man-mountain but with the ball at his feet his is graceful as well and this team is set up perfectly for him to play, to run out with the ball. ""Against Sweden he became someone who is an integral member of this team, someone who is indispensable at the moment."" Jurgen Klinsmann:""It takes a lot to make set-pieces work - the delivery is one thing but also the determination and desire to go in there and make the ball yours and that is what Harry did tremendously well against Sweden, and it was such a joy to watch him."" Jordan Henderson was one of four England players who went into the quarter-final a booking away from a suspension that would have meant them missing the semi-final. The others were Kyle Walker, Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek - all of them will be available. Rio Ferdinand:""I think Jordan Henderson's stock has gone up during this World Cup. He has been heavily criticised in the past for not passing the ball forward but against Sweden he proved he can do that, and he did it better than anyone. ""The ball he played through to send Raheem Sterling clear is an example of what he has brought to his game during this World Cup. If Pirlo plays that ball we are sat here salivating over it, so why not when it is Jordan? ""But it is his defensive work as well - the ground he covered, was phenomenal putting out fires left, right and centre and being that protector of the top three when the other midfielders are in advanced areas. Alan Shearer:""It is his work-rate and his pressing, the drive for his team. Against Sweden, when it came to the ugly side of the game that some players don't like doing, he was magnificent at that."" Rio Ferdinand:""Character. That is a big part of his make-up."" Watch: Wild celebrations as England reach semi-finals This video can not be played World Cup 2018: England players celebrate reaching the semi-finals Jurgen Klinsmann:""Throughout the entire England team, there was not even one weakness. What I really loved was in the second half they went for the second goal and they wanted to finish the game off."" Alan Shearer:""I did not ever feel anything other than we were going to beat Sweden and get to a semi-final. I never felt nervous at all during the game, and that is how comfortable they made us feel. ""We have got a momentum and a team spirit that is just dragging them through. I thought this was England's best performance of the tournament - I know they battered Panama but against Sweden they managed the game superbly well, and saw it through."" Rio Ferdinand:""We all fancied England to win before the game, by how many goals we did not know, but we fancied us to win because there is a confidence that exudes from this team, a knowhow and a philosophy. ""I wanted an identity borne out of this tournament for this team and I think we have got it now. They are possession-based, yes, they keep the ball and probe and we have got players in there who can make a difference. ""And they are young players gaining valuable experience here - they are enjoying it, and they deserve to be. What an environment that must be to be in. This video can not be played 'Semi-finals? I wasn't born in 1990, so I will take that' - Pickford ""This bunch seems like a well-balanced, well-oiled machine at the moment and that has come with momentum. Everyone was saying before the World Cup that we would be happy with the quarter-finals but once you get into a tournament, they have got that confidence now and things are happening for them. ""They are just performing. The draw has opened up for them, we can't get away from that, but you have still got to beat the teams who are in front of you, and we are doing that.""

"The nerve agent is highly toxic and can pass through the skin A police officer tested for possible exposure to a nerve agent in Salisbury has been given the medical all-clear. The Wiltshire Police officer was treated a short distance from Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill last Saturday. They remain in a critical condition after being exposed to Novichok by handling a contaminated item. The officer was cleared at Salisbury District Hospital. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case What are Novichok nerve agents? Wiltshire Police confirmed that one of their officers had been ""seeking medical advice"" at the hospital as part of ""a precautionary measure"". A Salisbury District Hospital spokesperson said: ""There is nothing to suggest there is any wider risk to anyone at the hospital."" The spokesperson added that the hospital had ""the ability to carry out the appropriate specialist tests. ""Salisbury District Hospital has seen a number of members of the public who have come to the hospital with health concerns since this incident started and none have required any treatment. ""We would like to reiterate the advice from Public Health England (PHE) that the risk to the wider public remains low."" The emergency department at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon where the officer initially attended had been closed but reopened at about 22:00 BST. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday An operation into the poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess is expected to take months as police examine more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage. Police are conducting a search for the item believed to have exposed the pair to Novichok. However, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the hunt has been hindered by the heatwave as chemical weapons experts wearing Hazmat (Hazardous Material) suits can only spend a few minutes inside the property being searched. Locations visited by the couple, as identified by the police, include Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. PHE issued ""highly precautionary advice"" for anyone who visited those locations to wash worn clothes with a regular detergent at normal temperature and wipe items like phones and handbags. This investigation comes months afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. He called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" and accused the country of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"". The Russian Embassy accused the UK of trying to ""frighten its own citizens"". Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Shock and worry after Novichok case What are Novichok nerve agents?

"A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children Twelve Thai boys trapped in a cave have exchanged emotional letters with their parents, for the first time since their ordeal began two weeks ago. ""Don't worry, we are all strong,"" one child said in a note. ""Teacher, don't give us lots of homework!"" he joked. The football coach who took the boys into the cave apologised to parents, but they wrote he was not to blame. Officials say that they have a window of up to four days before rains will make the rescue more difficult. The boys were exploring the cave when they became trapped by floodwaters on 23 June. The handwritten letters from the group were handed to British divers on Friday and released on theThai Navy Seal Facebook page,externalon Saturday. ""Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" a boy nicknamed Pong said. Another wrote: ""Nick loves Mum and Dad and siblings. If I can get out, Mum and Dad please bring me mookatha (Thai barbecue) to eat."" In full: Thai boys' letters of love and reassurance In his letter, the 25-year-old coach Ekkapol Chantawong, also known as Ake, said: ""Dear all kids' parents, now all of them are fine, the rescue team is treating us well. ""And I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can... I also sincerely apologise to the kids' parents."" In their letters, posted on the local government's Facebook page,several parents make clear that they do not blame the coach,external. ""Mums and dads are not angry at you. Thank you for helping take care of the kids,"" one said. Another reads: ""Tell Coach Ake: Don't think too much. We are not angry at him."" It was the first communication since attempts to establish a phone line inside the cave failed earlier this week. Helier Cheung, BBC News, Maesai district The letters make for remarkable reading. Words of love, reassurance and encouragement are interspersed with talk of food the boys are craving - and birthday parties. At least two of the boys have had their birthdays while stuck inside the cave. One of them, Note, has just turned 15. At the MyWay garage, where Note's father works, some of the workers have known Note since he was born - and describe him as a smart kid who loves sport and helps his father with mechanical work over the holidays. They were touched by his letter - but still full of concern for the boys. One of them, Rinlinee Sombat, told the BBC: ""He writes just like his Mum. But I want to see him even more than I want to see his handwriting."" Rinlinee Sombat and Ponrawee Tachavandee are hoping for Note's safe return Meanwhile, Ponrawee Tachavandee said he had spoken to Note's mother on Friday night - and she had been distraught since learning about the death of a Thai navy diver that day. He said she had told him that the ""navy Seal had practised for so long, and was so strong, but also died. How about a boy who has never dived before?"" The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, 10 days after they went missing. They were perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. How risky is the Thai boys rescue? 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' 'You never imagine someone you know could get trapped' Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention. There are concerns about the falling oxygen level in the chamber, but officials say an air line into the cave has now been installed. This video can not be played Dr Alex Rowe explains the impact of being trapped underground The danger of their situation became clear whena former Thai navy diver diedafter delivering air tanks to the group on Friday. Above ground, a huge military and civilian operation is racing against the clock to bring the boys out. Monsoon rains are threatening further flooding in the coming weeks and month. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search Elon Musk offers to help Thai cave rescue On Saturday, the governor of the Chiang Rai region, where the cave is located, said the next three to four days were ""the most favourable time for the operation in terms of the water, the weather and the boys' health"". Narongsak Osottanakorn said that after that, further rains could imperil the group. ""The water level may rise to the area where the children are sitting and make the area less than 10 sq m [100 sq ft],"" he said. Another concern, he added, was the growing concentration of carbon dioxide exhaled by the boys and rescue workers. This video can not be played Heavy rain is not expected until late in the week in the area where the boys are trapped in a cave He gave no details about how the rescue might be carried out.

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Highlights - Novak Djokovic beats Kyle Edmund to end British hopes Wimbledon 2018 on the BBC Venue:All England Club, WimbledonDates:2-15 July Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs and the BBC Sport website and app; Live Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra commentary; Text commentary online. British number one Kyle Edmund is out of Wimbledon after three-time champion Novak Djokovic fought back to win their third-round match. Serbian Djokovic, seeded 12th, regained control after 23-year-old Edmund made an encouraging start, going on to win 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 on Centre Court. The 21st seed's exit means there are no British players left in the singles. Former world number one Djokovic, 31, will play Russian Karen Khachanov in the last 16 on Monday. ""I would have, looking back on it, liked to have been a little bit more aggressive at stages,"" Edmund said. ""But it's easier said than done when you're in rallies. Today was reasonably good."" Edmund had only won one main-draw match at Wimbledon going into this year's tournament, but carried the nation's hopes in the men's draw after Andy Murray pulled out on the eve of the tournament. Two routine wins over qualifiers Alex Bolt and Bradley Klahn - players ranked outside the top 150 - raised hopes he could cause a shock against Djokovic. The Yorkshireman earned his maiden win over Djokovic at the Madrid Open in May, victory which he said would give him belief when they met again in SW19. However, that win was on the clay and over three sets - this match proved a different proposition as Djokovic showed he remains one of the biggest threats in the draw. It is the first time since 2007 a British singles player has not made the second week at Wimbledon. ""I thought it was a high-quality tennis match,"" said Djokovic. ""It was very, very, very intense. Just a couple points here and there."" Nadal advances to keep top ranking Fourth seed Zverev beaten by qualifier Gulbis Top seed Halep out in third round BBC TV, radio and online coverage The match was scheduled third on Centre Court on Saturday in an attempt to avoid a direct clash with England's World Cup quarter-final against Sweden. And the players walked out on to Centre - which had a sparse crowd watching the preceding match between Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka - just moments afterEngland wrapped up victory. There were still a few empty seats as play started, but those who had returned created a buzz which they hoped could help Edmund make a fast start. It did not materialise immediately as his serve came under pressure in the second game. Edmund saved two break points after edging a baseline rally and a forehand volley, going on to seal what proved to be a significant hold. With the energy of the crowd behind him, a pumped up Edmund picked up the pace and began to hurt Djokovic with ferocious forehands. His trademark shot and biggest weapon enabled him to take the first break of the match at the fourth attempt for a 4-2 lead, going on to serve out the opener. However, the buoyancy of the crowd - no doubt boosted by England's victory in the football - started to fade as Djokovic fought back. This video can not be played 'We need Hawkeye & VAR' - Djokovic furious after double bounce shot Djokovic has dropped down the rankings after spending six months out with an elbow injury and struggling to regain his consistency in recent months. The 12-time Grand Slam winner has lost the aura of invincibility that surrounded him at his peak, at times seemingly lacking the focus which enabled him to win the biggest prizes. It was evident in the opening set, particularly when the Serb pumped an easy forehand long when he threatened to break straight back. His body language - angrily shouting at the court and often looking discouraged - as the opening set moved towards a conclusion was also stark. However, something switched for the Serb in the second set. Djokovic missed two more break points in Edmund's first service game, but continued to apply all the pressure. Eventually it told when Edmund coughed up a damaging double fault on Djokovic's fourth break point of the eighth game, leaving his opponent to serve out for the set. Edmund had lost the intensity he started with, his unforced error count creeping up as Djokovic broke in the opening game of the third set and then again for a 5-2 lead which he closed out. The fourth set was another hard-fought battle, Edmund saving four break points in a dramatic seventh game - where he got away with a double bounce before hitting a winner. It did not prove pivotal as Djokovic went on to break in Edmund's next service game, clinching the match with an ace to win in two hours and 53 minutes. Djokovic has reached the Wimbledon last 16 for an 11th time Djokovic - who had blown kisses to the crowd after they cheered a time violation given to him and then booed him - roared with delight in a wild celebration after reaching the last 16 ""It was a Davis Cup-like atmosphere. I expected them to support Kyle, obviously. But at times they were slightly unfair to me,"" he said. ""I got time violation deservedly because I took more time. I thought the crowd's reaction after that was quite unnecessary. ""A couple guys really, you know, pretending they were coughing and whistling while I was bouncing the ball more or less to the end of the match at that end where I received the time violation. ""That's what I didn't like."" Tim Henman, former Wimbledon semi-finalist on BBC TV I'm disappointed Edmund lost, but I'm disappointed he lost to Djokovic, so in context it shows how far his game has come. Now he's a genuine contender in the Slams to get into the second week. And the way he played at the end of the first set and beginning of the second, you felt this could be another opportunity for him to make another breakthrough. From Djokovic's point of view it is a very important victory. He's been trending in the right direction. He's fit, he's healthy, his movement is exceptional. There's some challenges mentally, he still looks frustrated out there, so I think it was good for him to get through. Pat Cash, 1987 Wimbledon champion on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra That was a very good performance from Edmund and I think it will give him a lot of confidence going forward. Watching this match and the way Djokovic had to raise his standard to the level we know he can has given me the confidence to say Kyle will be in Grand Slam finals in the future and a top 10 player. That was a good performance. Djokovic really had to get to his best level to beat him.

"The parade started off from Portland Place, central London Streets in central London were filled with thousands of people as they celebrated the Pride in London parade. The parade itself, which coincided with England's World Cup quarter-final in Russia, included about 30,000 people from 472 organisations. But up to one million other people are thought to have lined the streets to watch the event. It started out from Portland Place at 12:00 BST and finished in Whitehall at about 17:00. As ever Pride participants produced some imaginative costumes Organisers said they hoped ""all the rainbows... will work their magic and send good vibes over to Russia.""

"Even the grandest of properties - like this one in Pendle - can be listed for less than Â£1m Tens of thousands of Â£1m-plus homes have been sold in the last 10 years - but in 16 areas of England and Wales no property topped the Â£1m mark. While one-bedroom flats can sell for millions in London, the most luxurious properties in areas from Gateshead to Gloucester cost less than Â£1m. A delve into Land Registry data by the BBC in May revealed thatsales of Â£1m-plus homes hit a new high last year. Fresh research shows where property has not collected a seven-figure sum. Stoke-on-Trent is famously a capital of ceramics but it is not the pottery, but the property, that is attracting some people here. In the window of estate agent Reeds Rains are a series of homes listed at between Â£80,000 and Â£120,000. Inside manager Martin Critchlow says that the relatively low prices attract investors, first-time buyers, and pensioners. Stoke-on-Trent - a home to pottery and low house prices ""We have people retiring to here from places like Kent, because they can get more for their money,"" he says. Buy-to-let investors, who typically make up about half of his clientele, are attracted by the relatively lack of boom and bust in the local market, alongside steady demand from tenants, he says. ""They are not going to find a goldmine, but they know the bottom is not going to fall out of the market,"" he says. Some properties in the area are let to students First-time buyers can also buy properties that their counterparts in some other parts of the country can only dream about. He tells of one recent example, when a buyer bought his first home - a three-bedroom detached with a garage - for Â£160,000. The 16 areas where transactions have never exceeded Â£1m since the start of 2007 are clustered primarily in the North West of England (seven), with three in Wales. These areas are not seeing top-end house prices, yet there is no absence of luxury among the properties currently for sale at less than Â£1m. For example, there is a five-bedroom detached home complete with games room, sauna, gym and wine cellar on the market for Â£950,000 in Worcester. This Worcester home is listed for less than Â£1m In Pendle, a gated five-bedroom home built in 1890 is for sale at an asking price of Â£875,000. Some of the original features remain, such as the servants' bells and oak panelling. While in Hyndburn, the owners are asking for slightly less for a 19th century four-bedroom farmhouse with 15 acres of land which houses 10 stables for horses. Previous research showed that, during the past decade, most Â£1m-plus properties were sold in London, but sales have doubled in the East of England - the biggest increase of any region in England and Wales. University cities such as Cambridge and Bristol saw Â£1m-plus sales surge. A total of 125,898 property sales have been completed in England and Wales for Â£1m or more since the start of 2007, the latest available transaction data from the Land Registry shows. The local authority with the most sales during that period was Westminster in London, with 12,917. You can see how many were sold in your area with this calculator.

The BBC data team analysed all residential transactions in England and Wales from the Land Registry price-paid dataset for the period from January 2007 to the latest data release at the end of June 2018. Property type classified as ""other"" in the Land Registry data was excluded, as the category could potentially contain properties that are not residential. All transactions over Â£1m (including those at exactly Â£1m) were mapped to local authorities using the latest Ordnance Survey's Codepoint Open mapping file from February 2018 that contains data for each postcode unit in England and Wales.

"Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol say goodbye as the US envoy departs for Japan North Korea has accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks. It branded the US attitude at the meeting as ""extremely troubling"". The statement, by an unnamed foreign ministry official, gave a starkly different account from one provided by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just hours before. He had said progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang. It is the first time he has visited North Korea since a summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The leader's meeting ended with a promise from Mr Kim to work towards denuclearisation, but details on how this will be achieved remain thin. North Korea crisis in 300 words Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments A key aim of Mr Pompeo during his visit was to firm up North Korea's commitment to disarmament. But the North Korean statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency, said the US had gone against the spirit of the summit by putting unilateral pressure on the country to abandon its nuclear weapons. ""We had anticipated the US side would come with a constructive idea, thinking we would take something in return,"" the North Korean statement said, warning its ""resolve for denuclearisation... may falter"". ""The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that [North Korea] would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset,"" it added. At the talks, Mr Pompeo did not meet with Mr Kim, but instead with Kim Yong-chol, who is seen as his right-hand man. In his assessment Mr Pompeo gave little away, but he said they had discussed at length a timeline for disarmament, including the destruction of a missile engine testing facility. ""These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues, some places a great deal of progress, other places there's still more work to be done,"" he said. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures After the Singapore summit, which also saw the US offer ""security guarantees"" to North Korea and promise to end its military drills with South Korea, Mr Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while US intelligence officials have said there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programmes. A state department spokesperson said Mr Pompeo had been ""very firm"" in focusing on denuclearisation, as well as on security assurances and another important US demand - the return of remains of US service personnel from the Korean War. As Saturday's meeting got under way Kim Yong-chol joked that Mr Pompeo may not have slept well during his overnight stay at a guesthouse in Pyongyang. Mr Pompeo said he ""slept just fine"". On Sunday, the US secretary of state will meet the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea in Tokyo. Win-win or a Kim win? Video, 00:02:20Win-win or a Kim win?

Serbian Djokovic, seeded 12th, regained control after 23-year-old Edmund made an encouraging start, going on to win 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 on Centre Court. The 21st seed's exit means there are no British players left in the singles. Former world number one Djokovic, 31, will play Russian Karen Khachanov in the last 16 on Monday. ""I would have, looking back on it, liked to have been a little bit more aggressive at stages,"" Edmund said. ""But it's easier said than done when you're in rallies. Today was reasonably good."" Edmund had only won one main-draw match at Wimbledon going into this year's tournament, but carried the nation's hopes in the men's draw after Andy Murray pulled out on the eve of the tournament. Two routine wins over qualifiers Alex Bolt and Bradley Klahn - players ranked outside the top 150 - raised hopes he could cause a shock against Djokovic. The Yorkshireman earned his maiden win over Djokovic at the Madrid Open in May, victory which he said would give him belief when they met again in SW19. However, that win was on the clay and over three sets - this match proved a different proposition as Djokovic showed he remains one of the biggest threats in the draw. It is the first time since 2007 a British singles player has not made the second week at Wimbledon. ""I thought it was a high-quality tennis match,"" said Djokovic. ""It was very, very, very intense. Just a couple points here and there."" Nadal advances to keep top ranking Fourth seed Zverev beaten by qualifier Gulbis Top seed Halep out in third round BBC TV, radio and online coverage The match was scheduled third on Centre Court on Saturday in an attempt to avoid a direct clash with England's World Cup quarter-final against Sweden. And the players walked out on to Centre - which had a sparse crowd watching the preceding match between Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka - just moments afterEngland wrapped up victory. There were still a few empty seats as play started, but those who had returned created a buzz which they hoped could help Edmund make a fast start. It did not materialise immediately as his serve came under pressure in the second game. Edmund saved two break points after edging a baseline rally and a forehand volley, going on to seal what proved to be a significant hold. With the energy of the crowd behind him, a pumped up Edmund picked up the pace and began to hurt Djokovic with ferocious forehands. His trademark shot and biggest weapon enabled him to take the first break of the match at the fourth attempt for a 4-2 lead, going on to serve out the opener. However, the buoyancy of the crowd - no doubt boosted by England's victory in the football - started to fade as Djokovic fought back. This video can not be played 'We need Hawkeye & VAR' - Djokovic furious after double bounce shot Djokovic has dropped down the rankings after spending six months out with an elbow injury and struggling to regain his consistency in recent months. The 12-time Grand Slam winner has lost the aura of invincibility that surrounded him at his peak, at times seemingly lacking the focus which enabled him to win the biggest prizes. It was evident in the opening set, particularly when the Serb pumped an easy forehand long when he threatened to break straight back. His body language - angrily shouting at the court and often looking discouraged - as the opening set moved towards a conclusion was also stark. However, something switched for the Serb in the second set. Djokovic missed two more break points in Edmund's first service game, but continued to apply all the pressure. Eventually it told when Edmund coughed up a damaging double fault on Djokovic's fourth break point of the eighth game, leaving his opponent to serve out for the set. Edmund had lost the intensity he started with, his unforced error count creeping up as Djokovic broke in the opening game of the third set and then again for a 5-2 lead which he closed out. The fourth set was another hard-fought battle, Edmund saving four break points in a dramatic seventh game - where he got away with a double bounce before hitting a winner. It did not prove pivotal as Djokovic went on to break in Edmund's next service game, clinching the match with an ace to win in two hours and 53 minutes. Djokovic has reached the Wimbledon last 16 for an 11th time Djokovic - who had blown kisses to the crowd after they cheered a time violation given to him and then booed him - roared with delight in a wild celebration after reaching the last 16 ""It was a Davis Cup-like atmosphere. I expected them to support Kyle, obviously. But at times they were slightly unfair to me,"" he said. ""I got time violation deservedly because I took more time. I thought the crowd's reaction after that was quite unnecessary. ""A couple guys really, you know, pretending they were coughing and whistling while I was bouncing the ball more or less to the end of the match at that end where I received the time violation. ""That's what I didn't like."" Tim Henman, former Wimbledon semi-finalist on BBC TV I'm disappointed Edmund lost, but I'm disappointed he lost to Djokovic, so in context it shows how far his game has come. Now he's a genuine contender in the Slams to get into the second week. And the way he played at the end of the first set and beginning of the second, you felt this could be another opportunity for him to make another breakthrough. From Djokovic's point of view it is a very important victory. He's been trending in the right direction. He's fit, he's healthy, his movement is exceptional. There's some challenges mentally, he still looks frustrated out there, so I think it was good for him to get through. Pat Cash, 1987 Wimbledon champion on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra That was a very good performance from Edmund and I think it will give him a lot of confidence going forward. Watching this match and the way Djokovic had to raise his standard to the level we know he can has given me the confidence to say Kyle will be in Grand Slam finals in the future and a top 10 player. That was a good performance. Djokovic really had to get to his best level to beat him.

"Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol say goodbye as the US envoy departs for Japan North Korea has accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks. It branded the US attitude at the meeting as ""extremely troubling"". The statement, by an unnamed foreign ministry official, gave a starkly different account from one provided by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just hours before. He had said progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang. It is the first time he has visited North Korea since a summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The leader's meeting ended with a promise from Mr Kim to work towards denuclearisation, but details on how this will be achieved remain thin. North Korea crisis in 300 words Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments A key aim of Mr Pompeo during his visit was to firm up North Korea's commitment to disarmament. But the North Korean statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency, said the US had gone against the spirit of the summit by putting unilateral pressure on the country to abandon its nuclear weapons. ""We had anticipated the US side would come with a constructive idea, thinking we would take something in return,"" the North Korean statement said, warning its ""resolve for denuclearisation... may falter"". ""The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that [North Korea] would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset,"" it added. At the talks, Mr Pompeo did not meet with Mr Kim, but instead with Kim Yong-chol, who is seen as his right-hand man. In his assessment Mr Pompeo gave little away, but he said they had discussed at length a timeline for disarmament, including the destruction of a missile engine testing facility. ""These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues, some places a great deal of progress, other places there's still more work to be done,"" he said. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures After the Singapore summit, which also saw the US offer ""security guarantees"" to North Korea and promise to end its military drills with South Korea, Mr Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while US intelligence officials have said there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programmes. A state department spokesperson said Mr Pompeo had been ""very firm"" in focusing on denuclearisation, as well as on security assurances and another important US demand - the return of remains of US service personnel from the Korean War. As Saturday's meeting got under way Kim Yong-chol joked that Mr Pompeo may not have slept well during his overnight stay at a guesthouse in Pyongyang. Mr Pompeo said he ""slept just fine"". On Sunday, the US secretary of state will meet the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea in Tokyo. Win-win or a Kim win? Video, 00:02:20Win-win or a Kim win?

because of the emotional and physical energy we had to exert against Colombia. We
knew the game would be stop start against Sweden. Defensively we dealt with
most things well, and when we didnât, our goalkeeper was outstanding. We
created opportunities in attack even though the
opposition made it difficult for us, and our football flowed well."" Asked about the optimism now surrounding the squad, Southgate added:""Managing
expectations is going to be a bit difficult. We are privileged to be here and to be England manager is an
honour. We are here because of the players as well of the staff. We have
senior pros that havenât played as much, but have carried on with smiles on

"A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children Twelve Thai boys trapped in a cave have exchanged emotional letters with their parents, for the first time since their ordeal began two weeks ago. ""Don't worry, we are all strong,"" one child said in a note. ""Teacher, don't give us lots of homework!"" he joked. The football coach who took the boys into the cave apologised to parents, but they wrote he was not to blame. Officials say that they have a window of up to four days before rains will make the rescue more difficult. The boys were exploring the cave when they became trapped by floodwaters on 23 June. The handwritten letters from the group were handed to British divers on Friday and released on theThai Navy Seal Facebook page,externalon Saturday. ""Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" a boy nicknamed Pong said. Another wrote: ""Nick loves Mum and Dad and siblings. If I can get out, Mum and Dad please bring me mookatha (Thai barbecue) to eat."" In full: Thai boys' letters of love and reassurance In his letter, the 25-year-old coach Ekkapol Chantawong, also known as Ake, said: ""Dear all kids' parents, now all of them are fine, the rescue team is treating us well. ""And I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can... I also sincerely apologise to the kids' parents."" In their letters, posted on the local government's Facebook page,several parents make clear that they do not blame the coach,external. ""Mums and dads are not angry at you. Thank you for helping take care of the kids,"" one said. Another reads: ""Tell Coach Ake: Don't think too much. We are not angry at him."" It was the first communication since attempts to establish a phone line inside the cave failed earlier this week. Helier Cheung, BBC News, Maesai district The letters make for remarkable reading. Words of love, reassurance and encouragement are interspersed with talk of food the boys are craving - and birthday parties. At least two of the boys have had their birthdays while stuck inside the cave. One of them, Note, has just turned 15. At the MyWay garage, where Note's father works, some of the workers have known Note since he was born - and describe him as a smart kid who loves sport and helps his father with mechanical work over the holidays. They were touched by his letter - but still full of concern for the boys. One of them, Rinlinee Sombat, told the BBC: ""He writes just like his Mum. But I want to see him even more than I want to see his handwriting."" Rinlinee Sombat and Ponrawee Tachavandee are hoping for Note's safe return Meanwhile, Ponrawee Tachavandee said he had spoken to Note's mother on Friday night - and she had been distraught since learning about the death of a Thai navy diver that day. He said she had told him that the ""navy Seal had practised for so long, and was so strong, but also died. How about a boy who has never dived before?"" The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, 10 days after they went missing. They were perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. How risky is the Thai boys rescue? 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' 'You never imagine someone you know could get trapped' Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention. There are concerns about the falling oxygen level in the chamber, but officials say an air line into the cave has now been installed. This video can not be played Dr Alex Rowe explains the impact of being trapped underground The danger of their situation became clear whena former Thai navy diver diedafter delivering air tanks to the group on Friday. Above ground, a huge military and civilian operation is racing against the clock to bring the boys out. Monsoon rains are threatening further flooding in the coming weeks and month. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search Elon Musk offers to help Thai cave rescue On Saturday, the governor of the Chiang Rai region, where the cave is located, said the next three to four days were ""the most favourable time for the operation in terms of the water, the weather and the boys' health"". Narongsak Osottanakorn said that after that, further rains could imperil the group. ""The water level may rise to the area where the children are sitting and make the area less than 10 sq m [100 sq ft],"" he said. Another concern, he added, was the growing concentration of carbon dioxide exhaled by the boys and rescue workers. This video can not be played Heavy rain is not expected until late in the week in the area where the boys are trapped in a cave He gave no details about how the rescue might be carried out. Meanwhile, rescuers outside have dug more than 100 holes in an attempt to reach the cave by a direct route. Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The physical effects of being trapped in a cave.

"Signs have gone up around Swansea and Gower beaches warning the public ""don't be a lobster"" to highlight the dangers of sitting out in the sun Beautiful beaches and a ""surf culture"" are two of the factors behind a rise in skin cancer rates in Wales, a leading oncologist has said. Prof John Wagstaff, director of the Wales Cancer Research Network, said Wales and Cornwall had two of the highest rates of the disease in the UK. The warning comes after seven people wereadmitted to hospital for sunburn. Figures show melanoma - a cancer caused by sunburn - is among the fastest-increasing cancers in Wales. There has been a 58.3% increase in incidence rates of melanoma from 2003-2005 to 2013-2015, the second biggest increase behind liver cancer, according to Public Health Wales. There are significant regional variances across Wales, with the melanoma rate in Cardiff and Vale 32% higher than the lowest rate in Hywel Dda. People are being advised to wear a high-factor suncream Wear protective clothing Use SPF 30+ sunscreen with at least four-star UVA protection Wear a wide-brimmed hat Wear quality sunglasses Seek shade from the sun whenever possible ""Generally, the further west you go the higher the incidence of melanoma,"" added Prof Wagstaff. ""Wales and Cornwall have the highest incidence in the UK. This is probably because there is more sunshine and a surf culture."" Prof Wagstaff explained there are two types of skin cancer: melanoma, which attacks pigment-containing cells, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) which is the most common. Prof John Wagstaff, director of the Wales Cancer Research Network ""Melanoma is the rarer of the two but is the most dangerous because it can spread around the bloodstream and lymph cells - it used to be a uniformly lethal condition,"" he said. ""It is caused by sunburn and the average age of people who have it is 53."" And while survival rates among people with melanoma have improved ""dramatically"" - from an average of just nine months to three years - the disease is still deadly, he added. Keep an eye on your moles, especially if they are exposed to the sun Gets bigger Changes shape Changes colour Bleeds or becomes crusty Is itchy or sore The problem of sunburn is getting worse in the UK but Prof Wagstaff said it was avoidable. ""In Australia, there has been a campaign for the last 25 years - on their beaches and in schools - telling people to keep their t-shirts on and put the sun block on. ""Incidence in Australia is falling quite dramatically while in the UK, incidence has doubled every 10 years for the last 40 years. ""Sunburn is a public health issue which hasn't been properly addressed."" Dr Aldridge treated Mr O'Brien's arm Caerphilly minibus driver Carl O'Brien was shocked to discover he had pre-cancerous cells on his arm in 2016 after visiting his GP for an unrelated matter. ""I nearly fell off my chair,"" he said. ""I knew nothing about it. ""As a driver I was more at risk - it is only the windscreen that protects you from the sun, not the side windows. ""Ever since I have worn a long-sleeve t-shirt while working. ""Wearing sun cream is a must, especially if you are fair - it is an absolute must."" And Mr O'Brien said he was living proof of the importance of keeping an eye on your skin and seeing your GP if you are worried.

"Bonnie Langford, right, plays Shakil's mother Carmel, with Davood Ghadami as his brother Kush EastEnders has been praised after parents of young knife crime victims told their stories on a special episode of the BBC One soap. They addressed the camera during Friday night's episode, which centred on the funeral of fictional character Shakil Kazemi. Shakil was stabbed to death by a gang in an episode shown in May. Viewers said they were in tears watching the episode, which has also been praised by critics. It concluded with the families of the real-life victims standing outside the church, holding up pictures of their loved ones, as the coffin was carried past to the sound of Abide With Me. The real stories behind the EastEnders episode Brooke Kinsella: 'London still not safe' Mark Easton: No easy answers to gun and knife crime What's it like to be stabbed?

She wrote that it was ""an undeniably difficult watch"", especially where the actors and victims' families shared the screen. Zack Morris, who plays Keegan Baker, with Shakil's friends ""This was a tear-jerking, traumatic reminder that knife crime is happening everywhere, in different ways, to different people - and that this is far, far more than a soap story,"" she said. Davood said on Twitter that he was ""so grateful"" for the ""bravery and strength"" of the contributors. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

because of the emotional and physical energy we had to exert against Colombia. We
knew the game would be stop start against Sweden. Defensively we dealt with
most things well, and when we didnât, our goalkeeper was outstanding. We
created opportunities in attack even though the
opposition made it difficult for us, and our football flowed well."" Asked about the optimism now surrounding the squad, Southgate added:""Managing
expectations is going to be a bit difficult. We are privileged to be here and to be England manager is an
honour. We are here because of the players as well of the staff. We have
senior pros that havenât played as much, but have carried on with smiles on

"Runners traditionally wear white with red scarves at the week-long festival A person was gored and four others hurt, the Red Cross said, as Pamplona's bull running festival got under way. One person was caught on a bull's horns during Saturday's run - statistically the most dangerous day of the week-long festival. Four others were taken to hospital suffering minor injuries from falls. The 875-metre run in the northern Spanish city lasts on average about two and a half minutes, with some 2,000 people taking part every year. According to the Pamplona government, on average hundreds of people are injured every year during the festival, although few require medical treatment - falling and grazes are far more common than injuries caused by bulls or pile ups in the crowd. Since records began in 1910,at least 16 people have died during the festival,external. The deadliest runs occurred in 1947 and 1980, when two participants in each year died. The last person to die at the festival,Daniel Jimeno Romero, was gored in the neck in 2009,externalduring the fourth run of the festival. The majority of runners are men - women have only been allowed to take part since 1974. This year's festival takes place amid protests about the treatment of women during the event.

"Even the grandest of properties - like this one in Pendle - can be listed for less than Â£1m Tens of thousands of Â£1m-plus homes have been sold in the last 10 years - but in 16 areas of England and Wales no property topped the Â£1m mark. While one-bedroom flats can sell for millions in London, the most luxurious properties in areas from Gateshead to Gloucester cost less than Â£1m. A delve into Land Registry data by the BBC in May revealed thatsales of Â£1m-plus homes hit a new high last year. Fresh research shows where property has not collected a seven-figure sum. Stoke-on-Trent is famously a capital of ceramics but it is not the pottery, but the property, that is attracting some people here. In the window of estate agent Reeds Rains are a series of homes listed at between Â£80,000 and Â£120,000. Inside manager Martin Critchlow says that the relatively low prices attract investors, first-time buyers, and pensioners. Stoke-on-Trent - a home to pottery and low house prices ""We have people retiring to here from places like Kent, because they can get more for their money,"" he says. Buy-to-let investors, who typically make up about half of his clientele, are attracted by the relatively lack of boom and bust in the local market, alongside steady demand from tenants, he says. ""They are not going to find a goldmine, but they know the bottom is not going to fall out of the market,"" he says. Some properties in the area are let to students First-time buyers can also buy properties that their counterparts in some other parts of the country can only dream about. He tells of one recent example, when a buyer bought his first home - a three-bedroom detached with a garage - for Â£160,000. The 16 areas where transactions have never exceeded Â£1m since the start of 2007 are clustered primarily in the North West of England (seven), with three in Wales. These areas are not seeing top-end house prices, yet there is no absence of luxury among the properties currently for sale at less than Â£1m. For example, there is a five-bedroom detached home complete with games room, sauna, gym and wine cellar on the market for Â£950,000 in Worcester. This Worcester home is listed for less than Â£1m In Pendle, a gated five-bedroom home built in 1890 is for sale at an asking price of Â£875,000. Some of the original features remain, such as the servants' bells and oak panelling. While in Hyndburn, the owners are asking for slightly less for a 19th century four-bedroom farmhouse with 15 acres of land which houses 10 stables for horses. Previous research showed that, during the past decade, most Â£1m-plus properties were sold in London, but sales have doubled in the East of England - the biggest increase of any region in England and Wales. University cities such as Cambridge and Bristol saw Â£1m-plus sales surge. A total of 125,898 property sales have been completed in England and Wales for Â£1m or more since the start of 2007, the latest available transaction data from the Land Registry shows. The local authority with the most sales during that period was Westminster in London, with 12,917. You can see how many were sold in your area with this calculator. Inthere werehomes over Â£1m sold since 2007, with the most expensive sold for. If the postcode search does not load,click to launch the interactive content,external. The BBC data team analysed all residential transactions in England and Wales from the Land Registry price-paid dataset for the period from January 2007 to the latest data release at the end of June 2018. Property type classified as ""other"" in the Land Registry data was excluded, as the category could potentially contain properties that are not residential. All transactions over Â£1m (including those at exactly Â£1m) were mapped to local authorities using the latest Ordnance Survey's Codepoint Open mapping file from February 2018 that contains data for each postcode unit in England and Wales. Postcodes not found in the OS Codepoint Open mapping file were not counted as part of the analysis, as they could not be matched to a local authority.

"This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting Theresa May is seeking Conservative MPs' backing for the cabinet's proposal for UK-EU relations after Brexit. The plan was agreed by the prime minister's senior ministers at a 12-hour cabinet awayday on Friday. Mrs May said the plan ""will be good for the UK and good for the EU"". But there has been unhappiness among Tory Brexiteers, with Jacob Rees-Mogg telling the BBC that when the detail emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal. Mr Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said that so far onlythe three page summary of the deal,externalhad been published, and he would have to wait and see the full 100-plus page document to see whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""not convinced"" by the deal, and criticised ""leaving out services from trade arrangements in the future... I've got a feeling the whole thing might start to unravel in the next few days"". All Conservative backbench MPs were invited to a briefing with the party's chief whip Julian Smith in Downing Street on Saturday, with about 40 thought to have attended. This video can not be played Nigel Evans: Plan guarantees red lines The message from those leaving the briefing, such as Tory MP Nigel Evans, was that the proposal was for a ""pragmatic"" Brexit delivering on the big referendum issues of sovereignty, immigration and the national finances without harming the ability to trade quickly and freely with the EU. Mr Evans said Mrs May would make a statement to Parliament about the plan on Monday and also address a meeting of all Conservative backbench MPs. The plan that ministers signed up to on Friday aims to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"". It also supports what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"" for the UK and EU. Laura Kuenssberg analysis: The deal is done At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Brexit jargon explained BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister had ""picked a side"" by opting for a closer relationship with the EU than many colleagues desired - and she now had to sell it to her party and the other European leaders. No 10, she added, hoped the new commitments would unlock the next phase of talks with the rest of the EU but it was not yet clear how many, or what kind, of objections had been raised within the cabinet. Downing Street said the proposals marked a ""substantial evolution"" in the UK's position and would resolve outstanding concerns about the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. ""This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU, and I look forward to it being received positively,"" Mrs May told the BBC. One pro-Brexit cabinet minister told the BBC there was ""no point"" pushing for a vote as ""we were well and truly outnumbered by 20 to seven"". The UK said it now wanted to accelerate the negotiations in an effort to secure an agreement by October, but also warned it will step up preparations for leaving on 29 March 2019 without a deal. EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who earlier suggested the EU would be willing to shift its position if the UK relaxed some of its ""red lines"", tweeted to say the plans would be assessed to see if they were ""workable and realistic"".

The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The prime minister had gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to try to resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details of theChequers statement,externalare as follows: The UK would accept continuing ""harmonisation"" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade Parliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so There will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater ""regulatory flexibility"" and ""strong reciprocal arrangements"" Freedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work A new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of ""a combined customs territory"" The UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules are in force Mrs May said this was an ""important step"" in the process of negotiating the UK's smooth exit from the EU. ""Of course we still have work to do with the EU in ensuring that we get to that end point in October. But this is good we have come today, following our detailed discussions, to a positive future for the UK,"" she said. She said the proposals, to be formally published in a white paper next week, would give the UK the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries while maintaining regulatory, environmental and consumer standards. This video can not be played Brexit: How will remainers and leavers react to cabinet customs agreement? In a letter sent to all Conservative MPs, she said she had allowed colleagues to express their views while policy was developed but ""agreement on this proposal marks the point where this is no longer the case and collective responsibility is fully restored"". There is no mention in the document of eitherthe single market or the customs union, which the UK has committed to leave after the end of a transition period in December 2020. Under plans for a free trade zone, the UK would be committed legally to following EU law for a large part of the economy, including manufacturing and farming. While Parliament would retain the right to diverge from EU regulations in these areas, the document makes clear that ""choosing not to pass the relevant legislation would have consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border"". Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt and David Davis among those listening to Theresa May The document also commits the government to step up preparedness for a no-deal scenario, as one of a range of possible outcomes, ""given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations"". The CBI employers group welcomed the proposals for a free trade area in goods which it said would provide a ""confidence boost"" to business. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was ""encouraging"" to see an agreed negotiating position from government. But FSB chairman Mike Cherry warned: ""The reaction from the rest of the EU is crucial for there to be concrete progress when negotiations restart in just over a week's time. The clock is ticking."" Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said there was ""a danger that this is a lowest common denominator plan"" designed to hold the cabinet together, rather than ""secure the strong negotiating position that we need with the EU"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Once upon a time we were told 'Brexit means Brexit', now we are told it means maintaining a common rulebook for all goods, a joint institutional framework for interpreting the agreement and the UK and EU forming this combined customs territory. ""That looks very much like regulatory alignment, the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and half a customs union to me."" Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement was ""hopefully a step forward"". But the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called the agreement ""a fudge"", adding: ""There might be agreement, for now, in the cabinet. The EU will not buy this."" Nigel Dodds, for the Democratic Unionist Party, said:  ""The government's commitment at Chequers to the political and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom with no borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is a welcome reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us."" Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it could be the case that ""Brexiteers have signed up to it knowing perfectly well that it is not going to pass the European Union and they'll then be able to blame Europe for the fact that it won't work"". Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said: ""This latest proposal continues to cherry pick certain aspects of EU membership in a way that the EU's negotiators have made perfectly clear is unacceptable. More fudge means yet more uncertainty and yet more damage to our economy."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who backed Brexit in the referendum, said the deal would end free movement of people and would end the remit of the European Court of Justice in the UK - saying that UK judges always pay regards to other countries' courts, such as Canada or Hong Kong. He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that the cabinet had agreed to step up preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal. Fellow cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also tweeted her backing for the deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave said it would represent a ""bad deal for the UK"" which would ""only slide further as the EU takes more and more"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan amounted to a ""sell-out to global corporates"" and would do nothing for the 90% of British firms which do not export to Europe. Veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Sir Bill Cash said he was ""deeply disappointed to say the least"" about the plans, which he suggested could contradict the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act passed by MPs last month.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will bring an end to free movement"" Theresa May has refused to rule out making it easier for EU citizens to come to the UK after Brexit than it is for people from elsewhere in the world. Under her plan for UK-EU relations - agreed by cabinet on Friday - unlimited immigration from the EU will end. But speaking to the BBC, Mrs May did not rule out preferential treatment for EU citizens after Brexit. ""We recognise that people will still want to have opportunities in each other's countries,"" she said. But a briefing being circulated tothe European Research Group (ERG)- a group of Eurosceptic Conservative backbench MPs - says the prime minister's plan ""would lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit"". The 18-page document expresses concern the UK would have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and would not be able to develop an ""effective international trade policy"". Laura Kuenssberg: Tory tensions on Europe still profound At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon The BBC understands Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was vocal and hostile in his opposition to Mrs May's plan, which he reportedly said would leave the UK as a ""vassal state"" and be a ""serious inhibitor of free trade"". Allies of Mr Johnson say he is staying in the cabinet to ""make the argument for Brexiteers"". Asked if it was possible EU citizens might get some preferential treatment, the prime minister said: ""We are going to decide. What we're going to do is say what works for the UK, what's right for the United Kingdom?"" A day after she secured cabinet approval on a plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU, Mrs May said ministers were now expected to speak with collective responsibility. ""Collective responsibility has returned... we are moving forward together,"" she told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Tory Brexiteer and ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg previously told the BBC that when detail of the plan emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal. Mr Rees-Mogg, said that so far onlythe three page summary of the deal,externalhad been published, and he would have to wait to see the full 100-plus page document to decide whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""This is a serious, workable proposal"" Mrs May will now have to take the plan to the EU, which she said was now ready to sit down and discuss the proposals. ""From the soundings I've had so far, there is a willingness to sit down and talk about this and a recognition that actually we now are in the stage where we need to agree what the future relationship's going to be,"" Mrs May said on Saturday. ""This is a serious, workable proposal,"" she added. The plans that ministers backed would see an end to freedom of movement. But a ""mobility framework"" would be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply to study and work. Mrs May said when people voted to leave the EU, ""they wanted to take control of our money, our laws and our borders and that's exactly what we will do"".

"Signs have gone up around Swansea and Gower beaches warning the public ""don't be a lobster"" to highlight the dangers of sitting out in the sun Beautiful beaches and a ""surf culture"" are two of the factors behind a rise in skin cancer rates in Wales, a leading oncologist has said. Prof John Wagstaff, director of the Wales Cancer Research Network, said Wales and Cornwall had two of the highest rates of the disease in the UK. The warning comes after seven people wereadmitted to hospital for sunburn. Figures show melanoma - a cancer caused by sunburn - is among the fastest-increasing cancers in Wales. There has been a 58.3% increase in incidence rates of melanoma from 2003-2005 to 2013-2015, the second biggest increase behind liver cancer, according to Public Health Wales. There are significant regional variances across Wales, with the melanoma rate in Cardiff and Vale 32% higher than the lowest rate in Hywel Dda. People are being advised to wear a high-factor suncream Wear protective clothing Use SPF 30+ sunscreen with at least four-star UVA protection Wear a wide-brimmed hat Wear quality sunglasses Seek shade from the sun whenever possible ""Generally, the further west you go the higher the incidence of melanoma,"" added Prof Wagstaff. ""Wales and Cornwall have the highest incidence in the UK. This is probably because there is more sunshine and a surf culture."" Prof Wagstaff explained there are two types of skin cancer: melanoma, which attacks pigment-containing cells, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) which is the most common. Prof John Wagstaff, director of the Wales Cancer Research Network ""Melanoma is the rarer of the two but is the most dangerous because it can spread around the bloodstream and lymph cells - it used to be a uniformly lethal condition,"" he said. ""It is caused by sunburn and the average age of people who have it is 53."" And while survival rates among people with melanoma have improved ""dramatically"" - from an average of just nine months to three years - the disease is still deadly, he added. Keep an eye on your moles, especially if they are exposed to the sun Gets bigger Changes shape Changes colour Bleeds or becomes crusty Is itchy or sore The problem of sunburn is getting worse in the UK but Prof Wagstaff said it was avoidable. ""In Australia, there has been a campaign for the last 25 years - on their beaches and in schools - telling people to keep their t-shirts on and put the sun block on. ""Incidence in Australia is falling quite dramatically while in the UK, incidence has doubled every 10 years for the last 40 years. ""Sunburn is a public health issue which hasn't been properly addressed."" Dr Aldridge treated Mr O'Brien's arm Caerphilly minibus driver Carl O'Brien was shocked to discover he had pre-cancerous cells on his arm in 2016 after visiting his GP for an unrelated matter. ""I nearly fell off my chair,"" he said. ""I knew nothing about it. ""As a driver I was more at risk - it is only the windscreen that protects you from the sun, not the side windows. ""Ever since I have worn a long-sleeve t-shirt while working. ""Wearing sun cream is a must, especially if you are fair - it is an absolute must."" And Mr O'Brien said he was living proof of the importance of keeping an eye on your skin and seeing your GP if you are worried.

"2018 Fifa World Cup quarter-final: Sweden v England Venue: Samara Arena Date: Saturday, 7 July Time: 15:00 BST Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button andiPlayer,BBC Sport websiteand app;listen on Radio 5 live; follow text updates online Millions of football fans are following the match between England and Sweden as they battle for a place in the World Cup semi-finals. The game - taking place in the Russian city of Samara - kicked off at 15:00 BST and can be followed across the BBC. England have not reached the last four of the tournament for 28 years and their sole World Cup win came in 1966. Before the match, manager Gareth Southgate said: ""We're improving and want to make history."" England are favourites to reach the last four from what is considered the easier side of the draw, with the winners of the match facing Russia or Croatia - who play later at 19:00 BST. Live updates: Sweden v England Analysis: 'England's golden chance to make giant leap forward' In Pictures: The nation watches big match 'Psychic' animals predict England v Sweden result How are you watching the game today? Email your pictures or video toyourpics@bbc.co.uk or use WhatsApp: +44 7555 173285 With the country basking in a heatwave, thousands of fans are watching the game on big screens at events up and down the country; barbecues have been prepared and pub gardens are experiencing bumper business. The climax of England's World Cup penalty shootout win over Colombia on Tuesday was seen by 23.6 million viewers on ITV. One England fan preparing a barbecue for the game had a shock this afternoon when his wife went into labour with their first child. ""The due date was nine days ago, but I was hoping she might be able to hold out until tomorrow,"" said Gaz, who married his wife Amy a year ago. ""I'm still hoping to catch the odd sneaky glance of the match from my phone. ""I wonder if my new daughter will be watching England in the semis with me."" Supermarkets could have seen a 5% uplift in grocery sales and 25% in alcohol as football fans stocked up on beer and barbecue food for the match. Tesco's the UK's largest retailer has predicted selling 3.5 million sausages this week along with four million burgers and three million punnets of strawberries. Asda, meanwhile, estimates a 1,966% rise in the sales of sausages, meatballs and barbecues compared with last week. British Airways says its website has seen a 700% increase in searches for flights to the host nation, Russia. England are in their first World Cup quarter-final for 12 years and are aiming to reach the semi-finals for the first-time since 1990. Sweden, the 1958 runners-up, last reached the quarter-finals in 1994 when they went on to finish third. England are the only side left in their side of the draw who have a won a World Cup before. Tuesday's victory over Colombia was England's first in a World Cup penalty shootout. England have scored nine goals already at this World Cup - the only time they have scored more is in 1966 when they won the tournament. This video can not be played The EastEnders cast cheer on England ahead of the match This video can not be played The last time England played Sweden at a World Cup Ashley Young, Kyle Walker and Dele Allie will start the game, having overcome minor injuries. Despite a groin injury, striker Jamie Vardy is fit enough to be named on the bench. Captain Harry Kane is aiming to become only the second Englishman after Lineker to win the Golden Boot for the World Cup's top scorer. He needs one goal to break Lineker's feat of scoring six times in 1986. ""My target isn't the Golden Boot,"" Kane told reporters. ""The target is to win the tournament. That's always been the target."" Sweden are 24th in Fifa's rankings - 12 places below England - and are without national hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic - who retired from international football two years ago. But they finished ahead of the Netherlands in qualifying, beat Italy in the subsequent play-offs and topped their group in Russia containing defending champions Germany. After Sweden's 1-0 win over Switzerland which sealed a spot in the last eight, coach Janne Andersson said: ""We're not satisfied with what we've done - we want to win the next match too."" The team had a rude awakening on Saturday when their hotel fire alarm went off first thing in the morning. Though there have been no suggestions of foul play, it follows an earlier incident in the tournament when police were called afterIran fans tried to stop the Portuguese team from sleepingby making noise outside their hotel. Matches 24: England won 8; drawn 9; lost 7. Team news and preview All you need to know about Sweden Belgium 'are the team to beat' Expectation levels among England fans were relatively low ahead of the tournament, after a series of previous disappointments including a humiliating knockout defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016. However, an early exit for defending champions Germany, as well as the shock departure of five-time victors Brazil on Friday, has boosted optimism in the England camp. In fact, it is the first time in history of the competition that none of Brazil, Germany or Argentina have made the semi-finals. Former England players including Rio Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ray Clemence and Peter Shilton tweeted their support on Saturday morning. Many supporters have been chanting, singing or simply declaring ""it's coming home"" in reference to theThree Lions songwritten for Euro 96 by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with the band the Lightning Seeds. Skinner has uploaded a video of himself dancing to the song with his shirt over his head. Former England captain David Beckham recorded a video in which he tells his followers: ""It's coming home."" But the feeling of optimism has not been shared by all. Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher has insisted, in his own colourful way, that football will not be returning home. The World Cup match is taking place on a busy sporting afternoon that also includes Wimbledon tennis, qualifying for Formula One's British Grand Prix at Silverstone and the first stage of cycling's Tour de France. Southgate and Colombia coach Jose Pekerman console Mateus Uribe after the penalty shootout defeat to England England manager Southgate has been winning fanswith his calm demeanour, sporting behaviour and a nice line in waistcoats. Retailer Marks & Spencer, which supplies the England team's official World Cup suit, reckons the Southgate effect has seen waistcoat sales rise 35%. Fans on social media have been sharing polite letters sent to them by Southgate - and the Twitter hashtag #GarethSouthgateWould was trending. #GarethSouthgateWould - Manager takes social media by storm Why some people won't be watching England v Sweden Southgate, 47, has said England must ""make the most"" of their World Cup opportunity, but warned against under-estimating an ""older, more experienced"" Sweden. ""You have to enjoy the good moments, but I am a long way from perfect, there are plenty of mistakes we have made while we have been here and we will make moving forward, so I think it is dangerous territory if we get carried away with things,"" said Southgate. That has not stopped England fans singing a tribute to the manager to the tune of Atomic Kitten's 2001 hit 'Whole Again': Looking back on when we first met, I cannot escape and I cannot forget, Southgate you're the one, you still turn me on, You can bring it home again! Southgate, who famously missed a penalty shootout against Germany in Euro '96, has welcomed the altered song: ""It's not as questionable as most of the lyrics that have been sung about me in the past,"" he quipped.

"Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol say goodbye as the US envoy departs for Japan North Korea has accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks. It branded the US attitude at the meeting as ""extremely troubling"". The statement, by an unnamed foreign ministry official, gave a starkly different account from one provided by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just hours before. He had said progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang. It is the first time he has visited North Korea since a summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The leader's meeting ended with a promise from Mr Kim to work towards denuclearisation, but details on how this will be achieved remain thin. North Korea crisis in 300 words Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments A key aim of Mr Pompeo during his visit was to firm up North Korea's commitment to disarmament. But the North Korean statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency, said the US had gone against the spirit of the summit by putting unilateral pressure on the country to abandon its nuclear weapons. ""We had anticipated the US side would come with a constructive idea, thinking we would take something in return,"" the North Korean statement said, warning its ""resolve for denuclearisation... may falter"". ""The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that [North Korea] would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset,"" it added. At the talks, Mr Pompeo did not meet with Mr Kim, but instead with Kim Yong-chol, who is seen as his right-hand man. In his assessment Mr Pompeo gave little away, but he said they had discussed at length a timeline for disarmament, including the destruction of a missile engine testing facility. ""These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues, some places a great deal of progress, other places there's still more work to be done,"" he said. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures After the Singapore summit, which also saw the US offer ""security guarantees"" to North Korea and promise to end its military drills with South Korea, Mr Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while US intelligence officials have said there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programmes. A state department spokesperson said Mr Pompeo had been ""very firm"" in focusing on denuclearisation, as well as on security assurances and another important US demand - the return of remains of US service personnel from the Korean War. As Saturday's meeting got under way Kim Yong-chol joked that Mr Pompeo may not have slept well during his overnight stay at a guesthouse in Pyongyang. Mr Pompeo said he ""slept just fine"". On Sunday, the US secretary of state will meet the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea in Tokyo. Win-win or a Kim win? Video, 00:02:20Win-win or a Kim win?

"Even the grandest of properties - like this one in Pendle - can be listed for less than Â£1m Tens of thousands of Â£1m-plus homes have been sold in the last 10 years - but in 16 areas of England and Wales no property topped the Â£1m mark. While one-bedroom flats can sell for millions in London, the most luxurious properties in areas from Gateshead to Gloucester cost less than Â£1m. A delve into Land Registry data by the BBC in May revealed thatsales of Â£1m-plus homes hit a new high last year. Fresh research shows where property has not collected a seven-figure sum. Stoke-on-Trent is famously a capital of ceramics but it is not the pottery, but the property, that is attracting some people here. In the window of estate agent Reeds Rains are a series of homes listed at between Â£80,000 and Â£120,000. Inside manager Martin Critchlow says that the relatively low prices attract investors, first-time buyers, and pensioners. Stoke-on-Trent - a home to pottery and low house prices ""We have people retiring to here from places like Kent, because they can get more for their money,"" he says. Buy-to-let investors, who typically make up about half of his clientele, are attracted by the relatively lack of boom and bust in the local market, alongside steady demand from tenants, he says. ""They are not going to find a goldmine, but they know the bottom is not going to fall out of the market,"" he says. Some properties in the area are let to students First-time buyers can also buy properties that their counterparts in some other parts of the country can only dream about. He tells of one recent example, when a buyer bought his first home - a three-bedroom detached with a garage - for Â£160,000. The 16 areas where transactions have never exceeded Â£1m since the start of 2007 are clustered primarily in the North West of England (seven), with three in Wales. These areas are not seeing top-end house prices, yet there is no absence of luxury among the properties currently for sale at less than Â£1m. For example, there is a five-bedroom detached home complete with games room, sauna, gym and wine cellar on the market for Â£950,000 in Worcester. This Worcester home is listed for less than Â£1m In Pendle, a gated five-bedroom home built in 1890 is for sale at an asking price of Â£875,000. Some of the original features remain, such as the servants' bells and oak panelling. While in Hyndburn, the owners are asking for slightly less for a 19th century four-bedroom farmhouse with 15 acres of land which houses 10 stables for horses. Previous research showed that, during the past decade, most Â£1m-plus properties were sold in London, but sales have doubled in the East of England - the biggest increase of any region in England and Wales. University cities such as Cambridge and Bristol saw Â£1m-plus sales surge. A total of 125,898 property sales have been completed in England and Wales for Â£1m or more since the start of 2007, the latest available transaction data from the Land Registry shows. The local authority with the most sales during that period was Westminster in London, with 12,917. You can see how many were sold in your area with this calculator. Inthere werehomes over Â£1m sold since 2007, with the most expensive sold for. If the postcode search does not load,click to launch the interactive content,external. The BBC data team analysed all residential transactions in England and Wales from the Land Registry price-paid dataset for the period from January 2007 to the latest data release at the end of June 2018. Property type classified as ""other"" in the Land Registry data was excluded, as the category could potentially contain properties that are not residential. All transactions over Â£1m (including those at exactly Â£1m) were mapped to local authorities using the latest Ordnance Survey's Codepoint Open mapping file from February 2018 that contains data for each postcode unit in England and Wales. Postcodes not found in the OS Codepoint Open mapping file were not counted as part of the analysis, as they could not be matched to a local authority.

"This video can not be played Floodwaters submerged homes and overturned cars over a wide area Flooding and landslides have killed at least 60 people and left dozens missing in western areas of Japan. Most of the deaths have occurred in Hiroshima prefecture, which has been hit by torrential rain since Thursday. Hundreds of homes have been damaged. About 1.5 million people have been ordered to leave their homes and three million more advised to do so. Authorities say it could potentially be the worst weather disaster Japan has seen in decades. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the authorities were facing a ""race against time"" to save and evacuate people. Thousands of police, firefighters and soldiers are taking part in search-and-rescue operations. Some of the victims have been buried alive by landslides, Japan's Kyodo news agency reports. In the town of Motoyama, about 600km (370 miles) west of the capital Tokyo, 583mm (23in) of rain fell between Friday morning and Saturday morning, Japan's meteorological agency said. More rain is expected over the next few days. Kyoto, about 300km to the east of Hiroshima, has also been hit by downpours.

"This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting Theresa May is seeking Conservative MPs' backing for the cabinet's proposal for UK-EU relations after Brexit. The plan was agreed by the prime minister's senior ministers at a 12-hour cabinet awayday on Friday. Mrs May said the plan ""will be good for the UK and good for the EU"". But there has been unhappiness among Tory Brexiteers, with Jacob Rees-Mogg telling the BBC that when the detail emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal. Mr Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said that so far onlythe three page summary of the deal,externalhad been published, and he would have to wait and see the full 100-plus page document to see whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""not convinced"" by the deal, and criticised ""leaving out services from trade arrangements in the future... I've got a feeling the whole thing might start to unravel in the next few days"". All Conservative backbench MPs were invited to a briefing with the party's chief whip Julian Smith in Downing Street on Saturday, with about 40 thought to have attended. This video can not be played Nigel Evans: Plan guarantees red lines The message from those leaving the briefing, such as Tory MP Nigel Evans, was that the proposal was for a ""pragmatic"" Brexit delivering on the big referendum issues of sovereignty, immigration and the national finances without harming the ability to trade quickly and freely with the EU. Mr Evans said Mrs May would make a statement to Parliament about the plan on Monday and also address a meeting of all Conservative backbench MPs. The plan that ministers signed up to on Friday aims to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"". It also supports what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"" for the UK and EU. Laura Kuenssberg analysis: The deal is done At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Brexit jargon explained BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister had ""picked a side"" by opting for a closer relationship with the EU than many colleagues desired - and she now had to sell it to her party and the other European leaders. No 10, she added, hoped the new commitments would unlock the next phase of talks with the rest of the EU but it was not yet clear how many, or what kind, of objections had been raised within the cabinet. Downing Street said the proposals marked a ""substantial evolution"" in the UK's position and would resolve outstanding concerns about the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. ""This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU, and I look forward to it being received positively,"" Mrs May told the BBC. One pro-Brexit cabinet minister told the BBC there was ""no point"" pushing for a vote as ""we were well and truly outnumbered by 20 to seven"". The UK said it now wanted to accelerate the negotiations in an effort to secure an agreement by October, but also warned it will step up preparations for leaving on 29 March 2019 without a deal. EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who earlier suggested the EU would be willing to shift its position if the UK relaxed some of its ""red lines"", tweeted to say the plans would be assessed to see if they were ""workable and realistic"".

The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The prime minister had gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to try to resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details of theChequers statement,externalare as follows: The UK would accept continuing ""harmonisation"" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade Parliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so There will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater ""regulatory flexibility"" and ""strong reciprocal arrangements"" Freedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work A new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of ""a combined customs territory"" The UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules are in force Mrs May said this was an ""important step"" in the process of negotiating the UK's smooth exit from the EU. ""Of course we still have work to do with the EU in ensuring that we get to that end point in October. But this is good we have come today, following our detailed discussions, to a positive future for the UK,"" she said. She said the proposals, to be formally published in a white paper next week, would give the UK the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries while maintaining regulatory, environmental and consumer standards. This video can not be played Brexit: How will remainers and leavers react to cabinet customs agreement? In a letter sent to all Conservative MPs, she said she had allowed colleagues to express their views while policy was developed but ""agreement on this proposal marks the point where this is no longer the case and collective responsibility is fully restored"". There is no mention in the document of eitherthe single market or the customs union, which the UK has committed to leave after the end of a transition period in December 2020. Under plans for a free trade zone, the UK would be committed legally to following EU law for a large part of the economy, including manufacturing and farming. While Parliament would retain the right to diverge from EU regulations in these areas, the document makes clear that ""choosing not to pass the relevant legislation would have consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border"". Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt and David Davis among those listening to Theresa May The document also commits the government to step up preparedness for a no-deal scenario, as one of a range of possible outcomes, ""given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations"". The CBI employers group welcomed the proposals for a free trade area in goods which it said would provide a ""confidence boost"" to business. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was ""encouraging"" to see an agreed negotiating position from government. But FSB chairman Mike Cherry warned: ""The reaction from the rest of the EU is crucial for there to be concrete progress when negotiations restart in just over a week's time. The clock is ticking."" Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said there was ""a danger that this is a lowest common denominator plan"" designed to hold the cabinet together, rather than ""secure the strong negotiating position that we need with the EU"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Once upon a time we were told 'Brexit means Brexit', now we are told it means maintaining a common rulebook for all goods, a joint institutional framework for interpreting the agreement and the UK and EU forming this combined customs territory. ""That looks very much like regulatory alignment, the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and half a customs union to me."" Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement was ""hopefully a step forward"". But the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called the agreement ""a fudge"", adding: ""There might be agreement, for now, in the cabinet. The EU will not buy this."" Nigel Dodds, for the Democratic Unionist Party, said:  ""The government's commitment at Chequers to the political and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom with no borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is a welcome reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us."" Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it could be the case that ""Brexiteers have signed up to it knowing perfectly well that it is not going to pass the European Union and they'll then be able to blame Europe for the fact that it won't work"". Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said: ""This latest proposal continues to cherry pick certain aspects of EU membership in a way that the EU's negotiators have made perfectly clear is unacceptable. More fudge means yet more uncertainty and yet more damage to our economy."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who backed Brexit in the referendum, said the deal would end free movement of people and would end the remit of the European Court of Justice in the UK - saying that UK judges always pay regards to other countries' courts, such as Canada or Hong Kong. He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that the cabinet had agreed to step up preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal. Fellow cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also tweeted her backing for the deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave said it would represent a ""bad deal for the UK"" which would ""only slide further as the EU takes more and more"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan amounted to a ""sell-out to global corporates"" and would do nothing for the 90% of British firms which do not export to Europe. Veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Sir Bill Cash said he was ""deeply disappointed to say the least"" about the plans, which he suggested could contradict the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act passed by MPs last month.

England have not reached the last four of the tournament for 28 years and their sole World Cup win came in 1966. Before the match, manager Gareth Southgate said: ""We're improving and want to make history.""

One England fan preparing a barbecue for the game had a shock this afternoon when his wife went into labour with their first child. ""The due date was nine days ago, but I was hoping she might be able to hold out until tomorrow,"" said Gaz, who married his wife Amy a year ago. ""I'm still hoping to catch the odd sneaky glance of the match from my phone. ""I wonder if my new daughter will be watching England in the semis with me.""

In fact, it is the first time in history of the competition that none of Brazil, Germany or Argentina have made the semi-finals. Former England players including Rio Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ray Clemence and Peter Shilton tweeted their support on Saturday morning. Many supporters have been chanting, singing or simply declaring ""it's coming home"" in reference to theThree Lions songwritten for Euro 96 by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with the band the Lightning Seeds.

"Some homes are without water on what is expected to be one of the hottest days of the year Cars were left submerged and homes cut off when a burst water main flooded streets in part of Birmingham. About 100 homes were affected around Wheeler Street in Newtown, West Midlands Fire Service said. At least one person and their dog were rescued from their home by boat. Supplier Severn Trent Water said the burst involved ""one of its biggest pipes"" and it would take a while to reconnect those homes now without water. The road has been badly damaged and people are asked to avoid the area. Water rescue teams checked vehicles caught in floods Engineers are on site and have isolated the burst pipe, Severn Trent said. Area operations manager Paul Baldwin said it was one of the largest trunk water mains in the city and was deep, making it ""complex"" to repair. Police drones have been brought in to help assess the extent of the damage This video can not be played Burst water main floods homes and wrecks road He said it was difficult to say how long repairs to the badly damaged road surface would take. Severn Trent has apologised to anyone affected and said the ""majority"" of customers had been reconnected. Teams have been assessing the damage caused to the road Staff were also delivering bottled water to those considered the most vulnerable. The firm said the pipe involved was 30in in diameter (76cm). An investigation into the cause of the burst would begin once supplies were fully restored.

"As the nation gears up for the next instalment of World Cup excitement, ""psychic"" animals across England have been making predictions for the quarter-final against Sweden. We haven't got Three Lions but even so there's quite a menagerie of mystics - so are they expecting England to triumph, a disappointing exit, or even the tension of penalties again? This video can not be played Although Phoenix ate from both bowls, he went back to England for seconds Rescue cat Phoenix from Cats Protection predicted all the England group games under his twitter hashtag#PawsomePredictor,external. The 11-year-old tabby previously suffered a ruptured cruciate ligament - a common footballing injury - suggesting he might be the cat for the job. ""Phoenix may have had mixed results with his predictions so far, but he's proved to be a real hit with our supporters,"" said his owner Cat Jarvis. ""He seems to be quite the patriot, having predicted all wins for England, so here's hoping our team continues to do well."" Though Phoenix didwrongly plump for Uruguay to beat France,externalon Friday... The meerkats are convinced England will take another step towards the final The mystic meerkats atDrayton Manor Park,externalin Staffordshire used their dribbling skill to also predict an England win. In its rather elaborate method of seeing into the future, the zoo set up two goals bearing the opposing teams' flags, with a draw post in the middle. The meerkats played with meal worms in enrichments balls, and they have already made 10 successful predictions. ""They have thoroughly enjoyed the animal enrichment, their moment in the spotlight and the extra public attention,"" said Chris Mitchell, head of zoo operations. ''We can't help but wonder if our meerkat mob might be England's lucky charm this year?"" Leaf cutter ants at Cannon Hall Farm in Barnsley, South Yorkshire Even leaf cutter ants at Cannon Hall Farm in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, are confident England will progress. Tiny versions of a St George's Cross and the Swedish flag were placed for the insects to grab and take back to their nest. And the insects grabbed the red and white one first, confidently forecasting a Swedish defeat on Saturday. Could this be a good omen for the quarter-final at the Samara Arena? This video can not be played Barley the goat predicts England v Sweden result A milking goat from St Werburghs City Farm in Bristol is yet another animal to predict an England win against Sweden. Barley has never displayed any psychic talent before but volunteer Alex Bowsher said he was ""sure she has it in her"". ""She's a ravenous girl on all occasions,"" he added. Barley was released into a pen containing two buckets of feed, and almost headed for the bucket marked Sweden, before changing her mind. Pablo is unwavering in his belief that football's coming home Pablo the gentoo penguin and his colony at Birmingham's Sealife Centre have predicted all England's victories so far. And once again they have no doubts Gareth Southgate's men will triumph (are we sensing a pattern here?) Flags have been attached to rocks in the birds' enclosure and they make their predictions by which one they chose to huddle on or around.

"When Gareth Southgate was first put in charge of the England team, one national newspaper described the public reaction as a ""mass wail of despair"". After thedebacle of losing to Iceland at Euro 2016and the embarrassment ofSam Allardyce's tenure,England had turned to what looked to be the safe, corporate option. Not only that, Southgate's only previous senior managerial experience involved taking Middlesbrough down from the Premier League, then getting sacked. But he has barely put a foot wrong as he prepares to lead his country into Saturday's World Cup quarter-final with Sweden. Qualification for Russia was achieved without alarm, the end of Wayne Rooney's international career was handled with kid gloves, and he has even guided England to a penalty shootout win. Clear-thinking, straight-talking and appearing to be a thoroughly decent bloke, Southgate has somehow got England to a World Cup quarter-final with optimism and realism in equal measure. Here, the people who know him best speak of the real Southgate. From being advised to become a travel agent, to throwing up over the Crystal Palace chairman, Euro '96 and beyond. Listen to the BBC Radio 5 live special on Gareth Southgate Southgate, a boyhood Manchester United fan, attended Pound Hill Junior School and Hazelwick School, both in Crawley, Sussex. He has said both schools were ""fundamental"" in him taking up football, largely because of his PE teachers.Dave Palmertaught Southgate at Hazelwick. He was very self-assured. I remember the last chat I had with him as a schoolboy. We were talking about the future and I was asking the boys what they would be doing the following year. Gareth said ""I'm at Crystal Palace"" and it dawned on me that was what he would be doing. As a 16-year-old, he was talking with absolute certainty. In those days, 60-odd boys used to turn up for football trials when they joined the school. He stood out straight away because he was so classy and had so much time. He used to glide around the pitch. He was a multi-talented sportsman. He played rugby for the school, to the extent that when we went on a football and rugby tour to France, Gareth played both sports. He was quite quick, 200m was his best track event, but he also won the county championship and held the school record in the triple jump. He was mature, had a good a sense of humour and a big smile. He was respected by his peers and teachers. He was very thoughtful and clever, as well as having a sharp wit. He set himself him high expectations in everything he did, either in the classroom or on the sports field. There's always a discussion when someone has so many different talents about where they take their life. He could have taken an academic route, or a sporting route. So many boys I've known have had high hopes in football, but there's never any certainty. Gareth was sure he was on the right path. Southgate (right) made his league debut for Crystal Palace in 1991 and captained them to promotion from Division One in 1994 Southgate was released by Southampton as a youngster. He came to the attention of Palace youth-team managerAlan Smith, who would later make him captain of the first team. Even after they both left Palace, Southgate and Smith remained close. Southgate visited Smith within 24 hours of missing his Euro '96 penalty and later, when manager of Middlesbrough, took Smith to Teesside as an advisor. I had a doubt whether or not he had a career in professional football in him. We had one particular game, which we lost, and I called him into the office and said: ""Gareth, I think you're too bright to do this job. I think you have to make a choice. If it was my choice, I think you should become a travel agent."" He was upset, but he took it on board. Instead of releasing him, I decided to go the other way and made him captain of the youth team, because I thought he had leadership qualities. Not because of what he said, but the way he went about his job. I introduced him to an estate agent friend of mine that got him to do some work after training. He was measuring up, mundane stuff, looking to see if a property could be marketed or not. All of these things help build the character that you become. It opened his eyes to what was out there and showed him what is was like to deal with people outside football. I was there when he threw up over the chairman, Ron Noades. It was a trip abroad and I had let the lads out for one night. Ron had his white shoes on and Gareth managed to do it. I heard plenty about it from Ron the next day. I can't repeat what Ron's words were, but I do know Gareth was very apologetic. No-one can say he has had it easy. He has had to fight for everything he has got, even if he did come from a middle-class Crawley background. To miss the penalty at Euro 1996, to be sacked by Middlesbrough, these are things that chip away from you. They have made him a stronger character. I know he went for one manager's job many years ago and he didn't get it because he was told he was too polite. He has principles. That does put him slightly aside from others. He has a real loyalty. He hasn't forgotten his roots. These are all things that make up his DNA that have led him to the England job. Southgate missed England's sixth penalty in the Euro '96 semi-final shootout against Germany Southgate played every minute of England's Euro '96 campaign, which ended with his penalty miss against Germany. When he became England manager, he said he did not think he would ever have to go through a worse experience.Alan Shearerwas part of the England team that night at Wembley. Not long ago, I made a documentary about Euro '96 and I asked Gareth if I could speak to him. He politely declined because he knew that one thing we wanted to talk about was the penalty miss and he'd had enough of it. Still to this day it will be hurting him. He took a penalty because he's brave. The manager was looking around for characters and one or two put their heads down, not wanting to take a penalty. That wasn't Gareth. After the five designated penalty takers were allotted, the manager was asking 'who's after that?' and Gareth stuck his hand up. I would never criticise anyone that has the courage, the balls, to put his hand up to take a penalty, particularly in those circumstances. When you have 90,000 in the stadium, 10 or 15 million watching on TV, it takes a certain character to put his hand up to take a penalty. There was nothing that I or anyone else could say to make him feel any better. Two years later we were at France '98. Tournaments can be a bit boring, doing the same thing for four or five weeks. We came up with the idea to fit as many song titles as possible into the interviews that we gave. Because the players' room was next door to the TV room and the interviews were going out live, once we got the song title in, you could hear a roar when the players realised you'd done it. Gareth managed to sneak Club Tropicana and Careless Whispers into an interview with Bob Wilson. He was definitely one of the brighter ones, so he was better at that than most. He was certainly better at song titles than he was at taking penalties. Gareth Southgate started 16 of Sven-Goran Eriksson's 67 matches in charge of the England team Southgate had caught the eye ofSven-Goran Erikssonwhen the Swede was manager of Lazio. When Eriksson became England manager in 2001, he had to manage Southgate's disappointment at falling behind the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell. Southgate was part of the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but did not play a single minute. He won the last of his 57 caps against Sweden in 2004, two years before the end of Eriksson's spell in charge. He came to me and asked for a meeting. He wanted to know how to make himself better. That's not easy, to keep working, on and on to make yourself better than players like Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand. It's a little unusual. In my experience, players don't come to the manager. He wants to resolve problems with talks, more than with shouting. It was easy to speak to him. He was never angry or irritated, he was always very polite. I could see that he was a thinking man. He thought about the training we did, why we did something in a certain way. You could see that he lived for football. He was very eager to learn and I wouldn't be surprised if at that time he was thinking of being a manager in the future. I have had many players who are not interested who the opponent is, they just want to play, but he was never the sort of player that did his training, then left without thinking about it. I'm quite sure he took it home with him. When you have players like that, you can see in the future they will be coaches or managers. When he was a player, he was already like a manager, a coach. I'm sure that Southgate, in the past, has talked to a lot of managers with a lot of experience, trying to find out secrets and advice. He is a good talker, but an even better listener. Southgate was Boro manager from 2006 to 2009 Southgate ended his playing career to become Middlesbrough manager in the summer of 2006. At 35, he was the youngest manager in the Premier League. He guided Boro to 12th and 13th over the following two seasons, but presided over their relegation in 2009. He was sacked on 21 October 2009, despite the club lying fourth in the Championship.Michael Caulfieldwas the Boro psychologist from soon after Southgate was appointed until they were relegated from the top flight. When he was still playing, his Boro team-mates nicknamed him 'Insurance'. George Boateng said whatever happened up the field, they knew they had Gareth behind them, ready to be used if needed, like an insurance policy. He went from being a player in the May to the manager in June, so the dynamic had to change. He understood he couldn't be their best mate, but the players knew he was of good character and he would treat them right. One day, I took him to see some cricket - Durham v Sussex in Chester-le-Street. It was a low-scoring game and we sat in the Sussex dressing room, watching their batsmen waiting to go in. He turned to me and said: ""I admire these athletes, because they have too much thinking time. How must it feel to watch wickets fall, knowing that you're next? That is so different to what footballers have to do."" He spoke to them, wanting to know how they coped with it. He never stopped asking questions, trying to learn. Not once did he talk about himself. Gareth is brave. Not the physical bravery of leading your country into war, but the kind that means he will always front up. In our last home game of the 2008-09 season, we had to beat Aston Villa otherwise it was pretty certain that we'd go down. We only drew 1-1. When the final whistle was greeted with boos and jeers, a lot of managers would have shaken hands then disappeared down the tunnel. Gareth marched into the centre circle to applaud the fans. Even though he wasn't being well received, he made sure he turned to all four corners of the ground. It was fight or flight and he never looked back. Southgate appointed Steve Holland as his assistant as soon as he became England manager Southgate replaced Allardyce after one game of England's World Cup qualifying campaign in the autumn of 2016. They secured their place in Russia in October 2017 with a game to spare but then changed their system. Assistant managerSteve Hollandhas been with Southgate throughout his tenure as England boss. One of the things he identified on taking the job was there was an issue on the back of the Iceland defeat and previous tournaments. I'd be fair in saying the sum of the mass didn't quite balance with what it delivered. Why was that? Was it handling a pressure situation that left the players not delivering what they do for their clubs? He has gone about trying to change that. We have a link with the Marines that is beyond climbing up trees and running through mud, but how these guys drop into other countries in the middle of the night and handle the pressure of if they are one step out of the plan, they get shot. They know what really is pressure, how to handle that, and we have learned from that. In terms of watching England players in club football, I'm sure England staff in the past have been 100% committed, but it's impossible that any of them have watched more matches than we have done this year. The same is possible, maybe, but not more. If there's an early kick-off and a late on Saturday, we'll do two games. Regularly, there's Tuesday and Wednesday in the Champions League, then Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Every Monday morning, after a weekend of fixtures, we'll meet to discuss the games that we've watched. We went to the Confederations Cup in the summer of 2017 and had the chance to discuss how England had been playing. We'd played a 4-2-3-1 formation in qualifying. We watched potential opponents - Germany played 3-4-3. We were looking at the opposition, trying to imagine where our team stood up against them. We made some decisions that we felt would take the team to the next phase. We still had to qualify, so we didn't want to bring those changes in too early. Once we qualified, we had a game to spare, and we used that game to play with three centre-halves. That is what we have done ever since.

The game - taking place in the Russian city of Samara - kicked off at 15:00 BST and can be followed across the BBC. England have not reached the last four of the tournament for 28 years and their sole World Cup win came in 1966. Before the match, manager Gareth Southgate said: ""We're improving and want to make history."" England are favourites to reach the last four from what is considered the easier side of the draw, with the winners of the match facing Russia or Croatia - who play later at 19:00 BST.

Email your pictures or video toyourpics@bbc.co.uk or use WhatsApp: +44 7555 173285 With the country basking in a heatwave, thousands of fans are watching the game on big screens at events up and down the country; barbecues have been prepared and pub gardens are experiencing bumper business. The climax of England's World Cup penalty shootout win over Colombia on Tuesday was seen by 23.6 million viewers on ITV. One England fan preparing a barbecue for the game had a shock this afternoon when his wife went into labour with their first child. ""The due date was nine days ago, but I was hoping she might be able to hold out until tomorrow,"" said Gaz, who married his wife Amy a year ago. ""I'm still hoping to catch the odd sneaky glance of the match from my phone. ""I wonder if my new daughter will be watching England in the semis with me."" Supermarkets could have seen a 5% uplift in grocery sales and 25% in alcohol as football fans stocked up on beer and barbecue food for the match. Tesco's the UK's largest retailer has predicted selling 3.5 million sausages this week along with four million burgers and three million punnets of strawberries. Asda, meanwhile, estimates a 1,966% rise in the sales of sausages, meatballs and barbecues compared with last week. British Airways says its website has seen a 700% increase in searches for flights to the host nation, Russia. England are in their first World Cup quarter-final for 12 years and are aiming to reach the semi-finals for the first-time since 1990. Sweden, the 1958 runners-up, last reached the quarter-finals in 1994 when they went on to finish third. England are the only side left in their side of the draw who have a won a World Cup before. Tuesday's victory over Colombia was England's first in a World Cup penalty shootout. England have scored nine goals already at this World Cup - the only time they have scored more is in 1966 when they won the tournament. This video can not be played The EastEnders cast cheer on England ahead of the match This video can not be played The last time England played Sweden at a World Cup Ashley Young, Kyle Walker and Dele Allie will start the game, having overcome minor injuries. Despite a groin injury, striker Jamie Vardy is fit enough to be named on the bench. Captain Harry Kane is aiming to become only the second Englishman after Lineker to win the Golden Boot for the World Cup's top scorer. He needs one goal to break Lineker's feat of scoring six times in 1986. ""My target isn't the Golden Boot,"" Kane told reporters. ""The target is to win the tournament. That's always been the target."" Sweden are 24th in Fifa's rankings - 12 places below England - and are without national hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic - who retired from international football two years ago. But they finished ahead of the Netherlands in qualifying, beat Italy in the subsequent play-offs and topped their group in Russia containing defending champions Germany. After Sweden's 1-0 win over Switzerland which sealed a spot in the last eight, coach Janne Andersson said: ""We're not satisfied with what we've done - we want to win the next match too."" The team had a rude awakening on Saturday when their hotel fire alarm went off first thing in the morning. Though there have been no suggestions of foul play, it follows an earlier incident in the tournament when police were called afterIran fans tried to stop the Portuguese team from sleepingby making noise outside their hotel. Matches 24: England won 8; drawn 9; lost 7. Team news and preview All you need to know about Sweden Belgium 'are the team to beat' Expectation levels among England fans were relatively low ahead of the tournament, after a series of previous disappointments including a humiliating knockout defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016. However, an early exit for defending champions Germany, as well as the shock departure of five-time victors Brazil on Friday, has boosted optimism in the England camp. In fact, it is the first time in history of the competition that none of Brazil, Germany or Argentina have made the semi-finals. Former England players including Rio Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ray Clemence and Peter Shilton tweeted their support on Saturday morning. Many supporters have been chanting, singing or simply declaring ""it's coming home"" in reference to theThree Lions songwritten for Euro 96 by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with the band the Lightning Seeds. Skinner has uploaded a video of himself dancing to the song with his shirt over his head. Former England captain David Beckham recorded a video in which he tells his followers: ""It's coming home."" But the feeling of optimism has not been shared by all. Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher has insisted, in his own colourful way, that football will not be returning home. The World Cup match is taking place on a busy sporting afternoon that also includes Wimbledon tennis, qualifying for Formula One's British Grand Prix at Silverstone and the first stage of cycling's Tour de France. Southgate and Colombia coach Jose Pekerman console Mateus Uribe after the penalty shootout defeat to England England manager Southgate has been winning fanswith his calm demeanour, sporting behaviour and a nice line in waistcoats. Retailer Marks & Spencer, which supplies the England team's official World Cup suit, reckons the Southgate effect has seen waistcoat sales rise 35%. Fans on social media have been sharing polite letters sent to them by Southgate - and the Twitter hashtag #GarethSouthgateWould was trending. #GarethSouthgateWould - Manager takes social media by storm Why some people won't be watching England v Sweden Southgate, 47, has said England must ""make the most"" of their World Cup opportunity, but warned against under-estimating an ""older, more experienced"" Sweden. ""You have to enjoy the good moments, but I am a long way from perfect, there are plenty of mistakes we have made while we have been here and we will make moving forward, so I think it is dangerous territory if we get carried away with things,"" said Southgate. That has not stopped England fans singing a tribute to the manager to the tune of Atomic Kitten's 2001 hit 'Whole Again': Looking back on when we first met, I cannot escape and I cannot forget, Southgate you're the one, you still turn me on, You can bring it home again! Southgate, who famously missed a penalty shootout against Germany in Euro '96, has welcomed the altered song: ""It's not as questionable as most of the lyrics that have been sung about me in the past,"" he quipped.

"Even the grandest of properties - like this one in Pendle - can be listed for less than Â£1m Tens of thousands of Â£1m-plus homes have been sold in the last 10 years - but in 16 areas of England and Wales no property topped the Â£1m mark. While one-bedroom flats can sell for millions in London, the most luxurious properties in areas from Gateshead to Gloucester cost less than Â£1m. A delve into Land Registry data by the BBC in May revealed thatsales of Â£1m-plus homes hit a new high last year. Fresh research shows where property has not collected a seven-figure sum. Stoke-on-Trent is famously a capital of ceramics but it is not the pottery, but the property, that is attracting some people here. In the window of estate agent Reeds Rains are a series of homes listed at between Â£80,000 and Â£120,000. Inside manager Martin Critchlow says that the relatively low prices attract investors, first-time buyers, and pensioners. Stoke-on-Trent - a home to pottery and low house prices ""We have people retiring to here from places like Kent, because they can get more for their money,"" he says. Buy-to-let investors, who typically make up about half of his clientele, are attracted by the relatively lack of boom and bust in the local market, alongside steady demand from tenants, he says. ""They are not going to find a goldmine, but they know the bottom is not going to fall out of the market,"" he says. Some properties in the area are let to students First-time buyers can also buy properties that their counterparts in some other parts of the country can only dream about. He tells of one recent example, when a buyer bought his first home - a three-bedroom detached with a garage - for Â£160,000. The 16 areas where transactions have never exceeded Â£1m since the start of 2007 are clustered primarily in the North West of England (seven), with three in Wales. These areas are not seeing top-end house prices, yet there is no absence of luxury among the properties currently for sale at less than Â£1m. For example, there is a five-bedroom detached home complete with games room, sauna, gym and wine cellar on the market for Â£950,000 in Worcester.

She wrote that it was ""an undeniably difficult watch"", especially where the actors and victims' families shared the screen.

"A senior Scotland Yard officer is being investigated for allegedly breaking rules about honours nominations. Temporary Chief Superintendent Parm Sandhu has been served with a ""gross misconduct"" investigation notice, meaning she could potentially face a serious disciplinary charge. In some cases, such a charge can lead to dismissal. The officer, who's been placed on restricted duties, has declined to comment on the allegation. Two other Metropolitan Police officers are also under investigation. BBC News understands the inquiry is focusing on whether Ms Sandhu encouraged colleagues to support her nomination for a Queen's Police Medal (QPM). The QPM, which was introduced in 1954, is awarded twice a year in the Queen's Birthday and New Year Lists. The medals are given to serving police officers in the UK in recognition of distinguished service or outstanding courage in the line of duty. In this year's New Year's honours, 18 officers were awarded the QPM, the same number awarded to officers in the birthday list last month. National Police Chief Council guidelines say that ""any person can nominate any other person for an honour"". However, as with other honours, people are not expected to nominate themselves and are not meant to contribute to or know about the process. The Inspectorate of Constabulary coordinates the process for those of superintendent rank and below, with applications considered by the Home Office before going to the honours committee, along with recommendations for knighthoods, MBEs and other awards. The internal Met investigation is examining an allegation that Ms Sandhu may have contacted other officers with a summary of information to support her QPM nomination. The inquiry is at an early stage and no disciplinary action has been taken so far. However, the officer has been notified that the investigation is looking at alleged ""gross misconduct"", which, if proven could lead to dismissal. Ms Sandhu, who joined the police in 1989, rose through the ranks to become borough commander in Richmond-upon-Thames. She is one of the most senior ethnic minority officers in the Met and in 2006 received an Asian Women of Achievement award, largely for her work in reassuring the community in the aftermath of the 7 July terrorist attacks on London's transport system. Last month she tweeted that she ""will be promoted to Ch Supt"" in the Metropolitan Police, adding: ""I will be the first woman of colour to hold this rank."" She is being supported through the investigation by representatives of the Police Superintendents' Association. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ""The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) is investigating the conduct of three officers following an allegation that they breached guidelines relating to the UK honours nomination process. ""A temporary chief superintendent currently attached to human resources was served with a gross misconduct notice on Wednesday 27 June and has been placed on restricted duties. ""Two other officers - a detective superintendent and an inspector, both from frontline policing - were served with misconduct notices on Wednesday 27 June. They remain on full duties. Enquiries continue.""

"On 27 January 1991, Whitney Houston stood on a small stage in Tampa, Florida, waiting for her cue. It was early evening. The pop superstar was wearing a baggy white tracksuit with a red stripe, a pair of Nike sneakers and a white headband. The outfit was the epitome of 1980s exercise-video chic. In front of her was a single microphone on a stand: behind her, the Florida Orchestra. The occasion was Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo Bills versus the New York Giants. The stadium was packed. Tens of millions of television sets were tuned in across the USA. ""The Voice"", as Houston had become known, was about to launch the sporting festivities by singing The Star-Spangled Banner. Emotions were running high. America was at war in the Gulf. The country needed and wanted to be brought together, to unite behind its national anthem. Whitney Houston sang The Star-Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl XXV, in January 1991 As gigs go, it was massive. The sort of event one would imagine a performer rehearsing for all day, every day, for weeks if not months. No doubt Whitney Houston would have done just that had Gareth Southgate been her manager. He wasn't. Whitney Houston was managed by her father, who, as it happens, was also partial to a waistcoat, but was otherwise not - shall we say - cut from the same cloth as the current England football manager. John Houston with his daughter Whitney in 1991 Mr Houston allowed his daughter to prepare as she pleased. And what pleased her was not to prepare. Even though she was about to try something she had never done before in front of an expectant nation. At her request, Rickey Minor, her musical director between 1989-1999, changed the anthem's metre from a 3 /4 metre waltz, to a 4 /4. This was to give an extra beat for each measure to allow her the freedom to hold some notes longer so she could add some gospel soul to the militaristic number. According to Minor, she listened to the music only once in his studio. Her eyes were closed and mouth shut. ""All right, I got it,"" she told him when the music finished. And that was it. As Rickey Minor says in Kevin Macdonald's feature documentary Whitney, when Houston started to sing that evening in 1991: ""What the world heard was her first take."" It was a good one. She knocked it out of the park. Her performance was one of the most memorable renditions of America's national anthem ever heard. It was not the apogee of her career - The Bodyguard and its associated megahit ballad I Will Always Love You was still a few years away - but it was certainly one of her career highpoints. The Super Bowl episode is the highpoint of Macdonald's film, which, for the usually excellent Oscar-winning filmmaker, is a slightly disappointingly run-of-the-mill affair with a misjudged and overly censorious ending. Director of photography, Nelson Hume [L] worked with director Kevin Macdonald [R] on the film He gets full marks for access, though. The film is awash with rare archive footage, chatty family members, and a decent range of colleagues who were central characters in her story. Whitney (L) sang in church from a young age Some of the old video clips are a treat to see. We get to watch a very young, precocious Whitney leading the singing in her local church, and then - just a few years later - blowing the minds of the audience with her sensational first professional performance. It is all very watchable. Macdonald has seamlessly knitted together domestic footage, contextualising archive news-reels, and his own down-the-barrel interviews with great expertise. The tone throughout has an understandably dark hue; we know the story doesn't end well: it is an inescapable fact, which therefore has to inform every facet of the portrait. The problem with the film is it lacks an incisive editorial line to make it more than a bunch of well edited clips and talking heads telling us what we already know with added - and often extraneous  - gossipy snippets (the singer liked sex, for example). There is too much focus on Whitney the personality and not enough on Whitney the artist. It feels like a missed opportunity, particularly as the interrogation of her personal life leads to a series of dead ends. Bobby Brown and Whitney went on their honeymoon in 1992 Her ex-husband Bobby Brown refused to talk about what happened to precipitate her tragic descent into a living hell of drug addiction and professional self-destruction. Cissy Houston, Whitney's mother, sitting in the church where the star sang Her mother, Cissy, says next to nothing about anything, a taciturn approach also adopted by Clive Davis, the man who signed Whitney to his record label and had a front row seat in the spectacle that was her rise and fall. There are also several no-shows of key protagonists. Robyn Crawford, the singer's great friend, companion, and long-time associate, is conspicuous by her absence. So is Dionne Warwick, the world famous cousin with whom Whitney sang, and whose sister Dee Dee, we are told, allegedly sexually abused her when she was a child.  (Dee Dee Warwick died in 2008, and so can't respond to the claims.) This is a revelation towards which the film builds as the mood darkens markedly in its second hour. Fine. But the way in which it is done is heavy-handed, the conclusions it appears to draw, simplistic. And yet, as you will discover if you watch this film, there was absolutely nothing simple about Whitney Houston.

"On 27 January 1991, Whitney Houston stood on a small stage in Tampa, Florida, waiting for her cue. It was early evening. The pop superstar was wearing a baggy white tracksuit with a red stripe, a pair of Nike sneakers and a white headband. The outfit was the epitome of 1980s exercise-video chic. In front of her was a single microphone on a stand: behind her, the Florida Orchestra. The occasion was Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo Bills versus the New York Giants. The stadium was packed. Tens of millions of television sets were tuned in across the USA. ""The Voice"", as Houston had become known, was about to launch the sporting festivities by singing The Star-Spangled Banner. Emotions were running high. America was at war in the Gulf. The country needed and wanted to be brought together, to unite behind its national anthem. Whitney Houston sang The Star-Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl XXV, in January 1991 As gigs go, it was massive. The sort of event one would imagine a performer rehearsing for all day, every day, for weeks if not months. No doubt Whitney Houston would have done just that had Gareth Southgate been her manager. He wasn't. Whitney Houston was managed by her father, who, as it happens, was also partial to a waistcoat, but was otherwise not - shall we say - cut from the same cloth as the current England football manager. John Houston with his daughter Whitney in 1991 Mr Houston allowed his daughter to prepare as she pleased. And what pleased her was not to prepare. Even though she was about to try something she had never done before in front of an expectant nation. At her request, Rickey Minor, her musical director between 1989-1999, changed the anthem's metre from a 3 /4 metre waltz, to a 4 /4. This was to give an extra beat for each measure to allow her the freedom to hold some notes longer so she could add some gospel soul to the militaristic number. According to Minor, she listened to the music only once in his studio. Her eyes were closed and mouth shut. ""All right, I got it,"" she told him when the music finished. And that was it. As Rickey Minor says in Kevin Macdonald's feature documentary Whitney, when Houston started to sing that evening in 1991: ""What the world heard was her first take."" It was a good one. She knocked it out of the park. Her performance was one of the most memorable renditions of America's national anthem ever heard. It was not the apogee of her career - The Bodyguard and its associated megahit ballad I Will Always Love You was still a few years away - but it was certainly one of her career highpoints. The Super Bowl episode is the highpoint of Macdonald's film, which, for the usually excellent Oscar-winning filmmaker, is a slightly disappointingly run-of-the-mill affair with a misjudged and overly censorious ending. Director of photography, Nelson Hume [L] worked with director Kevin Macdonald [R] on the film He gets full marks for access, though. The film is awash with rare archive footage, chatty family members, and a decent range of colleagues who were central characters in her story. Whitney (L) sang in church from a young age Some of the old video clips are a treat to see. We get to watch a very young, precocious Whitney leading the singing in her local church, and then - just a few years later - blowing the minds of the audience with her sensational first professional performance. It is all very watchable. Macdonald has seamlessly knitted together domestic footage, contextualising archive news-reels, and his own down-the-barrel interviews with great expertise. The tone throughout has an understandably dark hue; we know the story doesn't end well: it is an inescapable fact, which therefore has to inform every facet of the portrait. The problem with the film is it lacks an incisive editorial line to make it more than a bunch of well edited clips and talking heads telling us what we already know with added - and often extraneous  - gossipy snippets (the singer liked sex, for example). There is too much focus on Whitney the personality and not enough on Whitney the artist. It feels like a missed opportunity, particularly as the interrogation of her personal life leads to a series of dead ends. Bobby Brown and Whitney went on their honeymoon in 1992 Her ex-husband Bobby Brown refused to talk about what happened to precipitate her tragic descent into a living hell of drug addiction and professional self-destruction. Cissy Houston, Whitney's mother, sitting in the church where the star sang Her mother, Cissy, says next to nothing about anything, a taciturn approach also adopted by Clive Davis, the man who signed Whitney to his record label and had a front row seat in the spectacle that was her rise and fall. There are also several no-shows of key protagonists. Robyn Crawford, the singer's great friend, companion, and long-time associate, is conspicuous by her absence. So is Dionne Warwick, the world famous cousin with whom Whitney sang, and whose sister Dee Dee, we are told, allegedly sexually abused her when she was a child.  (Dee Dee Warwick died in 2008, and so can't respond to the claims.) This is a revelation towards which the film builds as the mood darkens markedly in its second hour. Fine. But the way in which it is done is heavy-handed, the conclusions it appears to draw, simplistic. And yet, as you will discover if you watch this film, there was absolutely nothing simple about Whitney Houston.

"Annette McKenzie's daughter Britney took her own life after suffering online bullying A mother who is fighting to improve mental health services for young people after her daughter took her own life wants Scotland's new mental health minister to fast-track changes. Annette McKenzie believes young people are dying because they are not getting the right treatment. She wants changes to the way drugs are prescribed and more use of counselling. On the second anniversary of her daughter's death, Annette begs Clare Haughey to make this a priority. Britney Mazzoncini's body was discovered in her Glasgow bedroom on 7 July 2016 by her father Raymond. Britney died after taking an overdose The 16-year-old died after taking an overdose of a beta-blocker. She had been prescribed a month's supply of the drugwithout the knowledge of her parents. Her mother Annette, 36,launched a petition and told MSPs parental consent should be neededto prescribe strong mental health medication to under 18s. She thinks her evidence, and submissions from other families and agencies, opened a ""can of worms"" and highlighted failings in the current service for vulnerable young people. In June, the public petitions committee ordered an inquiry into how young people can access mental health services. Annette wants the topic to be a priority for the newly-appointed minister for mental health, Clare Haughey. The new mental Health Minister Clare Haughey Annette told the BBC: ""It feels like every day there is another suicide in Scotland and every day mental health treatment is not any better. It is great that the petition is being taken seriously and the committee is concerned. But where is the action?"" She has watched in despair at reports of other young people taking their own lives and thinks Scotland cannot wait any longer to have the services young people need. ""I would like to see counsellors in schools. I would like to see places open for people suffering to walk into and be heard,"" she said. ""I would like to see a new training programme for not just GPs but the schools and the wider public sector. ""Every time I hear someone else has taken their life, I think, could that have been prevented? Were they on medication, were they given it on their first visit to the GP?"" Annette McKenzie addressed the petitions committee who have now ordered an inquiry Annette hopes the minister, herself a former mental health nurse, will champion her petition. She admits that as she prepares to mark the second anniversary of losing her daughter, the petition and the desire to stop it happening to anyone else is what keeps her going. Mental Health Minister Clare Haughey said: ""Watching a loved one struggle with their mental health can be harrowing and too many families are telling us how the services that should be supporting them failed to do so. ""I welcome the committee's decision to hold an inquiry on how young people can access mental health services and we have written to GPs with information about consent, support and treatment for young people with mental health problems, as part of our response to the complex issues raised by the petition."" She added: ""We are acting on the recommendations of the recently-published audit of rejected referrals and have appointed internationally-respected authority on mental health Dr Dame Denise Coia to look at how we reshape mental health services for children and young people, with Â£5m initial funding behind it. ""Our Youth Commission on Mental Health will also help us understand the views and experience of young people in relation to service provision."" MSP Johann Lamont sits on the petitions committee. She agrees more should be done: ""Annette McKenzie's courage in raising the issue of support for young people with mental health issues has been immense. ""The tragic loss of her daughter Britney has been devastating for her family and friends. I do hope the Minister Clare Haughey will respond to Annette's call for urgent action with care and compassion. ""Annette's bravery and all those young people still suffering deserve no less. Given her own background I am confident the minister will look closely at the work of the public petitions committee and rise to the challenge these distressing issues merit.""

"Some homes are without water on what is expected to be one of the hottest days of the year Cars were left submerged and homes cut off when a burst water main flooded streets in part of Birmingham. About 100 homes were affected around Wheeler Street in Newtown, West Midlands Fire Service said. At least one person and their dog were rescued from their home by boat. Supplier Severn Trent Water said the burst involved ""one of its biggest pipes"" and it would take a while to reconnect those homes now without water. The road has been badly damaged and people are asked to avoid the area. Water rescue teams checked vehicles caught in floods Engineers are on site and have isolated the burst pipe, Severn Trent said. Area operations manager Paul Baldwin said it was one of the largest trunk water mains in the city and was deep, making it ""complex"" to repair. Police drones have been brought in to help assess the extent of the damage This video can not be played Burst water main floods homes and wrecks road He said it was difficult to say how long repairs to the badly damaged road surface would take. Severn Trent has apologised to anyone affected and said the ""majority"" of customers had been reconnected. Teams have been assessing the damage caused to the road Staff were also delivering bottled water to those considered the most vulnerable. The firm said the pipe involved was 30in in diameter (76cm). An investigation into the cause of the burst would begin once supplies were fully restored. Drivers are being advised to avoid the area Police drones were used to assess the extent of the damage and Wheeler Street is currently closed from Farm Street to Markford Walk.

"This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting The cabinet has reached a ""collective"" agreement on the basis of the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit, Theresa May has said. Ministers have signed up to a plan to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"". They also supported what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"". The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the plan, agreed after a 12-hour meeting, would ""anger many Tory Brexiteers"". Our political editor said the prime minister had ""picked a side"" by opting for a closer relationship with the EU than many colleagues desired - and she now had to sell it to her party and the other European leaders. No 10, she added, hoped the new commitments would unlock the next phase of talks with the rest of the EU but it was not yet clear how many, or what kind, of objections were raised. Laura Kuenssberg analysis: The deal is done Brexit: All you need to know Brexit jargon explained Downing Street said the proposals marked a ""substantial evolution"" in the UK's position and would resolve outstanding concerns about the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. ""This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU, and I look forward to it being received positively,"" Mrs May told the BBC. One pro-Brexit cabinet minister told the BBC there was ""no point"" pushing for a vote as ""we were well and truly outnumbered by 20 to seven"". Nicholas Watt, political editor of BBC Newsnight, said the minister also warned that ""it will be a problem"" if there is any attempt to ""water down plans even further"" should the EU reject the UK's proposals. The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The UK said it now wanted to accelerate the negotiations in an effort to secure an agreement by October, but also warned it will step up preparations for leaving on 29 March 2019 without a deal. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier, who earlier suggested the EU would be willing to shift its position if the UK relaxed some of its ""red lines"", tweeted his reaction: Allow Twitter content?

Barnier: 'Realistic' Brexit plan needed As it happened: Reaction to cabinet deal The prime minister had gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to try and resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details of theChequers statement,externalare as follows: The UK would accept continuing ""harmonisation"" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade Parliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so There will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater ""regulatory flexibility"" and ""strong reciprocal arrangements"" Freedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work A new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of ""a combined customs territory"" The UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules were in force. Mrs May said this was an ""important step"" in the process of negotiating the UK's smooth exit from the EU. ""Of course we still have work to do with the EU in ensuring that we get to that end point in October. But this is good we have come today, following our detailed discussions, to a positive future for the UK,"" she said. She said the proposals, to be formally published in a white paper next week, would give the UK the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries while maintaining regulatory, environmental and consumer standards. This video can not be played Brexit: How will remainers and leavers react to cabinet customs agreement? In a letter sent to all Conservative MPs, she said she had allowed colleagues to express their views while policy was developed but ""agreement on this proposal marks the point where this is no longer the case and collective responsibility is fully restored"". There is no mention in the document of eitherthe single market or the customs union, which the UK has committed to leave after the end of a transition period in December 2020. Under plans for a free trade zone, the UK would be committed legally to following EU law for a large part of the economy, including manufacturing and farming. While Parliament would retain the right to diverge from EU regulations in these areas, the document makes clear that ""choosing not to pass the relevant legislation would have consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border"". Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt and David Davis among those listening to Theresa May The document also commits the government to step up preparedness for a no-deal scenario, as one of a range of possible outcomes, ""given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations"". The CBI employers group welcomed the proposals for a free trade area in goods which it said would provide a ""confidence boost"" to business. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said there was ""a danger that this is a lowest common denominator plan"" designed to hold the cabinet together, rather than ""secure the strong negotiating position that we need with the EU"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Once upon a time we were told 'Brexit means Brexit', now we are told it means maintaining a common rulebook for all goods, a joint institutional framework for interpreting the agreement and the UK and EU forming this combined customs territory. ""That looks very much like regulatory alignment, the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and half a customs union to me."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who backed Brexit in the referendum, said the deal would end free movement of people and would end the remit of the European Court of Justice in the UK - saying that UK judges always pay regards to other countries' courts, such as Canada or Hong Kong. He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that the cabinet had agreed to step up preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal. Fellow cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also tweeted her backing for the deal: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Leading Tory backbench Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg told the same programme that it was difficult to say whether or not the agreement was meeting the party's manifesto commitments on Brexit because he had seen only a three page summary rather than the full 100-plus page document. He said it was ""possible"", when the detail emerged, that the proposal could be ""worse than no deal"". And Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it could be the case that ""Brexiteers have signed up to it knowing perfectly well that it is not going to pass the European Union and they'll then be able to blame Europe for the fact that it won't work"". Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave said it would represent a ""bad deal for the UK"" which would ""only slide further as the EU takes more and more"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan amounted to a ""sell-out to global corporates"" and would do nothing for the 90% of British firms which do not export to Europe. Veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Sir Bill Cash said he was ""deeply disappointed to say the least"" about the plans, which he suggested could contradict the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act passed by MPs last month.

"Agreement includes proposal for UK-EU free trade area for goods The government will look for a different arrangement for services Freedom of movement will come to an end under proposals Michel Barnier says EU will now discuss whether plans are ""realistic"" Hamish Mackay That's all from us on the BBC live page after a night when the government's proposals left few happy - but did at least appear to leave Britain with a united cabinet.

Arch-Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash tells Evan Davis on Newsnight he is ""deeply disappointed"" by tonight's proposals. And he has ""grave doubts"" that the EU negotiators will accept them. As you would expect, tomorrow's newspaper front pages differ in their understanding of this evening's revelations. The Guardian's headline suggests ministers have ""no clue"" while the Telegraph praises May's ""victory"". The Daily Star, meanwhile, decides the Brexit news is not even worthy of its front page, preferring instead to focus on the potential shortage of bananas, which it calls ""our yellow curvy favourite"".

doesn't resolve many of the fundamental problems created by Brexit"". He added:  ""This only confirms how important it is that we have a People's Vote on

country can decide whether or not it's good enough."" The cabinet has reached a ""collective"" agreement on the basis of the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit.

They also supported what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"". You can read full details of tonight's Chequers statement here.

A taxi company was on standby during the day for any ministers who decided they couldn't accept Mrs May's proposals. As it happened, none were needed. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable says that while Brexiteer ministers may have signed up to the proposals, they might still be hoping to get ""their hard Brexit served on a plate"".

"This video can not be played Police search John Baker House where victim Dawn Sturgess lives The police operation into the poisoning of a couple with a nerve agent in Salisbury is ""expected to take months to complete"", officers have said. Police say Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, were exposed toNovichokafter handling an unknown object. The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital a week after falling ill. Their symptoms were the same as those of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who werepoisoned in March. No one else has come forward with similar symptoms following the incident, Wiltshire Police said. Police have cordoned off several areas including Rollestone Street in Salisbury, Police in hazardous material (hazmat) suitsspent Friday searchingJohn Baker House in Salisbury, the hostel where Ms Sturgess lives. Officers are also looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage to identify when the couple came in contact with the nerve agent. Police said the ""unique challenges"" surrounding the operation meant ""police activity is expected to take weeks and months to complete"". Novichok can be degraded by rainwater and sunlight over time - meaning it was probably discovered by the pair in a contained space, a government source said. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? Are you in the area? Do you have any information to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The government blamed the poisoning of the Skripals, both of whom have now left hospital, on the Russian authorities. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" after another MP, Conservative Tom Tugendhat who chairs the foreign affairs committee, said the latest incident was the result of a ""war crime"" and ""vile act of terror"" by Russia. Russia - which denies involvement in either incident - said the UK was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""intimidate its own citizens"". By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The search for the ""source item"", the container believed to have poisoned the pair now critically ill in Salisbury hospital, is proving harder than predicted. Due to the current heatwave, police detectives and chemical weapons experts wearing huge Hazmat (Hazardous Material) suits are only able to spend a few minutes at a time inside the property being searched. Every single item of possible interest, however small, is having to be assessed as the possible source of the Novichok nerve agent poison and is having to be handled with extreme care. Whitehall officials are hopeful that the source item will eventually be found - even if it takes months. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three who lives at the Salisbury hostel, which offers supported accommodation. A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who also lived at John Baker House, described her as a ""loving and caring person"". Mr Rowley's brother Matthew told the BBC: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed. Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said after Ms Sturgess was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and began ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said. ""He was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked, and he started sweating loads and dribbling, so I had to phone an ambulance for him,"" said Mr Hobson. This video can not be played Sam Hobson, a friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims, describes the symptoms he witnessed Based on information from a friend and items found at the flat, Wiltshire Police initially thought the pair had fallen ill after using a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine. But after tests at the government's military research facility at Porton Down, a major incident was declared and it was confirmed they had been exposed to Novichok. Police do not believe Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were victims of a targeted attack, but instead came into contact with the substance in Amesbury or Salisbury. On Friday night, police revealed more details around the victim's movements. They said the pair were both at John Baker House at lunchtime on 29 June, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the hostel at about 16:20 BST before heading to Amesbury by bus at about 22:30. At midday on Friday, there was an increased police presence in Muggleton Road - where the couple were found - with fire engines also attending Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Five areas have been cordoned off: Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Public Health England has repeated its ""highly precautionary advice"" for people who had visited those five locations but stressed there was no immediate health risk. PHE advised washing worn clothes with a regular detergent at normal temperature, wiping items like phones and handbags, and double-bagging dry-clean only items, with further instructions to follow on those. Mr Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were working on the investigation. Are you in the area?

"Some homes are without water on what is expected to be one of the hottest days of the year Cars were left submerged and homes cut off when a burst water main flooded streets in part of Birmingham. About 100 homes were affected around Wheeler Street in Newtown, West Midlands Fire Service said. At least one person and their dog were rescued from their home by boat. Supplier Severn Trent Water said the burst involved ""one of its biggest pipes"" and it would take a while to reconnect those homes now without water. The road has been badly damaged and people are asked to avoid the area. Water rescue teams checked vehicles caught in floods Engineers are on site and have isolated the burst pipe, Severn Trent said.

An investigation into the cause of the burst would begin once supplies were fully restored.

"England's progress in the World Cup may have delighted the nation - but it's also taken some by surprise. A whopping 23.6 million tuned in to watch England beat Colombia in a historic penalty shoot-out on Tuesday, with all eyes now on the quarter-final against Sweden in Samara. But with the match happening on a sunny Saturday afternoon, some people who didn't expect England to do quite so well, or who perhaps hadn't been interested in the tournament until now, are facing a clash. So, what are people doing to make sure they see the game? Getting married during the big game Why some people won't be watching The low-down on the quarter-finals What are England fans singing? In pictures: England's joy Michael Simpson and Tom Dillon cancelled their flight home What do you do if you're due to take off at the same time as the 15:00 kick-off? For England fans Michael Simpson and Tom Dillon, there was only one solution - cancel your flight back to England. They've been on holiday in Portugal for a week but when they realised they would miss the game if they got their flight from Lisbon to London, they decided to rearrange their travel plans. ""We're now flying back from Faro, about three hours from Lisbon,"" said Michael, who's been staying in a villa with friends just outside the Portuguese city. ""So we will watch the game in Lisbon and then stay in Faro, before flying back to London on Sunday. We've had to pay about another 130 euros each but it's worth it. ""It's a childhood dream to see England win the World Cup. So whether that meant staying in Portugal or coming back early, we just couldn't miss it. ""In the end, we couldn't get an earlier flight, so football's coming home - but we're not."" Editors, seen performing earlier this summer, will play their set as planned Thousands of music fans will be heading to Finsbury Park, London, for Wireless Festival this weekend, which left organisers with a dilemma about what to do at 15:00 on Saturday. Their solution? To stop the music on the main stage and screen the big game there instead. The last act before the match starts is 6Lack, who's due to finish his set at 14:55. Cue plenty of moshing if England win. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They're not doing the same for British Summer Time Hyde Park though, with Editors' set - which clashes with the crucial England game - carrying on as planned. Frontman Tom Smith has accepted that some people will stay away, saying: ""I'm sure many won't come to the gig until the game finishes... but many will, plus I'm sure loads will have it on on their phones whilst we play - and I for one can't wait to soundtrack Spurs' dire attempts to score a goal in open play for those World Cup crazy technologically savvy sunburnt goths stood in Hyde Park this Saturday afternoon."" The festival's director, Jim King, said it would be wrong to stop the music when ""people paid a lot of money to come and see all of those bands"". Another music festival, Sunniside Live in Sunderland, is going to be showing the game on the side of a double-decker bus. And luckily, the headliners on Saturday are The Lightning Seeds, who co-wrote football anthemThree Lions- so expect a mass singalong later in the evening. The musical Mamma Mia!, written, of course, by Swedish musicians Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson from Abba, is having a matinee showing on Saturday afternoon. And yes, you've guessed it - it starts exactly the same time as the Sweden v England game. At the interval, which coincides with the second half of the match starting, the score will be announced to the audience. A spokeswoman said: ""If it is a good result for England, we are planning to announce the final score at the end of the show."" Audience members will be reminded to switch their phones off at the beginning of the performance - perhaps a wise move, given the fury actors felt whentwo women followed England's penalty shoot-out victoryon their phones at a theatre earlier this week. Paul Leadbeater and Marita Phenix thought they had planned their wedding day at Sunderland's Stadium of Light perfectly to avoid it clashing with any games. But then, England ended up doing slightly better than they expected. They'll still be getting hitched on the pitch in Jordan Pickford and Jordan Henderson's home town, but only after the final whistle has blown. That's assuming it doesn't go to penalties again, that is. ""Guests have been asking what's happening so we had to put it back to 17:15,"" he said. ""Hopefully it won't go beyond that, or I'm not sure what will happen. But the stadium has been very accommodating and the game will be screened in one of the bars. ""My fiancÃ©e, who's got a season ticket to Sunderland, will be watching too, just not with me."" And what happens if the result isn't as the happy couple hope? ""I'm not thinking about England not winning,"" said Paul. ""So hopefully everyone will be on a high when the wedding begins. The only downside is everyone will have had a few more drinks."" Meanwhile one woman, according to a Mumsnet post, has banned guests from checking their phones at her wedding on Saturday and is declaring the venue a ""football-free zone"". And spare a thought too, for Nick Boles, Conservative MP for Grantham and Stamford, who says he's grappling with a moral dilemma as his niece is getting married at 16:00. Allow Twitter content?

It's the time of year when many schools are finishing ahead of the summer holidays, with school fetes planned for Saturday. But with fears that eyes may be on phone screens following the game, rather than concentrating on the coconut shy, some schools have changed their plans. One primary school in Richmond, south-west London, has brought the time of their fair forward, with one employee saying it had been a ""nightmare"", adding: ""Parents didn't want to be here, and then we had the issue of whether or not we'd screen it. We also thought the adults might be a bit overexcited."" And another in Surrey that has also done the same, with events now finishing an hour before kick-off, said parents - and teachers - wouldn't even have been able to follow events on their phones as they aren't allowed on the school site. Thousands of people turned out for Pride last year About a million people went to Pride in London last year - and organisers have admitted some may end up ""multitasking"" this year. They're not showing the game at the annual parade, but have wished lots of luck to the England team. Alison Camps, co-chairwoman of Pride in London, said: ""We obviously wish the England team all the best, we are hoping that all the rainbows, unicorns and glitter will work their magic and send good vibes over to Russia. ""I imagine there will be a lot of multitasking - I'm hoping there will be even more people celebrating on the streets after England have a famous victory."" Just because sports fans from all over the nation will have their eyes on goings-on in Samara, doesn't mean that the game will stop play. Wimbledon has already been declared a World Cup-free zone. Henley Royal Regatta is not showing the game either - but football fans can see it elsewhere in the town, including at the enclosure of nightclub Chinawhite. There's also qualifying at Silverstone, ahead of the British Grand Prix on Sunday. It starts at 14:00, but Silverstone has said five different areas of the racetrack will be screening the game.

"A US photo shows the U-boat under attack on 10 November 1943 Divers have found wreckage from a German World War Two U-boat near the coast of Galicia in north-west Spain. U-966 was heavily damaged by Allied bombers in November 1943, so the crew blew it up with timed charges and all but eight reached dry land. US Navy and RAF Liberator bombers targeted U-966 with depth charges for a whole day, as the German submarine zig-zagged and fired its anti-aircraft gun. One Allied plane was shot down - reportedly an RAF Catalina flying boat. An RAF Wellington bomber also took part in the submarine chase and dropped depth charges. The three divers who found the wreckage after years of searching The three divers' discovery in late June followed years of searching in a very rocky area where rough weather often makes diving impossible. The debris was photographed at a depth of 24-26m (79-85ft). One of the divers, naval historian Yago Abilleira, said they had found the wreckage near Estaca de Bares and it was spread over a wide area. They are not revealing the exact location, as it is a war grave. He told the local paper La Voz de Galicia (in Spanish),externalthat the crew had scuttled U-966, nicknamed ""Gut Holz"" (Good Wood), ""in desperation, as Allied planes were attacking them on all sides and they knew time was running out"". The U-boat's violent end scattered debris over a wide area of seabed Spanish media say the divers now want to find the downed Allied plane, believed to be near the U-boat wreck. A German naval history website, Ubootarchiv.de, says (in German),externalthat three local fishing boats rescued submariners who were clinging to rocks offshore.

"A picture of the fire-test A popular cladding brand failed a safety test this week - despite being seen as so fire-safe that it is permitted on tall buildings without any extra tests, Newsnight has learned. Cladding removed for failing tests may be being replaced by this brand, which has now failed the same test. Valcan, the UK distributor of Vitracore G2, said the product is safe and had passed the required testing. The housing ministry said it would look ""closely"" at the results. The test that took place this week was unusual: a fire-test took place in Dubai of a cladding design that, ordinarily, would not be expected to be tested.  It was a cladding system made up of Vitracore G2 cladding over a mineral wool insulation. UK building rules would presuppose this design to be safe without the test, since all the parts have fire safety ratings of at least ""limited combustibility"". This rating of ""limited combustibility"" is assigned based on lab assessments of the materials' chemistry. These ratings mean that, if this design were to be specified for a building, it could be installed without any need for a full system test.  It is only designs that use components deemed to have weaker fire ratings that are obliged to go through them. Our regulations assume a design using components of ""limited combustibility"" would pass the test - a test known in the jargon as the ""BS-8414"". This is the normal system test: cladding is fixed over a wall, and a fire is lit underneath it to test its resistance to the blaze. The test is intended to simulate the response to a fire spilling out of a window. It was the BS-8414 test that was used last year to determine which cladding systems were safe or unsafe after the Grenfell fire. The test was carried out at a facility run by an independent testing company called Exova and commissioned by Kingspan, a company that makes cladding products.  When the cladding was tested, the Exova engineers found that the temperature inside the cladding breached the upper limits required to pass the test. Adrian Buckmaster of Tetraclad, a cladding company, said he has observed a marked rise in the popularity of Vitracore G2, explaining: ""the sort of buildings it's going on to is where existing cladding that has failed the recent tests wants to be replaced with a similar type of finish."" This means that LAs and housing associations may have replaced cladding systems that have failed the BS 8414 test with a design that would also fail that test. A fire engine outside a tower block in Camden Vitracore G2 is a panel with honeycomb structure: it has a structure similar to corrugated cardboard - but is made out of aluminium. The panel has no solid core - and especially no combustible core, such as those used in the panels on the Grenfell Tower. Vitracore G2 is much safer than plastic-cored products like those used at Grenfell - but there have been concerns within the industry about how honeycomb-style cladding can safely be used. Vitracore G2 is made of thin aluminium and melts away rapidly in fire. This limits its ability to protect other components in the same way that more solid A2 panels can.  Vitracore G2 also has glue inside, holding it together. The glue, according to Vitracore's official test certificates, is highly combustible. This is permitted for a product of limited combustibility, if there is very little of it. Valcan, which distributes Vitracore G2 in the UK, said that the product had passed a BS-8414 test previously.  They also noted that because it has a ""limited combustibility"" rating, their cladding could be used in some circumstances without needing a test. They told Newsnight: ""Vitracore G2 was testedâ¦ by Exova Warringtonfire in November 2017. The panel did not spread flame, and temperature results were safely below requirements."" ""This test of Vitracore G2 demonstrates that the panels will not cause a fire to spread through the exterior or interior of a high-rise building."" The fire test rig during the test This is a broader issue than Vitracore G2, however. Newsnight has also learned of two other tests where a cladding system exclusively using limited combustibility components failed fire tests - one conducted in Australia and one in the UK. These results further challenge the assumption that a system made from products rated as ""limited combustibility"" or better can be assumed to be safe if the overall system has not been tested. This episode raises questions for the government. Ministers are minded to ban all combustible components in cladding. If it is still possible to create cladding systems that are unsafe without using anything deemed ""combustible"", this ban may not be effective. Mr Buckmaster said: ""maybe this is the situation where not only do you have to achieve a classification of non or limited combustibility but you also have to pass a large scale test."" The housing ministry said: ""We are consulting on banning the use of combustible materials in cladding systems on high-rise residential buildings. We will be looking at these test results closely.""

"This video can not be played Police search John Baker House where victim Dawn Sturgess lives The police operation into the poisoning of a couple with a nerve agent in Salisbury is ""expected to take months to complete"", officers have said. Police say Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, were exposed toNovichokafter handling an unknown object. The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital a week after falling ill. Their symptoms were the same as those of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who werepoisoned in March. No one else has come forward with similar symptoms following the incident, Wiltshire Police said. Police have cordoned off several areas including Rollestone Street in Salisbury, Police in hazardous material (hazmat) suitsspent Friday searchingJohn Baker House in Salisbury, the hostel where Ms Sturgess lives. Officers are also looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage to identify when the couple came in contact with the nerve agent. Police said the ""unique challenges"" surrounding the operation meant ""police activity is expected to take weeks and months to complete"". Novichok can be degraded by rainwater and sunlight over time - meaning it was probably discovered by the pair in a contained space, a government source said. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? Are you in the area? Do you have any information to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The government blamed the poisoning of the Skripals, both of whom have now left hospital, on the Russian authorities. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" after another MP, Conservative Tom Tugendhat who chairs the foreign affairs committee, said the latest incident was the result of a ""war crime"" and ""vile act of terror"" by Russia. Russia - which denies involvement in either incident - said the UK was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""intimidate its own citizens"". By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The search for the ""source item"", the container believed to have poisoned the pair now critically ill in Salisbury hospital, is proving harder than predicted. Due to the current heatwave, police detectives and chemical weapons experts wearing huge Hazmat (Hazardous Material) suits are only able to spend a few minutes at a time inside the property being searched. Every single item of possible interest, however small, is having to be assessed as the possible source of the Novichok nerve agent poison and is having to be handled with extreme care. Whitehall officials are hopeful that the source item will eventually be found - even if it takes months. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three who lives at the Salisbury hostel, which offers supported accommodation. A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who also lived at John Baker House, described her as a ""loving and caring person"". Mr Rowley's brother Matthew told the BBC: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed. Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said after Ms Sturgess was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and began ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said. ""He was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked, and he started sweating loads and dribbling, so I had to phone an ambulance for him,"" said Mr Hobson. This video can not be played Sam Hobson, a friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims, describes the symptoms he witnessed Based on information from a friend and items found at the flat, Wiltshire Police initially thought the pair had fallen ill after using a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine. But after tests at the government's military research facility at Porton Down, a major incident was declared and it was confirmed they had been exposed to Novichok. Police do not believe Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were victims of a targeted attack, but instead came into contact with the substance in Amesbury or Salisbury. On Friday night, police revealed more details around the victim's movements. They said the pair were both at John Baker House at lunchtime on 29 June, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the hostel at about 16:20 BST before heading to Amesbury by bus at about 22:30. At midday on Friday, there was an increased police presence in Muggleton Road - where the couple were found - with fire engines also attending Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Five areas have been cordoned off: Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Public Health England has repeated its ""highly precautionary advice"" for people who had visited those five locations but stressed there was no immediate health risk. PHE advised washing worn clothes with a regular detergent at normal temperature, wiping items like phones and handbags, and double-bagging dry-clean only items, with further instructions to follow on those. Mr Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were working on the investigation. Are you in the area?

"An HIV vaccine that has the potential to protect people around the world from the virus has shown promising results. The treatment, which aims to provide immunity against various strains of the virus, produced an anti-HIV immune system response in tests on 393 people,a study in the Lancet found,external. It also protected some monkeys from a virus that is similar to HIV. More testing is now needed to determine if the immune response produced can prevent HIV infection in people. 'Mind-blowing' cows hold clue to beating HIV The man who saved thousands of people from HIV New antibody attacks 99% of HIV strains About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids, and there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. But despite advances in treatment for HIV, both a cure and a vaccine for the virus have so far remained elusive. The drugPrep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is effective at preventing HIV infection, but, unlike a vaccine, it needs to be taken regularly, even daily, to prevent the virus from taking hold. Inventing a vaccine has proved an immense challenge for scientists, in part because there are so many strains of the virus, but also because HIV is adept at mutating to elude attack from our immune systems. Previous attempts at HIV vaccines have been limited to specific strains of the virus found in certain parts of the world. But for this ""mosaic"" vaccine, scientists have developed a treatment made up of pieces of different HIV viruses. The hope is that it could offer much better protection against the almost unlimited number of HIV strains found across the world. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, scientists tested various combinations of the mosaic vaccine in people aged 18 to 50 who did not have HIV and were healthy. The participants, from the US, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand, received four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks. All of the vaccine combinations produced an anti-HIV immune system response and were found to be safe. Scientists also carried out a parallel study where they gave rhesus monkeys the vaccine to protect them from getting simian-human immunodeficiency virus - a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys. The mosaic vaccine combination that showed the most promise in humans was found to protect 67% of the 72 monkeys from getting the disease. ""These results represent an important milestone,"" said Dan Barouch, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study. However, Prof Barouch also cautioned that the findings needed to be interpreted with caution. Though the vaccine triggered a response in the immune system of the people who took it, it is not clear if this would be enough to fight off the virus and prevent infection. ""The challenges in the development of an HIV vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to induce HIV-specific immune responses does not necessarily indicate that a vaccine will protect humans from HIV infection,"" he added. Nevertheless, the promising results of the study mean researchers will next test the treatment on 2,600 women in southern Africa who are at risk of getting the illness - one of only five vaccines to make it to this stage of so-called efficacy trials. Only one vaccine has ever shown evidence of protecting against HIV. A vaccine tested in Thailand lowered the rate of human infection by 31%, but the effect was considered too low to advance it to common use. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was early days for the vaccine but the signs were ""promising"". ""However, it's important to be cautious and be clear that there's a lot of work to do before an effective HIV vaccine is readily available."" Dr Brady added that in the meantime there were already tools that were effective for preventing the disease from spreading, such as contraception and treatments for HIV-positive people that prevent them from passing on the virus.

"A senior Scotland Yard officer is being investigated for allegedly breaking rules about honours nominations. Temporary Chief Superintendent Parm Sandhu has been served with a ""gross misconduct"" investigation notice, meaning she could potentially face a serious disciplinary charge. In some cases, such a charge can lead to dismissal. The officer, who's been placed on restricted duties, has declined to comment on the allegation. Two other Metropolitan Police officers are also under investigation. BBC News understands the inquiry is focusing on whether Ms Sandhu encouraged colleagues to support her nomination for a Queen's Police Medal (QPM). The QPM, which was introduced in 1954, is awarded twice a year in the Queen's Birthday and New Year Lists. The medals are given to serving police officers in the UK in recognition of distinguished service or outstanding courage in the line of duty. In this year's New Year's honours, 18 officers were awarded the QPM, the same number awarded to officers in the birthday list last month. National Police Chief Council guidelines say that ""any person can nominate any other person for an honour"". However, as with other honours, people are not expected to nominate themselves and are not meant to contribute to or know about the process. The Inspectorate of Constabulary coordinates the process for those of superintendent rank and below, with applications considered by the Home Office before going to the honours committee, along with recommendations for knighthoods, MBEs and other awards. The internal Met investigation is examining an allegation that Ms Sandhu may have contacted other officers with a summary of information to support her QPM nomination. The inquiry is at an early stage and no disciplinary action has been taken so far. However, the officer has been notified that the investigation is looking at alleged ""gross misconduct"", which, if proven could lead to dismissal. Ms Sandhu, who joined the police in 1989, rose through the ranks to become borough commander in Richmond-upon-Thames. She is one of the most senior ethnic minority officers in the Met and in 2006 received an Asian Women of Achievement award, largely for her work in reassuring the community in the aftermath of the 7 July terrorist attacks on London's transport system. Last month she tweeted that she ""will be promoted to Ch Supt"" in the Metropolitan Police, adding: ""I will be the first woman of colour to hold this rank."" She is being supported through the investigation by representatives of the Police Superintendents' Association. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ""The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) is investigating the conduct of three officers following an allegation that they breached guidelines relating to the UK honours nomination process. ""A temporary chief superintendent currently attached to human resources was served with a gross misconduct notice on Wednesday 27 June and has been placed on restricted duties. ""Two other officers - a detective superintendent and an inspector, both from frontline policing - were served with misconduct notices on Wednesday 27 June. They remain on full duties. Enquiries continue.""

"Steve Ditko created Spider-Man with Stan Lee in 1963 Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko has died aged 90 in New York, police say. He was found unresponsive at his flat in Manhattan on 29 June and was declared dead by paramedics who attended the scene. Fans, including author Neil Gaiman, have paid tribute to the artist. Ditko rose to fame for his work with Marvel Comics in the early 1960s, working with the company's future CEO Stan Lee on ideas including Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Lee came up with the idea of a teen superhero with the powers of a spider, says BBC North America correspondent Chris Buckler. But it was Ditko who created Spider-Man's distinctive blue and red costume and the web-shooters he wore on his wrists. Ditko left the company in 1966 after reportedly falling out with Lee and went on to create superhero The Creeper with DC Comics.

"Patients, including children, were hosed down with water to remove chemicals on their skin A report by the chemical weapons watchdog suggests chlorine may have been used in April's suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma. The interim report,externalby the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"" had been found (in samples taken from two locations), but there was no evidence of nerve agents. Medics say dozens of civilians were killed in the alleged attack by government forces on the rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus. The Syrian government denies carrying out any chemical weapons attacks. Following the Douma incident, US, British and French warplanes launched strikes against government facilities they said were involved in chemical weapons development and storage. The OPCW was recently given new powers by member statesto name those responsible for using chemical weapons. Its investigation into what happened in Douma is continuing. Medics in Douma reported on 7 April that more than 500 patients had been brought to medical facilities with symptoms suggesting exposure to a chemical agent. Rescue workers also reported a strong smell of chlorine in the air following air strikes that targeted two locations in Douma. The OPCW sent a Fact-Finding Mission team to Douma about a week later, but inspectors did not visit any sites of interest until 21 April. Douma 'chemical attack': What we know Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space ""Along with explosive residues, various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from two sites,"" the preliminary report said. ""Work by the team to establish the significance of these results is on-going. The FFM team will continue its work to draw final conclusions."" The report said industrial gas cylinders were present at the two sites where chlorinated organic chemicals were detected. Following the alleged attack, a UN investigation said evidence pointed to the use of chlorine but that some people had exhibited symptoms more consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. The OPCW report, however, said that ""no organophosphorous nerve agents or their degradation products were detected"" at the sites. The five-year siege of the Eastern Ghouta, an agricultural region outside the capital where at least 265,000 civilians lived, was the longest in modern history. It came to an end in April, after a two-month offensive by pro-government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, that decimated homes, businesses and hospitals and reportedly left more than 1,700 men, women and children dead. Correction 23 July 2018: An earlier version of this article inaccurately summarised the findings of the OPCW's report. It has since been amended to clarify that their report suggests that chlorine may have been used in April's suspected chemical attack in Douma.

"This video can not be played Police search John Baker House where victim Dawn Sturgess lives Police in hazmat suits have been searching a Salisbury hostel as they try to find the item contaminated with a nerve agent that poisoned a couple. Investigators entered John Baker House, where one of the victims, Dawn Sturgess, 44, lives, on Friday afternoon. Police believe Charlie Rowley, 45, and Ms Sturgess were exposed toNovichokafter handling the unknown object. The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital. Police said the ""unique challenges"" surrounding the operation meant ""police activity is expected to take weeks and months to complete"". They added they are looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage to help them find the source of the contamination. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said no objects have been collected for testing yet. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? A government scientist told BBC News that the contaminated item was unlikely to have been left in the open before the couple touched it. Novichok can be degraded by rainwater and sunlight over time - meaning it was probably discovered by the pair in a contained space, the government source added. But other experts have said the nerve agent was designed to be persistent and not break down. Speaking to BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, the government scientist also said the Novichok was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin and did not need to be ingested. The source added that Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess's symptoms were the same as those shown by Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. They were both poisoned with Novichok in nearby Salisbury in March. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, Wiltshire The Amesbury investigation is entering a new phase. Scientists and chemical weapons experts atPorton Downin Wiltshire are bracing themselves for an influx of countless objects all needing forensic analysis. Investigators, led by the Met Police's counter-terrorism detectives, are working on the basis that the pair - now critically ill from Novichok poisoning - handled a contaminated item that caught their interest. They need to find it. The item - or possibly items - are thought to be something found and touched by the pair, possibly something as innocuous as a perfume bottle or other luxury toiletry. The search for this ""source item"" is likely to be extensive, painstaking and could last through the summer. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three who lives at the Salisbury hostel, which offers supported accommodation. A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who also lived at John Baker House, described her as a ""loving and caring person"". Mr Rowley's brother Matthew told the BBC: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed. Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said after Ms Sturgess was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and began ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said. ""He was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked, and he started sweating loads and dribbling, so I had to phone an ambulance for him,"" said Mr Hobson. This video can not be played Sam Hobson, a friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims, describes the symptoms he witnessed Based on information from a friend and items found at the flat, Wiltshire Police initially thought the pair had fallen ill after using a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine. But after tests at the government's military research facility at Porton Down, a major incident was declared and it was confirmed they had been exposed to Novichok. Police do not believe Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were victims of a targeted attack, but instead came into contact with the substance in Amesbury or Salisbury. On Friday night, police revealed more details around the victim's movements. They said the pair were both at John Baker House on Friday lunchtime, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the hostel at around 16:20 BST before heading to Amesbury by bus at around 22:30. At midday on Friday, there was an increased police presence in Muggleton Road - where the couple were found - with fire engines also attending Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Five areas have been cordoned off: Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were working on the investigation. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the latest incident was a result of a ""war crime"" by Russia - and that using a nerve agent in a civilian area was a ""vile act of terror"". Mr Javid called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"". The home secretary added he was ""comfortable"" the ""exact same nerve agent"" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. But Russia - which denies involvement in either incident - said the UK was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""intimidate its own citizens"". Allow Twitter content?

"TV images showed armed police leading Damaso Lopez onto a plane at an airport in Ciudad Juarez Mexico has extradited to the US a senior member of the Sinaloa drug gang formerly headed by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Damaso Lopez is alleged to have been responsible for organising Guzman's escape from a high security jail in 2001. He then joined the cartel and became one of the drug lord's closest allies. He was captured last May and is seen by the US as a key witness in the case against Guzman who is in a US jail. Damaso Lopez is known as ""The Graduate"" because he studied law and was a senior official in the Mexican prison administration system.

"David Davis' unhappiness has been not secret for some time After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. Junior ministerial colleague Steve Baker has also quit alongside him from the Brexit department. David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Some of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday . Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday But Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt,  according to colleagues, that he was ""wondering if he really had a proper job"" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention. Mr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May. To some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, ""it's just a personal outburst"", adding: ""He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments."" But conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm. And when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose. Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis Westminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him. The most likely candidate it seems at this stage is Michael Gove who has pitched himself as the Brexiteer that ""remainers can do business with"". His public appearances defending the Brexit policy over the weekend make him certainly near the top of the list for one of the most important jobs in government.
