"Mr Paisley could lose his seat and face a by-election if 10% of voters in North Antrim sign the petition A petition that could force a by-election in North Antrim and unseat the current MP Ian Paisley has opened. In July, MPsvoted to suspend Mr Paisley for 30 sitting daysfor failing to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government and lobbying on its behalf at Westminster - triggering the recall procedure. The DUP MP apologised in the Commons, but will face a by-election if 10% of his constituents sign the petition. The recall petition is the first in UK parliamentary history. Profile: DUP MP Ian Paisley Timeline: Ian Paisley suspension Three centres selected for Paisley petition Paisley apologises over rule breach This is a fairly recent addition to politics, becoming law underthe Recall of MPs Act which came into effect in 2016. It states that MPs who are convicted of a criminal offence and jailed, convicted of providing false information on allowance claims or barred from the House of Commons for 10 sitting days or longer can lose their seat if there is a successful petition to recall them. The petition is open for signing for six weeks from 8 August to 19 September Last month, Mr Paisley received a ban from Westminster of 30 sitting days for breaching parliamentary rules, beginning on 4 September, which triggered the recall procedure. According to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI), the number of people entitled to sign the petition (ie eligible registered voters) is 75,478. The Recall of MPs Act 2015 says a petition needs 10% of that number in order to trigger a by-election, therefore 7,543 signatures are required. It would have been 7,547 but last week the Electoral Office said the figure was 7,543 - due to a ""sweep"" of the register removing deceased voters and others who were not eligible. The petition is open for signing for six weeks from 8 August to 19 September from 09:00-17:00 BST, Monday to Friday. Opening hours at the designated centres will be extended to 21:00 on 6 and 13 September. Letters have already been sent to constituents informing them about the details of the petition. Anyone wanting to sign it must live in the North Antrim constituency and be 18 years old, or have their 18th birthday before the end of the signing period on 19 September. But just like in any normal election, anyone wanting to sign it must also be registered to vote in parliamentary elections. The Electoral Office selected three designated venues which are located at: Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre, Ballymoney Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena Sheskburn House Recreation Centre, Ballycastle The petition can be signed at three centres Legislation allows for up to 10 locations for the petition but the electoral office has opened three,a decision which drew criticismfrom some political parties. Voters can also apply to sign by post or proxy. Applications for those must be returned to the Electoral Office by 4 September. The chief electoral officer, Virginia McVea, said there had been a change in the law in relation to the postal application so anyone who chooses not to attend in person will be able to apply for the postal option and if their details are verified, can receive it within six weeks. Applications can be downloaded at eoni.org.uk. There are two help lines for constituents who have queries about the process. They are 02890446600 and 02890446668. No. The Electoral Office has sought to reassure people that this will not happen. In normal elections, what is known as a ""marked register"" is made available to the political parties afterwards. This way, they can tell who has turned out to vote and that helps inform their campaigning for the future without giving away any information about an individual voter's particular preferences. But the recall petition is different in as much as it is fairly obvious that if someone has turned out, it is because they think Ian Paisley should face a by-election. With that in mind, the Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea has said the marked register for this recall petition will not be made available for inspection, and that maintaining the secrecy of the ballot is of ""paramount importance"". The Electoral Office also said no figures will be released about the number of postal votes issued for the petition. If the number of signatures reaches or surpasses 7,543 it will trigger a by-election and Mr Paisley will lose his seat. There would be nothing to stop him from standing in the by-election, however, and he has already indicated that he would do so. He has been the MP for North Antrim since 2010.

"The children appeared to be relaxing on the railway crossing ""Shocking"" images showing children sitting and playing on a level crossing have been released. The group can be seen lounging on the tracks at Wing, Rutland, where trains pass at 60mph (97km/h). Network Rail said the images showed a ""complete disregard"" for safety, and urged parents to speak to their children about the dangers. There have been more than 2,000 incidents involving young people on level crossings in five years. It says it has ""installed new warning posters nearby"" since children were pictured playing on the crossing in Rutland, and is ""carrying out a review"" of the crossing. Community safety manager Vicki Beadle said: ""Level crossings are there to keep you safe and we cannot stress enough the danger children are putting themselves in when they choose to misuse a level crossing."" Network Rail recently decided to close a level crossing in Matlock Bath, Derbyshire, becausepeople would not stop posing on the railway line for photos- despite being warned. A boy can be seen spreading his body over the crossing in one of the images Network Rail has closed other level crossings and is carrying out a review of this one Network Rail has a legal duty to control risks at level crossings like this Vulnerable families face energy price rise Ten times more men than women die in sea Are women turning their back on the pill? There are around 6,000 level crossings in the UK and Network Rail has a legal duty to assess, manage and control the risks of them. It has closed 1,100 level crossings between 2009 and 2017 and improved safety at others by installing barriers and better warning systems.

"Joel Urhie dreamed of becoming a firefighter, his family said The death of a seven-year-old boy killed in a house fire is being treated as murder, the Met Police has said. Joel Urhie was found after a ""very severe fire"" at his home in Adolphus Street, Deptford, south-east London, in the early hours. Joel's mother Sophie and sister Sarah escaped. His father John said: ""It's terrible, the pain we cannot forget."" Det Supt Jane Corrigan said the fire was believed to be arson but Joel was unlikely to be the target. ""It is difficult to imagine a seven-year-old is the motive for the attack,"" she said. ""[He] has lost his life in what should have been the safest place for him, his home,"" she added. ""We believe that the fire was started deliberately but at this stage I am unable to go into any further detail due to operational reasons."" There are no suspects at the moment, the Met said. Joel's mother Sophie and sister Sarah jumped to safety from the first floor Joel's family said he dreamed of becoming a firefighter. Speaking outside the house, Mr Urhie described Joel as ""a very lovely boy who was just loving life"". The 54-year-old said he moved out of the family home about five years ago but had been called at about 04:00 BST to say there had been a fire. ""When I came, the first thing I saw was my daughter inside the ambulance. They said, 'Joel's dead', and there's nothing I can do about it,"" he said. Police officers and firefighterswere called to the house shortly before 03:30 BST on Tuesday. It took more than 75 minutes to bring the flames under control and surrounding homes were evacuated as a precaution. The ground floor of the house was badly damaged by the blaze, as well as the first floor and the stairs. No-one was in the house at the time apart from Joel, his mother and sister, police said. Ms Urhie and her daughter jumped to safety from the first floor. They are recovering in hospital, with non-life threatening injuries, where they were joined by Joel's brother Sam, 21. Homes were evacuated as a precaution after the fire broke out in Adolphus Street Family friend Grace Gbenedio, 56, said she rushed outside her nearby home after hearing screams. Mrs Gbenedio said she held Joel's mother, who said: ""My son is inside."" ""She was on the floor crying, 'help, help, help',"" Mrs Gbenedio added. ""The fire was just too much, like a curtain, no-one could go in or out,"" she said. ""We heard the last blast of the glass and she just collapsed.""

"A teenager who was given a 1% chance of full recovery after a skiing accident has achieved seven As in his exams. Ross Nesbitt, 16, was training with Glasgow ski racing team in Austria in December 2016 when he crashed and hit his head on a fence post, leaving him in a coma. He spent a month in hospital in Innsbruck and a further six-and-a-half weeks in Scottish hospitals. He had to learn how to walk, talk and eat again. Ross returned to Williamwood High School in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, in May last year and is now celebrating seven As and a B in his National 5 exams. He said: ""I was pretty pleased, I was really not expecting that, but happy to get the results."" Scottish exam pass rate 'stable' His mother Wilma said: ""I was working when he got his text but I believe he jumped out of his skin and was so pleased. We're just absolutely ecstatic with his results. ""It was really touch and go at times, we didn't know whether we were going to get our boy back but it didn't take very long before there were signs that Ross was improving. Ross Nesbitt said he was not expecting his seven A grades ""The first thing was switching on his mobile phone and putting his code in, and we knew he was still with us, but he had quite a long time recovering. ""He had to learn to swallow, how to walk and talk again. He had lost 18kgs (2.8 stone) in weight over the initial period and had a tube in his stomach to feed him, so it's remarkable with the help of all the team at the Children's Hospital in Glasgow that we walked out of there."" Ross initially returned to school for a couple of days a week and also had extra tutoring with teachers to help him catch up. Speaking about the accident and his recovery, he said: ""I was heading down to the lift and decided to take a shortcut off the track of the slope and hit a lot of snow and flew forward and banged my head on a fence post. ""I had to relearn how to walk and talk and do basic things again. ""I knew when I went back to school they weren't going to make me do the S3 exams, so I didn't have that pressure on me. The school were really helpful."" Ross will return to Williamwood next week for fifth year. ""I've not really thought much about what I want to do,"" he said. ""I was going to wait to get the results to have a think about it but I'm still skiing, the accident was never going to put me off."" His mother added: ""It's what he wants to do. It's what drives him and he loves skiing. ""He's had a few races recently and been on the podium, maybe not first but he's nipping at their heels.""

"This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them California's biggest wildfire on record is expected to burn for the rest of the month, fire officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex fire has already engulfed 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles. Barely a third of it is under control, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Firefighters are tackling 18 major blazes across the state amid strong winds and low humidity. The fire - which comprises two blazes in the state's north - was declared the biggest in California's history on Monday. Officials had set a target to extinguish the fire by mid-August, but they now say they will need until early September. The fire is raging through a largely rural area, but it has burned 75 buildings and led to thousands of evacuations. A separate blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more than 1,500 structures. Burning through almost 160,000 acres, it was 47% contained by late Monday. The photos that explain the world's wildfires Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Meanwhile, more fires have been breaking out, adding to the mammoth workload of fire crews. The so-called Holy Fire, in southern California, grew dramatically and rapidly on Monday, with two hikers needing to be airlifted to safety. Allow Twitter content?

At least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but they also receive $2 (Â£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires. Firefighters told the LA Times about their gruelling schedule,external. One said his crew had slept - sitting up - in the seats of their fire engine on some nights. ""It's been pretty crazy - they're calling this the new norm,"" said Omar Estorga, captain of a crew working on the Carr fire. ""In years past, there were one or two big fires a year. Now they're doing three to four huge fires in a week."" Nearly half of the 10 largest California wildfires on record have occurred in the past decade, according to Reuters news agency. It is not yet known how the Mendocino blaze started. However, a flat tyre has been revealed to be the cause of the Carr Fire. Officials said a spark created from the wheel hitting the asphalt on 23 July grew into the deadly fire, which is still raging more than two weeks later. Over the weekend, dry and hot weather allowed the Mendocino Complex fire to make extraordinary gains, jumping across at least four creeks and one major road. A protective fire line - where bulldozers had cut through vegetation to create a barrier - also failed to hold it back. The LA Times said any one of these obstacles could stop a fire, but the bone-dry landscape was being fanned by shifting winds. As the flame moved in different directions, it was hard to predict and, therefore, contain. The Mendocino Complex fire gained pace and territory over the weekend Experts say this year has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned that conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". Unlike hurricanes - which follow an alphabetical list and are named before making landfall - fires are labelled more haphazardly. The dispatch centre or, sometimes, the first crew on the scene comes up with the name, usually taking inspiration from a local landmark. The Carr Fire is so called because it started near Carr Powerhouse Road. Mendocino Complex Fire is located in Mendocino County, and is an amalgamation of two blazes.

"Frank Gardner said the incident at Heathrow Airport was ""so absurd it is actually funny"" The BBC's Frank Gardner has spoken about being left ""stuck on an empty plane"" at Heathrow Airport, for a second time in six months. The security correspondent, who is a wheelchair user, had to wait 30 minutes to disembark from his flight on Monday. The delay was caused by staff locking themselves in a lift which was supposed to help him to the ground, he said. He added: ""It's not deliberate. But unless people like me make a fuss about it, it's not going to be addressed."" A Heathrow spokesperson said the airport had ""apologised to Mr Gardner for the technical fault"", and accepted it ""fell short of our standards"". In March, he was left on a plane at Heathrow for nearly two hours after staff said they had lost his wheelchair. It had been taken to the terminal, rather than the plane door, leaving him stranded. The latest delay for assistance comes after it emerged another wheelchair user was not allowed to board a flight at Belfast International Airport.He was told his wheelchair repair kit could be used to ""dismantle the plane"". Gardner was travelling on a British Airways flight from Krakow, Poland, to London's Heathrow Terminal 5 on Monday evening. The plane arrived early, but was not scheduled to park at a jetty, which allows passengers to walk off a flight without the use of steps. Allow Twitter content?

""Able-bodied passengers were able to walk down the steps to the buses,"" Gardner said. ""I had to wait for a high-lift, which turned up reasonably soon, but the high-lift operators couldn't get it to meet the door of the plane."" Cabin crew were ""very apologetic"", he added. ""They were courteous, they were calm, they were professional."" But after 30 minutes, the ground staff had locked themselves in the lift with Gardner's wheelchair.

The wheelchair had to be dismantled, passed through the lift window, and then reassembled before he was helped down the stairs. ""I'm not cross about it,"" Gardner said. ""But it's just a reminder that Heathrow isn't there yet when it comes to mobility-impaired passengers."" He said the airport had taken his feedback from the incident in March on board. And on Tuesday a Heathrow spokesperson added: ""While this was an isolated technical incident, unrelated to Mr Gardner's previous experience, we accept both fell short of our standards."" They added that changes made to their special assistance service had been ""recognised as 'good' by the regulator, and we continue to invest and make the necessary improvements"" required. Gardner said there had been an ""inverse correlation"" between the helpfulness of people in places with good wheelchair access and countries with nearly no provision. ""In a country like Cambodia, which has almost no facilities, everyone's happy to help.  I've been piggy-backed up the steps to a plane in a pouring rainstorm by the pilot. ""The flip side of that is Frankfurt Airport where I was there in transit, the ground staff had not turned up to help me. ""I could see my wheelchair sitting up at the cockpit. So I used my upper body to transfer myself up seven rows, zigzagging - which hurt like hell - all the way to get to my wheelchair.""

"Argos website warning Stores and shoppers across the UK are reporting a shortage of fans in the midst of unusually hot weather. Customers have found fans to be out of stock in branches of major retailers including Tesco, Argos, Sainsbury's and Wilko. Some have used social media to vent about the difficulties they've faced buying a fan. One London-based shopper said he had to go to seven different stores before he was able to buy one. Steven Bridges, a magician and vlogger, says his mission started at ""a big Sainsbury's in south London"", but he found himself out of luck there, as well as subsequently at M&S, TK Maxx and Next, while Argos only had premium fans available. ""There was nothing up to Â£50, the top end of my fan budget."" Mr Bridges left a further store disappointed before finally securing a fan he'd noticed in the window of a stationery shop. He posted a photo on Twitter to mark the occasion. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wilko confirmed they were short of fans and blamed it on ""increased demand for summer essentials"", resulting in ""record sales"". Pete Hardie, housewares buyer at Wilko, said: ""Sales of our summer essentials, including fans, have been up 90% on our previous best season. ""Top selling items have been stand fans for cooling larger rooms, desk fans for smaller spaces and handheld fans,"" he added. Argos has resorted to posting a warning on its website. When shoppers enter the search term ""fan"", a tailored message informs the customer that fans are ""low in stock."" ""We've really felt the heat this past couple of weeks,"" it reads.

The surge in demand coincides with an extended period of hot weather across the country. The Met Office says the temperature was above 28C somewhere in the UK every day for 15 days from 25th June to 9th July, and for 22 days in total up to 7 August. Though not unprecedented, this is ""obviously an unusual spell of hot weather"", the Met Office added. Many people are turning to fans to cool and ventilate rooms in their homes, as most houses and flats in the UK do not have air conditioning. Figures from a decade ago suggestonly 0.5% of propertiesin Britain had air con installed at the time.

PassengersRuby and James Watson, 28, diedwhen their car crashed into railings and a wall on Kilbourne Road, Belper, Derbyshire, last April. Carly Tomlinson, 24, of Nottingham Road, Belper, previously admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving while unfit through drink. At Nottingham Crown Court earlier, she was jailed for two years. The court heard Tomlinson was almost double the drink-driving limit when she smashed her car into a stone wall in the early hours of 30 April 2017. The mother-of-two had been travelling at 43mph in a 30mph zone. Ruby was ""not properly secured"" in her booster seat and Mr Watson was not wearing a seat belt, the court was told. Both died at the scene. Carly Tomlinson had been travelling at 43mph in a 30mph zone Tomlinson suffered a broken back, pelvis and ribs in the fatal crash and was left in a critical condition in hospital. Her barrister Raglan Ashton said: ""She says 'I will never forgive myself and not a day goes by when I don't think of James and Ruby' and, given the chance, she would put herself in their place."" East Midlands Live: Smoke from plastic pallets fire fills sky; Arrest over 'horrific' assault in park Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told Tomlinson: ""I suspect the physical injury is nothing compared to the emotional damage you have done to yourself. ""You killed your own child and your fiancÃ© - people that you loved and people that loved you. ""You will be haunted by this for the rest of your life."" The crash happened on Kilbourne Road, leading into Belper, Derbyshire Mr Watson's mother Janine Hitchcock said she could not attend court because she was ""so angry"" with ""what she has done to my family"".

Ruby was described as a ""thoughtful friend""with a ""smile for everyone"" by her school. Tomlinson was also disqualified from driving for four years.

"West Midlands Police said nine cars were set ablaze outside HMP Birmingham Two masked men who were ""armed with a firearm"" fled from outside a prison after cars were set on fire nearby. Police said the men made off in a vehicle after nine cars were set ablaze outside HMP Birmingham, which is in the Winson Green area of the city. The BBC understands the masked men were disturbed by G4S security staff, who spotted them spraying liquid on the car roofs in a car park near the jail. West Midlands Fire Service said they were called at 13:24 BST on Tuesday. It said two fire engine crews were sent to tackle the blaze, which was in a car park used by prison staff, and crews had left the scene at about 16:00. Police said they received reports the men were armed with a firearm, but said no injuries had been reported. The masked men made off in a vehicle after the cars were set on fire It is understood the men were challenged before one of them pulled out a weapon similar to a handgun, forcing the G4S staff to back away. The cars were then set alight, with a fire spreading along a row of vehicles, before the masked men escaped through a hole in the fence they had made with an angle grinder. One witness described the blaze as a ""firebomb"" with car tyres popping and windscreens shattering. A company next to the car park said their CCTV captured a group of three men jumping from a Volkswagen Golf, before making their escape five minutes later. Police said no injuries had been reported Det Con James Farrell said prison staff had been left ""alarmed"" by the incident and the motive for the attack was ""unclear"". ""Firearms officers were at the prison within minutes, but the offenders had already fled,"" he added. ""The motive for the attack is unclear, but we are trawling CCTV to trace the car which made off from the scene."" HMP Birmingham director Rob Kellett said: ""Nobody has been injured.

"Tesla's Model S (left) and Model X are both priced at more than $70,000 Tesla boss Elon Musk is considering taking the electric-car firm private, a move he claimed was the ""best path forward"" for the company. He said de-listing from the stock exchange meant Tesla, currently valued at $63.8bn (Â£50bn), would no longer be under the glare of Wall Street. In an unusual move, Mr Musk first made the announcement on Twitter rather than via an official regulatory disclosure. But analysts are sceptical about what would be the biggest buyout in history. Since Tesla floated on the stock market, Mr Musk has clashed with analysts and complained that quarterly scrutiny of the firm's finances encourages short-term thinking. Tesla shares ended the day 11% up at almost $380 per share - close to their all-time high. Mr Musk said shareholders would be offered $420 per share, valuing the business at more than $80bn, including debt. A buyout at that value would make it by far the biggest such deal. The current biggest is the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium that included KKR and TPG. Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game Musk declares Tesla 'a real car company' Tesla to slash thousands of jobs Mr Musk claimed to have secured funding to buy out shareholders, but did not provide details. However, he also warned that ""a final decision has not been made"" about the move. Any buy-out would need a shareholder vote. BBC business editor Simon Jack said that if it emerges that Mr Musk did not have solid financial backing for a buyout he could be in trouble with regulators for share price manipulation.

While Twitter was an unconventional way to make the announcement, the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, allows firms to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter in this way provided investors have been told which social media outlets will be used. In 2013,Tesla flagged Mr Musk's Twitter account as a source of information,external. The firm subsequently shareda message from Mr Musk to employees,externalthat explained the thinking behind his announcement. Mr Musk, who owns almost 20% of the company, said he hoped the move would shield the firm from distracting swings in the share price and the pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. He also said he wanted to end ""negative propaganda"" from short sellers, investors who bet on the shares of a firm going down. ""Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,""he wrote,external. Mr Musk has discussed the drawbacks of being a public company before. But his tweets stirred confusion initially, given his history of informal use of the social media service. For example, on April Fool's Day, he joked on Twitter about Tesla going bankrupt. Mr Musk's plan would allow investors to choose to retain their holdings. He planned to hold onto his shares and hoped to continue as chief executive, he added. Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said Mr Musk had a ""one-in-three chance"" of managing to succeed with his plan. ""The 16% premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivise existing shareholders to support the sale,"" he added. And Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. ""The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elon Musk had better have the money lined up to take Tesla private or he could be in serious trouble with regulators. There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each. The shares surged, which will have left the people who have been betting the shares would fall nursing very heavy losses. It will have given Mr Musk great pleasure to get one over on the naysayers. But he's playing a potentially dangerous game. If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation. It's a very serious charge, which can land you in jail. Read Simon's blog. Mr Musk's disclosure stirred further speculation about Tesla's future. The firm is spending heavily as it ramps up production of its latest car, the Model 3. It reported a record loss in its most recent quarter, and some analysts say it will need to raise money in order to survive. However, Mr Musk has said he has no plans to do so and promised that the firm will be profitable in the second half of the year, barring any unforeseen events. The tweets came after a separate report in the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had taken a 3%-5% stake in Tesla, a holding worth at least $1.9bn. The article said the state fund, overseen by the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been interested in buying newly issued shares.

"A teenager who was given a 1% chance of full recovery after a skiing accident has achieved seven As in his exams. Ross Nesbitt, 16, was training with Glasgow ski racing team in Austria in December 2016 when he crashed and hit his head on a fence post, leaving him in a coma. He spent a month in hospital in Innsbruck and a further six-and-a-half weeks in Scottish hospitals. He had to learn how to walk, talk and eat again. Ross returned to Williamwood High School in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, in May last year and is now celebrating seven As and a B in his National 5 exams. He said: ""I was pretty pleased, I was really not expecting that, but happy to get the results."" Scottish exam pass rate 'stable' His mother Wilma said: ""I was working when he got his text but I believe he jumped out of his skin and was so pleased. We're just absolutely ecstatic with his results. ""It was really touch and go at times, we didn't know whether we were going to get our boy back but it didn't take very long before there were signs that Ross was improving. Ross Nesbitt said he was not expecting his seven A grades ""The first thing was switching on his mobile phone and putting his code in, and we knew he was still with us, but he had quite a long time recovering. ""He had to learn to swallow, how to walk and talk again. He had lost 18kgs (2.8 stone) in weight over the initial period and had a tube in his stomach to feed him, so it's remarkable with the help of all the team at the Children's Hospital in Glasgow that we walked out of there."" Ross initially returned to school for a couple of days a week and also had extra tutoring with teachers to help him catch up. Speaking about the accident and his recovery, he said: ""I was heading down to the lift and decided to take a shortcut off the track of the slope and hit a lot of snow and flew forward and banged my head on a fence post. ""I had to relearn how to walk and talk and do basic things again. ""I knew when I went back to school they weren't going to make me do the S3 exams, so I didn't have that pressure on me. The school were really helpful."" Ross will return to Williamwood next week for fifth year. ""I've not really thought much about what I want to do,"" he said. ""I was going to wait to get the results to have a think about it but I'm still skiing, the accident was never going to put me off."" His mother added: ""It's what he wants to do. It's what drives him and he loves skiing. ""He's had a few races recently and been on the podium, maybe not first but he's nipping at their heels.""

"Increases in life expectancy in the UK have stalled and the slowdown is one of the biggest among 20 of the world's leading economies, ONS data shows. Rises in life expectancy dropped from 12.9 weeks per year for women from 2006 to 2011 to 1.2 weeks per year from 2011 to 2016, its report found. This increase in life expectancy for women was the lowest of the 20 nations, while for men only the US was worse. There was also a slowdown in other countries across Europe and Australia. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Throughout the 20th Century, the UK experienced steady improvements in life expectancy at birth. This has been attributed to healthier habits among the population as it ages, such as reduced smoking rates and improvements in treating infectious illnesses and conditions such as heart disease. But in recent years the progress has slowed. TheONS's analysis,externalfound the slowdown in life-expectancy improvement in the UK was most pronounced in women, dropping by 90% from 12.9 weeks per year from 2006 to 2011 to 1.2 weeks from 2011 to 2012 - the biggest reduction in all of the countries it analysed. For men, this was down 76% from 17.3 to 4.2 weeks. The ONS said the fall among men was in part due to a significant increase in male life expectancy between 2001 and 2011. As of 2016, a female baby born in the UK would on average be expected to live until 82.9, while a boy would be predicted to live until 79.2. Sir Steve Webb, former Liberal Democrat pensions minister and director of policy at the insurance provider Royal London, said: ""The UK has slumped from being one of the strongest performers when it comes to improving life expectancy to bottom of the league. ""There is a real human cost behind these statistics and we urgently need to understand more about why this is happening."" Prof Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he and other academics had for some time been voicing concern about the slowing rate of improvement in life expectancy. He said the data refuted one of the criticisms of their work - that the UK's slowdown was not unusual compared with other countries. Prof McKee said: ""It is not possible, with these data, to draw a conclusion about the reasons why the UK is performing so poorly. ""Our previous research has provided some pointers, suggesting the need to look in more detail at some consequences of austerity. ""What is in no doubt is the importance that the research needed to explain what we are now seeing is undertaken as soon as possible."" By BBC News health editor Hugh Pym Life expectancy has been rising in recent decades - but from 2011 the rate of increase started to slow in many countries. Now we know that slowdown has been more pronounced in the UK compared with several other leading economies. So the question arises: Are there factors peculiar to the UK at work? Some academics argue that government austerity policies must have played a part, for example cuts in social care budgets in England. They are calling for a parliamentary inquiry with experts giving evidence. Ministers say no such causation can be proved. Some will point out the US has seen a similar slowdown with a very different set of economic policies. This ONS report is the first such international analysis for a while and raises big questions about health outcomes and government policy in the UK. The ONS also analysed mortality rates - the number of deaths divided by the population - across the UK nations and found a similar slowdown in improvement between 2011 and 2016. For men, the improvement slowed most in England and Wales, though progress has also stalled in Northern Ireland and Scotland. For women, mortality rates increased slightly in Wales and showed no improvement in Northern Ireland. In England and Scotland, the mortality rates for women fell slightly. The UK was also at the bottom of the table for life expectancy improvements for men and women at 65 years old. However, Japan saw a big improvement, while there were also increases for the Scandinavian countries such as Norway, Denmark and Finland. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""These latest stats show that life expectancy is increasing and we are committed to helping people live healthier lives. ""The recent trends in life expectancy and mortality in the UK are also evident in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia - we want to understand these changing trends, which is why we have asked Public Health England to review this. ""As part of our long-term plan for the NHS, we are increasing funding by an average 3.4% per year - meaning that by 2023-24 it will receive Â£20.5bn a year more than it currently does.""

"The couple's sexual exploitation case shocked Germany (faces blurred for legal reasons) A woman who sold her son to paedophiles on the dark net has been jailed for 12 years and six months by a court in southern Germany. The Freiburg court also jailed her partner, the boy's stepfather, for 12 years. The boy was nine when the trial began in June. The German nationals, 48 and 39 years old, had sexually abused the boy themselves for at least two years. The dark net is an internet area beyond the reach of mainstream search engines. On Monday, the court jailed a Spanish man for 10 years for sexually abusing the boy repeatedly. Five other men have also been prosecuted in connection with the abuse. The couple were found guilty of rape, aggravated sexual assault of children, forced prostitution and distribution of child pornography. The boy is now living with foster parents. The couple must now pay â¬42,500 (Â£38,000; $49,200) in damages to the boy and to a three-year-old girl, who was also abused by them. The defendants (L and C): Faces are not shown because of strict German privacy law What is the dark web and is it a threat? Internet can be 'paedophile playground' How a BBC reader snared a paedophile What happened to the boy, who is now aged 10, shocked even experienced investigators, reports the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. Prosecutors say the boy was subjected to more than 60 serious sex attacks, many of which were filmed. The case has horrified Germany, not least because the authorities - who knew that the mother's partner was a convicted paedophile - missed opportunities to rescue the boy, our correspondent says. On Tuesday the judge told the boy's mother that she had carried out one of the most brutal sexual attacks. The trial has also raised concerns that officials might sometimes wrongly presume that a woman is incapable of abusing her own child. German media report that child welfare authorities in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg state have been heavily criticised for failing to stop the couple's abuse. The boy had been removed from the couple temporarily by social workers, but was then handed back to them. Spiegel news website reports that welfare officers had not exchanged information about the case that could have led them to the couple's crimes. According to case psychiatrist Hartmut Pleines, quoted by Spiegel, the mother's claim that she was in thrall to her partner when she committed the abuse was false. She did not explain her actions, but her partner did speak a lot in court during the two-month trial, Spiegel reported.

"Ben Stokes arrives at Bristol Crown Court for the second day of his trial England cricketer Ben Stokes was ""spiteful and angry"" towards a bouncer before he was involved in a fight with two men, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder is one of three men accused of fighting in Bristol on 25 September. Bristol Crown Court previously heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by 27-year-old Mr Stokes. They also deny affray and are on trial alongside the cricketer. Giving evidence, bouncer Andrew Cunningham said Mr Stokes became abusive after he was refused entry back into Mbargo nightclub just after 02:00 BST. Mr Stokes and his team-mate Alex Hales had left the nightclub at 00:46 but returned at 02:08. Mr Cunningham said he explained to them the club was closed and they would not be allowed to enter. He told the jury Mr Stokes offered him Â£300 to be let in, but after he refused the all-rounder became ""spiteful and angry"" and insulted Mr Cunningham's gold teeth and tattoos. Det Con Daniel Adams said CCTV footage played in court showed Mr Stokes flicking a V-sign at Mr Cunningham. However, the cricketer's barrister Gordon Cole QC said it was not accepted that Mr Stokes had made the gesture. Ryan Ali (left) and Ryan Hale have also pleaded not guilty to affray The CCTV also shows two men, William O'Connor and Kai Barry, leaving the club in the Clifton Triangle area of the city and the pair engaging in conversation with Mr Stokes and Mr Hales. Prosecutors sayMr Stokes mocked the two ""openly gay"" men outside the venue. However, Mr Cole said Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor, who had both been inside the club, had been ""taking the mickey"" out of his client's shoes. Referring to the CCTV, Det Con Adams told jurors Mr Stokes had ""mimicked the actions"" of Mr O'Connor and then ""flicked something which we believe was a cigarette butt"" at him. Mr Cunningham described Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor as ""effeminate"" and ""flamboyant"" and told the court Mr Stokes had ""made noises"" and ""camp hand gestures"" to mock them. He said he told Mr Stokes: ""If you are going to start on someone, start on me."" The bouncer continued: ""When I said this [Mr Hales] looked a bit confused. ""I explained to him what he had done. He turned to his friend and said 'Stokesy don't do that'."" This video can not be played Ben Stokes and Alex Hales are seen on CCTV outside the nightclub Mr Cunningham said that before leaving the club area Mr Stokes shook hands with his door supervisor colleague but he refused to do so. ""He went to shake mine and I had no reason to shake his hand,"" he said. ""They left and walked up the road."" Mr Cunningham denied he had been aggressive towards Mr Stokes and Mr Hales when they returned to the club. During cross-examination, Mr Cole said: ""You were rude in the way you spoke to them. They then stood outside for quite some time laughing and joking. ""They were laughing and joking with Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry."" Mr Cunningham replied: ""Definitely not. I never became aggressive. They were laughing and joking at them, not with them."" Mr Cole suggested there was an exchange of ""mickey taking"" and ""banter"" between Mr Stokes and Mr Hales and the two gay men. But Mr Cunningham replied: ""That's not how I would call it."" Andrew Cunningham said Mr Stokes became abusive after he was refused entry into a nightclub Stephen Mooney, representing Mr Ali, asked Mr Cunningham whether Mr Stokes and Mr Hales had treated him with ""respect and courtesy"". ""No,"" the doorman replied. The court has heard Mr Stokes knocked out both Mr Hale and Mr Ali when he and Mr Hales caught up with them, and Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry, on a nearby street. Mr Ali is said to have threatened Mr Hales with a bottle, while Mr Hale is alleged to have pulled a metal pole from a street sign and brought it to the scene. Mr Stokes claims he was acting in self-defence and took action after his co-defendants were homophobic towards Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry. The fight took place after Mr Stokes was turned away from Mbargo nightclub, the court heard The jury was shown video footage recorded by film student Max Wilson, who said he began filming after he heard a commotion and ""thought there was a fight about to break out"". ""Someone shoved another person,"" he said. The six men sounded like ""football hooligans"" and were ""clearly drunk"", he added. In the footage Mr Wilson was heard to swear after a punch was thrown. Asked why he reacted in that way, he replied: ""It was such a forceful punch. It just took me by surprise. ""I felt a little bit sorry about the lad that had been punched and it looked like he had his hands up."" Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against West Indies at the city's County Ground. The trial continues.

"More families are paying for internet-streamed movies and TV shows The use of commercial video streaming services has surged ahead in Great Britain, according to official figures. Close to half of all adults,externalsaid they had watched Netflix, Now TV, Amazon Prime Video or a similar internet-based service over the past three months. That compares to less than a third of respondents in 2016, the last time the figure was given. The data is contained in the Office for National Statistics' annual Internet Access and Use report. The study also indicates that the percentage of households with some kind of internet access has not changed since last year, remaining at 90%. But it does suggest that usage has increased, with 86% of over-16s reporting that they use the net daily or almost every day. The prior year, the figure was 80%. In addition, for the first time the survey says that 100% of households with children living in them have internet access. Sending and receiving emails remains the most popular task, with 84% of adults saying they had done this over the past quarter. But the activities that saw the biggest gains over the past two years were: watching video-on-demand from commercial services - 46% had done so over the last three months, up from 29% in 2016 watching videos from YouTube and similar platforms - 62%, up from 47% listening to net-streamed music - 58%, up from 49% internet banking - 69%, up from 60% selling goods or services over the internet - 25%, up from 18% One media industry analyst said the growing popularity of online TV had meant providers were having to adapt their offerings. ""If you look at the breakdown of who is using these services, it's starting to bleed outside the younger tech-savvy audiences and getting traction among older groups as well,"" commented Tom Harrington from Enders Analysis. ""You can see that reflected in the types of programming being made available, with Netflix and others commissioning original shows pitched at more mature audiences."" He added, however, that the market was set to become more competitive. Sky is set to make all its content available online; Apple is expected to launch a TV subscription service soon; and Disney may expand the content available via its DisneyLife app following the takeover of 21st Century Fox. The ONS report also points to some differences in internet use between the sexes. Women appear to be more engaged with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, with 69% saying they had recently used them. By contrast the figure for men was 60%. A higher proportion of women reported making video or voice calls over the net, but a greater percentage of men said they streamed music However, while 69% of men said they had recently watched videos on YouTube or a similar service, the figure for women was 56%. The study also finds women are more likely to have reported searching online for health-related information, while it seems men are more likely to have downloaded and played video games. The data is based on answers given to the ONS' Opinions and Lifestyle Survey between January and April. The sample size was 2,750 people.

"Frank Gardner said the incident at Heathrow Airport was ""so absurd it is actually funny"" The BBC's Frank Gardner has spoken about being left ""stuck on an empty plane"" at Heathrow Airport, for a second time in six months. The security correspondent, who is a wheelchair user, had to wait 30 minutes to disembark from his flight on Monday. The delay was caused by staff locking themselves in a lift which was supposed to help him to the ground, he said. He added: ""It's not deliberate. But unless people like me make a fuss about it, it's not going to be addressed."" A Heathrow spokesperson said the airport had ""apologised to Mr Gardner for the technical fault"", and accepted it ""fell short of our standards"". In March, he was left on a plane at Heathrow for nearly two hours after staff said they had lost his wheelchair. It had been taken to the terminal, rather than the plane door, leaving him stranded. The latest delay for assistance comes after it emerged another wheelchair user was not allowed to board a flight at Belfast International Airport.He was told his wheelchair repair kit could be used to ""dismantle the plane"". Gardner was travelling on a British Airways flight from Krakow, Poland, to London's Heathrow Terminal 5 on Monday evening. The plane arrived early, but was not scheduled to park at a jetty, which allows passengers to walk off a flight without the use of steps. Allow Twitter content?

""Able-bodied passengers were able to walk down the steps to the buses,"" Gardner said. ""I had to wait for a high-lift, which turned up reasonably soon, but the high-lift operators couldn't get it to meet the door of the plane."" Cabin crew were ""very apologetic"", he added. ""They were courteous, they were calm, they were professional."" But after 30 minutes, the ground staff had locked themselves in the lift with Gardner's wheelchair. The journalist tweeted: ""This is so absurd it is actually funny."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The wheelchair had to be dismantled, passed through the lift window, and then reassembled before he was helped down the stairs. ""I'm not cross about it,"" Gardner said.

"Parents were advised food wasn't always what a baby needed Changing the way that parents interact with their infants could help combat child obesity, a US study suggests. New mothers were offered ways of responding to babies' needs, including avoiding comforting with food. By the age of three, children exposed to so-called ""responsive parenting"" had lower body mass index (BMI). A UK child health expert said the study showed a small, early intervention could have long-term benefit. Eating and sleeping behaviours are established early. And if food is used to soothe or reward in infants, rather than just when they are hungry, that child may then use food to soothe their distress in later life and it could lead to them being obese. In the study, published inthe Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA),,externalnurses advised 279 first-time mothers - in their homes in the first six months after birth, and at a clinic at one and two years - on how to respond to their child's needs. The team focused on mothers because they tend to have the leading role in caring for infants in their first months and years, The advice included instructions on: sleep routines alternatives to feeding for calming a fussy infant recognising signals from the child of being hungry or full focusing on physical activities The children were then checked at the age of three. Those whose mothers had been coached in responsive parenting techniques were found to have lower BMIs. Girls were affected more than boys by the intervention. Researchers will continue to monitor them up to the age of nine. Ian Paul, from Penn State University, who led the study, said it was about coaching the mother to ""recognise their child's cues and needs"", and respond with a ""developmentally appropriate response in a prompt fashion"". ""With such high rates [of obesity] already among toddlers, it made sense during such a developmentally important time of infancy to begin to establish healthy behaviours. ""Based on our growth charts, 20-25% of two- to five-year-olds are already overweight or obese. It's a major problem, a tough nut to crack. ""Children who are overweight or obese at an early age have a much increased risk of staying overweight or obese as they get older."" But a ""lifelong approach"" was needed to break the obesity cycle. ""Overweight children become overweight parents who have overweight children â¦ so where in the cycle do you intervene? ""In our current environment, there needs to be a lifelong approach"". Figures in the UK show a similar problem. Nearly a quarter of children in England are obese or overweight by the time they start primary school and a third by the time they leave aged 11. Prof Neena Modi, professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London and former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said: ""This shows that you can achieve small but sustained impact from an intervention that starts early in infancy, and that the effect carries through to three years. ""The real question for policy makers is what can you do to sustain this? ""We know that the power of an early intervention is going to decline with time. ""How can we reinforce the good beginning?""

"This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? US President Donald Trump has issued a strong warning to anyone trading with Iran, following his re-imposition of sanctions on the country. ""Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,"" the president tweeted. Some re-imposed sanctions took effect overnight and tougher ones relating to oil exports will begin in November. Iran's president said the measures were ""psychological warfare"" which aimed to ""sow division among Iranians"". Iran nuclear deal: Key details The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Firms face legal risk over Iran sanctions The sanctions follow theUS withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, earlier this year. The deal, negotiated during the presidency of Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Mr Trump has called the deal ""one-sided"", ""disastrous"" and the ""worst I've ever seen"". Hebelieves renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal,external. The European Union, which remains committed to the original agreement, has spoken out against the sanctions, vowing to protect firms doing ""legitimate business"" with Iran.

On Monday he had said that Iran faced a choice to ""either change its threatening, destabilising behaviour and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation"". ""I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities, including its ballistic missile programme and its support for terrorism,"" he said.

""They want to launch psychological warfare against the Iranian nation."" he said. ""Negotiations with sanctions doesn't make sense. We are always in favour of diplomacy and talks... but talks need honesty."" The foreign ministers of Germany, the UK and France released a statement on Monday that said the nuclear deal remained ""crucial"" to global security. They also unveiled a ""blocking statute"", which is intended to protect European firms doing business with Iran despite the new US sanctions. Alistair Burt, the UK's minister of state for the Middle East, told the BBC: ""If a company fears legal action taken against it and enforcement action taken against it by an entity in response to American sanctions, then that company can be protected as far as EU legislation is concerned."" He said Iran would simply ""batten down the hatches"" until the next US election. However, German car and lorry maker Daimler, which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, confirmed this week that it has now ceased activities in the country. Iran has already seenunrest since last December over a poorly-performing economy. Rising food prices, unemployment and even poor water supplies have led to protests in a number of cities. Demonstrations in Tehran in June were said to be the capital's biggest since 2012. This video can not be played Tehran saw large-scale economic protests in June How much they are tied to the new US sanctions policy is hard to determine, but one definite link is the effect on Iran's currency. It lost around half of its value after Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Iran acted by easing its foreign exchange rules on Sunday, and the rial has strengthened by 20% since then. Iranians have been hoarding gold as a safeguard, pushing it to a record high in Tehran. The sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the US blocks Iranian oil sales. This could halt about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day, although Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat. The International Monetary Fund said in March that Iran's net official reserves could decline this year to $97.8bn, which would finance about 13 months of imports. And analysts at BMI Research say Iran's economy could contract by 4.3% in 2019. However, Barbara Slavin, of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council,told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat when sanctions hit hard, it often means ordinary people become ""totally dependent"" on their government and so sanctions do not tend to topple regimes. As the first tranche of new US sanctions kicks in, young Iranians have been sharing their stories with BBC Persian.  Many are already feeling the effects, as the economy had slowed down in anticipation of what was to come. ""I used to work in marketing for a home appliance manufacturer,"" said Peyman. ""I lost my job as the company can't import the components."" Aerospace engineer Ali lost his job of 13 years because his company couldn't import equipment.

"The couple's sexual exploitation case shocked Germany (faces blurred for legal reasons) A woman who sold her son to paedophiles on the dark net has been jailed for 12 years and six months by a court in southern Germany. The Freiburg court also jailed her partner, the boy's stepfather, for 12 years. The boy was nine when the trial began in June. The German nationals, 48 and 39 years old, had sexually abused the boy themselves for at least two years. The dark net is an internet area beyond the reach of mainstream search engines. On Monday, the court jailed a Spanish man for 10 years for sexually abusing the boy repeatedly. Five other men have also been prosecuted in connection with the abuse. The couple were found guilty of rape, aggravated sexual assault of children, forced prostitution and distribution of child pornography. The boy is now living with foster parents. The couple must now pay â¬42,500 (Â£38,000; $49,200) in damages to the boy and to a three-year-old girl, who was also abused by them. The defendants (L and C): Faces are not shown because of strict German privacy law What is the dark web and is it a threat? Internet can be 'paedophile playground' How a BBC reader snared a paedophile What happened to the boy, who is now aged 10, shocked even experienced investigators, reports the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. Prosecutors say the boy was subjected to more than 60 serious sex attacks, many of which were filmed. The case has horrified Germany, not least because the authorities - who knew that the mother's partner was a convicted paedophile - missed opportunities to rescue the boy, our correspondent says. On Tuesday the judge told the boy's mother that she had carried out one of the most brutal sexual attacks. The trial has also raised concerns that officials might sometimes wrongly presume that a woman is incapable of abusing her own child. German media report that child welfare authorities in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg state have been heavily criticised for failing to stop the couple's abuse. The boy had been removed from the couple temporarily by social workers, but was then handed back to them. Spiegel news website reports that welfare officers had not exchanged information about the case that could have led them to the couple's crimes. According to case psychiatrist Hartmut Pleines, quoted by Spiegel, the mother's claim that she was in thrall to her partner when she committed the abuse was false. She did not explain her actions, but her partner did speak a lot in court during the two-month trial, Spiegel reported.

"This video can not be played A disabled man was unable to board a flight from Belfast because his wheelchair repair kit was deemed a security risk. A disabled man was unable to board a flight from Belfast because his wheelchair repair kit was deemed a security risk. Steve Smithers, 48, was turned away at security and missed his flight to see his sick father, who is about to start treatment for cancer. He said staff claimed the spanners could be used to ""dismantle the plane"". Belfast International Airport has apologised and will make a donation to a charity on Mr Smithers' behalf. The repair kit, which he said was essential for wheelchair users, contains several spanners and a wheel nut. Mr Smithers says he has never had trouble at security with his tool kit before ""When I booked this trip, all I wanted to do was to get to see my seriously-ill father,"" said Mr Smithers, who is paralysed from the chest down after a motorbike accident. ""I have travelled extensively over the 11 years I have been paralysed and there have never been any problems preventing me from doing so independently."" Mr Smithers, who lives in Killinchy, County Down, has had to postpone his trip to Essex to visit his 76-year-old father Joe until the end of August, but he does not want to fly again. Mr Smithers said the security gate supervisor at Belfast International Airport, near Templepatrick in County Antrim, told him he would have to put his bag with the tool kit - which also contained his catheter and diabetes medication - in the hold. But, he said, the security supervisor also told him if he put his bag in the hold he would not have time to make it back through security in time for his flight. Mr Smithers said when he suggested he could give the spanners to the cabin crew until landing, security said this was also not possible. ""I just wanted someone to listen to me,"" said Mr Smithers. He said that he was a seasoned traveller, having travelled to Australia and the United States on his own, but has never been refused access through security before. Essential medicines even if they exceed 100ml, including inhalers and liquid foodstuffs Supporting documentation -  a copy of the prescription or a doctor's letter - is required Security staff may open the containers to screen the liquids Medical equipment if considered essential Again documentation is needed and security staff will screen the equipment separately. Source:GOV.UK,external In a statement, a spokesperson for Belfast International said it acknowledged Mr Smithers had a distressing experience at the airport security search point. ""As the treatment experienced by Mr Smithers during this process fell well below standards expected from security personnel, in order to remedy this, the airport will be immediately reviewing customer service and escalation procedures with our security provider ICTS,""  it said. Mr Smithers said he tried to explain to security that he needed the tool kit in case his wheels broke and that he would need to adjust his wheelchair to fit a hire car he had booked for his arrival at Gatwick. When he rang the car hire company, it confirmed there were no mechanics on site and would not be able to make the adjustments for him when he arrived. Steve Smithers says he will not fly again after his experience His partner Lisa Clydesdale, 39, said he was ""literally in tears"" trying to explain his predicament. He said he had no choice but to miss his flight. Both EasyJet and the car hire company have refunded him in full. EasyJet also offered compensation to apologise for a delay retrieving his baggage. Belfast International Airport contacted Mr Smithers to apologise and offer him compensation, but Ms Clydesdale said they suggested the airport donate to a disability charity instead. ""For disabled people it is not about asking for special treatment, but simply wanting the opportunity to live life as unimpaired by our disabilities as is possible, and to be allowed to do so with dignity,"" said Mr Smithers. ""On this occasion, it was particularly pertinent for me as this was the last opportunity I would have to see my father before he starts chemotherapy but no disabled person should have to experience this, regardless of the circumstances for their trip.""

"This video can not be played People smuggling gang convicted Six men have been found guilty of trying to smuggle Albanian migrants in overcrowded boats across the English Channel. The operation, which was mainly based in Dymchurch, in Kent, was uncovered following a series of blunders. Police moved on the gang after they turned to three-person jet skis. Father and son Leonard and Alfie Powell were convicted at the Old Bailey alongside Wayne Bath, Albert Letchford, Sabah Dulaj and Artur Nutaj. Another son, George Powell, entered a guilty plea for his part in the conspiracy on 15 May. Two other men - Alan Viles, 27, from Folkestone, and Francis Wade, 59, from Rochester - were found not guilty. The nine-week trial heard how one boat linked to the Kent-based gang had to be rescued after nearly sinking. It was built for six people but had 20 people onboard, including 18 Albanian migrants. Another boat had to be rescued after it was found travelling the wrong way up a shipping lane, and had run out of fuel. Had the gang not been stopped by a National Crime Agency-led (NCA) surveillance operation, they would have been the first to have tried to run migrants across the world's busiest shipping route on jet-skis. Six men were found guilty - Top row left to right: Bath, Dulaj, Letchford / Bottom row left to right: Nutaj, Alfie Powell, Leonard Powell NCA senior investigator Mark McCormack raised concerns about the gang's ""level of incompetency"". He said: ""We have people controlling vessels with no maritime experience, no sailing experience, who have completed very rudimentary courses of one or two days, trying to cross this busy shipping channel at night in a small vessel not utilising lights or radar."" The court heard that migrants, including men, women and children, were charged up to Â£6,000 each to journey across the Channel from near Calais. The gang are believed to have carried out one successful trip in a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) called Rebel, which was found abandoned on the beach at Dymchurch with children's life jackets on board on 11 May 2016. When border officials went to investigate, the professed owner, Wayne Bath, claimed to have been out ""night fishing"" when he experienced engine trouble. 'Rebel', a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, was found abandoned at Dymchurch Two weeks later, French police spotted a group of people signalling a boat in the water off Cran d'Escalles beach near Calais. The migrants began to wade out to meet it, but the Antares RHIB left after a parked car signalled using its headlights. Prosecutor Timothy Probert-Wood QC told jurors they were ""clearly not there for a day on the beach"". Migrant boat operation 'a lucrative scam' Smuggling accused 'unaware' of boat rescue Smuggling accused 'refused to help boat' Two days later, the gang tried again with the newly acquired White Scanner RHIB, under the watch of NCA agents. It picked up 18 migrants from France - including two children aged 16 and 17 and a woman - but ran out of fuel on the return journey, forcing the migrants to bale out as the vessel flooded with water. They were rescued by the coastguard helicopter and RNLI. White Scanner's two-man crew, Mark Stribling, 35, from Farningham, and Robert Stilwell, 33, from Dartford,were jailedin July 2016. Migrants were brought across in small boats, the court heard The gang then bought another larger boat on which the NCA planted a bug to listen to them plotting their next migrant run. Following a failed attempt on 25 July due to rough seas, the NCA secretly filmed a meeting of the gang after which they bought a jet-ski. They were arrested before the jet-ski could be brought into use. All eight defendants had denied conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Mr Viles and Mr Wade said they had done favours or jobs for the group, unaware of the people smuggling operation. Albanian nationals Dulaj and Nutaj acted as ""travel agents"", finding people who wanted to go to the UK. Leonard Powell, 66, of Hilltop Farm, Farningham, Alfie Powell, 39, of Button Lane, Swanley, Bath, 38, of Sea Approach, Warden, Letchford, 42, of Rochester Road, Gravesend, Dulaj, 23, of Hospital Way, Catford, south-east London, and Nutaj, 39, of Wheatley Gardens, Edmonton, north London, will be sentenced with George Powell, of Hilltop Farm, Farningham, on 21 September.

"Ben Stokes arrives at Bristol Crown Court for the second day of his trial England cricketer Ben Stokes was ""spiteful and angry"" towards a bouncer before he was involved in a fight with two men, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder is one of three men accused of fighting in Bristol on 25 September. Bristol Crown Court previously heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by 27-year-old Mr Stokes. They also deny affray and are on trial alongside the cricketer. Giving evidence, bouncer Andrew Cunningham said Mr Stokes became abusive after he was refused entry back into Mbargo nightclub just after 02:00 BST. Mr Stokes and his team-mate Alex Hales had left the nightclub at 00:46 but returned at 02:08. Mr Cunningham said he explained to them the club was closed and they would not be allowed to enter. He told the jury Mr Stokes offered him Â£300 to be let in, but after he refused the all-rounder became ""spiteful and angry"" and insulted Mr Cunningham's gold teeth and tattoos. Det Con Daniel Adams said CCTV footage played in court showed Mr Stokes flicking a V-sign at Mr Cunningham. However, the cricketer's barrister Gordon Cole QC said it was not accepted that Mr Stokes had made the gesture. Ryan Ali (left) and Ryan Hale have also pleaded not guilty to affray The CCTV also shows two men, William O'Connor and Kai Barry, leaving the club in the Clifton Triangle area of the city and the pair engaging in conversation with Mr Stokes and Mr Hales. Prosecutors sayMr Stokes mocked the two ""openly gay"" men outside the venue. However, Mr Cole said Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor, who had both been inside the club, had been ""taking the mickey"" out of his client's shoes. Referring to the CCTV, Det Con Adams told jurors Mr Stokes had ""mimicked the actions"" of Mr O'Connor and then ""flicked something which we believe was a cigarette butt"" at him. Mr Cunningham described Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor as ""effeminate"" and ""flamboyant"" and told the court Mr Stokes had ""made noises"" and ""camp hand gestures"" to mock them. He said he told Mr Stokes: ""If you are going to start on someone, start on me."" The bouncer continued: ""When I said this [Mr Hales] looked a bit confused. ""I explained to him what he had done. He turned to his friend and said 'Stokesy don't do that'."" This video can not be played Ben Stokes and Alex Hales are seen on CCTV outside the nightclub Mr Cunningham said that before leaving the club area Mr Stokes shook hands with his door supervisor colleague but he refused to do so. ""He went to shake mine and I had no reason to shake his hand,"" he said. ""They left and walked up the road."" Mr Cunningham denied he had been aggressive towards Mr Stokes and Mr Hales when they returned to the club. During cross-examination, Mr Cole said: ""You were rude in the way you spoke to them. They then stood outside for quite some time laughing and joking. ""They were laughing and joking with Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry."" Mr Cunningham replied: ""Definitely not. I never became aggressive. They were laughing and joking at them, not with them."" Mr Cole suggested there was an exchange of ""mickey taking"" and ""banter"" between Mr Stokes and Mr Hales and the two gay men. But Mr Cunningham replied: ""That's not how I would call it."" Andrew Cunningham said Mr Stokes became abusive after he was refused entry into a nightclub Stephen Mooney, representing Mr Ali, asked Mr Cunningham whether Mr Stokes and Mr Hales had treated him with ""respect and courtesy"". ""No,"" the doorman replied. The court has heard Mr Stokes knocked out both Mr Hale and Mr Ali when he and Mr Hales caught up with them, and Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry, on a nearby street. Mr Ali is said to have threatened Mr Hales with a bottle, while Mr Hale is alleged to have pulled a metal pole from a street sign and brought it to the scene. Mr Stokes claims he was acting in self-defence and took action after his co-defendants were homophobic towards Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry. The fight took place after Mr Stokes was turned away from Mbargo nightclub, the court heard The jury was shown video footage recorded by film student Max Wilson, who said he began filming after he heard a commotion and ""thought there was a fight about to break out"". ""Someone shoved another person,"" he said. The six men sounded like ""football hooligans"" and were ""clearly drunk"", he added. In the footage Mr Wilson was heard to swear after a punch was thrown. Asked why he reacted in that way, he replied: ""It was such a forceful punch. It just took me by surprise. ""I felt a little bit sorry about the lad that had been punched and it looked like he had his hands up."" Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against West Indies at the city's County Ground. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Cleaner Willan Arias Bermeo: ""My pay is too low to live in London"" Cleaners at the Ministry of Justice and a London council have gone on strike over pay, saying they cannot afford to live in the capital. The workers, mostly migrants, want to be paid the London Living Wage, over Â£2-an-hour more than their current pay. One cleaner, at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said he had taken a second job and now worked 13-hour days so he had enough money. The Ministry of Justice said its cleaners were ""valued colleagues"". The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) Council said it intended to take the cleaning services back under control from the contractor Amey, and would ""review all the associated costs and services at that time"". The cleaners on strike - who work at the Ministry of Justice, RBKC and private health providers - are currently paid the National Living Wage, at Â£7.83 per hour for those aged 25 and over. One RBKC cleaner, Willan Arias Bermeo, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was struggling to afford to live in London despite having taken a second job. ""My situation is very difficult. I have to work very hard to get a good life here,"" he said. The cleaners' protested outside the Ministry of Justice ""That is the reason every day Monday to Saturday I work, 13 to 14 hours per day."" He said after paying his rent, transport costs, bills and sending money to support his family in his home country, he was left with Â£100-per-month to live on. He described the strikes as ""our chance"" for change. ""Otherwise... there is no hope for us."" Petros Elia said the cleaners' strike was ""unprecedented"" The United Voices of the World Union, which organised the strikes, said the dispute also included issues over the lack of an occupational sick pay scheme and parity with the pay of directly employed staff. It founder Petros Elia said the cleaners were ""really leading the way, showing what can be done if workers come together. ""These strikes are unprecedented, they're really demanding a wage they can live on."" The RBKC told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it does ""not control what Amey [the contractor] pays their own staff"". But Mr Elia claimed this was a ""lie"". ""They [the council] set the price, they decide the cleaners' wages, the cleaners' terms and conditions,"" he said. Emma Dent Coad said Kensington and Chelsea Council can afford for workers to be paid the London Living Wage Emma Dent Coad, Labour MP for Kensington, added that the case had been made to the council to pay its workers the London Living Wage for the past ""eight years"". ""Every time we've brought it to the council, the argument has been, 'We can't afford it, it will cost Â£1m a year to pay all our [contractors' staff] the London Living Wage,'"" she said. ""They choose to subsidise opera and other things for the same amount,"" she added, ""but they won't actually pay people a living wage so they don't have to rely on benefits."" Amey said in a statement that it was ""committed to the wellbeing of its employees. ""We have a number of agreements with councils to pay the London Living Wage. ""[Kensington and Chelsea Council] made no such request and so the staff on this contract currently receive the National Living Wage."" Regarding its dispute over pay, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said its cleaners were ""valued colleagues"". It added: ""We strictly enforce the Living Wage in all our contracts but specific pay and terms are for employers to agree directly with their employees.""

"A teenager who was given a 1% chance of full recovery after a skiing accident has achieved seven As in his exams. Ross Nesbitt, 16, was training with Glasgow ski racing team in Austria in December 2016 when he crashed and hit his head on a fence post, leaving him in a coma. He spent a month in hospital in Innsbruck and a further six-and-a-half weeks in Scottish hospitals. He had to learn how to walk, talk and eat again. Ross returned to Williamwood High School in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, in May last year and is now celebrating seven As and a B in his National 5 exams. He said: ""I was pretty pleased, I was really not expecting that, but happy to get the results."" Scottish exam pass rate 'stable' His mother Wilma said: ""I was working when he got his text but I believe he jumped out of his skin and was so pleased. We're just absolutely ecstatic with his results. ""It was really touch and go at times, we didn't know whether we were going to get our boy back but it didn't take very long before there were signs that Ross was improving. Ross Nesbitt said he was not expecting his seven A grades ""The first thing was switching on his mobile phone and putting his code in, and we knew he was still with us, but he had quite a long time recovering. ""He had to learn to swallow, how to walk and talk again. He had lost 18kgs (2.8 stone) in weight over the initial period and had a tube in his stomach to feed him, so it's remarkable with the help of all the team at the Children's Hospital in Glasgow that we walked out of there."" Ross initially returned to school for a couple of days a week and also had extra tutoring with teachers to help him catch up. Speaking about the accident and his recovery, he said: ""I was heading down to the lift and decided to take a shortcut off the track of the slope and hit a lot of snow and flew forward and banged my head on a fence post. ""I had to relearn how to walk and talk and do basic things again. ""I knew when I went back to school they weren't going to make me do the S3 exams, so I didn't have that pressure on me. The school were really helpful."" Ross will return to Williamwood next week for fifth year. ""I've not really thought much about what I want to do,"" he said. ""I was going to wait to get the results to have a think about it but I'm still skiing, the accident was never going to put me off."" His mother added: ""It's what he wants to do. It's what drives him and he loves skiing. ""He's had a few races recently and been on the podium, maybe not first but he's nipping at their heels.""

The former Sinn FÃ©in leader said it would contain recipes with ""some of the best-kept secrets"" of the 1998 peace process.

"Fraser, a pupil at Greenfaulds High School in Cumbernauld, gets a kiss from his mum after getting five As The pass rate for this year's Higher exams was ""broadly stable"", Education Secretary John Swinney has said. He was speaking on the day more than 135,000 pupils in Scotland found out how they had done in their National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers. The number of entries for Highers and the proportion of students who received a pass mark both fell slightly. Mr Swinney said it was ""another very strong performance by young people in Scotland"". He told the BBC: ""We've seen the number of Highers broadly stable and consistent in terms of the pass rate, despite the fall in pupil numbers who are involved in S5 and S6 within Scottish education."" Seven As for boy given 1% recovery chance There had been a doubling of skills-based qualifications over the last six years, which was ""crucial for young people entering the labour market"", along with ""really strong performances"" in Advanced Higher and in National 5. ""It is a really great achievement by young people - I congratulate them,"" said Mr Swinney. All students have received their results by post but about 59,000 also opted to receive them by text or email. A free helpline0808 100 8000is available for anyone seeking practical advice. It is open from 08:00 until 20:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Skills Development Scotland line will then be open from 09:00 until 17:00 from 9 to 15 August. There were 147,000 Higher passes, with a pass rate of 76.8%, compared with 77.0% in 2017. The results showed a record number of entries for Advanced Higher (24,331) since changes to the qualification were made in 2015/16, with attainment rates remaining high at 80.5%. Ucas figures show that 29,830 students from Scotland have had their university applications confirmed. This is a 4% increase in acceptances despite an overall fall in the population of 18-year olds. There has continued to be a drop in university acceptances for EU students. Detailed analysis of the results at subject level showed: A continued rise in passes in Mathematics at Higher and Advanced Higher National 5 Application of Mathematics pass rate up 11.3 percentage points Pass rates for English up 5.3 percentage points at Advanced Higher level Pass rates for English at Higher level down by 1.4 percentage points Pass rates for English at National 5 level down by 2.4 percentage points Skills-based qualifications increased to 50,305 this year - more than double the number in 2012 Mr Swinney  said that in the first year that unit assessments were removed from National 5, the overall pass rate remained high at 77.4%. He added: ""It is clear that our young people have performed strongly, against rigorous standards, and are now in an exciting position to decide what they go on to do next,"" he said. ""Results day is the culmination of months of hard work and it is important to remember that, whatever the outcome, it is only the beginning of a journey. ""Anyone who did not receive the results they had hoped for, or who is just unsure about their next steps, should get in touch with the SDS exam helpline for access to expert careers advice."" The main interest often lies in the Higher results - seen as the gold standard of the qualification system. The Highers were modified in 2015 to tie them in more closely with the National 4s and 5s which effectively replaced Standard Grades. Since 2016 only the modified Highers have been on offer. The proportion of Higher entries which achieve a pass is broadly stable but has declined for three years in a row. This year 76.8% of entries were marked at Grade C or above compared with 77% last year and 77.2% in 2016. The total number of entries has also fallen each year. The SQA also provided information about individual subjects. The number of entries for Higher English rose but the proportion of students who passed fell. This year there were 36,185 entries - 75.9% passed. Last year's pass rate was 77.3% The opposite happened in Higher Maths. The number of entries fell but the proportion that passed rose. This year there were 18,753 entries - 74.5% passed. Last year's pass rate was 74%. Figures like these will be viewed as representing a broadly stable system. Some may wonder why the overall proportion of candidates passing has declined for three years running - however if the number had risen for three years some might wonder if this was a sign of the exams getting easier or of ""teaching to the test"". Craig Newlands was among four students from Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire chosen by their head teacher to open their results live on the BBCGood Morning Scotland radio programme. ""I got five As,"" he revealed. ""It is what I hoped for. I will go back for 6th year now and take those results and see what the uni courses offer and then decide what course I want to do."" Eastwood High School pupils Clare Wallace (right) and Erin Wallace show head teacher Stuart Maxwell their results Pupils at Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire with their results The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is also issuing awards in Skills for Work courses, National Progression Awards and National Certificates for Scottish students. Commenting on the Ucas figures, NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: ""While it is encouraging to see a modest rise in the proportion of Ucas acceptances for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, we can't lose sight of the fact there is much more to do to ensure more students from the poorest areas make it into higher education. ""We need to see every institution - without exception - pulling their weight to change the current culture and boost admissions for these students."" The Royal Mail said staff have been ""pulling out all the stops"" to ensure results arrive as quickly as possible, with deliveries taking place across the world as many Scots are abroad for results day. Julie Pirone, director of external relations at Royal Mail, said the service had been working with partners in 45 countries to ensure results reached  pupils. Certificates have been issued to more than 135,000 candidates More than 758,000 exams were taken between 30 April and 4 June Exams were taken in 480 schools and colleges Almost 59,000 candidates received their results by email and/or text Seven As for boy given 1% recovery chance Scottish Qualifications Authority Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Ruby and James Watson were killed in the crash in Derbyshire A mother who killed her fiancÃ© and six-year-old daughter in a drink-driving crash has been jailed. PassengersRuby and James Watson, 28, diedwhen their car crashed into railings and a wall on Kilbourne Road, Belper, Derbyshire, last April. Carly Tomlinson, 24, of Nottingham Road, Belper, previously admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving while unfit through drink. At Nottingham Crown Court earlier, she was jailed for two years. The court heard Tomlinson was almost double the drink-driving limit when she smashed her car into a stone wall in the early hours of 30 April 2017. The mother-of-two had been travelling at 43mph in a 30mph zone. Ruby was ""not properly secured"" in her booster seat and Mr Watson was not wearing a seat belt, the court was told. Both died at the scene. Carly Tomlinson had been travelling at 43mph in a 30mph zone Tomlinson suffered a broken back, pelvis and ribs in the fatal crash and was left in a critical condition in hospital. Her barrister Raglan Ashton said: ""She says 'I will never forgive myself and not a day goes by when I don't think of James and Ruby' and, given the chance, she would put herself in their place."" East Midlands Live: Smoke from plastic pallets fire fills sky; Arrest over 'horrific' assault in park Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told Tomlinson: ""I suspect the physical injury is nothing compared to the emotional damage you have done to yourself. ""You killed your own child and your fiancÃ© - people that you loved and people that loved you. ""You will be haunted by this for the rest of your life."" The crash happened on Kilbourne Road, leading into Belper, Derbyshire Mr Watson's mother Janine Hitchcock said she could not attend court because she was ""so angry"" with ""what she has done to my family"". Janine Hitchcock, 51, said: ""[Tomlinson] needs to pay for all the heartbreak she has done. ""My family has been completely torn apart and I feel awful like I can't breathe."" Ruby was described as a ""thoughtful friend""with a ""smile for everyone"" by her school. Tomlinson was also disqualified from driving for four years.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'has caused offence', PM says Boris Johnson has stood by his remarks about the burka after the Conservative Party chairman told him to apologise. The former foreign secretary has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and comparing them to ""bank robbers"". PM Theresa May has backed calls for Mr Johnson to apologise, saying the remarks have ""clearly caused offence"". But a source close to Mr Johnson said he ""won't be apologising"", adding it was ""ridiculous"" to attack his views. ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues,"" the source added. ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" Johnson burka 'letter box' jibe sparks anger What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? Mr Johnson's remarks,in a Daily Telegraph article,external, have provoked criticism from Muslim groups, some Tory MPs and opposition parties. This video can not be played Senior Conservative Muslim peer Lord Sheikh calls on party to take whip away from Johnson In the article, Mr Johnson said full-face veils should not be banned but that it was ""ridiculous"" people chose to wear them. However, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum said the remarks would harm community relations. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said he agreed with Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt that there had been degree of offence in Mr Johnson's comments, and called on the former London mayor to apologise.

By BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The criticism pitted at Boris Johnson has largely been around the words that he used - ""letter boxes"" and ""bank robbers"" to describe Muslim women wearing face veils. But Mr Johnson hasn't directly responded to the accusation that it is his language which caused the offence. Instead, the statement that has come from a source close to him suggests Mr Johnson wants to turn this into a debate about whether or not women should wear the burka at all. Keeping a high profile is important to Mr Johnson. He is seen by some in the Conservative Party as a contender for leadership - particularly since his resignation in which he criticised the prime minister's plan for Brexit. But he risks being seen as weak if he is forced into an apology by the party chairman. So his refusal to apologise, and an attempt to now put himself on the side of ""liberal values"", could be an example of Mr Johnson trying to save face while maintaining his profile. Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet, welcomed Mr Lewis's intervention and called for disciplinary action against Mr Johnson if he did not apologise. She described the remarks as ""offensive and deliberately provocative, but very clever politics"". A debate about the burka should be had ""in a serious way"", she said, rather than ""trying to get airtime and attention on an issue which he knows will resonate with a certain part of the Tory Party"". This video can not be played Shazia Awan-Scully on Johnson Shazia Awan-Scully, a Muslim who ran as a Conservative candidate in 2010, said she did not agree with wearing the burka but it was up to women to make up their own minds. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some women choose to wear it, some women are conditioned to wear it, but it's certainly out of the question for me to tell a woman what to wear."" She added that the language used by Mr Johnson showed he was ""pandering to this Islamophobic attitude bubbling away in the Conservative Party"", which she said she had experienced herself.

Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Johnson had raised an important subject in a ""light-hearted way"". The reaction ""says a lot about internal Conservative Party politics"", he told the BBC. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who supports banning face veils, said Mr Johnson had been ""tactless"". The 50-year-old said wearing a full-face veil was a ""new phenomenon"" and she didn't consider it a religious right, adding that she would be ""very opposed"" to it becoming normalised in British society. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year,Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her lifeafter a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim. Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target. Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"". And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society. Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hatred. But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia. In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. Boris Johnson said he did not think face coverings should be banned but said the burka was ""oppressive"" But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation"".

"Joel Urhie's body was found inside the house after the blaze in Deptford A seven-year-old boy has died in a ""suspicious"" house fire. Joel Urhie's body was found after a ""very severe fire"" in the house in Adolphus Street, Deptford, south-east London, in the early hours of Tuesday. His father John said: ""It's terrible, the pain we cannot forget."" Two women jumped to safety from the first floor, while 35 firefighters were sent to the scene, London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. Police have launched an arson investigation. The Met said it was working with fire investigators and had ""deemed the fire as suspicious"". Scotland Yard has launched an arson investigation Speaking outside the house Mr Urhie described his son as ""a very lovely boy who was just loving life"". The 54-year-old said he moved out of the family home about five years ago but had been called at about 04:00 BST to say there had been a fire. ""When I came, the first thing I saw was my daughter inside the ambulance. They said, 'Joel's dead', and there's nothing I can do about it,"" he said. Family friend Grace Gbenedio, 56, said she rushed outside her nearby home after hearing screams. Mrs Gbenedio said she held Joel's mother, Sophie Urhie, who said: ""My son is inside."" ""She was on the floor crying, 'help, help, help',"" Mrs Gbenedio added. ""The fire was just too much, like a curtain, no-one could go in or out,"" she said. ""We heard the last blast of the glass and she just collapsed."" Joel Urhie's body was found after a ""very severe fire"" Neighbours have spoken of their shock at Joel's death. A family friend, who asked not to be named, described Mrs Urhie as ""an angel"" who ""would come to anyone's aid"". ""She doesn't deserve this. She's so nice,"" she said. This video can not be played Andre Pavanello and Kayla McClellan, who live next door, said they were woken by screaming Fire crews were called shortly before 03:30 and it took more than 75 minutes to bring the flames under control. Clive Stagg, who lives in a nearby flat, said he had rushed to the house after hearing a woman screaming and discovered ""all hell was breaking loose"". ""I have never seen anything like it. The whole house was ablaze,"" he said. London Fire Brigade said the cause of the fire was ""under investigation"" Friends and neighbours say the family affected by this tragic blaze are ""lovely"". One said Joel would often play outside during the summer holidays. All morning neighbours have been gathering on street corners offering each other hugs and support. Many of them have been visibly upset, struggling to come to terms with the news that a young boy has lost his life. Kayla McClellan lives next door to the family and said that as she tried to leave her house ""a wall of fire came through the front and we immediately closed it and went out through the back"". Mrs Urhie is in hospital with her daughter, Sarah, 19. Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. The ground floor of the house was badly damaged by the blaze, as well as the whole of the first floor and the stairs from the ground to the first floor. Surrounding homes were evacuated as a precaution. LFB said the cause of the fire was ""under investigation"".

"Officers have had to cancel leave to cover incidents such as the Wiltshire poisonings, the Police Federation said Almost one in 12 police officers say they have taken a second job, with some appearing to be in financial ""dire straits"", according to the Police Federation of England and Wales. A survey from the organisation, which represents thousands of officers, found 7.8% have sought extra work - a figure it says is a record high. And it said 44% worried about finances daily or nearly every day. Some officers have resorted to food vouchers, the PFEW chairman said. Previous reports have foundthat officers have taken up second jobs in professions including teaching, beauty therapy, photography, bar work and football refereeing. Officers are allowed to carry out additional work outside their job if the force approves it. Thestarting salary for a constable,externalis currently between Â£19,971 and Â£23,124, but rises to Â£24,171 after two years of service and can progress up to Â£38,382. A chief inspector's salarystarts,externalat Â£54,432. A2% pay increase,externalfor police officers will come into force in September. The Home Office says more than half of police constables are earning at the top of their pay bracket, and their average pay will be more than Â£38,600 following the pay increase. According to the survey,,externalwhich included responses from more than 27,000 police officers from constable up to chief inspector rank: 7.8% of respondents had taken up additional employment, up from 6.3% last year More than one in nine (11.8%) said they never or almost never had enough money to cover all of their essentials, rising from 11% last year Three quarters said they felt financially worse off than they did five years ago Over 87% of officers surveyed did not feel their pay was fair considering the ""stresses and strains of the job"" Chairman John Apter said it ""hardly comes as a surprise"" but the results were ""grim"". ""Our members are clearly suffering from even worse financial pressures than last year, with some appearing to be in dire straits,"" he said. Additional police were on duty to bolster security during Donald Trump's visit to the UK Mr Apter blamed dwindling resources and rising crime which has led to a record high demand for police services, adding that ""cash-strapped"" officers wanted to be ""adequately paid"". He highlighted the poisonings in Wiltshire and Donald Trump's UK visit as examples of officers having to cancel leave or rest days to be deployed. One police officer who has a second job, says he earns more in his extra work than he would do by doing overtime in his policing job. ""Where I am, about a third of us have second jobs,"" he said, adding there is ""very little loyalty left"" and ""like me, the only reason they stay is for what is left of our pensions"". Another, a police sergeant, says he joined the Army Reserve to bolster his take-home pay. The PFEW has labelled the 2% pay increase, coming into force on 1 September, as ""derisory"". Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Conservatives were ""in total denial about the misery that their cuts to public services have caused"". Reality Check: Is police funding falling? A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""We are grateful to all police officers for the incredible job they do - and will continue to ensure they have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively. ""The police pay award for 2018/19 represents the highest consolidated pay award since 2010. And the number of people joining police forces is at a 10-year high which demonstrates policing is still a desirable and sought-after career."" They added there will be a Â£460m increase in overall funding for police in 2018/19. Francis Habgood, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for pay and conditions, said forces encouraged officers to seek support if they ran into financial difficulties.

"Fraser, a pupil at Greenfaulds High School in Cumbernauld, gets a kiss from his mum after getting five As The pass rate for this year's Higher exams was ""broadly stable"", Education Secretary John Swinney has said. He was speaking on the day more than 135,000 pupils in Scotland found out how they had done in their National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers. The number of entries for Highers and the proportion of students who received a pass mark both fell slightly. Mr Swinney said it was ""another very strong performance by young people in Scotland"". He told the BBC: ""We've seen the number of Highers broadly stable and consistent in terms of the pass rate, despite the fall in pupil numbers who are involved in S5 and S6 within Scottish education."" Seven As for boy given 1% recovery chance There had been a doubling of skills-based qualifications over the last six years, which was ""crucial for young people entering the labour market"", along with ""really strong performances"" in Advanced Higher and in National 5. ""It is a really great achievement by young people - I congratulate them,"" said Mr Swinney. All students have received their results by post but about 59,000 also opted to receive them by text or email. A free helpline0808 100 8000is available for anyone seeking practical advice. It is open from 08:00 until 20:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Skills Development Scotland line will then be open from 09:00 until 17:00 from 9 to 15 August. There were 147,000 Higher passes, with a pass rate of 76.8%, compared with 77.0% in 2017. The results showed a record number of entries for Advanced Higher (24,331) since changes to the qualification were made in 2015/16, with attainment rates remaining high at 80.5%. Ucas figures show that 29,830 students from Scotland have had their university applications confirmed. This is a 4% increase in acceptances despite an overall fall in the population of 18-year olds. There has continued to be a drop in university acceptances for EU students. Detailed analysis of the results at subject level showed: A continued rise in passes in Mathematics at Higher and Advanced Higher National 5 Application of Mathematics pass rate up 11.3 percentage points Pass rates for English up 5.3 percentage points at Advanced Higher level Pass rates for English at Higher level down by 1.4 percentage points Pass rates for English at National 5 level down by 2.4 percentage points Skills-based qualifications increased to 50,305 this year - more than double the number in 2012 Mr Swinney  said that in the first year that unit assessments were removed from National 5, the overall pass rate remained high at 77.4%. He added: ""It is clear that our young people have performed strongly, against rigorous standards, and are now in an exciting position to decide what they go on to do next,"" he said. ""Results day is the culmination of months of hard work and it is important to remember that, whatever the outcome, it is only the beginning of a journey. ""Anyone who did not receive the results they had hoped for, or who is just unsure about their next steps, should get in touch with the SDS exam helpline for access to expert careers advice."" The main interest often lies in the Higher results - seen as the gold standard of the qualification system. The Highers were modified in 2015 to tie them in more closely with the National 4s and 5s which effectively replaced Standard Grades. Since 2016 only the modified Highers have been on offer. The proportion of Higher entries which achieve a pass is broadly stable but has declined for three years in a row. This year 76.8% of entries were marked at Grade C or above compared with 77% last year and 77.2% in 2016. The total number of entries has also fallen each year. The SQA also provided information about individual subjects. The number of entries for Higher English rose but the proportion of students who passed fell. This year there were 36,185 entries - 75.9% passed. Last year's pass rate was 77.3% The opposite happened in Higher Maths. The number of entries fell but the proportion that passed rose. This year there were 18,753 entries - 74.5% passed. Last year's pass rate was 74%. Figures like these will be viewed as representing a broadly stable system. Some may wonder why the overall proportion of candidates passing has declined for three years running - however if the number had risen for three years some might wonder if this was a sign of the exams getting easier or of ""teaching to the test"". Craig Newlands was among four students from Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire chosen by their head teacher to open their results live on the BBCGood Morning Scotland radio programme. ""I got five As,"" he revealed. ""It is what I hoped for. I will go back for 6th year now and take those results and see what the uni courses offer and then decide what course I want to do."" Eastwood High School pupils Clare Wallace (right) and Erin Wallace show head teacher Stuart Maxwell their results Pupils at Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire with their results The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is also issuing awards in Skills for Work courses, National Progression Awards and National Certificates for Scottish students. Commenting on the Ucas figures, NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: ""While it is encouraging to see a modest rise in the proportion of Ucas acceptances for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, we can't lose sight of the fact there is much more to do to ensure more students from the poorest areas make it into higher education.

"A Labour MP facing disciplinary action has branded the probe into his conduct a ""farce and a disgrace"". Ian Austin's lawyers have accused Labour's general secretary of failing to ""observe the most rudimentary principles of natural justice"". They say Labour is using the probe to silence his ""legitimate, honestly-held criticisms of Mr Corbyn's failure to address the scourge of anti-Semitism"". Labour has dropped a similar investigation into MP Margaret Hodge. The party launched an investigation last month into alleged ""abusive conduct"" by Mr Austin after reports of a heated clash with Labour chairman Ian Lavery over the party's code of conduct on anti-Semitism. Hodge refuses to apologise as probe dropped MP faces action in Labour anti-Semitism row It later emerged that complaints had also been made against him by Labour MP Chris Williamson and by Mr Corbyn himself, although the Labour leader had not made his complaint formally. In a letter to Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby, Mr Austin's solicitors, Hamlins, call on the party to drop the investigation or reveal the substance of the complaints against him and the rules he is alleged to have broken. The letter calls the party's disciplinary procedures ""Kafkaesque"". Dame Margaret Hodge says she stands by her criticism of Mr Corbyn It echoes a letter sent by Dame Margaret Hodge's solicitors to Ms Formby ahead of the party's decision to drop its disciplinary procedures against her. Dame Margaret was said to have called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"" in a heated exchange with the Labour leader last month. ""I stand by what I said,""she told the Evening Standard,external. ""Ian acted in a very similar way to me and it is obvious that the case against him should now immediately be dropped."" She accused the Labour leadership of using trumped-up disciplinary actions to purge critics of Mr Corbyn. ""I have absolutely no doubt that there are those in the leadership who want to get rid, whether it is through de-selection or disciplinary action, of any opposition,"" she told the Standard. ""The new style of politics is bullying and intolerance, not gentle and inclusive."" Mr Corbyn has been criticised by Jewish community leaders and some of his own MPs over what they see as his refusal to take allegations of anti-Semitism in the party seriously enough. The row centres on the Labour Party's code of conduct - which includes an internationally recognised definition of anti-Semitism but omits four of the 11 examples of ""contemporary anti-Semitism"". Labour says it has ""expanded and contextualised"" theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,externalexamples that it has used to provide ""legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"". And Mr Corbyn has insisted anti-Semites have no place in the Labour Party and acknowledged the party has not been quick enough to deal with those who have spread ""poison"" in the party's name.

"Ben Stokes arrives at Bristol Crown Court for the second day of his trial England cricketer Ben Stokes was ""spiteful and angry"" towards a bouncer before he was involved in a fight with two men, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder is one of three men accused of fighting in Bristol on 25 September. Bristol Crown Court previously heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by 27-year-old Mr Stokes. They also deny affray and are on trial alongside the cricketer. Giving evidence, bouncer Andrew Cunningham said Mr Stokes became abusive after he was refused entry back into Mbargo nightclub just after 02:00 BST. Mr Stokes and his team-mate Alex Hales had left the nightclub at 00:46 but returned at 02:08. Mr Cunningham said he explained to them the club was closed and they would not be allowed to enter. He told the jury Mr Stokes offered him Â£300 to be let in, but after he refused the all-rounder became ""spiteful and angry"" and insulted Mr Cunningham's gold teeth and tattoos. Det Con Daniel Adams said CCTV footage played in court showed Mr Stokes flicking a V-sign at Mr Cunningham. However, the cricketer's barrister Gordon Cole QC said it was not accepted that Mr Stokes had made the gesture. Ryan Ali (left) and Ryan Hale have also pleaded not guilty to affray The CCTV also shows two men, William O'Connor and Kai Barry, leaving the club in the Clifton Triangle area of the city and the pair engaging in conversation with Mr Stokes and Mr Hales. Prosecutors sayMr Stokes mocked the two ""openly gay"" men outside the venue. However, Mr Cole said Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor, who had both been inside the club, had been ""taking the mickey"" out of his client's shoes. Referring to the CCTV, Det Con Adams told jurors Mr Stokes had ""mimicked the actions"" of Mr O'Connor and then ""flicked something which we believe was a cigarette butt"" at him. Mr Cunningham described Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor as ""effeminate"" and ""flamboyant"" and told the court Mr Stokes had ""made noises"" and ""camp hand gestures"" to mock them. He said he told Mr Stokes: ""If you are going to start on someone, start on me."" The bouncer continued: ""When I said this [Mr Hales] looked a bit confused. ""I explained to him what he had done. He turned to his friend and said 'Stokesy don't do that'."" This video can not be played Ben Stokes and Alex Hales are seen on CCTV outside the nightclub Mr Cunningham said that before leaving the club area Mr Stokes shook hands with his door supervisor colleague but he refused to do so. ""He went to shake mine and I had no reason to shake his hand,"" he said. ""They left and walked up the road."" Mr Cunningham denied he had been aggressive towards Mr Stokes and Mr Hales when they returned to the club. During cross-examination, Mr Cole said: ""You were rude in the way you spoke to them. They then stood outside for quite some time laughing and joking. ""They were laughing and joking with Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry."" Mr Cunningham replied: ""Definitely not. I never became aggressive. They were laughing and joking at them, not with them."" Mr Cole suggested there was an exchange of ""mickey taking"" and ""banter"" between Mr Stokes and Mr Hales and the two gay men. But Mr Cunningham replied: ""That's not how I would call it."" Andrew Cunningham said Mr Stokes became abusive after he was refused entry into a nightclub Stephen Mooney, representing Mr Ali, asked Mr Cunningham whether Mr Stokes and Mr Hales had treated him with ""respect and courtesy"". ""No,"" the doorman replied. The court has heard Mr Stokes knocked out both Mr Hale and Mr Ali when he and Mr Hales caught up with them, and Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry, on a nearby street. Mr Ali is said to have threatened Mr Hales with a bottle, while Mr Hale is alleged to have pulled a metal pole from a street sign and brought it to the scene. Mr Stokes claims he was acting in self-defence and took action after his co-defendants were homophobic towards Mr O'Connor and Mr Barry. The fight took place after Mr Stokes was turned away from Mbargo nightclub, the court heard The jury was shown video footage recorded by film student Max Wilson, who said he began filming after he heard a commotion and ""thought there was a fight about to break out"". ""Someone shoved another person,"" he said. The six men sounded like ""football hooligans"" and were ""clearly drunk"", he added. In the footage Mr Wilson was heard to swear after a punch was thrown. Asked why he reacted in that way, he replied: ""It was such a forceful punch. It just took me by surprise. ""I felt a little bit sorry about the lad that had been punched and it looked like he had his hands up."" Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against West Indies at the city's County Ground. The trial continues.

"Women who have a heart attack are more likely to survive if they are treated by a female doctor in hospital, a major US study suggests. An analysis of 580,000 heart attack cases over 19 years found 13.3% died after being treated by a man compared with 12% who were cared for by a woman. Their chances were also improved if treated by a male doctor who had a lot of female colleagues in his team. One theory is that men may be worse at treating women, researchers said. Independent experts said more work was needed to see if the findings applied to UK hospitals. Waist size 'bigger heart risk in women' Heart attack care 'unequal for women' Pain bias: the health inequality rarely discussed Researchers looked through anonymous patient data from Florida hospitals between 1991 and 2010. After taking factors such as age, race and medical history into account, they found all patients had a better chance of surviving a heart attack if they were treated by a female doctor, but the difference in outcomes was biggest in women. When patients were treated by male doctors, 12.6% of men died compared with 13.3% of women. But when female physicians took charge of treatment, those percentages fell - to 11.8% of men and 12% of women. Lead scientist Dr Seth Carnahan, from Washington University, in St Louis, said: ""Our work corroborates prior research showing that female doctors tend to produce better patient outcomes than male doctors. ""The novel part of what we are doing is showing that the benefit of having a female doctor is particularly stark for a female patient."" The team also found that survival rates for women rose as the percentage of female doctors working in the accident and emergency unit increased, especially if the physician in charge was male. Researchers said doctors may be receiving training that suggested heart disease was predominantly a condition that affected men. However, there are limitations to the study. It cannot prove it was the presence of female doctors that caused the improved survival rates. Maureen Talbot, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said previous research from the charity had already shown a ""worrying difference"" in the treatment given to men and women suffering from heart attacks. She said: ""While this study supports this theory, more research is needed in UK hospitals to see if the bias exists here. ""It's important that we better understand what is causing this variation in care. ""And the BHF is already funding research into how we can improve the outcomes of women who have a heart attack.""

"This video can not be played People smuggling gang convicted Six men have been found guilty of trying to smuggle Albanian migrants in overcrowded boats across the English Channel. The operation, which was mainly based in Dymchurch, in Kent, was uncovered following a series of blunders. Police moved on the gang after they turned to three-person jet skis. Father and son Leonard and Alfie Powell were convicted at the Old Bailey alongside Wayne Bath, Albert Letchford, Sabah Dulaj and Artur Nutaj. Another son, George Powell, entered a guilty plea for his part in the conspiracy on 15 May. Two other men - Alan Viles, 27, from Folkestone, and Francis Wade, 59, from Rochester - were found not guilty. The nine-week trial heard how one boat linked to the Kent-based gang had to be rescued after nearly sinking. It was built for six people but had 20 people onboard, including 18 Albanian migrants. Another boat had to be rescued after it was found travelling the wrong way up a shipping lane, and had run out of fuel. Had the gang not been stopped by a National Crime Agency-led (NCA) surveillance operation, they would have been the first to have tried to run migrants across the world's busiest shipping route on jet-skis. Six men were found guilty - Top row left to right: Bath, Dulaj, Letchford / Bottom row left to right: Nutaj, Alfie Powell, Leonard Powell NCA senior investigator Mark McCormack raised concerns about the gang's ""level of incompetency"". He said: ""We have people controlling vessels with no maritime experience, no sailing experience, who have completed very rudimentary courses of one or two days, trying to cross this busy shipping channel at night in a small vessel not utilising lights or radar."" The court heard that migrants, including men, women and children, were charged up to Â£6,000 each to journey across the Channel from near Calais. The gang are believed to have carried out one successful trip in a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) called Rebel, which was found abandoned on the beach at Dymchurch with children's life jackets on board on 11 May 2016. When border officials went to investigate, the professed owner, Wayne Bath, claimed to have been out ""night fishing"" when he experienced engine trouble. 'Rebel', a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, was found abandoned at Dymchurch Two weeks later, French police spotted a group of people signalling a boat in the water off Cran d'Escalles beach near Calais. The migrants began to wade out to meet it, but the Antares RHIB left after a parked car signalled using its headlights. Prosecutor Timothy Probert-Wood QC told jurors they were ""clearly not there for a day on the beach"". Migrant boat operation 'a lucrative scam' Smuggling accused 'unaware' of boat rescue Smuggling accused 'refused to help boat' Two days later, the gang tried again with the newly acquired White Scanner RHIB, under the watch of NCA agents. It picked up 18 migrants from France - including two children aged 16 and 17 and a woman - but ran out of fuel on the return journey, forcing the migrants to bale out as the vessel flooded with water. They were rescued by the coastguard helicopter and RNLI. White Scanner's two-man crew, Mark Stribling, 35, from Farningham, and Robert Stilwell, 33, from Dartford,were jailedin July 2016. Migrants were brought across in small boats, the court heard The gang then bought another larger boat on which the NCA planted a bug to listen to them plotting their next migrant run. Following a failed attempt on 25 July due to rough seas, the NCA secretly filmed a meeting of the gang after which they bought a jet-ski. They were arrested before the jet-ski could be brought into use. All eight defendants had denied conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Mr Viles and Mr Wade said they had done favours or jobs for the group, unaware of the people smuggling operation. Albanian nationals Dulaj and Nutaj acted as ""travel agents"", finding people who wanted to go to the UK. Leonard Powell, 66, of Hilltop Farm, Farningham, Alfie Powell, 39, of Button Lane, Swanley, Bath, 38, of Sea Approach, Warden, Letchford, 42, of Rochester Road, Gravesend, Dulaj, 23, of Hospital Way, Catford, south-east London, and Nutaj, 39, of Wheatley Gardens, Edmonton, north London, will be sentenced with George Powell, of Hilltop Farm, Farningham, on 21 September.

"Kharg Island terminal: Energy exports are vital for the Iranian economy European foreign affairs chiefs have pledged to protect firms against the impact of US sanctions for doing business with Iran. An EU ""blocking statute"" will take effect on Tuesday to nullify US legal action against European firms in connection with Iran. Some US sanctions on Iran are expected to be reimposed later on Monday. In May, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from an international 2015 deal to control Iran's nuclear ambitions. Under that deal, nuclear-related Western sanctions on Iran were lifted. Mr Trump argues that the deal will not prevent Iran from finding ways to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear research is strictly for civilian purposes. A joint statement from EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK,externalsays the nuclear deal - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - is ""crucial"" for global security. ""We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran, in accordance with EU law and with UN Security Council resolution 2231,"" the statement says. ""This is why the European Union's updated Blocking Statute enters into force on 7 August to protect EU companies doing legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extra-territorial sanctions."" They say they ""expect Iran to fully implement its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA"". Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment programme in return for the lifting of crippling Western sanctions. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Iran row threatens EU billion-dollar deals This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? It will enable EU-based firms to recover damages resulting from the US sanctions. It will also ban EU businesses from complying with those US sanctions, unless they get exceptional authorisation from the European Commission. Theexisting blocking statute dated from 1996,externaland applied to the effects of US sanctions on Cuba. The updated version - relating to US sanctions on Iran - will be published on Tuesday, and will take effect immediately.

"France's Total signed a major gas production deal with Iran after sanctions were lifted The EU is scrambling to find ways to safeguard huge business deals with Iran, amid the threat of US penalties. Washington is re-imposing strict sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 international deal to control the country's nuclear ambitions. On 8 May President Donald Trump denounced the deal, saying he would withdraw the US from it. Since the deal took effect in 2016 major European firms have rushed to do billions of dollars' worth of business with Iran, and now thousands of jobs are at stake. Many of those firms fear their business ties with the US could be at risk if they continue to do deals with Iran past a November deadline. Some firms say they are now preparing to wind down their business in Iran. There is an existingEU ""blocking statute"", from 1996,external, aimed at countering US sanctions linked to communist Cuba. Now EU officials say they are revamping the statute to avoid the latest US restrictions on firms doing business with Iran. But there are doubts about the statute's legal power. Reuters news agency says Shell and some other European firms with big operations in the US prefer to push for US waivers on a case-by-case basis. US authorities have imposed hefty fines on banks for processing Iranian transactions, including UK-based Standard Chartered, HSBC and Lloyds. France, Germany and the UK all say they remain committed to the nuclear deal with Iran and to expanding business ties, provided Iran sticks to its commitments. Iranian-made Renault Logan cars went on sale in 2007 France condemns US over Iran sanctions The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Winners and losers as Trump quits Iran deal Iran nuclear deal: Key details Before the imposition of punitive sanctions on Iran in 2012 the EU was its biggest trade partner. In 2011 Iran had a big trade surplus with the EU. Trade slumped in 2012, but has been climbing back up since the 2015 deal. EU exports to Iran in 2017,external(goods and services) totalled â¬10.8bn (Â£9.5bn; $12.9bn), and imports from Iran to the bloc were worth â¬10.1bn. The value of imports was nearly double the 2016 figure. Most EU imports from Iran are energy-related - more than 75% is oil and other fuels. EU exports to Iran are mainly machinery and transport equipment, followed by chemicals. Italy's trade volume was highest, followed by France, then Germany and the Netherlands. But trade with Iran makes up just 0.6% of the EU's total global trade. Iran's main trade partners are the United Arab Emirates and China,external, which account for 23.6% and 22.3% of the country's total trade, according to the European Commission.

"It may sound like the title of a low budget sci-fi movie, but for planetary scientists, ""Hothouse Earth"" is a deadly serious concept. Researchers believe we could soon cross a threshold leading to boiling hot temperatures and towering seas in the centuries to come. Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this ""irreversible pathway"". Theirstudy shows,externalit could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C. An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies. Human actions boosted heatwave odds The woman who found a new threat in plastic Young will pick up 'climate change bill' Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures. Many parts of the world would be significantly disrupted in a Hothouse Earth scenario But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse. So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in. Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct. ""What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself,"" co-author Prof Johan RockstrÃ¶m, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News. ""We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium."" Melting ice in the Arctic will reduce the amount of sunlight reflected back into space Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade. In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term ""feedback processes"". Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor. The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes. In short, it's not good. Flooding and coastal erosion may be a major problem in a warmer world According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years. The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable. The impacts would be ""massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,"" say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought. ""One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,"" said Prof RockstrÃ¶m. ""It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought."" What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems. People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century. But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an ""irreversible pathway"" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Surprisingly, yes! We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet. ""Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions. ""This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,"" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as in this model, will be necessary, say the authors The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound. ""As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',"" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. ""Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for â thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth."" Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. ""Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,"" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. ""At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero.""

"A Labour MP facing disciplinary action has branded the probe into his conduct a ""farce and a disgrace"". Ian Austin's lawyers have accused Labour's general secretary of failing to ""observe the most rudimentary principles of natural justice"". They say Labour is using the probe to silence his ""legitimate, honestly-held criticisms of Mr Corbyn's failure to address the scourge of anti-Semitism"". Labour has dropped a similar investigation into MP Margaret Hodge. The party launched an investigation last month into alleged ""abusive conduct"" by Mr Austin after reports of a heated clash with Labour chairman Ian Lavery over the party's code of conduct on anti-Semitism. Hodge refuses to apologise as probe dropped MP faces action in Labour anti-Semitism row It later emerged that complaints had also been made against him by Labour MP Chris Williamson and by Mr Corbyn himself, although the Labour leader had not made his complaint formally. In a letter to Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby, Mr Austin's solicitors, Hamlins, call on the party to drop the investigation or reveal the substance of the complaints against him and the rules he is alleged to have broken. The letter calls the party's disciplinary procedures ""Kafkaesque"". Dame Margaret Hodge says she stands by her criticism of Mr Corbyn It echoes a letter sent by Dame Margaret Hodge's solicitors to Ms Formby ahead of the party's decision to drop its disciplinary procedures against her. Dame Margaret was said to have called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"" in a heated exchange with the Labour leader last month. ""I stand by what I said,""she told the Evening Standard,external. ""Ian acted in a very similar way to me and it is obvious that the case against him should now immediately be dropped."" She accused the Labour leadership of using trumped-up disciplinary actions to purge critics of Mr Corbyn. ""I have absolutely no doubt that there are those in the leadership who want to get rid, whether it is through de-selection or disciplinary action, of any opposition,"" she told the Standard. ""The new style of politics is bullying and intolerance, not gentle and inclusive."" Mr Corbyn has been criticised by Jewish community leaders and some of his own MPs over what they see as his refusal to take allegations of anti-Semitism in the party seriously enough. The row centres on the Labour Party's code of conduct - which includes an internationally recognised definition of anti-Semitism but omits four of the 11 examples of ""contemporary anti-Semitism"". Labour says it has ""expanded and contextualised"" theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,externalexamples that it has used to provide ""legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"". And Mr Corbyn has insisted anti-Semites have no place in the Labour Party and acknowledged the party has not been quick enough to deal with those who have spread ""poison"" in the party's name.

"This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has hit out at the United States over its reinstatement of economic sanctions. He described the measures, which came into effect overnight, as ""psychological warfare"" which aimed to ""sow division among Iranians"". The sanctions take aim at various sectors, with further punitive action planned against Iran's oil trade. The European Union has spoken out against the measures, vowing to protect firms doing ""legitimate business"". It follows the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, earlier this year. The deal, negotiated during the presidency of Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. US President Donald Trump says the deal is ""one-sided"" andhe believes renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal,externaland end its ""malign"" activities. Mr Trump signed an executive order which brought sanctions back into place at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Tuesday. They target: The purchase or acquisition of US banknotes by Iran's government Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals Graphite, aluminium, steel, coal and software used in industrial processes Transactions related to the Iranian rial currency Activities relating to Iran's issuance of sovereign debt Iran's automotive sector A second phase is planned to come back into effect on 5 November which will have implications for Iran's energy and shipping sectors, petroleum trading and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran. The imposing of sanctions followsMr Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 deal earlier this year. Mr Trump had long spoken out against the agreement, labelling it ""disastrous"" and the ""worst deal I've ever seen"". Iran nuclear deal: Key details The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Only the US has withdrawn, with other signatories remaining committed to the original agreement. Mr Trump says Iran faces a choice to ""either change its threatening, destabilising behaviour and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation"". ""I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities, including its ballistic missile programme and its support for terrorism,"" Mr Trump said on Monday. Mr Rouhani said the US government had ""turned their back on diplomacy"" with the action. Mr Rouhani criticised Mr Trump's strategy, saying ""negotiations with sanctions doesn't make sense"" ""They want to launch psychological warfare against the Iranian nation."" Mr Rouhani said. ""Negotiations with sanctions doesn't make sense. We are always in favour of diplomacy and talks... but talks need honesty,"" He also accused the Trump administration of using Iran as domestic political leverage ahead of November's midterm elections in the United States. The foreign ministers of Germany, the UK and France released a statement on Monday that said the nuclear deal remained ""crucial"" to global security. They also unveiled a ""blocking statute""which is intended to protect European firms doing business with Iran despite the new US sanctions. Alistair Burt, the UK's minister of state for the Middle East, told the BBC: ""If a company fears legal action taken against it and enforcement action taken against it by an entity in response to American sanctions, then that company can be protected as far as EU legislation is concerned."" However, German car and lorry maker Daimler, a major firm which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, confirmed this week that it has now ceased activities in the country. The US had previously rejected calls to offer exemptions, with Mr Trump vowing ""severe consequences"" against firms and individuals who continued to trade with Iran. An anonymous senior US official said thatthe administration was ""not particularly concerned"" by EU protection efforts,external. Iran has seenunrest since last December over a poorly-performing economy. Rising food prices, unemployment and even poor water supplies have led to protests in a number of cities. Demonstrations in Tehran in June were said to be the capital's biggest since 2012. This video can not be played Tehran saw large-scale economic protests in June How much they are tied to the new US sanctions policy is hard to determine, but one definite link is the effect on Iran's currency. It lost around half of its value since Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Iran acted to ease its foreign exchange rules on Sunday and the rial has since strengthened by 20%. Iranians have been hoarding gold as a safeguard, pushing it to a record high in Tehran. The sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the US blocks Iranian oil sales. This could halt about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day, although Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat. The International Monetary Fund said in March that Iran's net official reserves could decline this year to $97.8bn, which would finance about 13 months of imports. And analysts at BMI Research say Iran's economy could contract by 4.3% in 2019. However, Barbara Slavin, of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council,told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat when sanctions hit hard, it often means ordinary people become ""totally dependent"" on their government and so sanctions do not tend to topple regimes.

"Kroenke believes owning 100% of the club will benefit Arsenal Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke has made a Â£600m offer to buy the whole of the club in a deal that would value the Gunners at Â£1.8bn. The American billionaire owns 67% of Arsenal through his company KSE, which says Alisher Usmanov has agreed to sell his 30% stake in the club. A KSE statement says taking the club private will help to further Arsenal's ""strategy and ambitions"". The buy-out announcement was made to the London Stock exchange on Tuesday. Despite his shareholding, Usmanov is not part of the board or the decision-making at Arsenal. The metal magnate made a Â£1bn bidto buy the Emirates outfit in May 2017 but this was rejected by Kroenke. The statement to the stock exchange added: ""KSE's ambitions for the club are to see it competing consistently to win the Premier League and the Champions League, as well as the major trophies in the women's senior game and at youth level."" KSE said that under ""its stewardship since 2011 the club has invested in major transfers, player contracts, analytics, senior non-playing football management employees"" and it ""expects the club to build on those investments"". Arsenal have a new manager in charge this season after Unai Emery took over from Arsene Wenger, who had been Gunners boss for 22 years. In Wenger's final season, Arsenal finished sixth in the Premier League as they missed out on the Champions League but qualified for the group stages of the Europa League. The Gunners start their Premier League campaign against champions Manchester City on Sunday. While Kroenke says taking sole ownership will benefit the club, the Arsenal Supporters' Trust (AST) called the news ""a dreadful day"" for the Gunners. ""Stan Kroenke taking the club private will see the end of supporters owning shares in Arsenal and their role upholding custodianship values,"" said an AST statement. AST added that by becoming the 100% owner, Kroenke would be able to take ""detrimental actions"" such as paying ""management fees and dividends without any check or balance"". It added: ""The AST is also extremely concerned to note that this purchase is being funded by a loan. ""The AST is wholly against this takeover which marks a very sad day for Arsenal football club."" Rob Wilson, football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University There are two sides to this and from a fans' point of view you like to have a bit more transparency - when there is more than one person involved you get a broader discussion about what you should do, who you should buy and how much to spend on particular people. When you have this single ownership, particularly when it will be set up in the United States, it lacks a bit of transparency. There will be big dividends getting paid out from the football club as a profit maximising entity, but for Arsenal that's not really any different to what they have had for the past 10 or 15 years with Usmanov and back when Farhad Moshiri (former shareholder and Everton co-owner) was involved. The only thing that concerns me is it's going to be a leverage buy-out, so he's going to have to borrow to be able to do it. Depending on which side of the fence you're on will determine whether you see that as a positive or a negative thing. From a purely business point of view, it's not a bad model. It's like you or I buying a house, taking out a mortgage, if you maintain those payments against those loans or however you borrowed then it is not a problem. While the leverage is there that would have to be paid back, I don't think it will limit the activity Arsenal will be able to undertake in the transfer market as the reality is in order to make that business profitable, you have to be finishing in the top four and going into European competition. Kroenke will be raising the capital to take control of the club with Â£45m of his own money and borrowing Â£557m, which he says will not be against the club. ""The offer is not being funded by way of any debt finance (bank loans, payment in kind loans or other debt or quasi debt interest bearing obligations) for which the payment of interest on, repayment of, or security for any liability (contingent or otherwise) will depend on the business of Arsenal,"" said the statement. In the offer document,,externaleach of Arsenal's 62,217 shares are valued at at Â£29,419.64. KSE currently has 41,743 of those, with Usmanov holding a stake of 18,695, which would be worth Â£550m under the offer. Aquiring Usmanov's shares would move KSE past the 90% threshold whereby they could compulsorily be able to purchase the remaining 1,779 shares, which are valued at Â£52.3m. Apart from Arsenal, Kroenke's ""family portfolio"" of assets also include NFL side Los Angeles Rams, the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL outfit Colorado Avalanche, MLS side Colorado Rapids and Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League.

"Would you eat dog meat? UK law says that you can't buy or sell dog meat, but if you humanely kill a dog you own, you can eat it. But there have been calls to make it illegal, including from SNP MP Dr Lisa Cameron who believes the public would be ""right behind legislation calling for a ban"". A spokesman for the prime minister says the UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and ""we wish to maintain that"". Dr Cameron is the chair of the All-party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group. She told Newsbeat she wants a law banning eating dog meat to be passed quickly, adding: ""I don't imagine that there will be any party in parliament which would stand against that."" This is one of eight dogs which was brought to the UK after being rescued from a farm in South Korea A ban is also backed by Foreign Office minister and Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncanwho told the Sun,externalit is ""absolutely right"". Dr Cameron says there has been a rise in the consumption of dog meat in the UK, but two animal welfare organisations that Newsbeat spoke to say that they don't have evidence for this. The World Dog Alliance says it doesn't know if there are people in the UK who eat dog meat - but still wants it to be made illegal. Humane Society International told Newsbeat it has ""never come across any evidence to suggest that dog meat is being consumed in the UK"". Some countries in Asiaeat dogs, and it is also said to happen in Switzerland, althoughit isn't widespread. Animal organisations claim that some dogs which are eaten in other countries are stolen pets, are kept in horrible conditions and are tortured before they're killed. Dr Lisa Cameron is an SNP MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow Kike Yuen is project executive at the World Dog Alliance, based in Hong Kong, which campaigns to promote laws on banning dog meat consumption around the world. The organisation has been lobbying for a similar law in the US. There have been few reported cases of people eating dog in the country. Proposals for a law banning eating dog meat in America is currently working its way through US Congress. ""The reason why we did the legislation in the United States is because we found that there are some Asian immigrants eating dogs there,"" Kike told Newsbeat. He adds: ""We are worried that it is going to happen in the UK."" This dog was rescued from a farm in South Korea Humane Society International runs campaigns to end the dog meat trade in countries including Indonesia, China and South Korea. Spokesperson Wendy Higgins says she ""wouldn't want anyone to think that dog meat eating is rife in the UK or that it has anything to do with the number of people that we have living in this country from Asia"". She added: ""Most people across Asia are united in wanting to see an end to the dog meat trade and I don't see numbers of people from Asia in the United Kingdom having any impact on that whatsoever."" Despite there being no evidence that people in the UK eat dogs, Dr Cameron said ""the government has to take action to nip it in the bud"". She added: ""I think it's a concern if it is happening at all, no matter where it is happening. I'm not aware that it's linked with any particular groups in terms of research outcome."" Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""The commercial trade in dog meat in the UK is illegal, but we will look closely at the decision taken in the US.

"Dame Margaret Hodge is a vocal critic of Labour's issues with anti-Semitism Labour has dropped its inquiry into Dame Margaret Hodge despite her refusal to apologise over a confrontation with Jeremy Corbyn about anti-Semitism. Dame Margaret tweeted she was pleased the party had scrapped any action but added neither side had apologised. Journalists were briefed the decision had been taken after she expressed ""regret"" to Labour chief whip Nick Brown for her conduct. Dame Margaret hit back, insisting she had done no such thing. MPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism code A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Anti-Semites don't speak for me - Corbyn A strongly-wordedresponse from her lawyers,externalto Labour general secretary Jennie Formby said that although the ""decision is welcomed, the basis on which you seek to explain your belated volte face is entirely disingenuous"". The letter said Dame Margaret ""did not express regret"" and that was a misrepresentation in order to ""save face in your necessary climb down"". The investigation was launched after a heated exchange last month in which Dame Margaret was said to have called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Mr Corbyn has been criticised by Jewish community leaders and some of his own MPs over what they see as his refusal to take allegations of anti-Semitism in the party seriously enough. It centres on the Labour Party's code of conduct - which includes an internationally recognised definition of anti-Semitism but omits four of the 11 examples of ""contemporary anti-Semitism"".

Labour MP Ian Austin is stillfacing disciplinary actionfrom Labour over claims - denied by him - that he screamed abuse during a row over the code of conduct.  He has called the new code of conduct a ""disgrace"". Mr Corbyn, a long-standing supporter of the rights of Palestinians, has defended Labour's decision not to include one of the IHRA examples - which warns against ""claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour"". He said this had ""sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic"" Some Labour figures, including the shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith, had called for the investigation into Dame Margaret to be dropped - and shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour needed to ""move on"". Dame Margaret previously said she had chosen to confront Mr Corbyn in anger at what she said was the party's ""arrogance"" over its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. She accused Labour of ""playing around"" with the international definition, and said she had gone to tell Mr Corbyn he was ""perceived as being anti-Semitic"".

"Fraser, a pupil at Greenfaulds High School in Cumbernauld, gets a kiss from his mum after getting five As The pass rate for this year's Higher exams was ""broadly stable"", Education Secretary John Swinney has said. He was speaking on the day more than 135,000 pupils in Scotland found out how they had done in their National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers. The number of entries for Highers and the proportion of students who received a pass mark both fell slightly. Mr Swinney said it was ""another very strong performance by young people in Scotland"". He told the BBC: ""We've seen the number of Highers broadly stable and consistent in terms of the pass rate, despite the fall in pupil numbers who are involved in S5 and S6 within Scottish education."" Seven As for boy given 1% recovery chance There had been a doubling of skills-based qualifications over the last six years, which was ""crucial for young people entering the labour market"", along with ""really strong performances"" in Advanced Higher and in National 5. ""It is a really great achievement by young people - I congratulate them,"" said Mr Swinney. All students have received their results by post but about 59,000 also opted to receive them by text or email. A free helpline0808 100 8000is available for anyone seeking practical advice. It is open from 08:00 until 20:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Skills Development Scotland line will then be open from 09:00 until 17:00 from 9 to 15 August. There were 147,000 Higher passes, with a pass rate of 76.8%, compared with 77.0% in 2017. The results showed a record number of entries for Advanced Higher (24,331) since changes to the qualification were made in 2015/16, with attainment rates remaining high at 80.5%. Ucas figures show that 29,830 students from Scotland have had their university applications confirmed. This is a 4% increase in acceptances despite an overall fall in the population of 18-year olds. There has continued to be a drop in university acceptances for EU students. Detailed analysis of the results at subject level showed: A continued rise in passes in Mathematics at Higher and Advanced Higher National 5 Application of Mathematics pass rate up 11.3 percentage points Pass rates for English up 5.3 percentage points at Advanced Higher level Pass rates for English at Higher level down by 1.4 percentage points Pass rates for English at National 5 level down by 2.4 percentage points Skills-based qualifications increased to 50,305 this year - more than double the number in 2012 Mr Swinney  said that in the first year that unit assessments were removed from National 5, the overall pass rate remained high at 77.4%. He added: ""It is clear that our young people have performed strongly, against rigorous standards, and are now in an exciting position to decide what they go on to do next,"" he said. ""Results day is the culmination of months of hard work and it is important to remember that, whatever the outcome, it is only the beginning of a journey. ""Anyone who did not receive the results they had hoped for, or who is just unsure about their next steps, should get in touch with the SDS exam helpline for access to expert careers advice."" The main interest often lies in the Higher results - seen as the gold standard of the qualification system. The Highers were modified in 2015 to tie them in more closely with the National 4s and 5s which effectively replaced Standard Grades. Since 2016 only the modified Highers have been on offer. The proportion of Higher entries which achieve a pass is broadly stable but has declined for three years in a row. This year 76.8% of entries were marked at Grade C or above compared with 77% last year and 77.2% in 2016. The total number of entries has also fallen each year. The SQA also provided information about individual subjects. The number of entries for Higher English rose but the proportion of students who passed fell. This year there were 36,185 entries - 75.9% passed. Last year's pass rate was 77.3% The opposite happened in Higher Maths. The number of entries fell but the proportion that passed rose. This year there were 18,753 entries - 74.5% passed. Last year's pass rate was 74%. Figures like these will be viewed as representing a broadly stable system. Some may wonder why the overall proportion of candidates passing has declined for three years running - however if the number had risen for three years some might wonder if this was a sign of the exams getting easier or of ""teaching to the test"". Craig Newlands was among four students from Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire chosen by their head teacher to open their results live on the BBCGood Morning Scotland radio programme. ""I got five As,"" he revealed. ""It is what I hoped for. I will go back for 6th year now and take those results and see what the uni courses offer and then decide what course I want to do."" Eastwood High School pupils Clare Wallace (right) and Erin Wallace show head teacher Stuart Maxwell their results Pupils at Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire with their results The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is also issuing awards in Skills for Work courses, National Progression Awards and National Certificates for Scottish students. Commenting on the Ucas figures, NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: ""While it is encouraging to see a modest rise in the proportion of Ucas acceptances for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, we can't lose sight of the fact there is much more to do to ensure more students from the poorest areas make it into higher education. ""We need to see every institution - without exception - pulling their weight to change the current culture and boost admissions for these students."" The Royal Mail said staff have been ""pulling out all the stops"" to ensure results arrive as quickly as possible, with deliveries taking place across the world as many Scots are abroad for results day. Julie Pirone, director of external relations at Royal Mail, said the service had been working with partners in 45 countries to ensure results reached  pupils. Certificates have been issued to more than 135,000 candidates More than 758,000 exams were taken between 30 April and 4 June Exams were taken in 480 schools and colleges Almost 59,000 candidates received their results by email and/or text Seven As for boy given 1% recovery chance Scottish Qualifications Authority Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Officers have had to cancel leave to cover incidents such as the Wiltshire poisonings, the Police Federation said Almost one in 12 police officers say they have taken a second job, with some appearing to be in financial ""dire straits"", according to the Police Federation of England and Wales. A survey from the organisation, which represents thousands of officers, found 7.8% have sought extra work - a figure it says is a record high. And it said 44% worried about finances daily or nearly every day. Some officers have resorted to food vouchers, the PFEW chairman said. Previous reports have foundthat officers have taken up second jobs in professions including teaching, beauty therapy, photography, bar work and football refereeing. Officers are allowed to carry out additional work outside their job if the force approves it. Thestarting salary for a constable,externalis currently between Â£19,971 and Â£23,124, but rises to Â£24,171 after two years of service and can progress up to Â£38,382. A chief inspector's salarystarts,externalat Â£54,432. A2% pay increase,externalfor police officers will come into force in September. The Home Office says more than half of police constables are earning at the top of their pay bracket, and their average pay will be more than Â£38,600 following the pay increase. According to the survey,,externalwhich included responses from more than 27,000 police officers from constable up to chief inspector rank: 7.8% of respondents had taken up additional employment, up from 6.3% last year More than one in nine (11.8%) said they never or almost never had enough money to cover all of their essentials, rising from 11% last year Three quarters said they felt financially worse off than they did five years ago Over 87% of officers surveyed did not feel their pay was fair considering the ""stresses and strains of the job"" Chairman John Apter said it ""hardly comes as a surprise"" but the results were ""grim"". ""Our members are clearly suffering from even worse financial pressures than last year, with some appearing to be in dire straits,"" he said. Additional police were on duty to bolster security during Donald Trump's visit to the UK Mr Apter blamed dwindling resources and rising crime which has led to a record high demand for police services, adding that ""cash-strapped"" officers wanted to be ""adequately paid"". He highlighted the poisonings in Wiltshire and Donald Trump's UK visit as examples of officers having to cancel leave or rest days to be deployed. One police officer who has a second job, says he earns more in his extra work than he would do by doing overtime in his policing job. ""Where I am, about a third of us have second jobs,"" he said, adding there is ""very little loyalty left"" and ""like me, the only reason they stay is for what is left of our pensions"". Another, a police sergeant, says he joined the Army Reserve to bolster his take-home pay. The PFEW has labelled the 2% pay increase, coming into force on 1 September, as ""derisory"". Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Conservatives were ""in total denial about the misery that their cuts to public services have caused"". Reality Check: Is police funding falling? A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""We are grateful to all police officers for the incredible job they do - and will continue to ensure they have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively. ""The police pay award for 2018/19 represents the highest consolidated pay award since 2010. And the number of people joining police forces is at a 10-year high which demonstrates policing is still a desirable and sought-after career."" They added there will be a Â£460m increase in overall funding for police in 2018/19. Francis Habgood, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for pay and conditions, said forces encouraged officers to seek support if they ran into financial difficulties.

"The heatwave has spurred people into splashing out on fans, food and drink, but it has failed to prevent a slowdown in spending growth, a survey suggests. Sales in stores open at least a year rose by 0.5% in July, compared with 1.1% in June, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. The slowdown came despite food sales having their best July for five years. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said for many struggling retailers ""autumn could not come sooner"". She said the recent sweltering temperatures had put shoppers off browsing in shops, while the three-month long period of sunshine meant demand for many summer products had slowed. Warmer weather 'could last until October' Heatwave causing farmers 'serious concern' Five things enjoying a World Cup bonanza The survey also showed that total sales slowed last month, rising 1.6% compared with 2.2% in June. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG - which helped to produce the BRC survey, said ""perhaps it was just too hot to hit the High Street"". However, he said the survey showed the challenges retailers were facing, warning it would take more than ""events-based retail and sunshine to improve the health of the High Street"". The gloomy findings suggest little let-up in the tough retail climate. House of Fraser has been under pressure from online retailers House of Fraser is urgently seeking fresh funding in order to survive, with experts warning it will collapse if it does not find a new investor. The department store chain is one of a number of retailers struggling amid falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys R Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive. A separate survey from Barclaycard, which sees nearly half of the nation's credit and debit card transactions, suggests a slightly less negative picture. It said consumer spending rose 5% year-on-year in July. Spending in pubs was up almost 17%, the biggest increase since April last year, a rise Barclaycard credited to England's World Cup performance. However, it too cautioned that the rise in spending was likely to be short term with consumers less confident in their household finances than a year ago.

"This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them Twin wildfires in California, known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, have grown to become the largest active wildfire in state history, officials said on Monday. The fires have spread rapidly in recent days to burn 283,800 acres of land - an area almost the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters are tackling 16 major blazes across the state amid hot weather, strong winds and low humidity. At least seven people have been killed in the Carr fire in the state's north. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump has reiterated social media comments that the fires' spread is being ""made so much worse"" by California's environmental laws. Local officials and experts have criticised and dismissed his tweets. More than 14,000 firefighters and hundreds of US army personnel are trying to contain the more than a dozen major fires burning throughout the state. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Officials say the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two nearby fires being treated as the same incident, has surpassed last year's Thomas Fire to become the largest in state history. Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) described the wildfires as ""extremely fast, extremely aggressive, extremely dangerous,"" ""Look how big it got, just in a matter of days... Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen,"" he said on Monday. It is only 30% contained so far, with authorities warning it could take another week to get the blaze under control. This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". The US president has criticised Governor Jerry Brown and California's environmental laws on social media in recent days. He tweeted on Monday that the wildfires were being ""magnified & made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Allow Twitter content?

Deputy fire chief Mr Mclean dismissed Mr Trump's comments to US media, saying firefighters had ""plenty of water"" to tackle these wildfires. ""Our changing climate is leading to more severe and destructive fires that we are seeing this year and last,""he told Time magazine,external.

"Gates - pictured here in February - has already pleaded guilty to two criminal charges The ex-deputy of Donald Trump's former  campaign manager Paul Manafort has told a court he committed crimes with his former boss and stole from him. Rick Gates, star prosecution witness in the fraud trial, said the defendant, Mr Manafort, directed most of the crimes. Both were indicted last October for hiding millions of dollars they made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians. This is the first criminal trial to come from the Department of Justice-led inquiry into alleged Russian meddling. President Donald Trump calls the investigation a political ""witch hunt"", and has argued Mr Manafort is being treated worse than Al Capone. Trump says son met Russian for information On day five of the trial in Alexandria, Virginia, Gates was asked by the prosecutor whether he had committed any crimes with Mr Manafort, and he said: ""Yes."" He testified that Mr Manafort had directed him to lower taxable income by reporting overseas income as loans. Gates told the jury of six women and six men on Monday that he had been ordered by Mr Manafort not to disclose foreign bank accounts in Cyprus. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? The witness also testified he had helped the defendant file false tax returns, concealing 15 foreign accounts from the US government despite knowing it was illegal. He added that he had stolen ""several hundred thousand"" dollars from Mr Manafort by submitting false expense reports. Gates - who served on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign with Mr Manafort - told the court he had stolen from other employers, too. A courtroom sketch shows Mr Manafort seated during the opening day of his trial Mr Manafort, 69, could spend the rest of his life in prison if found guilty of all the fraud charges. Gates, 46, is already facing up to six years in prison under the terms of a plea deal he struck with prosecutors in February when he pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Originally charged as a co-conspirator, he acknowledged in court on Monday he was co-operating with the prosecution in the hope of leniency. Trump ex-campaign chief's 'income altered' Tax accountant Cindy LaPorta testified last week and earlier on Monday Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether any Trump aides colluded with an alleged Moscow plot to help elect him as US president, and whether there was any obstruction of justice. But Mr Manafort is not charged with helping the Kremlin. Prosecutors say he dodged taxes on millions of dollars he made from his work for a Russia-friendly Ukrainian political party. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Who's who in Russia drama? How Trump-Russia scandal has unfolded What is the special counsel? Testimony from Mr Manafort's tax preparer continued on Monday. Accountant Cindy LaPorta - who was granted immunity from prosecution - was asked by prosecutors if she had been aware of a $10m (Â£7.7m) loan in 2006 from Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. She testified that she was unaware if the loan was categorised for tax purposes as income. Ms LaPorta told the court on Friday she had suspected Gates was misleading her about Mr Manafort's finances. But she said she was under the impression that Mr Manafort had been directing his deputies' actions and ""knew what was going on"".

Detailed analysis of the results at subject level showed: A continued rise in passes in Mathematics at Higher and Advanced Higher National 5 Application of Mathematics pass rate up 11.3 percentage points Pass rates for English up 5.3 percentage points at Advanced Higher level Pass rates for English at Higher level down by 1.4 percentage points Pass rates for English at National 5 level down by 2.4 percentage points Skills-based qualifications increased to 50,305 this year - more than double the number in 2012 Mr Swinney  said that in the first year that unit assessments were removed from National 5, the overall pass rate remained high at 77.4%. He added: ""It is clear that our young people have performed strongly, against rigorous standards, and are now in an exciting position to decide what they go on to do next,"" he said. ""Results day is the culmination of months of hard work and it is important to remember that, whatever the outcome, it is only the beginning of a journey. ""Anyone who did not receive the results they had hoped for, or who is just unsure about their next steps, should get in touch with the SDS exam helpline for access to expert careers advice."" The main interest often lies in the Higher results - seen as the gold standard of the qualification system. The Highers were modified in 2015 to tie them in more closely with the National 4s and 5s which effectively replaced Standard Grades. Since 2016 only the modified Highers have been on offer. The proportion of Higher entries which achieve a pass is broadly stable but has declined for three years in a row. This year 76.8% of entries were marked at Grade C or above compared with 77% last year and 77.2% in 2016. The total number of entries has also fallen each year. The SQA also provided information about individual subjects. The number of entries for Higher English rose but the proportion of students who passed fell. This year there were 36,185 entries - 75.9% passed. Last year's pass rate was 77.3% The opposite happened in Higher Maths. The number of entries fell but the proportion that passed rose. This year there were 18,753 entries - 74.5% passed. Last year's pass rate was 74%. Figures like these will be viewed as representing a broadly stable system. Some may wonder why the overall proportion of candidates passing has declined for three years running - however if the number had risen for three years some might wonder if this was a sign of the exams getting easier or of ""teaching to the test"". Craig Newlands was among four students from Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire chosen by their head teacher to open their results live on the BBCGood Morning Scotland radio programme. ""I got five As,"" he revealed. ""It is what I hoped for. I will go back for 6th year now and take those results and see what the uni courses offer and then decide what course I want to do."" Eastwood High School pupils Clare Wallace (right) and Erin Wallace show head teacher Stuart Maxwell their results Pupils at Gryffe High School in Renfrewshire with their results The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is also issuing awards in Skills for Work courses, National Progression Awards and National Certificates for Scottish students. Commenting on the Ucas figures, NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: ""While it is encouraging to see a modest rise in the proportion of Ucas acceptances for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, we can't lose sight of the fact there is much more to do to ensure more students from the poorest areas make it into higher education. ""We need to see every institution - without exception - pulling their weight to change the current culture and boost admissions for these students."" The Royal Mail said staff have been ""pulling out all the stops"" to ensure results arrive as quickly as possible, with deliveries taking place across the world as many Scots are abroad for results day. Julie Pirone, director of external relations at Royal Mail, said the service had been working with partners in 45 countries to ensure results reached  pupils. Certificates have been issued to more than 135,000 candidates More than 758,000 exams were taken between 30 April and 4 June Exams were taken in 480 schools and colleges Almost 59,000 candidates received their results by email and/or text Seven As for boy given 1% recovery chance Scottish Qualifications Authority Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"A no-deal Brexit poses a risk to the public because the UK would lose access to EU-wide security powers and databases, police leaders have warned. Police and crime commissioners say law enforcement agencies ""face a significant loss of operational capacity"" if the arrangements stop. They have asked the home secretary to confirm his contingency plans. The Home Office says it will continue to make the case for the retention of the capabilities. In aletter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid,external, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners' cross-party Brexit Working Group stresses the importance of continued co-operation with European policing and justice bodies after March 2019. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options UK 'can't keep European Arrest Warrant' It says 32 measures are currently being used on a daily basis including the European Arrest Warrant;  the Schengen Information System -  a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. ""The UK and EU share a common and ever evolving threat picture. We believe that a comprehensive partnership in all areas of policing and security co-operation is of mutual benefit to all,"" they add. The commissioners say after discussions with National Crime Agency and the National Police Chiefs' Council, they understand ""considerable additional resource would be required for policing to operate using non-EU tools and that such tools would be sub-optimal - potentially putting operational efficiency and public safety at risk"". They add: ""We are therefore concerned that a 'no deal' scenario could cause delays and challenges for UK policing and justice agencies."" The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has indicated the UK wouldnot be able to remain part of the European Arrest Warrantafter Brexit and said it would not have the same access to organisations such as police agency Europol. But in June,the prime minister complained EU negotiators were blocking agreementon deals, risking the safety of EU and UK citizens. AHome Office spokesman told the Guardian:,external""There is widespread recognition that the UK and EU can most effectively combat security threats when we work together. ""It is important we maintain operational capabilities after Brexit, and we will continue to make this case to the European Commission."" He said the government was confident co-operation would continue but it was also preparing for ""every eventuality, including no deal"".

"The green-domed mosque in North Lombok has now been reduced to rubble Rescue workers are searching the ruins of a mosque in Lombok, Indonesia, where it is feared people were trapped by Sunday's deadly earthquake. The 6.9 magnitude quake is now known to have killed nearly 100 people and left at least 20,000 people homeless. The mosque is one of thousands of buildings in North Lombok that were damaged. Two people have already been rescued from the rubble, according to the national search and rescue agency. The earthquake struck on Sunday amid evening prayers. One witness told news agency AFP there may have been as many as 50 people in Jabal Nur mosque in Lading-Lading village at the time. ""Our imam ran, so the others followed,"" 53-year-old Kelana said. At least three crushed bodies have already been retrieved from the rubble. Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said many sandals were found in front of the mosque, raising fears that more victims could be found. This video can not be played Imam stays as quake hits Bali mosque He shared footage of one man being brought out from under the collapsed building.,external Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. The impact of Sunday's quake has far exceeded that of another which hitLombok last week, killing 16 people. The official death toll now stands at 98, but officials believe that may rise. Most of the victims were killed by falling debris. Rescuers look under the ruins of the flattened mosque Aid agencies have said their priority now is to provide shelter for displaced people, as aftershocks continue to rattle the area. In Lombok's main city of Mataram, medical staff have been struggling to cope with the injured in damaged hospitals. They have resorted to treating people in the open air. But the Indonesian Red Cross said there had been one ""blessing"" amid the disaster.Its volunteers helped a 38-year-old woman give birth at a temporary health station,externalon Monday. One of the names she gave her baby was ""Gempa"", which means earthquake in Indonesian. Pictures showed hospital patients in Mataram being moved out to makeshift wards set up under tents Phillipa Hodge was at the Katamaran Hotel just north of Mataram when the quake hit. She told the BBC the lights went out and the scene ""became chaotic"". ""People were falling over each other trying to get out, and glass was shattering. We felt debris fall on to us. ""I couldn't see my partner and I was shouting his name. Finally we found each other and he had blood all over his face and shirt."" Buildings in Bali were also left damaged by the earthquake and at least two people are known to have died there. Meanwhile search and rescue teams have rescued at least 4,000 people from the three Gili Islands. The white sand beaches and clear waters draw many backpackers and divers. Videos and images from the Gilis show hundreds of tourists crowded on beaches waiting to board small boats. On Gili Air, one of three islands that make up the Gili islands, crowds of tourists had waited to be evacuated ""It's understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking,"" Muhammad Faozal, the head of the tourism agency in West Nusa Tenggara province had earlier told AFP. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo has urged the speedy evacuation of casualties, calling for more flights to be sent to the affected areas.

"The British Homeopathic Association said it demonstrated a lack of long-term decision-making by NHS bosses The last place in England to offer publicly-funded homeopathy is to stop providing the practice on the NHS. Bristol's clinical commissioning group (CCG) has decided to end NHS-funded homeopathic treatment except in exceptional circumstances. Homeopathy is based on the idea ""like cures like"", but many scientists say patients are only getting sugar. The British Homeopathic Association said its treatments were of ""enormous value"" to patients. Since homeopathic treatmentsstopped being provided at the Royal London Hospital of Integrated Medicinein April, referrals for NHS treatment by homeopathic practitioners have only remained possible in Bristol and at the Glasgow Centre of Integrative Care. In Bristol, the NHS homeopathic service was delivered on behalf of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust by the Portland Centre for Integrative Medicine in Clifton. The trust says homeopathic medicine has been available in Bristol since 1852. Bid to overturn homeopathy crackdown Why does the NHS spend on homeopathy? Homeopathy could be blacklisted A 2010 House of Commons report found homeopathic remedies performed no better than placebos - dummy treatments. In 2017,NHS England recommended,externalthat GPs and other prescribers should stop providing it. It said: ""There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition"" while the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend using homeopathy for any clinical condition. But the practice remains popular with some patients seeking alternative or complementary treatments. The governing body of Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire (BNSSG) CCG, which oversees NHS services in the area, said about 40 new patients per year received NHS-funded homeopathic consultations and the overall cost in 2017-18 was Â£109,476. It needs to make savings of Â£37m in the coming financial year. ""This equates to around a further 22 hip replacements or 170 cataract operations,"" it said. The CCG decided to restrict referrals, at its public meeting on Tuesday. Clinicians will now need to set out why their patient is ""clinically exceptional"" and require the treatments. Dr Jonathan Hayes of the BNSSG CCG said: ""We've looked at the balance of evidence... and collectively, taking all that into consideration, we've come to the conclusion we shouldn't continue to fund this service in our area."" ""Staff and clinicians from across the CCG have closely examined the full range of clinical evidence available from both sides of the debate, consulted with local people, clinicians, patient groups and providers of homeopathic treatments,"" said Dr Peter Brindle, BNSSG medical director for clinical effectiveness. But Margaret Wyllie, Chair of the British Homeopathic Association, said: ""This demonstrates a lack of long-term decision-making by NHS bosses and helps to explain the ongoing NHS crisis. ""The amount of money spent on homeopathy by Bristol CCG is a tiny fraction of the local NHS budget but is of enormous value to the patients who benefit from the treatment, many of whom are elderly, and have chronic health conditions. ""The CCG should evaluate the impact on the future health, and costs to the NHS, for the homeopathy patients once the service is removed.""

"Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon met in Edinburgh at the signing of a new investment deal Prime Minister Theresa May has been challenged to set out a ""plan B"" for Brexit during talks with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh. Mrs May was in Scotland to mark the signing of a ""city deal"" investment package for the south east region. Ms Sturgeon said the prime minister's Brexit plan ""seems to be dead"", asking her to set out an alternative to avoid the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Mrs May urged the Scottish government not to ""sow division"" over Brexit. She called on Scottish ministers to get behind her negotiating position, adding ""a good deal for the UK is a good deal for Scotland"". What are the UK's Brexit options? The trip was the prime minister's first domestic appearance since she cut short her summer walking holiday fortalks with French President Emmanuel Macron. She has also spoken to the EU's chief negotiator Jean-Claude Juncker in a bid to win him over to the vision of Brexit she agreed with her ministersat Chequers in July. And while in Edinburgh she came under pressure from Ms Sturgeon to set out more details of what the UK's future relationship with the EU might look like after it leaves in March 2019. The Scottish and UK governments have long been at odds over Brexit, having failed to come to an agreement over the future of devolved powers which saw MSPsrefuse to give their backing to the EU Withdrawal Bill. Mrs May took in some of the sights of the Edinburgh festival while in Scotland, meeting a gospel choir Prior to the talks, Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that Brexit would be ""top of the agenda"", saying the UK leaving the EU without a deal would be ""catastrophic"". She said: ""With every day that passes, the prospect of a no deal Brexit or a Brexit with very, very little information about the future relationship seems to become more and more likely. ""Both of those outcomes would be completely unacceptable, absolutely disastrous for our economy, so I hope she can reassure me that neither of those things are going to happen. ""But if she can't, then I hope she will outline her plan B, because we cannot simply take a step off that Brexit cliff-edge next March without knowing what comes next. ""If the PM continues on her current track, trying to pretend that the Chequers deal - which even within her own party seems to be dead - is the way forward, then there's a risk we end up there and that cannot be allowed."" After the meeting, Mrs May urged the Scottish government to get behind her proposals. She said: ""What the government has put forward in the Chequers agreement and the White Paper is a proposal that delivers on Brexit, that ensures we bring an end to free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which protects jobs and livelihoods and is good for every part of the UK. ""What I want to see is as we sit and and negotiate that deal with the EU, I think its incumbent on the Scottish government to support the proposals, to be speaking up for those proposals in Europe, rather than sowing the politics of division. ""From Scotland's point of view, their trade within the UK's internal market is worth four times their trade with the EU. ""It's important that as we work on this deal, we are working with those in Scotland to deliver for Scotland. A good deal for the UK is a good deal for Scotland."" Details of the city deal agreement were announced in 2017 The Edinburgh and south east Scotland city dealwas announced last yearbut was formally signed off by the two leaders on Tuesday. It will see the Scottish and UK governments each contribute Â£300m, while local business and academic partners are expected to bring the total investment up to Â£1.2bn. The funds will go towards scientific research on space, health sciences, agricultural technology and food and drink at five new ""innovation hubs"", as well as the creation of a new 1,000 seat concert hall. This is the latest in a string of city deal packages, which have seen the two governments invest more than Â£1bn each in infrastructure and economic growth. Mrs May is also to announce Â£13m in funding for six science centres across the country,including in Dundee and Glasgow,to help improve facilities and attract new visitors.

"Ben Stokes leaves Bristol Crown Court after the first day of the trial England cricketer Ben Stokes mocked two gay men and flicked a cigarette butt at one of them before brawling with two other men, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder, who will miss the second Test against India at Lord's, denies affray. Bristol Crown Court heard Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 27, were knocked unconscious by Mr Stokes in Bristol on 25 September 2017. They also deny affray and are on trial alongside Mr Stokes. The fight outside a nightclub was ""a sustained episode of significant violence"" in which Mr Stokes ""lost control"", jurors were told. Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, said Mr Stokes, 27, had ""knocked Mr Hale unconscious and then - after time to pause for thought, to calm - he did exactly the same to Mr Ali"". The prosecutor described Mr Stokes's actions as ""well beyond acting in self-defence or defence of another"". The cricketer has maintained that ""at all times he acted in self-defence of himself or others"" and believed the force he used was ""reasonable and entirely justified"". An altercation took place in the Clifton Triangle area of the city just after 02:00 BST after the three defendants had left a nightclub, Mr Corsellis said. The court heard Mr Ali had sustained ""significant injuries"", including a broken eye socket. Ryan Ali (left) and Ryan Hale have both pleaded not guilty to affray Mr Corsellis told the jury a bottle was used at the beginning by Mr Ali, and a broken street sign brought into the fray towards the end by Mr Hale. The defendants had been drinking in Mbargo nightclub, with the fight taking place after it closed, jurors heard. Mr Stokes and his team-mate Alex Hales had left the nightclub at 00:46 but returned at 02:08. Bouncer Andrew Cunningham explained to the pair the club was closed and they would not be allowed in. However, an ""obviously upset"" Mr Stokes became ""aggressive"" and insulted Mr Cunningham about his appearance, jurors heard. Mr Cunningham said Mr Stokes's attention then turned to two ""openly gay"" men - Kai Barry and William O'Connor - outside the venue. He claimed the cricketer had mimicked their voices and mannerisms in what he described as ""a derogatory way"". The fight took place after Mr Stokes was turned away from Mbargo nightclub, the court heard Mr Corsellis said footage showed Mr Stokes ""copying hand gestures made by the men"", while the bouncer claimed the cricketer had flicked a cigarette butt at Mr O'Connor. ""Mr Stokes's behaviour outside the nightclub sets an important tone for what happened that night,"" the prosecutor said. ""He was clearly frustrated and annoyed.  He took to acting in a provocative and offensive way."" Only the defendants know precisely how the fight started, Mr Corsellis told the court, which was shown further footage of the incident. A video showed Mr Ali hitting Mr Barry on the shoulder with a bottle. Mr Stokes threw a punch at Mr Ali, and the pair fell to the ground, the jury were told. Then Mr Hale tried to drag Mr Stokes off Mr Ali, the court heard. Mr Hale told police he had been ""smashed to the floor"". Mr Corsellis alleged Mr Stokes did not act in self-defence but had pursued the other men in ""retaliation"". ""Everybody except him wants it to stop,"" he told the jury. He said that in the footage Mr Stokes' England team-mate Mr Hales could be heard to say: ""Stokes, Stokes, that's enough."" Ben Stokes, Ryan Hale and Ryan Ali all deny affray Mr Ali said ""move away, move away"" and Mr Hale said ""stop, stop"", Mr Corsellis told the court. An eyewitness, Laura Sweeney, said she saw Mr Hale pull a metal leg from a road sign and run towards the other men. After he was arrested Mr Stokes was interviewed by police, and in a prepared statement said he saw two men speaking to two gay men in a ""harsh and abusive"" way. The statement said he ""took exception to this and said 'leave it out'"". Mr Hale then ""grabbed and pulled"" him, and Mr Stokes ""felt the need to defend himself as he thought he was going to be attacked"" and hit him ""more than once"", jurors were told. In a second statement Mr Stokes denied being ""aggressive"" towards Mr Cunningham, accusing him of being ""rude"" and suggested he had a ""chip on his shoulder"". ""He denied mimicking or behaving in a derogatory manner towards Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor, saying that they had engaged in joking with each other and denied flicking a cigarette butt at anyone,"" the court heard. Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against West Indies at the city's County Ground. The trial continues.

"Kharg Island terminal: Energy exports are vital for the Iranian economy European foreign affairs chiefs have pledged to protect firms against the impact of US sanctions for doing business with Iran. An EU ""blocking statute"" will take effect on Tuesday to nullify US legal action against European firms in connection with Iran. Some US sanctions on Iran are expected to be reimposed later on Monday. In May, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from an international 2015 deal to control Iran's nuclear ambitions. Under that deal, nuclear-related Western sanctions on Iran were lifted. Mr Trump argues that the deal will not prevent Iran from finding ways to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear research is strictly for civilian purposes. A joint statement from EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK,externalsays the nuclear deal - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - is ""crucial"" for global security. ""We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran, in accordance with EU law and with UN Security Council resolution 2231,"" the statement says. ""This is why the European Union's updated Blocking Statute enters into force on 7 August to protect EU companies doing legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extra-territorial sanctions."" They say they ""expect Iran to fully implement its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA"".

"France's Total signed a major gas production deal with Iran after sanctions were lifted The EU is scrambling to find ways to safeguard huge business deals with Iran, amid the threat of US penalties. Washington is re-imposing strict sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 international deal to control the country's nuclear ambitions. On 8 May President Donald Trump denounced the deal, saying he would withdraw the US from it. Since the deal took effect in 2016 major European firms have rushed to do billions of dollars' worth of business with Iran, and now thousands of jobs are at stake. Many of those firms fear their business ties with the US could be at risk if they continue to do deals with Iran past a November deadline. Some firms say they are now preparing to wind down their business in Iran. There is an existingEU ""blocking statute"", from 1996,external, aimed at countering US sanctions linked to communist Cuba. Now EU officials say they are revamping the statute to avoid the latest US restrictions on firms doing business with Iran. But there are doubts about the statute's legal power. Reuters news agency says Shell and some other European firms with big operations in the US prefer to push for US waivers on a case-by-case basis. US authorities have imposed hefty fines on banks for processing Iranian transactions, including UK-based Standard Chartered, HSBC and Lloyds. France, Germany and the UK all say they remain committed to the nuclear deal with Iran and to expanding business ties, provided Iran sticks to its commitments.

In 2011 Iran had a big trade surplus with the EU. Trade slumped in 2012, but has been climbing back up since the 2015 deal. EU exports to Iran in 2017,external(goods and services) totalled â¬10.8bn (Â£9.5bn; $12.9bn), and imports from Iran to the bloc were worth â¬10.1bn. The value of imports was nearly double the 2016 figure. Most EU imports from Iran are energy-related - more than 75% is oil and other fuels. EU exports to Iran are mainly machinery and transport equipment, followed by chemicals. Italy's trade volume was highest, followed by France, then Germany and the Netherlands. But trade with Iran makes up just 0.6% of the EU's total global trade. Iran's main trade partners are the United Arab Emirates and China,external, which account for 23.6% and 22.3% of the country's total trade, according to the European Commission. EU trade, by contrast, makes up 6% of Iran's total. Since the lifting of sanctions there have been major EU-Iran business deals, among them: Total(French) signed a deal worth up to $5bn to help Iran develop the world's largest gas field, South Pars.
