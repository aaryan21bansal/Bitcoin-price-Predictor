Police said the man, from Micheldever, was driving on the A33 when the accident happened just before 16:00 GMT. He died at the scene. It comes as the UK continues to feel the after-effects of the storm which brought flooding and severe gales. Trains, flights and motorists face further disruption, while many flood warnings remain in place. Yellow weather warnings for snow, ice and wind,externalare also in force for large swathes of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England until 12:00 GMT on Wednesday. Forecasters said some areas could see blizzards and up to 20cm (8in) of snow. As it happened: Storm Ciara aftermath The storm in pictures Thousands of homes without power Hampshire Police released a statement on Monday saying a 58-year-old man died after a tree fell on the Mercedes he was driving from Winchester to Micheldever. ""His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers,"" the statement added. More than 500 properties are believed to have been flooded during Storm Ciara, with that number expected to increase as more information is collected, Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said. She added that between 40 and 80cm of rain had fallen within 24 hours across much of northern England. Ms Villiers said the government would provide ""significant financial support"" for the areas affected by flooding. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick activated the government's emergency Bellwin scheme for areas of West Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, which allows for funding to be activated. Elsewhere,wintry conditions have swept across Scotland, with many roads being affected by snow. Four peoplehad to be rescued near the summit of Ben Nevis, in the Scottish Highlands, after getting caught in blizzards. A Land Rover drives on a snow-covered road near Trinafour, Scotland.

Firefighters were called to this residential street in Essex in the early hours of Monday morning The town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, in Cumbria, was one of those severely hit by flooding The clean-up operation is also taking place in Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire Some areas experienced a month-and-a-half's worth of rainfall and gusts of 97mph on Sunday, resulting in flooding and power cuts for more than half a million households. Flood warnings remain in place across the UK, including71 in England,external,24 in Scotland,externalandthree in Wales,external. Engineers have managed to restore electricity to the vast majority of homes but more than 20,000 properties across east and south-east England and north Wales spent Sunday night without power.

"The UK government is considering taking a stake in troubled airline Flybe. The government is in talks with Flybe and the European Commission to ensure any rescue deal does not break state aid rules. Officials say support given to Flybe so far, such as a pledge to cut tax on some domestic routes, are industry-wide measures. However, the government is considering extending a loan of up to Â£100m to the loss-making airline. Government officials insist that any such loan will be on commercial terms but sources at competitors ask how the government can really mean that if the airline finds commercial lenders unavailable. There are different ways of answering those potential objections. First, charge an interest rate on a loan that fully reflects the risk that the government is taking with taxpayer money. This is the government's preferred option. Businesses with a loss-making track record should not be able to borrow at super-low interest rates when the risk of default is perceived as high. However, a loan at high rates of interest could damage the airline's ability to nurse itself back to health because of the hefty repayments required on a high interest loan. You would merely be kicking the can down the road. Another solution being floated - and described as ""possible"" by officials - is for the government to extend the loan but reserve the right to purchase shares at a pre arranged (low) price once the airline has returned to health. These rights, often described as ""warrants"", was the manner in which legendary investor Warren Buffett pumped money into investment bank Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis and there are few more commercially savvy financial first aid givers than he. A government loan to Flybe may be similar to a deal Warren Buffett struck with Goldman Sachs This approach makes it more likely the airline will be able to pay its debts, which in turn makes it more likely the airline will be worth more in the future, at which point UK taxpayers could reap rewards for the risk taken. Hey presto - a commercial arrangement thath helps the company now and sees the taxpayer share in any future success. To be clear, this is still uncomfortable territory for the government. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is prepared to push the envelope of what is possible in order to deliver on election commitments to improve regional connectivity to ""level-up"" Britain. A commitment that might look hollow if Flybe were to collapse. The EU has told the BBC it is in discussions with the government to ascertain whether financial assistance to Flybe provided to date or in the future could break EU competition rules. A spokesperson for the European Commission told the BBC that it is the responsibility of member states to decide whether support needs to be notified as state aid - which the UK insists it does not - unless other parties complain that such support is illegal and the EU can then investigate. British Airways' owner IAG and Ryanair have already done just that in letters to the European Commission over their concerns that the Flybe rescue announced in mid-January amounted to anti-competitive and therefore illegal support. IAG lodged a Freedom of Information request with the government seeking more detail about the extent of the support package. The deadline for the government to respond to that is this Thursday. British Airways-owner IAG has complained to the EC about UK government support for Flybe IAG boss Willie Walsh has pointed out that Flybe has wealthy owners including BA's arch-rival Virgin Airlines. Virgin, along with the Stobart haulage group and New York-based hedge fund Cyrus Capital, have agreed to put in Â£30m to Â£40m of their own money but that is thought to be insufficient to secure the long-term future of the airline and without a loan to get through the lean winter months, it remains in danger. Other things that have irritated rivals are Flybe's decision to switch its London-Newquay service from Heathrow to Gatwick - potentially freeing up a Heathrow slot for part owner Virgin Airlines and Flybe's expansion at Southend airport which just so happens to be owned by the Stobart group. It is not clear how much of the financial support from Flybe's owners has already been exhausted. The company said on Sunday that ""the airline is being supported by its shareholders and leading suppliers, is managing its cash position carefully and currently has strong liquidity"" There are many industry sources who insist that Flybe's problems are more deep-seated. Its business model is broken and the government is risking both wasting taxpayers' money AND creating a dangerous precedent for assisting failing businesses. As with many things being contemplated - the approval of HS2 despite ballooning costs, a potential mansion tax, prioritising fishing over finance, a raid on pension tax relief - we are dealing with a very different kind of Conservative government.

"Cacti that are over 200 years old and have sacred significance have been chopped down Native American burial sites have been blown up by construction crews building the US-Mexico border wall, says a lawmaker and tribal leaders. Authorities confirmed that ""controlled blasting"" has begun at Arizona's Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a Unesco recognised natural reserve. Raul Grijalva, a Democratic congressman,told the Intercept,externalthe destruction is ""sacrilegious"". The government failed to consult the Tohono O'odham Nation, he said. Environmental groups also warn of the damage being done to the local underground aquifer, as well as to migrating wildlife in the remote desert region about 115 miles (185km) west of Tucson. Officials say the aim of the project is to construct a 30ft-tall (9m) steel barrier that runs for 43 miles on the national park land. Allow Twitter content?

The United Nations designated Organ Pipe as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, calling it ""a pristine example of an intact Sonoran Desert ecosystem"". Mr Grijalva, the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, represents a district that encompasses the area, which shares 400 miles of border with Mexico. Construction on Monument Hill above saguaro cacti He toured the burial sites at the Organ Pipe, known as Monument Hill, last month, and was told that O'odham people buried warriors from the rival Apache tribe there. ""What we saw on Monument Hill was opposing tribes who were respectfully laid to rest - that is the one being blasted with dynamite,"" Mr Grijalva said. In interviews with US media, he called the Trump administration's conduct ""sacrilegious"" and said the environmental monitor that the government assigned to the project would do nothing to mitigate the cultural damage. One area contained artefacts dating back 10,000 years. Tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr told the Arizona Republic that even though the land is now controlled by the US government, ""we have inhabited this area since time immemorial."" ""They're our ancestors. They're our remnants of who we are as a people, throughout this whole area. And it's our obligation, it's our duty to do what is necessary to protect that.""

Crews are reported to have also destroyed ancient saguaro cacti, which Mr Grijalva said the O'odham people see ""as the embodiment of their ancestors"". ""So to see them turned into mulch - it's deeply upsetting."" The Trump administration has been able to build sections of the US-Mexico border wall on public land due to the 2005 REAL ID Act, which gives the federal government the right to waive laws that conflict with US national security policy. In their bid to build the wall, the White Househas waived dozens of laws,external- including ones that protected Native American graves, endangered species, and the environment. Mr Grijalva said he will work towards repealing the 2005 act and will convene a congressional hearing in the coming weeks in an effort to do so. Trump might not get his wall.

"The government has pledged Â£5bn over the next five years to improve bus and cycling services in England. Boris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares. Mr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would ""improve quality of life and productivity"". But Labour said the PM's plan ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" that have led to thousands of route closures. The announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project. Plans for first all-electric bus town revealed Cycling lessons for all children plan Bus funding: Where would it help the most? Mr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. In addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the Â£5bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 ""zero-carbon"" buses in England and Wales. This video can not be played The Cornwall teenager with a two hour bus commute Other planned improvements include: More evening and weekend services to make it easier for people to get around outside peak hours A ""simpler, cheaper and more convenient"" ticketing system for buses Priority schemes to allow buses to pass quickly through congested roads In September, ministers announced Â£220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England. They hope the cash will enable operators to restore recently withdrawn services, to give passengers in rural areas more choice and to increase the use of contactless payments. Further details will be announced in a new National Bus Strategy to be published later this year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the government's investment plan ""must be local"" to connect left-behind places to the rest of the country. ""We can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements. better rail, less congested roads, beautiful British-built buses, cleaner, greener, quicker, safer, more frequent,"" he said. ""Above all, we can improve the quality of life for people and improve their productivity, make places more attractive to live in and invest in."" Responding to the prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's plan as ""piecemeal"" and said the planned investment ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" in bus services. ""Funding for buses has fallen by Â£645m a year since 2010, 3,300 routes cut or withdrawn and fares have soared,"" he said. ""It's councils that keep bus routes open. We need long-term funding for the local authorities that have suffered such severe cuts and now face a further Â£8bn black hole over this Parliament."" British Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, welcomed the funding and said: ""Business communities will want to work with central government, local government and bus operators to ensure that this new funding makes a real difference on the ground."" On cycling, Mr Johnson promised to create ""hundreds of miles"" of new cycle paths and plans to make cycling safer in towns by expanding projects dubbed ""mini Holland"" schemes. The aim of creating ""low-traffic neighbourhoods"" outside of London is part of government plans to double rates of cycling by the 2025. There are plans for more evening and weekend services Campaign group the Walking and Cycling Alliance said ""the emphasis on quality infrastructure is to be applauded"" and that it hoped to work with other groups to ""ensure that this investment is the start of a real transformation in how we get around"". A spokesperson added: ""It has never been more important to make it easier to walk and cycle - to tackle climate change, poor air quality, crippling congestion, and the mental and physical health of the nation. ""The evidence is clear and people want to do it, what has been lacking is the investment and ambition to make it safe and easy for everyone.""

"The trial of Hashem Abedi (left) was told he and his brother used their mother's bank account The Manchester Arena attacker and his brother used their mother's bank account to buy tools and equipment to make a bomb, a court has been told. The Old Bailey heard Samia Tabbal's bank card was used to buy a battery and other items before the 2017 attack. Mrs Tabbal had been receiving tax credits, child and housing benefit of about Â£550 a week, even though she left the UK for Libya in October 2016. Hashem Abedi denies involvement in his brother Salman's attack. The jury was told Mrs Tabbal's bank statements showed a series of large cash withdrawals of between Â£50 and Â£300 each month in the UK after she left the country. As well as items from a B&Q superstore, her bank account was also used to pay for an industrial battery from a specialist shop in Salford, the court heard.

Her monthly housing benefit was last paid four days later, on 26 May. The financial investigation also revealed Salman Abedi, who had dropped out of a business management degree at the University of Salford on 13 January, received a student loan payment of Â£1,002.54 four days earlier and a further one of Â£2,258 at the end of the month. The court was told four cash withdrawals of Â£700, Â£710, Â£790 and Â£800 were taken from his RBS account on 23 January, before Abedi reported his bank card had been lost. His Halifax student account card was found in the foyer of the arena after the attack. Abdalraouf Abdallah was convicted in 2016 of preparing terrorist acts The jury also heard from Alharth Forjani, the Abedis' cousin, who said Hashem had asked him to help buy a bomb-making chemical on Amazon. He said he had agreed to make the purchase because ""I trusted him"", but he later had ""a bad feeling"" about what he had bought. Mr Forjani said he had then searched for the chemical online, because ""I just thought it might be to make explosives"", adding: ""I think that he believes in terrorism, that's what I thought."" Earlier, the trial heard Salman Abedi went to HMP Altcourse in Liverpool with two other men to meet convicted terrorist Abdalraouf Abdallah on 18 January 2017, four months before the attack. Abdallah, who was left paralysed after being shot during the 2011 Libyan uprising, was convicted of two counts of preparation of terrorist acts by helping two men enter Syria via Turkey and funding terrorism by sending Â£2,000 to his own brother. The jury was told a second meeting was set up for 6 March at the prison, but Salman did not attend.

Boris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares. Mr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would ""improve quality of life and productivity"". But Labour said the PM's plan ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" that have led to thousands of route closures. The announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project. Plans for first all-electric bus town revealed Cycling lessons for all children plan Bus funding: Where would it help the most? Mr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. In addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the Â£5bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 ""zero-carbon"" buses in England and Wales. This video can not be played The Cornwall teenager with a two hour bus commute Other planned improvements include: More evening and weekend services to make it easier for people to get around outside peak hours A ""simpler, cheaper and more convenient"" ticketing system for buses Priority schemes to allow buses to pass quickly through congested roads In September, ministers announced Â£220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England. They hope the cash will enable operators to restore recently withdrawn services, to give passengers in rural areas more choice and to increase the use of contactless payments. Further details will be announced in a new National Bus Strategy to be published later this year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the government's investment plan ""must be local"" to connect left-behind places to the rest of the country. ""We can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements. better rail, less congested roads, beautiful British-built buses, cleaner, greener, quicker, safer, more frequent,"" he said. ""Above all, we can improve the quality of life for people and improve their productivity, make places more attractive to live in and invest in."" Responding to the prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's plan as ""piecemeal"" and said the planned investment ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" in bus services. ""Funding for buses has fallen by Â£645m a year since 2010, 3,300 routes cut or withdrawn and fares have soared,"" he said. ""It's councils that keep bus routes open. We need long-term funding for the local authorities that have suffered such severe cuts and now face a further Â£8bn black hole over this Parliament."" British Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, welcomed the funding and said: ""Business communities will want to work with central government, local government and bus operators to ensure that this new funding makes a real difference on the ground."" On cycling, Mr Johnson promised to create ""hundreds of miles"" of new cycle paths and plans to make cycling safer in towns by expanding projects dubbed ""mini Holland"" schemes. The aim of creating ""low-traffic neighbourhoods"" outside of London is part of government plans to double rates of cycling by the 2025. There are plans for more evening and weekend services Campaign group the Walking and Cycling Alliance said ""the emphasis on quality infrastructure is to be applauded"" and that it hoped to work with other groups to ""ensure that this investment is the start of a real transformation in how we get around"". A spokesperson added: ""It has never been more important to make it easier to walk and cycle - to tackle climate change, poor air quality, crippling congestion, and the mental and physical health of the nation. ""The evidence is clear and people want to do it, what has been lacking is the investment and ambition to make it safe and easy for everyone.""

"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?

"The cost of HS2 is reportedly set to soar to more than Â£100bn One thing is certain about HS2: it doesn't generate much in the way of agreement. The latest debate around the high-speed rail line, which could be Europe's largest infrastructure project, concerns a revised cost figure of Â£106 billion,reported earlier this week,external. But experts close to the independent review of HS2 have cast doubt on the significance of that figure to a forthcoming report, led by former chairman of HS2 Doug Oakervee. Andy Street, the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands and a member of the review panel, told Newsnight that ""Â£106 billion was a 'could be' number. It was never a base case."" Others involved in the process said they did not believe the figure had even featured in the version of the report they had seen. The review panel's work finished in October, at which point those involved were allowed to read a ""final draft"" of the report before handing it back. ""The draft I read did not, to my recollection, give an opinion of costs as high as Â£106 billion,"" said one. Another expressed surprise in seeing the figure linked to the report this week. But the review had, indeed, identified risks that the costs could rise above the Â£81-88 billion estimate, they added. The panel, they said, had discussed steps that should be taken to help control the projects costs, including beefing up the project's governance with an independent, permanent review body. It had also considered whether the approach to contracts should be revised, with the government assuming more of the project risk to bring costs down. The Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to make a call within weeks on whether HS2 should proceed. The fate of the mammoth infrastructure project is seen as closely linked to the new government's ambitions to boost growth in constituencies in the North and Midlands. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and one of the Oakervee review panel, this week suggested the leak of the report was government ""spin"" against the project. He toldRadio 4's PM programme: ""Number 10 are trying to spin the fact that they are sitting on the report and they are trying to condition the public to their own conclusions. Some of the aspects of the reporting....are not, if the report was properly published, the way it would be interpreted"". Another person involved in the review told Newsnight: ""It was a yes recommendation"", adding that they shared Mr Sentance's concerns. Others questioned whether the report could have changed since the version shared with the panel last year. ""I stand behind the report and have no reason to think anything has changed,"" said Mr Street. ""I would like to see the report published as soon as possible so that we all know exactly what the facts are"". A DfT spokesperson said this week:  ""A draft of the Oakervee Report was delivered shortly before Christmas. ""The Transport Secretary, Chancellor and Prime Minister will take a final decision on HS2 shortly."" The FT, which first reported the new details from the Oakervee review, said that Â£106 billion was the price of the project put forward to the review by Michael Byng, an infrastructure consultant. A separate report published by Lord Berkeley, the former deputy chair of the Oakervee review, had mentioned a figure of Â£107 billion as the latest cost of the project. Lord Berkeley published his own report, saying that he disagreed with the conclusions of the draft review and ""was not given an opportunity to amend it."" HS2: Give me the facts, says Shapps Will HS2 ever get built? HS2 'threatens' natural habitats, report warns Supporters of HS2 argue that the large price tag reflects the scale of the project, which will be delivered over two decades and has the potential to transform the UK's rail infrastructure. But to give the go ahead to HS2, the government will (implicitly at least) be required to show the project's value at the latest expected cost. Whatever that might actually be.

"Work is under way ""by a range of government officials"" to look at the idea of building a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge, No 10 has said. Boris Johnson has described the bridge as a ""very interesting idea"", while Ireland's premier Leo Varadkar has said it was ""worth examining"". But Nicola Sturgeon said there were ""more important priorities"". Two routes have previously been floated - from Portpatrick to Larne or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. The Portpatrick route would be more than 20 miles across the Irish Sea. Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge 'worth examining' The prime minister's spokesperson said: ""The prime minister has said it would have some merit - as a result you would expect government to be looking into it. ""Work is under way by a range of government officials."" However shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard accused Mr Johnson of being ""a master of distraction,"" adding: ""every moment spent talking about a bridge no one wants, is airtime not spent focusing on the crises right in front of us"". Scotland's First Minister Ms Sturgeon said her mind was not closed to the idea but added ""if he [the prime minister] has got Â£20bn to build such a bridge going spare at the moment - that could be spent on more important priorities"". A spokesperson for the UK Chamber of Shipping said the bridge would simply ""replicate"" ferry services already operating between Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK,"" they added. Critics think it's mad. And it certainly won't be easy. The cost could be more than Â£20bn and the Irish Sea isn't the most hospitable terrain for a major infrastructure project - Beaufort's Dyke is littered with munitions dumped afterWorld War II.,external Leading architects - however - have said it would be possible. And Boris Johnson is taking it seriously - having made it clear he is keen on the idea. Officials are looking at feasibility at the moment and reporting directly to Number 10. I'm told we should find out later this year if there's any prospect of this moving forward. If engineering challenges can be overcome - then cost will be important too. But it's worth remembering Boris Johnson's track record on ambitious bridge projects is a troubled one. As London Mayor - he backed a Garden Bridge over the Thames. It was cancelled by Sadiq Khan because of the financial risk - but still cost around Â£53m. Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, to Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, is one potential route for a bridge The price of any construction would, obviously, be dependent on the route chosen. More than a decade ago the think tank the Centre for Cross Border Studiessuggested a 21-mile bridge from Dumfries and Galloway could provide international rail links and ease the strain on air services.,external At that time it estimated the cost of the scheme would be about Â£3.5bn. However, by last year the suggested price tag had risen considerably. Some experts have suggested Â£15bn might be required for the project but others have said that  Â£20bn would be a ""conservative estimate"".

"A GP practice in Brighton has been temporarily closed after a staff member tested positive for coronavirus. Patients at the city's County Oak medical centre have been advised to contact the NHS 111 phone service if they have concerns. Two of the eight people diagnosed in the UK are understood to be GPs. The Department of Health has called the virus a ""serious and imminent threat"" to public health, but the overall risk to the population is ""moderate"". However, the risk to individuals is low, the department said. A school in Southampton has also closed over concerns about the virus. St Mary's Independent School said the ""precautionary"" three-day closure came after ""members of the school community"" became ill, having recently travelled to China. Brackley Medical Centre in Northamptonshire was also closed as a precautionary measure, but later reopened. There have been more than 40,000 cases of the virus globally, mostly in China. The total number of deaths in China is now 1,011. Coronavirus: How worried should we be? A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus super-spreaders: Why are they important? Four new UK cases were announced on Monday - taking the total number of people infected in the UK to eight. Two of the new cases are understood to be GPs - one of whom works at the County Oak medical centre. A sign put up at the surgery said it had been closed ""for extensive cleaning as a precautionary measure"" and would be open as soon as possible, hopefully on Tuesday afternoon. One of the eight UK cases is a British man who caught the virus at a conference in Singapore and travelled to a ski resort in France. He was diagnosed in Brighton, and is being treated at St Thomas' Hospital in London. He has been linked to five of the other cases. County Oak Medical Centre In addition to the eight cases in the UK, five British nationals tested positive in France following the Brighton man's trip to the ski resort. A British man has also been diagnosed with coronavirus in Majorca after coming into contact with a carrier in France. Tedros Adhanom - director general of the World Health Organization - told a press conference on Monday that cases such as those in the UK and France ""could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire"". ""But for now, it's only a spark,"" he said. ""Our objective remains containment."" Meanwhile, the Department of Health has introduced new measures in England that mean those in quarantine will not be free to leave their accommodation, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. The move comes after a passenger on the first UK flight from Wuhan, who is being held in quarantine on the Wirral, had been ""threatening to abscond"" despite signing a contract agreeing to the isolation period. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. The main focus is on rapidly identifying people with the disease and taking them to specialist hospitals for treatment in isolation. They are then tracing anybody who has come into close contact with patients to make sure they know the signs of the disease and what to do. Arrowe Park Hospital, on the Wirral, and Kents Hill Park conference centre, in Milton Keynes, have been designated as ""isolation"" facilities in the UK. Evacuees from Wuhan who travelled to the UK on two flights chartered by the Foreign Office arecurrently in quarantine at those locations.

He said he and his wife, who is a Chinese national, had been in a town in Hubei province and were unable to reach Wuhan to fly back to the UK - but the Foreign Office organised a coach to pick them up. He said he was ""relieved to have been able to get out"", and compared scenes in Hubei with ""something out of a post-apocalyptic movie"". Astatement published on the Department of Health website earlier on Monday said,externalthe ""incidence or transmission of novel coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health"". However, Whitehall sources say that announcement was made to help enforce the new quarantine powers. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said the ""over dramatic"" language was likely to have been used for ""obscure legal reasons"". The departmentconfirmed on Twitter that the risk to the public,externalhas not changed. That risk has been declared as ""moderate"" - a level which allows the government to plan for all eventualities, officials say.

"A proposed design for an HS2 train The government is set to approve the controversial High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, the BBC has learned. An announcement on the route linking London to Birmingham, and then on to Manchester and Leeds, is expected by the prime minister on Tuesday. Supporters of the plan say it will improve transport times, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. But the rising cost of the project and accusations of mismanagement have provoked anger from critics. HS2 - which is due to be completed by 2040 - is already over budget and behind schedule. The government is expected to approve the whole line. However, it will try to make changes to the second phase of the project - the routes to Manchester and Leeds - to save money. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC the train line would help cut overcrowding: ""We need a better backbone for our public transport services, ""The capacity HS2 is going to deliver is absolutely crucial."" Many smaller businesses have also welcomed the plan. Lee Kemp, who runs Vermillion Films in Birmingham, which makes corporate training films, said HS2 is ""really good news for us as a city and as a region"". ""With this actually moving forward people can start making plans around it,"" he told the BBC. Latest reaction to HS2 go-ahead How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive What is the HS2 route and how much will it cost? Just how blow-out is the HS2 budget? HS2 costs out of control, says review's deputy chair However, the building of HS2 has also had its casualties. Ron and Anne Ryallhave been ordered to leave their home in March,because it is on the planned route and is due to be demolished. Ron told the BBC:,external""It's completely wrecked our lives. I'm finding it difficult that someone can just walk into your life and destroy it. My family has lived in this lane for 100 years. I was born here."" A source close to the project has confirmed that Boris Johnson will also announcea series of other transport projectson Tuesday. The projects are aimed at answering critics who fear the high cost of HS2 will mean other infrastructure projects are sidelined. Some of them will be situated in the north of England and the Midlands as part of the government's manifesto promise to ""level up"" the UK by investing more in regions outside of London. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Approving the plan could be seen as a risky move for Mr Johnson as there has been opposition to the scheme within the Conservative Party. His chief adviser Dominic Cummings called HS2 a ""disaster zone"" last summer, while several MPs who represent constituencies that could be affected by the building works are also against the project. Transport SecretaryGrant Shapps has defended the right of Tory MPs to oppose the plan,saying they were entitled to represent the views of their constituents. Former Conservative cabinet minister David Lidington, said he feared HS2 was ""20th Century technology and infrastructure for a 21st Century economy"". Labour peer Lord Berkeley - former deputy chairman of the project's independent review - said HS2 would not help commuters in the north, but would be good for people travelling between London and Birmingham. Environmental groups say HS2 will boost carbon emissions and spoil areas of natural beauty. In 2015, it was estimated that the cost of HS2 would be Â£56bn, but a review has warned that it could rise to as much as Â£106bn. Work to prepare the ground for the first phase of HS2 linking London and Birmingham has been going on for years. But a green light from the government means construction of the railway will begin relatively soon. It is also expected that work on the line between Birmingham and Crewe will be rolled into the first phase. It had originally been slated to begin at a later stage. Construction on the second phase of the project, originally planned to link Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham with Leeds, is at a much earlier stage. The BBC has been told that the government will commission a further review of this part of the line to find ways of making it more affordable. It also wants to ensure that these lines can be better integrated into the existing railway network along with other planned upgrades such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, which aims to improve east-west links across the north of England. This video can not be played Working on HS2: ""The opportunities are just immense"" The initial plan was for a new railway line between London and the West Midlands carrying 400m-long (1,300ft) trains, with as many as 1,100 seats per train. The line would enable trains to reach speeds of up to 250mph and would run as often as 14 times an hour in each direction. This would be followed by a V-shaped second phase taking services from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. Early work has begun on the first phase of HS2 The Department for Transport (DfT) has saidthat the project will triple the capacity of trains across the entire route. According to the latest estimates, the first stage would be completed between 2028 and 2031 - long after the original opening date of 2026. Meanwhile, the second stage would be ready in 2035-2040. The announcement on High Speed 2 broadly mirrors some of the main recommendations from the government's still unpublished review into the project. I've read the full report and it emphasises that any significant changes to the first phase of HS2, linking London to Birmingham, would have caused further delays. No-one in government wanted that. The Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds phase will undergo another review because it is at such an early stage, and ministers believe savings can be found. They also want the high-speed lines to be better integrated with our existing rail network and future infrastructure projects. Politics and pledges to voters in the north of England and the Midlands was a big part of this decision. But so too was the amount of work which has already been done on the first phase of the project. Ultimately, the government felt that turning back wasn't an option. Its much higher price tag has made HS2 politically toxic, so the government is also announcing a massive cash injection for buses and cycling in England. I'm told that figures within government who weren't sold on HS2 wanted those other transport pledges at the same time. Essentially, because they were over-optimistic in the first place. The National Audit Office has warned in successive reports over a number of years thatHS2 had an ""unrealistic timetable"". In its most recent analysis, it said thatthe risks of the project were never properly assessedwhen initial costs were estimated. HS2 began under the Labour government in 2009, but the cost has continued to balloon under subsequent administrations. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London-to-Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the DfT. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth. Darren Caplan, head of the Railway Industry Association. told the BBC that the line would also ""increase capacity on the East Coast Main Line, the Midlands Main Line and the West Coast Main Line.

She added that between 40 and 80cm of rain had fallen within 24 hours across much of northern England. Ms Villiers said the government would provide ""significant financial support"" for the areas affected by flooding. Earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick activated the government's emergency Bellwin scheme for areas of West Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, which allows for funding to be activated. Elsewhere,wintry conditions have swept across Scotland, with many roads being affected by snow. Four peoplehad to be rescued near the summit of Ben Nevis, in the Scottish Highlands, after getting caught in blizzards. A Land Rover drives on a snow-covered road near Trinafour, Scotland.

"This video can not be played US Attorney General William Barr called the hack ""one of the largest data breaches in history"" The US has charged four Chinese military officers over the huge cyber-attack on credit rating giant Equifax. More than 147 million Americans were affected in 2017 when hackers stole sensitive personal data including names and addresses. Some UK and Canadian customers were also affected. China has denied the allegations and insisted it does not engage in cyber-theft. Announcing the indictments on Monday, Attorney General William Barr called the hack ""one of the largest data breaches in history"". According to court documents, the four - Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei - are allegedly members of the People's Liberation Army's 54th Research Institute, a component of the Chinese military. They spent weeks in the company's system, breaking into security networks and stealing personal data, the documents said. The nine-count indictment also accuses the group of stealing trade secrets including data compilation and database designs. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations on Tuesday and said China's government, military and their personnel ""never engage in cyber theft of trade secrets"". He said China was itself a victim of cyber-crime, surveillance and monitoring by the US, Reuters reported. The whereabouts of the four suspects is unknown and it is highly unlikely that they will stand trial in the US. FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said: ""We can't take them into custody, try them in a court of law, and lock them up -not today, anyway,external."" Equifax said hackers accessed the information between mid-May and the end of July 2017 when the company discovered the breach. The accused allegedly routed traffic through 34 servers in nearly 20 countries to try to hide their true location. The FBI released this wanted picture of the suspects The credit rating firm holds data on more than 820 million consumers as well as information on 91 million businesses. On the inside of a hacking catastrophe Mr Bowdich said there was no evidence so far of the data being used to hijack a person's bank account or credit card. Equifax CEO Mark Begor said in a statement that the company was grateful for the investigation. ""It is reassuring that our federal law enforcement agencies treat cybercrime - especially state-sponsored crime - with the seriousness it deserves."" Critics have accused the company of failing to take proper steps to guard information and for waiting too long to inform the public about the hack. Richard Smith, CEO of Equifax at the time of the hacking, resigned a month after the breach. He apologised for the firm's failings, ahead of testifying in Congress. Equifax was forced to pay a $700m (Â£541m) settlement to the Federal Trade Commission. The US regulator alleged the Atlanta-based firm failed to take reasonable steps to secure its network. At least $300m of the settlement went towards paying for identity theft services and other related expenses run up by the victims. In a statement Mr Barr said,external: ""This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people. ""Today we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the internet's cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us."" This is not the first time the US has charged members of the Chinese military with hacking US companies. The first indictment came back in 2014 and helped lead to a deal the following year to try to restrain such activity. But clearly the US feels that it needs to return to the weapon of public indictments to increase pressure again. The US has become increasingly concerned not just at the alleged theft of economic secrets but also the intelligence risks. Equifax was one of a series of large data breaches linked to China - others include health care providers and, most significantly, the theft of data from the Office of Personnel Management which carried sensitive records for almost all US federal employees. One of the concerns for US security officials is how Chinese spies may be able to put together these vast databases about US citizens. Officials say the information could be used to create ""targeting packages"", establishing which individuals have access to sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities which would allow them to be approached. They add, though, that so far they have not seen the Equifax information being used for that purpose.

"This video can not be played Ireland's elections: Five myths explained Fianna FÃ¡il has won the most seats in the Irish general election just one ahead of Sinn FÃ©in, who recorded a historic result. Sinn FÃ©in's haul of 37 seats is an increase of 14 on the 2016 election. Fine Gael, whose party leader Leo Varadkar led the outgoing government as taoiseach (Irish prime minister), finished with 35 seats, down 15 from four years ago. The tight numbers could lead to lengthy negotiations to form a government. The election results were confirmed shortly after midnight when two Fianna FÃ¡il candidates, Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth, won the last two seats in Cavan-Monaghan. The final results showed that: Sinn FÃ©in had won 37 seats, an increase of 14 on the 2016 election Fianna FÃ¡il had lost six seats since 2016 but became the largest party by one seat Fine Gael lost 15 seats from 2016 The Green Party recorded their best ever election result, winning 12 seats - an improvement of 10 from 2016 The outcome was described as""something of a revolution in the ballot box""by Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald. With all first preferences counted, the left-wing republican party has taken 24.5% of the vote, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il had ruled out forging a coalition with left-wing republican party Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday, taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar conceded it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, who topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency, said Sinn FÃ©in wanted to be in government and was working to establish if the numbers were there to deliver it without Fianna FÃ¡il or Fine Gael. On Monday evening, she said she had not heard from the leaders of those two parties and has instead been speaking to Labour, the Green Party and other smaller parties that make up the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). ""People want different politics, new politics and better government - a new government - and I believe Sinn FÃ©in will be the core of that,"" she told reporters in Dublin. ""I may well be the next taoiseach,"" she added. As it happened: Irish election results and analysis day two Who is Mary Lou McDonald? Profile of Ireland's political parties Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mrs McDonald also said she believed constitutional change was coming. ""The point has been conceded in the Good Friday agreement by the British state - the presence here is solely on the basis of consent,"" she said. ""That consent can only be tested in a unity referendum and we are going to have a unity referendum - and I want us to do it in an orderly, thoughtful democratic and absolutely peaceful manner."" Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, said the party would have ""asks in terms of the republican project"", in line with itsrepeated calls for the next government to prepare for Irish unity. Left-leaning Sinn FÃ©in managed to successfully tap into the public anger felt in the Republic of Ireland over issues that have dogged centre-right Fine Gael for a number of years - a shortage of housing, rocketing rents and homelessness, analysts suggest. That is despite the fact the country is forecast to have one of the fastest growing economies in the EU in 2020. They were dubbed ""the problems of success"" by former Finance Minister Michael Noonan as far back as 2015. This video can not be played ""This is a seismic election shift"" - Michelle O'Neill Brexit - a considerable focus of Leo Varadkar and his deputy Simon Coveney while in power - barely registered as an issue in the campaign. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, whose party is in a power-sharing government with Sinn FÃ©in in Northern Ireland, said younger voters had backed Sinn FÃ©in as a ""protest vote"". ""From a Northern Ireland perspective we will have to work with whoever the government is in the Republic of Ireland,"" Mrs Foster told BBC News NI. She also said Sinn FÃ©in may have their focus on Northern Ireland questioned, in the way there had been a ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" over her party's confidence-and-supply agreement with the previous Conservative government in the UK. Sinn FÃ©in's best-ever result is the success story of this election. However, with how the overall votes have fallen, we know that Sinn FÃ©in will not necessarily end up in government despite its swathe of victories. The magic number for winning a majority government in the Republic of Ireland is 80 seats. None of the three big parties - Fine Gael, Fianna FÃ¡il and now Sinn FÃ©in - will come close to that figure. Attempts to form a new coalition-of-sorts will formally get under way, although this will be complex. Previous administrations in the Republic of Ireland have been forged this way too, but it's taken a while to get there. In 2016, it took70 days for a government to be formedafter the parties agreed a confidence-and-supply agreement, which saw a Fine Gael-only cabinet, propped up by Fianna FÃ¡il votes on key policy areas. Read more of Jayne's analysis here. Sinn FÃ©in's vote has increased dramatically - winning 37 seats out of the 42 seats it stood candidates in and topping the poll in 30 constituencies. Followingthe last election in 2016 Sinn FÃ©in had 23 seatsin the DÃ¡il. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and since 2016, a confidence-and-supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first preference votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was clear there was now a ""three-party system"". On Sunday MicheÃ¡l Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days and that he respected the will of the people. The Green Party has increased the number of seats it holds, jumping from two seats in the last election to 10. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). AontÃº (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. Who will be the next Irish prime minister?

"Prominent companies have cut ties with the prince's scheme Pitch@Palace, a Dragons' Den-type mentoring network set up by Prince Andrew, has appeared to further distance itself from its royal founder. The company, owned by the prince, had already moved from its Buckingham Palace base into new office space. Now, the initiative has removed mention of the prince's name from its website. Prominent supporters turned their backs on Pitch@Palace after revelations about the prince's friendship with disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Barclays, Standard Chartered and KPMG all cut ties after aBBC Newsnight interview about the royal's relationship with the late sex offender. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? What do charities get from having a royal patron? The scheme connects start-up firms, often in the technology sector, with potential investors. Until recently, its website welcomed visitors with the words: ""The Duke of York founded Pitch@Palace to provide a platform to amplify and accelerate the work of entrepreneurs."" But as first reported in the Telegraph, that message has now been replaced with a note saying that Pitch@Palace is taking the first part of 2020 to ""refresh the brand"". Some, but not all, pictures of Prince Andrew have also been removed from the website. The UK arm of Pitch@Palace is currently being wound up but its global operations remain active. It is not known whether the prince will play an active role in the initiative going forward. The prince appears at an event for Pitch@Palace In November, the duke announced that he would step back from royal duties because the Epstein scandal had become a""major disruption""to the Royal Family. It followed an interview with Newsnight in which he said that he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, despite the late financier having been convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution in 2008. The prince did, however, say he regretted visiting Epstein at his Florida home in 2010. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, says she was trafficked to London by Epstein in 2001, when she was 17, and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew. Prince Andrew emphatically denies any form of sexual contact or relationship with her and says any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation. He said he has no recollection of ever meeting Ms Giuffre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts. He has since been criticised by the US prosecutor in charge of the investigation who said the prince had provided ""zero co-operation"" to the Epstein investigators. Buckingham Palace said the prince's legal team was dealing with the issue and that it would not be commenting further. Who was Jeffrey Epstein?

""Today we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the internet's cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us."" This is not the first time the US has charged members of the Chinese military with hacking US companies. The first indictment came back in 2014 and helped lead to a deal the following year to try to restrain such activity. But clearly the US feels that it needs to return to the weapon of public indictments to increase pressure again. The US has become increasingly concerned not just at the alleged theft of economic secrets but also the intelligence risks. Equifax was one of a series of large data breaches linked to China - others include health care providers and, most significantly, the theft of data from the Office of Personnel Management which carried sensitive records for almost all US federal employees. One of the concerns for US security officials is how Chinese spies may be able to put together these vast databases about US citizens. Officials say the information could be used to create ""targeting packages"", establishing which individuals have access to sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities which would allow them to be approached. They add, though, that so far they have not seen the Equifax information being used for that purpose.

"Last year Rose Kalemba wrote a blog post explaining how hard it had been - when she was raped as a 14-year-old girl - to get a video of the attack removed from a popular porn website. Dozens of people then contacted her to say that they were facing the same problem today. The nurse stopped at the doorway leading out of Rose's hospital room and turned to face her. ""I'm sorry this happened to you,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""My daughter was raped too."" Rose looked at the nurse. She couldn't be older than 40, Rose thought, her daughter must be young, like me. She thought back to the morning after the assault, to the conversations with the emotionless policeman and the clinical doctor. Everyone had used the phrase ""alleged"" when referring to the violent, hours-long overnight attack that Rose had described to them. With the exception of her father and grandmother, most of her relatives hadn't believed her either. With the nurse it was different. ""She believed me,"" Rose says. It was a small crack of hope - someone recognising and acknowledging what had happened to her. A wave of relief washed over her, which felt like it could be the start of her recovery. But soon hundreds of thousands of people would see the rape for themselves and from those viewers she received no sympathy. A decade later, Rose Kalemba brushes her thick thigh-length black hair at the bathroom mirror, twirling the ends with her fingers to form natural ringlets. This wouldn't have been the case in the months after her attack - all the mirrors in her home had to be covered with blankets, as she couldn't bear to catch her reflection. She is now 25 and she has organised routines of self-care into her daily life. Taking care of her hair is one. Combing it takes time and effort, it's almost an act of meditation. She knows she has beautiful hair, people comment on it all the time. Every morning she also makes herself a cup of cacao, a pure, raw form of chocolate that she believes has healing qualities, and writes down her goals in a diary. She deliberately puts them in the present tense. ""I'm an excellent driver,"" is one goal. ""I'm happily married to Robert,"" is another. ""I'm a great mother."" Sitting down to talk, Rose pulls her hair over her shoulders - it covers most of her body, her own armour. Growing up in a small town in Ohio, it wasn't unusual for Rose to go for a walk alone before bedtime. It cleared her head, she enjoyed the fresh air and peace. So that evening in summer 2009 started like most for 14-year-old Rose. Rose as a young child, with toys and books But then a man appeared from the shadows. At knifepoint he forced her into a car. Sitting in the passenger seat was a second man, aged about 19 - she'd seen him around town. They drove her to a house on the other side of town and raped her over a period of 12 hours, while a third man filmed parts of the assault. Rose was in shock - she could hardly breathe. She was badly beaten and stabbed on her left leg, her clothes bloody. She fell in and out of consciousness. At some point, one of the men got out a laptop and showed Rose videos of attacks on other women. ""I am of first nations ethnicity,"" she says. ""The attackers were white and the power structure was clear. Some of the victims were white but many were women of colour."" Later, the men threatened to kill her. Forcing herself to collect her senses, Rose began to talk to them. If they released her, she wouldn't reveal their identities, she said. Nothing would ever happen to them, no-one would know. Taking her back in the car, men dumped her in a street about half an hour's walk from her home. Walking through the door, she caught sight of her reflection in the hall mirror. A gash in her head was oozing blood. Her father, Ron, and some extended family were in the living room about to have lunch. Still bleeding from her stab wound, she explained what had happened to her. ""My dad called the police, he immediately comforted me, but the others said I had asked for it by walking out late at night,"" Rose says. At the hospital, Rose was greeted by a male doctor and male police officer. ""They both dealt with me in an extremely matter-of-fact manner,"" she adds, ""There was no kindness, no warmth."" The male police officer asked her if this had started as consensual. Was it a night gone wild, he wondered. Rose was stunned. ""Here I was beaten beyond recognition. Stabbed and bleeding..."" Rose told them no, it had not been consensual. And still reeling from what she had been through, she said she didn't know who had attacked her. The police had no leads to go on. When Rose was released the next day, she attempted suicide, unable to imagine how she could possibly live a normal life now. Her brother found her in time. A few months later, Rose was browsing MySpace when she found several people from her school sharing a link. She was tagged. Clicking on it, Rose was directed to the pornography-sharing site, Pornhub. She felt a wave of nausea as she saw several videos of the attack on her. ""The titles of the videos were 'teen crying and getting slapped around', 'teen getting destroyed', 'passed out teen'. One had over 400,000 views,"" Rose recounts. ""The worst videos were the ones where I was passed out. Seeing myself being attacked where I wasn't even conscious was the worst."" She made an instant decision to not tell her family about the videos - most of them had not been supportive anyway. Telling them would achieve nothing. Within days it was evident that most of her peers at school had seen the videos. ""I was bullied,"" she says, ""People would say that I asked for it. That I led men on. That I was a slut."" Some boys said their parents had told them to stay away from her, in case she seduced them and then accused them of rape. ""People have an easier time blaming the victim,"" she says. Rose says she emailed Pornhub several times over a period of six months in 2009 to ask for the videos to be taken down. ""I sent Pornhub begging emails. I pleaded with them. I wrote, 'Please, I'm a minor, this was assault, please take it down.'"" She received no reply and the videos remained live. ""The year that followed I withdrew into myself. I disassociated,"" she recalls, ""I felt nothing. Numb. I kept to myself."" She would wonder, with every stranger who made eye contact with her, if they had seen the videos. ""Had they got off to it? Had they gratified themselves to my rape?"" She couldn't bear to look at herself. That's why she covered the mirrors with blankets. She would brush her teeth and wash in the dark, thinking all the time about who could be watching the videos. Then she had an idea. She set up a new email address posing as a lawyer, and sent Pornhub an email threatening legal action. ""Within 48 hours the videos disappeared."" Months later Rose began to receive counselling, finally revealing the identity of her attackers to the psychologist, who was duty bound to report them to the police. But she didn't tell her family or the police about the videos. The police collected victim impact statements from Rose and her family. The attackers' lawyers argued that Rose had consented to sex, and the men were charged not with rape but ""contributions towards the delinquency of a minor"" - a misdemeanour - and received a suspended sentence. Rose and her family did not have the energy, or the resources, to fight for a tougher sentence. It's clear that Ron Kalemba thinks a lot about what happened to his daughter all those years ago. What could he have done differently, if he'd known more, he wonders. His daughter changed after the assault. She went from being a straight-A student to missing classes, rarely handing in her homework. We're sitting in a park near his home that Ron visits often. He and Rose sometimes read from passages of the Bible from a picnic bench together. They don't talk much about the past. ""It feels like the whole world let her down,"" he says. ""Her abuse, it was like it was a big joke to everyone. It changed her life completely, and people let her down every step of the way."" Ron Kalemba: Rose had a ""digital crowd of bullies"" Ron only heard about the Pornhub videos in 2019, when a blog that Rose shared about her abuse went viral on social media. He had no idea that his daughter's rape had been seen by so many people, nor that people in her school had mocked her for it. ""I knew a girl in eighth grade when I was in school,"" Ron recalls. ""People would pick on her, and she would get beaten up. And none of us would say anything, we just watched it happen."" ""I ran into her years later and she thought that I was a bully too, because I had just stood by and watched it happen. In reality it had only been a couple of people who actually hurt her but she thought we were all against her because we watched it and said nothing. That's what the silence felt like to her."" Is this what he thinks happened to Rose? ""Yes but it was worse for her. She had a digital crowd of bullies too. Some silent and some abusive. Hers is a different world."" Rose Kalemba on her father's knee Over the next few years Rose would often disappear into the digital world. She threw herself into writing, expressing herself on blogs and social media, sometimes using aliases, sometimes her real name. One day in 2019, as she was scrolling through her social media feed she saw a number of posts about Pornhub. People were praising it for donating to bee conservation charities, adding caption facilities for deaf viewers, donating to aid domestic violence charities and providing $25,000 scholarships for women who want to enter the tech industry. According to Pornhub, there were 42 billion visits to its website in 2019 - an increase of 8.5 billion from the year before, with a daily average of around 115 million. And 1,200 searches per second. ""It's impossible to miss Pornhub if you use social media,"" says Rose. ""They've done a great job at positioning themselves as a 'woke' mission, almost transcending porn, but videos titled like mine are still on the site. There's no way of knowing if there are rapes on there and the victims don't know it."" In the viral blog post, Rose shared a detailed account of her rape, and called out Pornhub for turning a blind eye until she pretended to be a lawyer. Dozens of women and some men responded to her post, saying that videos showing them being sexually abused had also appeared on the site. In a statement to the BBC, Pornhub said: ""These horrific allegations date back to 2009, several years prior to Pornhub being acquired by its current owners, so we do not have information on how it was handled at that time. Since the change in ownership, Pornhub has continuously put in place the industry's most stringent safeguards and policies when it comes to combating unauthorised and illegal content, as part of our commitment to combating child sex abuse material. The company employs Vobile, a state-of-the-art third party fingerprinting software, which scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorised material and makes sure the original video doesn't go back up on the platform."" When asked why videos with titles similar to those uploaded featuring Rose's rape, such as ""teen abused while sleeping"", ""drunk teen abuse sleeping"" and ""extreme teen abuse"" are still active on Pornhub, the company said: ""We allow all forms of sexual expression that follow our Terms of Use, and while some people may find these fantasies inappropriate, they do appeal to many people around the world and are protected by various freedom of speech laws."" Pornhub introduced a ""non-consensual content removal system"" in 2015, but stories about videos of abuse on the website continue to surface. In October last year a 30-year-old Florida man, Christopher Johnson, faced charges for sexually abusing a 15-year-old. Videos of the attack had been posted on Pornhub. In a statement to the BBC regarding this case, Pornhub said its policy is to ""remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case"". In 2019 Pornhub also removed a channel called Girls Do Porn, when 22 women sued it for forcing them to take part in videos, and the channel's owners were charged with sex trafficking. ""People may say that what happened to me a decade ago isn't a reality of today, but that is simply not the case,"" says Rose. ""Women have told me that it is still happening, after they saw my blog. And these are Western women with access to social media. ""I don't doubt that videos in other parts of the world, in places we know porn is consumed in large bulks like the Middle East and Asia are places where the victim might not even be aware that their abuse is being shared."" The BBC also spoke to one woman who emailed Rose. A video showing her being abused remained for years on a smaller site, even though she sent several emails to the company, and left a post in the comments section under the video. The woman, from California, says that the video has also been downloaded and shared on other porn sites. Lawyers for the website told the BBC that their clients had ""no knowledge of any such situation"". The BBC then provided a link to the video, as well as screenshots of comments by the woman requesting for it to be removed. It was finally removed in the following days. ""What happened to Rose in 2009 is still happening today on several free streaming porn sites - and not just Pornhub,"" says Kate Isaacs from Not Your Porn, a group that investigates porn sites. ""There's nothing we can do about rogue, smaller porn sites set up by individuals but large commercial sites like Pornhub need to be held accountable and they are not right now. No laws apply to them."" So-called revenge pornography, which is a type of image-based sexual abuse, has been a criminal offence in England and Wales since 2015. The law defines it as ""the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person, without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress"". It is punishable by up to two years' imprisonment. However platforms that share this content have not been held accountable so far. ""Porn sites are aware that there is disturbing and non-consensual content on their platforms,"" says Isaacs. ""They know that there is no way we can differentiate fantasy role-play acting, or faked production scenarios, or real abuse."" She set up Not Your Porn when a sex video featuring a friend of hers (who was under 16 at the time) was uploaded on to Pornhub. Kate says more than 50 women in the UK have come to her in the past six months to say that sexual videos have been posted without their consent on pornography sites. Thirty of them were uploaded to Pornhub. She also points out that Pornhub and other websites enable viewers to download videos on to their own computer - so even if the video is taken down from one website it's easy for any of these users to share it or upload it again to another. Not Your Porn are campaigning for laws in that UK that would make the sharing of non-consensual pornographic videos a criminal offence. Rose has hope for the future. In her early 20s she met her boyfriend, Robert, who she says has helped her discuss and come to terms with her abuse. She hopes they'll get married and have a daughter. And her dog Bella, a pitbull is a source of strength. ""I've grown up around pitbulls. They may have a reputation of being aggressive but they're so sweet,"" she says. ""They're aggressive only if abused by humans,"" she adds pointedly. ""In many ways, I have a life sentence,"" Rose say. ""Even now I could be at the grocery store and I wonder if a stranger has seen my video."" But she no longer wants to be silent, she says. ""The most powerful weapon of a rapist is our silence."" This video can not be played  Purnima Shil was gang-raped in northern Bangladesh at the age of 13 and she has not been allowed to forget it. Twelve years later, because of the stigma that attaches to rape victims in some parts of the country, someone shamed her by creating a pornographic Facebook page in her name - with her photograph and telephone number. #NotYourPorn LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Work is under way ""by a range of government officials"" to look at the idea of building a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge, No 10 has said. Boris Johnson has described the bridge as a ""very interesting idea"", while Ireland's premier Leo Varadkar has said it was ""worth examining"". But Nicola Sturgeon said there were ""more important priorities"". Two routes have previously been floated - from Portpatrick to Larne or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. The Portpatrick route would be more than 20 miles across the Irish Sea. Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge 'worth examining' The prime minister's spokesperson said: ""The prime minister has said it would have some merit - as a result you would expect government to be looking into it. ""Work is under way by a range of government officials."" However shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard accused Mr Johnson of being ""a master of distraction,"" adding: ""every moment spent talking about a bridge no one wants, is airtime not spent focusing on the crises right in front of us"". Scotland's First Minister Ms Sturgeon said her mind was not closed to the idea but added ""if he [the prime minister] has got Â£20bn to build such a bridge going spare at the moment - that could be spent on more important priorities"". A spokesperson for the UK Chamber of Shipping said the bridge would simply ""replicate"" ferry services already operating between Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK,"" they added. Critics think it's mad. And it certainly won't be easy. The cost could be more than Â£20bn and the Irish Sea isn't the most hospitable terrain for a major infrastructure project - Beaufort's Dyke is littered with munitions dumped afterWorld War II.,external Leading architects - however - have said it would be possible. And Boris Johnson is taking it seriously - having made it clear he is keen on the idea. Officials are looking at feasibility at the moment and reporting directly to Number 10. I'm told we should find out later this year if there's any prospect of this moving forward. If engineering challenges can be overcome - then cost will be important too. But it's worth remembering Boris Johnson's track record on ambitious bridge projects is a troubled one. As London Mayor - he backed a Garden Bridge over the Thames. It was cancelled by Sadiq Khan because of the financial risk - but still cost around Â£53m. Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, to Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, is one potential route for a bridge The price of any construction would, obviously, be dependent on the route chosen. More than a decade ago the think tank the Centre for Cross Border Studiessuggested a 21-mile bridge from Dumfries and Galloway could provide international rail links and ease the strain on air services.,external At that time it estimated the cost of the scheme would be about Â£3.5bn. However, by last year the suggested price tag had risen considerably. Some experts have suggested Â£15bn might be required for the project but others have said that  Â£20bn would be a ""conservative estimate"".

"This video can not be played What is Solar Orbiter and what's it going to do? Europe's audacious Solar Orbiter probe has lifted off on its quest to study the Sun from close quarters. The â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) mission is packed with cameras and sensors that should reveal remarkable new insights on the workings of our star. Scientists want to better understand what drives its dynamic behaviour. The spacecraft launched aboard an Atlas rocket, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 04:03 GMT (23:03 local time Sunday). The Sun will occasionally eject billions of tonnes of matter and entangled magnetic fields that can disrupt activity at Earth. The worst of these storms will trip the electronics on satellites, interfere with radio communications and even knock over power grids. Researchers hope the knowledge gained from Solar Orbiter (SolO) will improve the models used to forecast the worst of the outbursts. Sun's surface seen in remarkable new detail Solar Orbiter ready to take on audacious mission Joint mission blasts skyward to Mercury This video can not be played The Sun's surface as viewed by the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope on Hawaii The probe is a flagship venture of the European Space Agency (Esa), but with the participation of its US counterpart, Nasa. And it's the Americans who've taken on the responsibility for launching SolO. SolO will be put on a path that takes it periodically to within 43 million km (27 million miles) of the Sun's surface. That's closer in than the planet Mercury where the temperatures are searing. To survive, the probe will have to work from behind a large titanium shield. BBC Radio 4's In our time: What is the solar wind and how does it affect us? Pictures will be snapped through peepholes that must be closed after a data-gathering session to prevent internal components from melting. ""We've had to develop lots of new technologies in order to make sure that the spacecraft can survive temperatures of up to 600C,"" said Dr Michelle Sprake, a systems engineer with European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. ""One of the coatings that makes sure the spacecraft doesn't get too hot is actually made out of baked animal bones,"" she told BBC News. Solar Orbiter rode to space on a United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket SolO has six imagers and four in-situ instruments. The latter will sample the excited gas (plasma) and magnetic fields as they race away from our star and flow over the spacecraft. ""Solar Orbiter is all about the connection between what happens on the Sun and what happens in space,"" explained Prof Tim Horbury from Imperial College London. ""We need to go close to the Sun to look at a source region, then measure the particles and fields that come out from it. It's this combination, plus the unique orbit, that makes Solar Orbiter so powerful in studying how the Sun works and affects the Solar System."" This video can not be played Prof Lucie Green: ""You get explosions and eruptions in the atmosphere of our star"" That unique orbit will lift SolO out of the plane of the planets to look down on the Sun's poles. ""We don't yet have a detailed understanding of why the Sun has an 11-year cycle over which activity rises and falls,"" said Prof Lucie Green from University College London. ""There are missing observations that prevent us from knowing which of our theories are correct, and those missing observations are the ones we've never made of the poles."" What the researchers will see, they cannot say for sure. But the expectation is that SolO will detect signals of when the Sun's activity is about to change. ""We believe we will see indications of the next cycle early on in the polar regions,"" speculated Esa project scientist Dr Daniel MÃ¼ller. ""These are small concentrations of magnetic field."" SolO took eight years to build and test This decade is expected to be a golden one for advances in solar physics. SolO's launch follows hot on the heels ofthe Americans' Parker probe, which shares many of the same scientific goals and even some of the same kinds of instruments. And here on Earth, an astounding new 4m telescope has just opened on Hawaii. Called the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), this facility can resolve details on the Sun's surface that are a mere 30km across. Its ""first light"" images released last monthshowed boiling cells of plasma in spectacular detail. ""SolO sits in this family of missions studying the inner Solar System. I regard it as a kind of orchestra. Every instrument plays a different tune but together they play the symphony of the Sun,"" said Prof GÃ¼nther Hasinger, Esa's director of science.

"Like a lot of people her age, Callie Lewis loved animals and posting videos she'd made of herself on YouTube and Tumblr. But Callie, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at a young age, struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts. ""Callie was passionate about animal rights, she would always say that she much preferred animals to people,"" recalls her mum, Sarah Lewis. She was just 24 when she took her own life. This video can not be played Callie's grandfather, a Vicar, wrote her a heartfelt letter after her suicide Now, anew Panorama documentarytells Callie's story, looking at the role suicide forums played in her death and challenging the NHS over, what they have acknowledged as, failings in Callie's care. It wasn't until just over a month before her death that Callie started chatting with strangers in online suicide forums. These are corners of the internet where people discuss suicide and in some cases, share information on how someone can end their own life. In posts on one suicide forum, Callie told other users about failed attempts to take her life. In another, she asked for help hiding her intentions from mental health professionals. After hanging out on the forum, Callie discovered a new suicide method and even bought a ""suicide kit"", which she later used to end her life. Callie's mum believes the website played a significant role in her daughter's death in August 2018. She went to stay in Windermere, Cumbria - 350 miles away from her mum - where she remained for several days before taking her life. ""Without those forums, I think my daughter would have struggled to find the information that she was looking for about how to die,"" Sarah says. Sarah, Callie's mum, wants to share her daughter's story She found out that Callie had been using them after one of her daughter's close friends, Jan - a former special needs teacher - alerted her out of concern for Callie's safety. According to Jan, Callie had become ""engrossed"" in suicide websites which were ""encouraging her how to do it"". Jan says Callie cut ties with him in the run-up to her death. ""She felt that if she communicated with me she wouldn't be able to do it, but if she cut me off and communicated with them they would make sure she did it."" ""When we found out about the suicide website she'd been on, that set off an alarm bell - it began to feel like an obsession,"" says Callie's granddad, Graham Lewis. After stopping communication with family and friends before her death, the last people Callie spoke to were the forum users. Instead of trying to get her help, they encouraged her to take her own life. ""Good luck. We all wish you a swift travel,"" wrote one. ""May you find peace, my friend,"" said another. ""In the UK, we show the Samaritans' 24-hour helpline number to connect people who are depressed, suicidal or in distress with the help and advice they need as quickly as possible,"" say Google's guidelines, which were sent to Newsbeat.

The government says that ""more needs to be done to tackle the promotion of self-harm and the targeting of vulnerable people online"" and adds that it is ""developing world-leading laws to put a new duty of care on online companies towards their users"".

There is always another way."" But the support Callie needed was hard to come by. Despite her mum's efforts to get help from the NHS a series of errors meant she became lost in the system. The last time Sarah saw Callie, was at a train station. Desperately worried about her daughter, Sarah had called the police. When there was no mental health bed available for Callie that night, she spent the night with officers in a police car. Callie had a mental health assessment the next morning but denied having any immediate intention of wanting to kill herself. She'd already asked forum users for advice on convincing NHS staff she was OK before the assessment. Callie asked forum users for advice on how to fool medical professionals She also told mental health professionals that she didn't want her mum to be given any information about her treatment as she was over 18. Callie's care was then taken over by her local Community Mental Health Team, who called Callie three times and got no response. Rules say when this happens, someone must visit the person at home - but this didn't happen. The person assigned to be Callie's case worker then went off sick. No one was appointed to take over Callie's case. It took 13 days before Kent and Medway NHS Trust realised Callie had gone missing and in that time, she had killed herself. ""I kept her safe all her life and then the moment I asked for help she stops being safe and that's just very hard for me to come to terms with, I feel I made the wrong decision,"" says Sarah. ""It's the thought of her just wondering around by herself lost and, nobody able to help her. ""That really upsets me. I just needed to know that somebody somewhere was caring for her and nobody was and I wasn't able to."" Kent and Medway NHS Trust told Panorama it was ""deeply saddened by Callie's tragic death"". ""We failed to provide Callie with the standard of care that she and her family should have expected and we apologise unreservedly for this,"" it said in a statement.

An inquest into Callie's death concluded that there had been a number of individual and organisational failures in her care amounting to gross failure.

"Cancer patients in England are missing out on basic information about their diseases because of staff shortages in the NHS, a charity has warned. Macmillan Cancer Support said at least 120,000 patients a year felt topics including treatments and side effects were not fully explained. The charity blamed ""soaring"" staffing pressures, which left people ""in the dark"" about how to prepare. The NHS said satisfaction levels with cancer care were at a record high. What not to say to someone with cancer As part of an NHS survey, more than 70,000 people who have undergone cancer treatment in England were asked about their care. More than a third (39%) said the longer-term side-effects of treatment were not fully explained - the charity said that equated to about 120,000 a year. A quarter of people also said they did not have the possible side effects explained prior to the start of treatment. And one in five said there were not always enough nurses on duty to care for them. Macmillan warned that without this information and support, patients ""may feel uncertain about treatment, feel forced to give up a job or feel unsure about how to prepare for the impact cancer might have on them physically, financially and emotional"". An NHS England spokesman said cancer survival rates and patient satisfaction levels with their cancer care were at record highs. The ""vast majority of patients were given the name of a clinical nurse specialist to support them through their treatment, which is testament to the hard work and compassion of NHS staff"", he added.

"Like a lot of people her age, Callie Lewis loved animals and posting videos she'd made of herself on YouTube and Tumblr. But Callie, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at a young age, struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts. ""Callie was passionate about animal rights, she would always say that she much preferred animals to people,"" recalls her mum, Sarah Lewis. She was just 24 when she took her own life. This video can not be played Callie's grandfather, a Vicar, wrote her a heartfelt letter after her suicide Now, anew Panorama documentarytells Callie's story, looking at the role suicide forums played in her death and challenging the NHS over, what they have acknowledged as, failings in Callie's care. It wasn't until just over a month before her death that Callie started chatting with strangers in online suicide forums. These are corners of the internet where people discuss suicide and in some cases, share information on how someone can end their own life. In posts on one suicide forum, Callie told other users about failed attempts to take her life. In another, she asked for help hiding her intentions from mental health professionals. After hanging out on the forum, Callie discovered a new suicide method and even bought a ""suicide kit"", which she later used to end her life. Callie's mum believes the website played a significant role in her daughter's death in August 2018. She went to stay in Windermere, Cumbria - 350 miles away from her mum - where she remained for several days before taking her life. ""Without those forums, I think my daughter would have struggled to find the information that she was looking for about how to die,"" Sarah says. Sarah, Callie's mum, wants to share her daughter's story She found out that Callie had been using them after one of her daughter's close friends, Jan - a former special needs teacher - alerted her out of concern for Callie's safety. According to Jan, Callie had become ""engrossed"" in suicide websites which were ""encouraging her how to do it"". Jan says Callie cut ties with him in the run-up to her death. ""She felt that if she communicated with me she wouldn't be able to do it, but if she cut me off and communicated with them they would make sure she did it."" ""When we found out about the suicide website she'd been on, that set off an alarm bell - it began to feel like an obsession,"" says Callie's granddad, Graham Lewis. After stopping communication with family and friends before her death, the last people Callie spoke to were the forum users. Instead of trying to get her help, they encouraged her to take her own life. ""Good luck. We all wish you a swift travel,"" wrote one. ""May you find peace, my friend,"" said another. ""In the UK, we show the Samaritans' 24-hour helpline number to connect people who are depressed, suicidal or in distress with the help and advice they need as quickly as possible,"" say Google's guidelines, which were sent to Newsbeat. ""We remove pages from our index in limited circumstances, including when required by law.

"About 200 British and foreign nationals were repatriated from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, on Sunday The number of people infected by the coronavirus in the UK has doubled to eight - after four more patients tested positive for the virus. It comes as the government issued new powers in England to keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. In order to do this the Department of Health has described the coronavirus as a ""serious and imminent threat"" to public health. The overall risk level to the UK remains ""moderate"". There have been more than 40,000 cases of the virus globally, mostly in China. The total number of deaths in China is now 908. Coronavirus kills 97 in deadliest day so far A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus: Your travel rights explained Your questions answered The new cases are all linked to a British man who caught the virus at a conference in Singapore and travelled to a ski resort in France. He was diagnosed in Brighton, and is being treated at St Thomas' Hospital in London. He is also linked tothe fourth UK patient, who was exposed to the virus in France, whilefive British nationals tested positive in Francefollowing his trip to the ski resort. Chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said the new cases have been transferred to specialist NHS centres at Guys' and St Thomas' and the Royal Free hospitals in London. A University of York student and their relative, still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle, have not been connected to the cluster of UK cases. This looks a lot like a ""super-spreading"" event. It is likely another British national diagnosed in Majorca is also connected to the Brighton man. This is not unusual in outbreaks. We know that people pass this novel coronavirus on to an average of two-to-three people, but some will pass it on to nobody and others will pass it on to far more. In Mers-coronavirus,a super-spreading event led to 82 people being infected,external. History has demonised the super-spreader. Irish cook Mary Mallon (1869-1938) is remembered as ""Typhoid Mary"" after unknowingly passing on the disease when she had no symptoms. She spent decades in exile and forced quarantine. But in reality it's not the patient's fault. Having no symptoms, making unusually large amounts of virus or mixing with lots of people can all lead to super-spreading. The British man visited Singapore on business from 20 to 23 January, before staying at a chalet in the Alpine resort area of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc. He flew back to the UK from Geneva on 28 January, easyJet confirmed. Four adults and a nine-year-old child were subsequently diagnosed with the virus after coming into contact with him. They are not in a serious condition. The group were staying at this chalet in the French Alpine ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie EasyJet said in a statement on Monday that health officials are trying to trace other passengers on flight EZS8481 to London Gatwick who might be at risk. On his return to the UK, the Brighton man visited The Grenadier pub in Hove. On Monday, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced new regulations in England as ""the transmission of coronavirus would constitute a serious threat"". Under the Department of Health measures people will not be free to leave quarantine, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. Arrowe Park Hospital, on the Wirral, and Kents Hill Park conference centre, in Milton Keynes, have been designated as ""isolation"" facilities in the UK. Passengers on Sunday's flight from Wuhan were taken to Kents Hill Park conference centre, in Milton Keynes Evacuees from Wuhan who travelled to the UK on two flights chartered by the Foreign Office arecurrently in quarantine at the locations.

Tackling the coronavirus threat has taken the government into uncharted territory. Quarantining hundreds of British citizens for two weeks has never been done on this scale in modern times. Whitehall sources say the latest Department of Health announcement on the virus threat covers the tightening of some regulations to help enforce quarantine powers. This gives legal underpinning to the quarantining of people back from Wuhan in Milton Keynes and the Wirral. They all signed contracts committing to the 14-day isolation but it's understood that more rigorous regulations are needed to ensure people stay the course. This is not a ramping up in official warnings to the wider public. The language used in the official release describing an ""imminent threat"" was over dramatic and confusing and probably there only for obscure legal reasons. The actual threat level announced by Public Health England a couple of weeks ago remains moderate. The majority of cases are in China, where 40,171 people are infected. The new virus was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. The city of 11 million has been in lockdown for weeks. The outbreak was declared a global emergency by the WHO on 30 January. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus It is estimated that 1% of people infected with the new coronavirus may die, according to a report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling. Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said the estimate suggests the impact of the epidemic ""may be comparable to the major influenza pandemics of the 20th Century"". Meanwhile, there are now 130 confirmed cases of coronavirus on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in the port of Yokohama. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath, isadvised to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild,external. People who suspect they have the virus are asked to take steps to avoid close contact with other people as much as possible, as they would do with other flu viruses.

The new virus was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. The city of 11 million has been in lockdown for weeks. The outbreak was declared a global emergency by the WHO on 30 January. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus It is estimated that 1% of people infected with the new coronavirus may die, according to a report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling. Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said the estimate suggests the impact of the epidemic ""may be comparable to the major influenza pandemics of the 20th Century"". Meanwhile, there are now 130 confirmed cases of coronavirus on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in the port of Yokohama. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath, isadvised to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild,external. People who suspect they have the virus are asked to take steps to avoid close contact with other people as much as possible, as they would do with other flu viruses.

"This video can not be played Ireland's elections: Five myths explained Fianna FÃ¡il has won the most seats in the Irish general election just one ahead of Sinn FÃ©in, who recorded a historic result. Sinn FÃ©in's haul of 37 seats is an increase of 14 on the 2016 election. Fine Gael, whose party leader Leo Varadkar led the outgoing government as taoiseach (Irish prime minister), finished with 35 seats, down 15 from four years ago. The tight numbers could lead to lengthy negotiations to form a government. The election results were confirmed shortly after midnight when two Fianna FÃ¡il candidates, Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth, won the last two seats in Cavan-Monaghan. The final results showed that: Sinn FÃ©in had won 37 seats, an increase of 14 on the 2016 election Fianna FÃ¡il had lost six seats since 2016 but became the largest party by one seat Fine Gael lost 15 seats from 2016 The Green Party recorded their best ever election result, winning 12 seats - an improvement of 10 from 2016 The outcome was described as""something of a revolution in the ballot box""by Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald. With all first preferences counted, the left-wing republican party has taken 24.5% of the vote, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il had ruled out forging a coalition with left-wing republican party Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday, taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar conceded it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, who topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency, said Sinn FÃ©in wanted to be in government and was working to establish if the numbers were there to deliver it without Fianna FÃ¡il or Fine Gael. On Monday evening, she said she had not heard from the leaders of those two parties and has instead been speaking to Labour, the Green Party and other smaller parties that make up the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). ""People want different politics, new politics and better government - a new government - and I believe Sinn FÃ©in will be the core of that,"" she told reporters in Dublin. ""I may well be the next taoiseach,"" she added. As it happened: Irish election results and analysis day two Who is Mary Lou McDonald? Profile of Ireland's political parties Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mrs McDonald also said she believed constitutional change was coming. ""The point has been conceded in the Good Friday agreement by the British state - the presence here is solely on the basis of consent,"" she said. ""That consent can only be tested in a unity referendum and we are going to have a unity referendum - and I want us to do it in an orderly, thoughtful democratic and absolutely peaceful manner."" Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, said the party would have ""asks in terms of the republican project"", in line with itsrepeated calls for the next government to prepare for Irish unity. Left-leaning Sinn FÃ©in managed to successfully tap into the public anger felt in the Republic of Ireland over issues that have dogged centre-right Fine Gael for a number of years - a shortage of housing, rocketing rents and homelessness, analysts suggest. That is despite the fact the country is forecast to have one of the fastest growing economies in the EU in 2020. They were dubbed ""the problems of success"" by former Finance Minister Michael Noonan as far back as 2015. This video can not be played ""This is a seismic election shift"" - Michelle O'Neill Brexit - a considerable focus of Leo Varadkar and his deputy Simon Coveney while in power - barely registered as an issue in the campaign. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, whose party is in a power-sharing government with Sinn FÃ©in in Northern Ireland, said younger voters had backed Sinn FÃ©in as a ""protest vote"". ""From a Northern Ireland perspective we will have to work with whoever the government is in the Republic of Ireland,"" Mrs Foster told BBC News NI. She also said Sinn FÃ©in may have their focus on Northern Ireland questioned, in the way there had been a ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" over her party's confidence-and-supply agreement with the previous Conservative government in the UK. Sinn FÃ©in's best-ever result is the success story of this election. However, with how the overall votes have fallen, we know that Sinn FÃ©in will not necessarily end up in government despite its swathe of victories. The magic number for winning a majority government in the Republic of Ireland is 80 seats. None of the three big parties - Fine Gael, Fianna FÃ¡il and now Sinn FÃ©in - will come close to that figure. Attempts to form a new coalition-of-sorts will formally get under way, although this will be complex. Previous administrations in the Republic of Ireland have been forged this way too, but it's taken a while to get there. In 2016, it took70 days for a government to be formedafter the parties agreed a confidence-and-supply agreement, which saw a Fine Gael-only cabinet, propped up by Fianna FÃ¡il votes on key policy areas. Read more of Jayne's analysis here. Sinn FÃ©in's vote has increased dramatically - winning 37 seats out of the 42 seats it stood candidates in and topping the poll in 30 constituencies. Followingthe last election in 2016 Sinn FÃ©in had 23 seatsin the DÃ¡il. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and since 2016, a confidence-and-supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first preference votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was clear there was now a ""three-party system"". On Sunday MicheÃ¡l Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days and that he respected the will of the people. The Green Party has increased the number of seats it holds, jumping from two seats in the last election to 10. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). AontÃº (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. Who will be the next Irish prime minister?

"Ballot boxes are opened at the RDS in Dublin at the start of the Irish general election count on Sunday Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald has described the Irish general election as ""something of a revolution in the ballot box"". Counting is continuing and the first results have come in, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the most first preference votes. With all first preferences counted, it has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 20.9% for Fine Gael. No one party will win enough seats for an outright majority. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il ruled out forming a government with Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday evening taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Follow live updates Profile of Ireland's political parties Polling in the election closed at 22:00 local time on Saturday. Ballot boxes from across the 39 constituencies were opened at 09:00 on Sunday. Many counts have finished for the night and will resume at 10:00 on Monday, but some are continuing. Sinn FÃ©in ran 42 candidates across the 39 multi-seat constituencies, about half that of both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, which will have a knock-on effect on the number of seats it can secure in the 160-seat DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) where 80 seats are needed for a majority. From left: MicheÃ¡l Martin (Fianna FÃ¡il), Leo Varadkar (Fine Gael) and Mary Lou McDonald (Sinn FÃ©in) Once the final number of seats for each party is known, leaders will try to form a coalition government in order to avoid another general election. Before the election both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il said they would not enter coalition with Sinn FÃ©in. Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was exploring options to see if it would be possible to form a government without either Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said his party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn FÃ©in ""in large part because of their policies in relation to crime, tax and the way the economy and society should be run and also our deep concerns about their democratic structures. ""We don't believe a coalition between Sinn FÃ©in and Fine Gael is a viable option,"" he said. He said a ""forced marriage would not result in a good government."" Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. He said reports suggested that his party ""would be the largest"". He added that he was a ""democrat"" and respected the vote of the people. Sinn FÃ©in's Donnchadh Ã Laoghaire celebrates being the first TD elected Followingthe last election in 2016 Sinn FÃ©in had 23 seatsin the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). There are 160 seats up for election this time around, and Sinn FÃ©in is set to dramatically increase how many it holds after it won the most first preference votes. Ms McDonald said this election was about ""change"". She topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency. ""The frustration people have felt for a long time with the two-party system, whereby Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il handed the baton of power between each other - that's now over,"" she said. ""We now have a very substantial mandate."" She said she was exploring options to see to see if it was possible to form a government without Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il. This video can not be played 'Excluding Sinn FÃ©in would be wrong' By Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Sunday evening is seeing a cascade of results from across the country. Many early victories have gone to Sinn FÃ©in - with no part of the country looking untouched by the party's surge. While the general picture is becoming clear - the final numbers will be determined by the process of numerical preferences trickling down through the various stages of the counts. Sinn FÃ©in surpluses will be very much in play here - as the party was only running one candidate in many constituencies, the destination of the transfers from the successful runners is set to have an impact on what other parties take the seats. The latest seat projection by University College Dublin, for RTÃ, puts Fianna Fail as the largest party on 45 seats - with Sinn FÃ©in on 37 and Fine Gael on 36. Plenty of counting is still to come. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and with a confidence and supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first precence votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. Party leader Leo Varadkar reiterated that he did not want to enter into government with Sinn FÃ©in and said Ms McDonald had not been in contact with him. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was now clear there was now a ""three-party system"". This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: 'My position on Sinn FÃ©in hasn't changed' Fianna FÃ¡il has been in government for more years than anyone else since Ireland became independent, but it has not been the ruling party since 2011. Earlier on Sunday MicheÃ¡l Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days. He said there was a lot of ""volatility"", adding people who could not get elected in the local elections had been successful in this one. He said the most important thing when forming a government was ""compatibility in the programme for government"" and that formation of a government was going to be very difficult. Mr Martin added he was a ""democrat"" and respected the will of the people. Despite previously saying he would not govern with Sinn FÃ©in he has now not ruled that out. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MichÃ©al Martin and family at the St Anthony's boys' school polling station in Ballinlough, County Cork The Green Party is also set to increase the number of seats it holds. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected on the first count for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. Ruth Coppinger from the left wing alliance Solidarity-People Before Profit lost her seat. Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said it had not been a good day for his party as it had been squeezed by Sinn FÃ©in. The party's former leader Joan Burton lost her seat in Dublin West. She was first elected to the DÃ¡il in 1992. The Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said it was ""historic,"" saying there had been a ""seismic shift"". She said she knew there was a wind in the Sinn FÃ©in sail. Eamon Ryan was in an upbeat mood about his party's prospects The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). AontÃº (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. Anexit poll,external- commissioned jointly by Irish national broadcasters RTÃ and TG4, as well as The Irish Times and University College Dublin suggested a move toward Sinn FÃ©in among younger voters, with the party receiving the largest number of first preference votes among 18-24 years olds (31.8%). The majority of voters over the age of 65 appear to have given their first preference to Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Voting papers are organised at the counting centre at the RDS in Dublin on Sunday Ireland's elections are carried out under the proportional representation (PR) voting system, using the single transferable vote (STV). Voters wrote ""1"" opposite their first choice candidate, ""2"" opposite their second choice, ""3"" opposite their third choice and so on. This means that the picture presented when the first preference votes are counted does not completely reflect the final outcome. Newly elected TDs will gather on 20 February . The ceann comhairle, or speaker, is automatically re-elected. In most situations, the speaker does not vote, so a government will need 80 TDs to hold a majority.

"Cancer patients in England are missing out on basic information about their diseases because of staff shortages in the NHS, a charity has warned. Macmillan Cancer Support said at least 120,000 patients a year felt topics including treatments and side effects were not fully explained. The charity blamed ""soaring"" staffing pressures, which left people ""in the dark"" about how to prepare. The NHS said satisfaction levels with cancer care were at a record high. What not to say to someone with cancer As part of an NHS survey, more than 70,000 people who have undergone cancer treatment in England were asked about their care. More than a third (39%) said the longer-term side-effects of treatment were not fully explained - the charity said that equated to about 120,000 a year. A quarter of people also said they did not have the possible side effects explained prior to the start of treatment. And one in five said there were not always enough nurses on duty to care for them. Macmillan warned that without this information and support, patients ""may feel uncertain about treatment, feel forced to give up a job or feel unsure about how to prepare for the impact cancer might have on them physically, financially and emotional"". An NHS England spokesman said cancer survival rates and patient satisfaction levels with their cancer care were at record highs. The ""vast majority of patients were given the name of a clinical nurse specialist to support them through their treatment, which is testament to the hard work and compassion of NHS staff"", he added.

"This video can not be played What is Solar Orbiter and what's it going to do? Europe's audacious Solar Orbiter probe has lifted off on its quest to study the Sun from close quarters. The â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) mission is packed with cameras and sensors that should reveal remarkable new insights on the workings of our star. Scientists want to better understand what drives its dynamic behaviour. The spacecraft launched aboard an Atlas rocket, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 04:03 GMT (23:03 local time Sunday). The Sun will occasionally eject billions of tonnes of matter and entangled magnetic fields that can disrupt activity at Earth. The worst of these storms will trip the electronics on satellites, interfere with radio communications and even knock over power grids. Researchers hope the knowledge gained from Solar Orbiter (SolO) will improve the models used to forecast the worst of the outbursts. Sun's surface seen in remarkable new detail Solar Orbiter ready to take on audacious mission Joint mission blasts skyward to Mercury This video can not be played The Sun's surface as viewed by the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope on Hawaii The probe is a flagship venture of the European Space Agency (Esa), but with the participation of its US counterpart, Nasa. And it's the Americans who've taken on the responsibility for launching SolO. SolO will be put on a path that takes it periodically to within 43 million km (27 million miles) of the Sun's surface. That's closer in than the planet Mercury where the temperatures are searing. To survive, the probe will have to work from behind a large titanium shield. BBC Radio 4's In our time: What is the solar wind and how does it affect us? Pictures will be snapped through peepholes that must be closed after a data-gathering session to prevent internal components from melting. ""We've had to develop lots of new technologies in order to make sure that the spacecraft can survive temperatures of up to 600C,"" said Dr Michelle Sprake, a systems engineer with European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. ""One of the coatings that makes sure the spacecraft doesn't get too hot is actually made out of baked animal bones,"" she told BBC News. Solar Orbiter rode to space on a United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket SolO has six imagers and four in-situ instruments. The latter will sample the excited gas (plasma) and magnetic fields as they race away from our star and flow over the spacecraft. ""Solar Orbiter is all about the connection between what happens on the Sun and what happens in space,"" explained Prof Tim Horbury from Imperial College London. ""We need to go close to the Sun to look at a source region, then measure the particles and fields that come out from it. It's this combination, plus the unique orbit, that makes Solar Orbiter so powerful in studying how the Sun works and affects the Solar System."" This video can not be played Prof Lucie Green: ""You get explosions and eruptions in the atmosphere of our star"" That unique orbit will lift SolO out of the plane of the planets to look down on the Sun's poles. ""We don't yet have a detailed understanding of why the Sun has an 11-year cycle over which activity rises and falls,"" said Prof Lucie Green from University College London. ""There are missing observations that prevent us from knowing which of our theories are correct, and those missing observations are the ones we've never made of the poles."" What the researchers will see, they cannot say for sure. But the expectation is that SolO will detect signals of when the Sun's activity is about to change. ""We believe we will see indications of the next cycle early on in the polar regions,"" speculated Esa project scientist Dr Daniel MÃ¼ller. ""These are small concentrations of magnetic field."" SolO took eight years to build and test This decade is expected to be a golden one for advances in solar physics. SolO's launch follows hot on the heels ofthe Americans' Parker probe, which shares many of the same scientific goals and even some of the same kinds of instruments. And here on Earth, an astounding new 4m telescope has just opened on Hawaii. Called the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), this facility can resolve details on the Sun's surface that are a mere 30km across. Its ""first light"" images released last monthshowed boiling cells of plasma in spectacular detail. ""SolO sits in this family of missions studying the inner Solar System. I regard it as a kind of orchestra. Every instrument plays a different tune but together they play the symphony of the Sun,"" said Prof GÃ¼nther Hasinger, Esa's director of science.

"The 2007 set was typically glitzy, but the Oscars doesn't attract as many viewers as it used to Martin Scorsese's film The Irishman was snubbed at the Oscars on Sunday night, walking away empty-handed despite landing 10 nominations. But the veteran director showed he still had a sense of humour when the length of his film - three-and-a-half hours - was the butt of one of Chris Rock's opening jokes. ""Marty, I got to tell you, I loved the first season of The Irishman,"" Rock told Scorsese, who was seated in the audience, drawing laughs from the man himself and everyone else in the auditorium. Not to be outdone, the Oscars ceremony itself equalled Scorsese's mob drama with the same running time. It also failed to hit its target though,with the US live TV audience falling to an all-time low.of 23.6 million. This follows a trend offalling ratings for award ceremonies,externalas more people prefer to discover the highlights online rather than sit through the whole thing. In contrast, whenTitanic swept the board,externalat the Oscars back in 1998,the ceremony was watched by a record 57 million viewers,external. James Cameron declared himself ""king of the world"" when his film Titanic won 11 Oscars Last year's ceremony was minus a host for the first time, resulting in an11% ratings bumpto 29.6 million viewers. Despite this success,some commentators are now calling for the return of a presenter to steer the ship.,external But that's not the only issue with the televised ceremony. Matthew Belloni, the Hollywood Reporter's editorial director, thinks it needs a fresh approach. ""I believe the Oscars telecast would be improved if there was exclusive movie content that viewers had to tune in to see,"" he tells BBC News. ""For instance, the Hollywood studios could all agree to air an exclusive trailer no one has seen during the telecast. Who wouldn't want to watch for a first look at Top Gun 2 or Fast & Furious 9?"" Belloni went further on the Media Masters podcast in 2018,external, saying: ""The fact that the Oscars are so boring is a colossal failure on the Academy's part. Julia Roberts and Russell Crowe won acting Oscars for Erin Brockovich and Gladiator in 2001 ""First of all there are 24 categories, most of which the average person does not care about. And they are presented with the exact same fanfare and exact same time allotted to each one of them. ""It's after midnight on the [US] east coast by the time they get to best picture, and they're running through it to get it done because they're already late. It is crazy."" He also thinks the Academy ""has been nominating films that fewer people are seeing"" in recent years. ""You don't see as many of the Titanic or Gladiator-style movies that win best picture any more. It's smaller films, films with niche audiences."" That means, he says, that ""there's less of an incentive for viewers to tune in, because they don't feel like they have a horse in the race"". Editor Thelma Schoonmaker thinks the ceremony ""could be shorter"" Three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker,whose working life is spent deciding how to best present film footage, also had some ideas for the ceremony. ""Frankly I don't watch it unless one of our people is nominated,"" she told BBC News. But the veteran editor-who edited The Irishman (how long was it originally?!) - suggests the ceremony ""could be shorter probably [with] shorter speeches"". ""There's so many thank yous that everybody does - to their agent, their this, their that. That, I think, is not as meaningful to most of the audience as it is obviously to the people they're thanking. ""Maybe the speeches could be more about the work - you know, the art of it."" Oscar winner Mark Bridges won a jet ski for the brevity of his speech in 2018 In 2018, host Jimmy Kimmel was so keen to cut down the speeches he gave a jet ski to the winner who spoke for the least amount of time. ""I have a stopwatch,"" he told that year's nominees. ""Why waste precious time thanking your mom when you could be taking her for the ride of her life on a brand new jet ski?"" Phantom Thread costume designer Mark Bridges ended up with the $18,000 (Â£13,800) vehicle,which he donated to charity. Schoonmaker noted that when she attended the recentAmerican Cinema Editors awards,external, the speeches were top notch. ""I was very impressed. They were very moving speeches. There was hardly any of the endless, endless list of thanking. The speeches were short and it was a very good ceremony."" Perhaps film editors have a thing or two to teach the rest of the movie industry when it comes to speaking succinctly. Jimmy Kimmel wanted to keep the 2018 ceremony short Another suggestion came fromThe Big Picture podcast,external, which suggested the Academy should count down to the winning film by actually revealing the votes each best film nominee got. Hosts Sean Fennessy and Amanda Dobbins, who'd seen the idea on Twitter, said this would make the ceremony ""much more fun"", adding that a ranking should be revealed ""every 15 or 20 minutes until you get to the final film - you have the elimination chamber of Oscars"".

Of course, the Oscars are not the only TV show facing declining audiences. Traditional TV as a whole is struggling to reach younger viewers. ""The hottest shows on TV networks - which command the highest ad prices - are attracting older viewers, which is a challenge for brands that want to reach millennials and teens,""said the New York Times in 2018,external. ""As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook."" So what can be done to stem the exodus of award show viewers? This year's Brit Awards areslimming down the number of winners from 12 to nine, compared with the Oscars' 24 categories. The Brits are also promising ""more music"", with artists given full creative control of their performances. Celeste, the BBC's Sound Of 2020, is performing at the Brits as their Rising Star winner The Baftas already edit their film awards ceremony down to a two-hour BBC broadcast. Even with new host Graham Norton, this year's event attracted an average  of 3.03m viewers, down from 2019's 3.5m - which in turn was500,000 fewer than 2018,external. 10 things we learned at the Baftas ceremony Oscar watchers may recall that organisers tried to update the ceremony last year. They wanted to include apopular films category, havefewer songs performed,externaland to give awards including cinematography and editing during ad breaks. Spike Lee criticised a proposal to hand out Oscars during ad breaks But afterobjections from heavyweights including Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, the ad break decisionwas reversed. The overall format remained the same - minus a host, afterKevin Hart resignedamid controversy over old homophobic tweets. Oscars TV review 2019: No host? No problem Oscars TV review 2020: A clumsy attempt to address a lack of diversity Ricky Gervais returned to host this year's Golden Globes So was former host Johnny Carson rightwhen he famously called the Oscars,external""two hours of sparkling entertainment, spread out over a four-hour show""? BBC News asked a group of students from theLos Angeles Film School,externalwhat they thought. As potential academy voters, and maybe even future winners, they were able to offer a youthful perspective - and their views were decidedly mixed. While most of them enjoyed the ceremony, they felt it was ""too long"", ""hasn't changed in years"" and ""doesn't captivate younger audiences"". Attendees at the Governors Ball can enjoy a chocolate Oscar after the ceremony None of them said it should be hostless. The ditching of the popular film category split opinion. Some said it would simply reward ""the movie that made the most money"" and was ""useless"" because ""the awards must be about quality"". But others liked the idea, feeling it ""might attract the attention of younger viewers"" who are currently being courted by many parts of the media. Captivating winners' speeches, such as Olivia Colman's last year, make for memorable moments, and some students love it when film-makers speak about their work or politics. Allow YouTube content?

""Movies are meant to move people, and the people making them have powerful voices and should speak for what they believe,"" said one. But others believe ""overlong thank yous are the worst"", with one student stating: ""I don't care about Hollywood's opinion on politics."" There also was no consensus about consigning categories like editing to the ad breaks. One student argued these awards represented ""where the real skill is"", but another replied: ""It should be reported afterwards."" Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's Oscars duet went viral last year Best song performances were a big hit with the students. After all, who could forgetlast year's steamy performance of Shallowby Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper? One remarked they ""loved"" the songs as ""they make the show feel more modern"", while another advocated reducing them all to a ""medley"". BBC News has also contacted Oscars organisers to see if they have any further plans for the ceremony. According to Matt Wolf from the International New York Times, Oscars organisers will ""incur outrage almost no matter what they do with the ceremony"". ""Even if five new pre-conditions were met, five more would emerge,"" said Wolf, who describes himself as a ""self-confessed Oscars nerd"". He also thinks the organisers should televise all the categories, but said of the technical nominees: ""Mr and Mrs Middle America have no idea what they do."" He complained that ""all four acting winners are guessable this year in advance, which takes the suspense out of it. ""It's not the Oscars' fault, but RenÃ©e Zellweger, Joaquin Phoenix, Brad Pitt and Laura Dern seem dead certs so the awards seem a bore."" His prediction turned out to be correct. Security is always tight inside the Dolby Theatre Yet Wolf is sympathetic to the ceremony's organisers. ""The Oscars have become a very pliable punching bag; people can use it to vent their frustrations from all quarters. If they do A people want B; if they do Q people want Z."" The Oscars, he goes on, need to reflect all aspects of the ceremony. ""You want the garish dress on the red carpet as much as you want someone stunning and stellar. We need the package, warts and all. ""People love to complain about the Oscars, it's sort of a cultural sport, but the imperfections are what make them so glorious."" 17 quirky facts about this year's Oscars Erivo 'bittersweet' as lone black actor nominee Oscars 2020: International film hopefuls Oscars 2020: The winners in full Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"The short gap between the Baftas and the Oscars this year has barely left Joaquin Phoenix enough time to washhis multi-use tux.,external The Joker star is just one Hollywood actor currently hot-footing it from London to Los Angeles in time for the Academy Awards on Sunday. This year's ceremony is being held earlier than usual in an attempt to combat falling ratings. The slew of other awards ceremonies over several months was thought to be damaging interest in the Oscars, which mark the conclusion of awards season. Oscar-ologists have been closely studying the nominations list for trends, patterns, quirks and clues about who might win what. 1. Scarlett Johansson has joined a rather exclusive club. She is only the 12th person to receive two acting nominations in the same year. Johansson is nominated for both best actress and best supporting actress for her performances in Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit respectively. Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story (left) and Jojo Rabbit The other 11 people who've been nominated twice in acting categories at the same Oscars ceremony include Sigourney Weaver (in 1989), Al Pacino (1993), Emma Thompson (1994), Jamie Foxx (2005) and, most recently, Cate Blanchett (2008). But none has ever won in both their categories. 2. It's been 15 years since the winner of best actress and best picture were in sync. Very rarely does the winner of best actress also star in the winner of best picture - the last one who did was Hilary Swank in 2004's Million Dollar Baby. That's unlikely to change this year. RenÃ©e Zellweger is the favourite to win best actress for Judy, which isn't evennominatedfor best picture. 3. Cynthia Erivo could end up with a massive EGOT. In fact, if the Harriet star wins an Oscar to go with her Emmy, Grammy and Tony awardsshe'll become the youngest EGOT winner,externalin history. The 33-year-old would take over fromthe current record holder Robert Lopez,external, who completed the quad in 2018 at the age of 39. Erivo has two chances to do this on Oscars night - because she's nominated for both best actress and best original song (she co-wrote Harriet's anthemic original song Stand Up.) 4. If Sam Mendes wins best director, it'll be the biggest gap between two directing wins in Oscars history. The newly-knighted Sir Sam first won in 2000 for American Beauty, but could triumph again at the 2020 ceremony with his hugely successful World War One epic 1917. Before now, Billy Wilder recorded the biggest gap, winning his two best director trophies 15 years apart for The Lost Weekend (1945) and The Apartment (1960). 5. There's a competing couple in the best picture category. Directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, who began dating in 2011 and have a child together, are up against each other for the top prize. Gerwig's nomination for Little Women and Baumbach's for Marriage Story make them the first director-couple to go head-to-head for best picture. Laura Dern (right), stars in Greta Gerwig's Little Women and Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story This almost happened in 2009, when James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow both had films nominated - but they had divorced some 18 years earlier. Gerwig and Baumbach are nominated in slightly different categories for writing (best adapted screenplay and original screenplay respectively), so at least that slightly eases the tension over the dishwasher. Coincidentally, both their films star Laura Dern, who is nominated for best supporting actress. 6. Having said that, Little Women and Marriage Story are both long shots for the top prize. That's partly because it's unusual for a film to win best picture without a nomination for best director, which neither Gerwig nor Baumbach have. It's not impossible, however. Last year, Green Book triumphed without a director nod for Peter Farrelly. Prior to that, 2013's Argo was the last to win without a nomination for its director Ben Affleck. 7. Toy Story 4 could better the Oscars record it set with Toy Story 3. The prize for best animated feature was introduced in 2001, and since then only one sequel - Toy Story 3 - has won. So a victory for Toy Story 4 would make it not just the second sequel to win best animated feature, but the second to win within its own film series. 8. Parasite has already broken a record and it could break another if it wins. It's the first Korean film to receive a best picture nomination, and only the sixth film to be nominated for both best picture and international feature film. That list of previous double nominees includes last year's Roma, 2012's Amour and 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. 9. Jonathan Pryce brings a dose of reality to best actor. The Two Popes star is the only nominee in the category who plays a real-life figure - Pope Francis. The others, Leonardo DiCaprio, Antonio Banderas, Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix, all portray fictional characters. (Admittedly, Pedro AlmodÃ³varwove some of his own experiences,externalinto the film director character played by Banderas in Pain & Glory.) There's more reality in the best actress category - RenÃ©e Zellweger plays Judy Garland, Cynthia Erivo portrays anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman and Charlize Theron plays Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. 10. Magazines are fertile ground for film ideas. Two of this year's awards season hopefuls were based on single magazine articles. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood was inspired bya 1998 feature in Esquire magazine,externalby journalist Tom Junod, who wrote a profile interview with the children's entertainer Fred Rogers. Hustlers, meanwhile, was based ona 2015 investigation in New York magazine,externalby Jessica Pressler. Despite both films being nominated across awards season, including at the Golden Globes, sadly only Beautiful Day registered on the Academy's radar. Jennifer Lopez will have to rely on a future film to score her first Oscar nomination. Jennifer Lopez (who stars in Hustlers) and Tom Hanks (in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) 11. The average age of the supporting actor nominees is 71. That's considerably older this year than the average age of all previous winners in this category -which is 49,external. This time around, Brad Pitt is the youngest at 56, nominated alongside Tom Hanks (63), Joe Pesci (76), Al Pacino (79) and Sir Anthony Hopkins (82). Having been around a while, it's perhaps unsurprising that all five of these greedy guts already have an Oscar - Pitt's came as a producer on 12 Years A Slave while the others won for acting. 12. Birdman could act as a benchmark for 1917. Oscar pundits keep a close eye on best film editing every year, because there's a strong correlation between being nominated in this category and ultimately winning best picture. It's notable, therefore, that 1917's momentum for the top prize comes despite the lack of an editing nomination. Only one film since 1980 has won best picture without a best film editing nod, which was 2014's Birdman. Interestingly, Birdman and 1917 already share something in common - both films appear to have beenshot in one continuous take. Neither actually were, which, ironically, shows how skilful the editing must have been. 1917 won two Golden Globes for best drama film and best director for Sam Mendes 13. Ford v Ferrari is the first motor racing film to get a best picture nomination. This might not sound particularly interesting, but there's a surprisingly large number of racing films which have missed out in the past - such as Rush, Grand Prix and Days of Thunder. Senna wouldn't have been eligible for best picture as it would have been in for best documentary, but it wasn't even nominated for that. Ford v Ferrari (which is titled Le Mans '66 in some countries) is nominated but is highly unlikely to win. ""It faces tough competition,""acknowledged Christopher Smith of Motor1,,external""but beating tough competition is what the movie is all about."" 14. Netflix have doubled their chances of winning best picture this year. The streaming service pinned all its hopes (and money) on Roma in 2019, campaigning hard for the best picture win which eventually went to Green Book. They fielded far more films for awards season this year, such as The King, Dolemite Is My Name, The Two Popes and The Laundromat (a film about which the less said the better). Dolemite Is My Name, starring Eddie Murphy, was one of Netflix's big hopes this year However, two of their films in particular, The Irishman and Marriage Story, are nominated for the top prize. It may well be that the Academy is still not ready to allow a streaming service to win best picture. But if any Netflix title can win them over, you'd think it'd be a Martin Scorsese gangster film starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. 15. Neither of the two favourites for best picture have nominations in the acting categories. This may be down to Parasite being perceived as a film with an ensemble cast, where no performance is easily singled out for a leading actor category. The absence of 1917 in the acting categories is perhaps more surprising as George MacKay appears in the entire film. 16. Songwriter Dianne Warren's nod in best original song (for I'm Standing With You from the film Breakthrough) is her 11th Oscar nomination. Her others include LeAnn Rimes's How Do I Live (from Con Air), Aerosmith's I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (from Armageddon) and Faith Hill's There You'll Be (from Pearl Harbor). But,as we said last year, she has still never actually won. In fact, she is now themost Oscar-nominated woman without a win,externalin history, which keeps the heat off Glenn Close a little longer. Sir Elton John's nomination in this category comes 25 years after he won it for Can You Feel The Love Tonight? from The Lion King. RenÃ©e Zellweger's portrayal of Judy Garland (pictured right) could win her best actress 17. Judy Garland never won an Oscar. But she was supposed to. She was widely expected to win for 1954's A Star is Born, and even had cameras set up around her hospital bed (she had just given birth) to capture her speech. Grace Kelly won instead for The Country Girl - one of the biggest upsets in Oscars history. The cameramen rapidly dismounted the equipment around Garland and left. So if RenÃ©e Zellweger does win best actress, at least that will indirectly mark some form of (late) Academy recognition for Garland, more than five decades after she died.

"Cancer patients in England are missing out on basic information about their diseases because of staff shortages in the NHS, a charity has warned. Macmillan Cancer Support said at least 120,000 patients a year felt topics including treatments and side effects were not fully explained. The charity blamed ""soaring"" staffing pressures, which left people ""in the dark"" about how to prepare. The NHS said satisfaction levels with cancer care were at a record high. What not to say to someone with cancer As part of an NHS survey, more than 70,000 people who have undergone cancer treatment in England were asked about their care. More than a third (39%) said the longer-term side-effects of treatment were not fully explained - the charity said that equated to about 120,000 a year. A quarter of people also said they did not have the possible side effects explained prior to the start of treatment. And one in five said there were not always enough nurses on duty to care for them. Macmillan warned that without this information and support, patients ""may feel uncertain about treatment, feel forced to give up a job or feel unsure about how to prepare for the impact cancer might have on them physically, financially and emotional"". An NHS England spokesman said cancer survival rates and patient satisfaction levels with their cancer care were at record highs. The ""vast majority of patients were given the name of a clinical nurse specialist to support them through their treatment, which is testament to the hard work and compassion of NHS staff"", he added.

"Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) should not be used to prevent someone from reporting sexual harassment in the workplace, according to new guidance. Arbitration service Acas has published advice for firms and workers about NDAs, including how to avoid misuse. Several high-profile scandals have exposed how NDAs are often used to silence mainly women alleging sexual harassment and misconduct. Acas said misusing these agreements can be ""very damaging"" to an organisation. NDAs are contracts or parts of contracts that typically prevent staff and ex-staff making information public. They can apply to commercially sensitive details such as inventions and ideas, or anything likely to damage an organisation's reputation, and are sometimes known as ""gagging orders"" or ""hush agreements"". Acas chief executive Susan Clews, said: ""The news has reported on victims coming forward that have alleged appalling abuse by high-profile figures who have then tried to use NDAs to silence whistleblowers. ""NDAs can be used legitimately in some situations but they should not be used routinely or to prevent someone from reporting sexual harassment, discrimination or whistleblowing at work."" She told the BBC that there had been an increase in the use of confidentiality clauses to ""cover up wrongdoing"" and ""stop people talking about sexual harassment"". ""That's really not great for employees,"" she said, adding that it stops businesses from tackling ""the underlying issue"". NDAs: New laws to crack down on 'gagging' clauses What are non-disclosure agreements? 'Why I broke my non-disclosure agreement' It emerged that NDAs were used by ex-movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and his company to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. He was fired by The Weinstein Company before it eventually went bust. Harvey Weinstein and his film business used NDAs to settle claims of sexual misconduct As part of the bankruptcy filing, the company said it released anyone ""who suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein"" from their NDAs. Mr Weinstein denies that he ever engaged in ""nonconsensual sex"". Acas said its new advice states that NDAs cannot be used to stop someone from: reporting discrimination or sexual harassment at work or to the police; whistleblowing; or disclosing a future act of discrimination or harassment. It also states that employees should be given a reasonable length of time to consider signing a non-disclosure agreement including allowing them to consult a trade union or lawyer. Additionally, Acas advises that NDAs should ""never"" be used routinely, stating they ""should not be used to hide a problem or brush it under the carpet"". Ms Clews said: ""Our new advice can help employers and their staff understand what NDAs are, how to prevent their misuse and examples where they will not be needed.""
